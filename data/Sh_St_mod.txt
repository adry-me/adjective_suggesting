description of a struggle and people in their sunday best stroll about  swaying over the gravel under this enormous sky which  from hills in the distance  stretches to distant hills i at about midnight a few people rose  bowed  shook hands  said it had been a pleasant evening  and then passed through the wide doorway into the vestibule  to put on their coats
the hostess stood in the middle of the room and made graceful bowing movements  causing the dainty folds in her skirt to move up and down
i sat at a tiny table    it had three curved  thin legs    sipping my third glass of benedictine  and while i drank i surveyed my little store of pastry which i myself had picked out and arranged in a pile
then i saw my new acquaintance  somewhat dishevelled and out of shape  appear at the doorpost of an adjoining room  but i tried to look away for it was no concern of mine
he  however  came toward me and  smiling absent mindedly at my occupation  said   excuse me for disturbing you  but until this very moment i've been sitting alone with my girl in the room next door
ever since half past ten
lord  what an evening  i know it isn't right for me to be telling you this  for we hardly know one another
we only met on the stairs this evening and exchanged a few words as guests of the same house
and now    but you must forgive me  please    my happiness just cannot be contained  i can't help it
and since i have no other acquaintance here whom i can trust     i looked at him sadly    the piece of fruitcake which i had in my mouth did not taste particularly good    and said into his rather flushed face   i'm glad of course that you consider me trustworthy  but displeased that you have confided in me
and you yourself  if you weren't in such a state  would know how improper it is to talk about an amorous girl to a man sitting alone drinking schnapps   when i said this  he sat down with a jolt  leaned back in his chair  and let his arms hang down then he pressed them back  his elbows pointed  and began talking in rather a loud voice   only a little while ago we were alone in that room  annie and i
and i kissed her  i kissed her    her mouth  her ears  her shoulders
oh  my lord and savior   a few guests  suspecting ours to be a rather more animated conversation  approached us closer  yawning
whereupon i stood up and said so that all could hear   all right then  if you insist  i'll go with you  but i repeat  it's ridiculous to climb up the laurenziberg now  in winter and in the middle of the night
besides  it's freezing  and as it has been snowing the roads out there are like skating rinks
well  as you like     at first he gazed at me in astonishment and parted his wet lips  but then  noticing the guests who had approached quite close  he laughed  stood up  and said   i think the cold will do us good  our clothes are full of heat and smoke  what's more  i'm slightly tipsy without having drunk very much  yes  let's say goodbye and go   so we went to the hostess  and as he kissed her hand she said   i am glad to see you looking so happy today   touched by the kindness of these words  he kissed her hand again  whereupon she smiled
i had to drag him away
in the vestibule stood a housemaid  whom we hadn't seen before
she helped us into our coats and then took a small lantern to light us down the stairs
her neck was bare save for a black velvet ribbon around her throat  her loosely clothed body was stooped and kept stretching as she went down the stairs before us  holding the lantern low her cheeks were flushed  for she had drunk some wine  and in the weak lamplight which filled the whole stairwell  i could see her lips trembling
at the foot of the stairs she put down the lantern  took a step toward my acquaintance  embraced him  kissed him  and remained in the embrace
only when i pressed a coin into her hand did she drowsily detach her arms from him  slowly open the front door  and let us out into the night over the deserted  evenly lit street stood a large moon in a slightly clouded  and therefore unusually extended  sky
on the frozen snow one had to take short steps
hardly were we outside when i evidently began to feel very gay
i raised my legs  let my joints crack  i shouted a name down the street as though a friend of mine had just vanished around the corner  leaping  i threw my hat in the air and caught it boastfully
my acquaintance  however  walked on beside me  unconcerned
he held his head bent
he didn't even speak
this surprised me  for i had calculated that he  once i had got him away from the party  would give vent to his joy
now i too could calm down
no sooner had i given him an encouraging slap on the back than i suddenly no longer understood his mood  and withdrew my hand
since i had no use for it  i stuck it in the pocket of my coat
so we walked on in silence
listening to the sound of our steps  i couldn't understand why i was incapable of keeping step with my acquaintance    especially since the air was clear and i could see his legs quite plainly
here and there someone leaned out of a window and watched us
on turning into the ferdinandstrasse i realized that my acquaintance had begun to hum a melody from the dollar princess
it was low  but i could hear it distinctly
what did this mean  was he trying to insult me  as for me  i was ready to do without not only this music  but the walk as well
why wasn't he speaking to me  anyway  and if he didn't need me  why hadn't he left me in peace in the warm room with the benedictine and the pastry  it certainly wasn't i who had insisted on this walk
besides  i could have gone for a walk on my own
i had merely been at a party  had saved an ungrateful young man from disgrace  and was now wandering about in the moonlight
that was all right  too
all day in the office  evenings at a party  at night in the streets  and nothing to excess
a way of life so natural that it borders on the excessive  yet my acquaintance was still behind me
indeed  he even quickened his steps when he realized that he had fallen in the rear
no word was uttered  nor could it be said that we were running
but i wondered if it wouldn't be a good idea to turn down a side street  after all  i wasn't obliged to go on this walk with him
i could go home alone and no one could stop me
then  secretly  i could watch my acquaintance pass the entrance to my street
goodbye  dear acquaintance  on reaching my room i'll feel warm  i'll light the lamp in its iron stand on my table  and when i've done that i'll lie back in my armchair which stands on the torn oriental carpet
pleasant prospects  why not  but then  no then
the lamp will shine in the warm room  shine on my chest as i lie in the armchair
then i'll cool off and spend hours alone between the painted walls and the floor which  reflected in the gilt framed mirror hanging on the rear wall  appears slanted
my legs were growing tired and i had already decided to go home and lie down  when i began to wonder if  before going away  i ought to say good night to my acquaintance
but i was too timid to go away without a word and too weak to call to him out loud
so i stood still  leaned against the moonlit wall of a house  and waited
my acquaintance came sailing along the pavement toward me as fast as though he expected me to catch him
he winked at me  suggesting some agreement which i had apparently forgotten
 what's up   i asked
 oh  nothing   he said
 i only wanted to ask your opinion about that housemaid who kissed me on the staircase
who is the girl  have you ever seen her before  no  nor have i
was she a housemaid at all  i had meant to ask you this before  while she was walking down the stairs in front of us    i saw at once by her red hands that she's a housemaid  and not even the first housemaid  and when i gave her the money i felt her hard skin    but that merely proves that she has been some time in service  which no doubt is the case    you may be right about that
in that light one couldn't distinguish everything  but her face reminded me of the elder daughter of an officer i happen to know    not me   he said
 that won't stop me going home  it's late and i have to be in the office early
one sleeps badly there   whereupon i put out my hand to say goodbye to him
 whew  what a cold hand   he cried
 i wouldn't like to go home with a hand like that
you should have let yourself be kissed  too  my friend
that was an omission
still  you can make up for it
but sleep  on a night like this  what an idea  just think how many thoughts a blanket smothers while one lies alone in bed  and how many unhappy dreams it keeps warm    i neither smother anything nor warm anything   i said  oh  go on   he concluded   you're a humorist   at the same time he began walking again and i followed without realizing it  for i was busy thinking of what he had said
from these words i imagined that my acquaintance suspected in me something which  although it wasn't there  made me nevertheless rise in his estimation by his suspecting it
so it was just as well i hadn't gone home
who knows  this man    thinking of housemaid affairs while walking beside me  his mouth steaming with cold     might be capable of bestowing on me in the eyes of the world a value without my having to work for it
let's pray the girls won't spoil him  by all means let them kiss and hug him  that's their duty and his right  but they mustn't carry him off
after all  when they kiss him they also kiss me a little    with the corners of their mouths  so to speak
but if they carry him off  then they steal him from me
and he must always remain with me  always
who is to protect him  if not i  and he's so stupid
someone says to him in february  come up the laurenziberg    and off he goes
and supposing he falls down now  or catches cold  suppose some jealous man appears from the postgasse and attacks him  what will happen to me  am i to be just kicked out of the world  i'll believe that when i see it  no  he won't get rid of me
tomorrow he'll be talking to fräulein anna  about ordinary things at first  as is natural  but suddenly he won't be able to keep it from her any longer  last night  annie  after the party  you remember  i was with a man the like of whom you've certainly never seen
he looked    how can i describe him to you     like a stick dangling in the air  he looked  with a black haired skull on top
his body was clad in a lot of small  dull yellow patches of cloth which covered him completely because they hung closely about him in the still air of last night
well  annie  does that spoil your appetite  it does  in that case it's my fault  then i told the whole thing badly
if only you'd seen him  walking timidly beside me  reading infatuation on my face (which wasn't very difficult)  and going a long way ahead of me so as not to disturb me
i think  annie  you'd have laughed a bit and been a bit afraid  but i was glad of his company
for where were you  annie  you were in your bed  and your bed was far away    it might just as well have been in africa
but sometimes i really felt as though the starry sky rose and fell with the gasping of his flat chest
you think i'm exaggerating  no  annie
upon my soul  no
upon my soul which belongs to you  no
and i didn't spare my acquaintance    we had just reached the first steps of the franzensquai    the smallest fraction of the humiliation he must have felt at making such a speech
save that my thoughts grew blurred at this moment  for the moldau and the quarter of the town on the farther shore lay together in the dark
a number of lights burning there teased the eye
we crossed the road in order to reach the railing along the river  and there we stood still
i found a tree to lean against
because of the cold blowing up from the water  i put on my gloves  sighed for no good reason  as one is inclined to do at night beside a river  but then i wanted to walk on
my acquaintance  however  was staring into the water  and didn't budge
then he moved closer to the railing  his legs were already against the iron bar  he propped his elbows up and laid his forehead in his hands
what next  after all  i was shivering and had to put up the collar of my coat
my acquaintance stretched himself    his back  shoulders  neck    and held the upper half of his body  which rested on his taut arms  bent over the railing  oh well  memories   said i  yes  even remembering in itself is sad  yet how much more its object  don't let yourself in for things like that  it's not for you and not for me
it only weakens one's present position without strengthening the former one    nothing is more obvious    quite apart from the fact that the former one doesn't need strengthening
do you think i have no memories  oh  ten for every one of yours
now  for instance  i could remember sitting on a bench in l
it was in the evening  also near a river
in summer  of course
and on such evenings it's my habit to pull up my legs and put my arms around them i had leaned my head against the wooden back of the bench  and from there i watched the cloudlike mountains on the other shore
a violin was playing softly in the hotel by the river
now and again on both shores trains chuffed by amid shining smoke   turning suddenly around  my acquaintance interrupted me  he almost looked as though he were surprised to see me still here
 oh  i could tell you much more   i said  nothing else
 just imagine   he began   and it always happens like this
today  as i was going downstairs to take a short walk before the evening party  i couldn't help being surprised by the way my hands were dangling about in my cuffs  and they were doing it so gaily
which promptly made me think  just wait  something's going to happen today
and it did  too   he said this while turning to go and looked at me smiling out of his big eyes
so i had already got as far as that
he could tell me things like that and at the same time smile and look at me with big eyes
and i    i had to restrain myself from putting my arm around his shoulders and kissing him on the eyes as a reward for having absolutely no use for me
but the worst was that even that could no longer do any harm because it couldn't change anything  for now i had to go away  away at any price
while i was still trying urgently to think of some means by which i could stay at least a little while longer with my acquaintance  it occurred to me that perhaps my long body displeased him by making him feel too small
and this thought    although it was late at night and we had hardly met a soul    tormented me so much that while walking i bent my back until my hands reached my knees
but in order to prevent my acquaintance from noticing my intentions i changed my position only very gradually  tried to divert his attention from myself  once even turning him toward the river  pointing out to him with outstretched hands the trees on the schutzeninsel and the way the bridge lamps were reflected in the river but wheeling suddenly around  he looked at me    i hadn't quite finished yet    and said   what's this  you're all crooked  what on earth are you up to    quite right
you're very observant   said i  my head on the seam of his trousers  which was why i couldn't look up properly
 enough of that  stand up straight  what nonsense    no   i said  my face close to the ground   i'll stay as i am    you really can annoy a person  i must say
such a waste of time  come on  put an end to it    the way you shout  in the quiet of the night   i said
 oh well  just as you like   he added  and after a while   it's a quarter to one   he had evidently seen the time on the clock of the mühlenturm
i promptly stood up straight as though i'd been pulled up by the hair
for a while i kept my mouth open  to let my agitation escape
i understood  he was sending me away
there was no place for me near him  or if there were one  at least it could not be found
why  by the way  was i so intent on staying with him  no  i ought to go away    and this at once    to my relatives and friends who were waiting for me
but if i didn't have any relatives and friends then i must fend for myself (what was the good of complaining )  but i must leave here no less quickly
for in his eyes nothing could redeem me any longer  neither my length  my appetite  nor my cold hand
but if i were of the opinion that i had to remain with him  it was a dangerous opinion
 i wasn't in need of your information   i said  which happened to be true
 thank god you're standing up straight again
all i said was that it's a quarter to one    that's all right   said i  and stuck two fingernails in the gaps between my chattering teeth
 if i didn't need your information  how much less do i need an explanation
the fact is  i need nothing but your mercy
please  take back what you said just now    that it's a quarter to one  but with pleasure  especially since a quarter to one passed long ago   he lifted his right arm  flicked his hand  and listened to the castanetlike sound of his cuff links
obviously  this is the time for the murder
i'll stay with him and slowly he'll draw the dagger    the handle of which he is already holding in his pocket    along his coat  and then plunge it into me
it's unlikely that he'll be surprised at the simplicity of it all    yet maybe he will  who knows  i won't scream  i'll just stare at him as long as my eyes can stand it
 well   he said
in front of a distant coffeehouse with black windowpanes a policeman let himself glide over the pavement like a skater his sword hampering him  he took it in his hand  and now he glided along for quite a while  finally ending up by almost describing a circle
at last he yodeled weakly and  melodies in his head  began once more to skate
it wasn't until the arrival of this policeman    who  two hundred feet from an imminent murder  saw and heard only himself    that i began to feel a certain fear i realized that whether i allowed myself to be stabbed or ran away  my end had come
would it not be better  then  to run away and thus expose myself to a difficult and therefore more painful death  i could not immediately put my finger on the reasons in favor of this form of death  but i couldn't afford to spend my last remaining seconds looking for reasons
there would be time for that later provided i had the determination  and the determination i had
i had to run away  it would be quite easy
at the turning to the left onto the karlsbrücke i could jump to the right into the karlsgasse
it was winding  there were dark doorways  and taverns still open  i didn't need to despair
as we stepped from under the arch at the end of the quay onto the kreuzherrenplatz  i ran into that street with my arms raised but in front of a small door in the seminarkirche i fell  for there was a step which i had not expected
it made a little noise  the next street lamp was sufficiently far away  i lay in the dark
from a tavern opposite came a fat woman with a lantern to see what had happened in the street
the piano within continued playing  but fainter  with only one hand  because the pianist had turned toward the door which  until now ajar  had been opened wide by a man in a high buttoned coat
he spat and then hugged the woman so hard she was obliged to raise the lantern in order to protect it
 nothing's happened   he shouted into the room  whereupon they both turned  went inside  and the door was closed
when i tried to get up i fell down again
 sheer ice   i said  and felt a pain in my knee
yet i was glad that the people in the tavern hadn't seen me and that i could go on lying here peacefully until dawn
my acquaintance had apparently walked on as far as the bridge without having noticed my disappearance  for it was some time before he joined me
i saw no signs of surprise as he bent down over me    lowering little more than his neck  exactly like a hyena    and stroked me with a soft hand
he passed it up and down my cheekbone and then laid his palm on my forehead
 you've hurt yourself  eh  well  it's icy and one must be careful    didn't you tell me so yourself  does your head ache  no  oh  the knee
h'm
that's bad   but it didn't occur to him to help me up
i supported my head with my right hand  my elbow on a cobblestone  and said   here we are together again   and as my fear was beginning to return  i pressed both hands against his shinbone in order to push him away
 do go away   i said
he had his hands in his pockets and looked up the empty street  then at the seminarkirche  then up at the sky
at last  at the sound of a carriage in one of the nearby streets  he remembered me   why don't you say something  my friend  do you feel sick  why don't you get up  shall i look for a cab  if you like  i'll get you some wine from the tavern
in any case  you mustn't lie here in the cold
besides  we wanted to go up the laurenziberg    of course   said i  and got up on my own  but with great pain
i began to sway  and had to look severely at the statue of karl iv to be sure of my position
however  even this would not have helped me had i not remembered that i was loved by a girl with a black velvet ribbon around her neck  if not passionately  at least faithfully
and it really was kind of the moon to shine on me  too  and out of modesty i was about to place myself under the arch of the tower bridge when it occurred to me that the moon  of course  shone on everything
so i happily spread out my arms in order fully to enjoy the moon and by making swimming movements with my weary arms it was easy for me to advance without pain or difficulty to think that i had never tried this before  my head lay in the cool air and it was my right knee that flew best  i praised it by patting it
and i remembered that once upon a time i didn't altogether like an acquaintance  who was probably still walking below me  and the only thing that pleased me about the whole business was that my memory was good enough to remember even a thing like that
but i couldn't afford to do much thinking  for i had to go on swimming to prevent myself from sinking too low
however  to avoid being told later that anyone could swim on the pavement and that it wasn't worth mentioning  i raised myself above the railing by increasing my speed and swam in circles around the statue of every saint i encountered
at the fifth    i was holding myself just above the footpath by imperceptible flappings    my acquaintance gripped my hand
there i stood once more on the pavement and felt a pain in my knee
 i've always admired   said my acquaintance  clutching me with one hand and pointing with the other at the statue of st
ludmila   i've always admired the hands of this angel here to the left
just see how delicate they are  real angel's hands  have you ever seen anything like them  you haven't  but i have  for this evening i kissed hands      but for me there was now a third possibility of perishing
i didn't have to let myself be stabbed  i didn't have to run away  i could simply throw myself into the air
let him go up his laurenziberg  i won't interfere with him  not even by running away will i interfere with him
and now i shouted   out with your stories  i no longer want to hear scraps
tell me everything  from beginning to end
i won't listen to less  i warn you
but i'm burning to hear the whole thing   when he looked at me i stopped shouting so loud
 and you can count on my discretion  tell me everything that's on your mind
you've never had so discreet a listener as i   and rather low  close to his ear  i said   and you don't need to be afraid of me  that's quite unnecessary   i heard him laugh
 yes  yes   i said
 i believe that
i don't doubt it   and so saying i pinched him in the calves    where they were exposed
but he didn't feel it
whereupon i said to myself   why walk with this man  you don't love him  nor do you hate him  because all he cares about is a girl and it's not even certain that she wears a white dress
so to you this man is indifferent    i repeat  indifferent
but he is also harmless  as has been proved
so walk on with him up the laurenziberg  for you are already on your way  it's a beautiful night  but let him do the talking and enjoy yourself after your fashion  for this is the very best way (say it in a whisper) to protect yourself   ii diversions or proof that it's impossible to live i a ride and now    with a flourish  as though it were not the first time    i leapt onto the shoulders of my acquaintance  and by digging my fists into his back i urged him into a trot
but since he stumped forward rather reluctantly and sometimes even stopped  i kicked him in the belly several times with my boots  to make him more lively
it worked and we came fast enough into the interior of a vast but as yet unfinished landscape
the road on which i was riding was stony and rose considerably  but just this i liked and i let it become still stonier and steeper
as soon as my acquaintance stumbled i pulled him up by the collar and the moment he sighed i boxed his head
in doing so i felt how healthy this ride in the good air was for me  and in order to make him wilder i let a strong wind blow against us in long gusts
now i even began to exaggerate my jumping movements on my acquaintance's broad shoulders  and gripping his neck tight with both hands i bent my head far back and contemplated the many and various clouds which  weaker than i  sailed clumsily with the wind i laughed and trembled with courage
my coat spread out and gave me strength
i pressed my hands hard together and in doing so happened to make my acquaintance choke
only when the sky became gradually hidden by the branches of the trees  which i let grow along the road  did i come to myself
 i don't know   i cried without a sound   i really don't know
if nobody comes  then nobody comes
i have done nobody any harm  nobody has done me any harm  but nobody will help me
a pack of nobodies
but it isn't quite like that
it's just that nobody helps me  otherwise a pack of nobodies would be nice  i would rather like (what do you think ) to go on an excursion with a pack of nobodies
into the mountains  of course  where else  just look at these nobodies pushing each other  all these arms stretched across or hooked into one another  these feet separated by tiny steps  everyone in frock coats  needless to say we walk along so happily  a fine wind is whistling through the gaps made by us and our limbs in the mountains our throats become free
it's a wonder we don't break into song   then my acquaintance collapsed  and when i examined him i discovered that he was badly wounded in the knee
since he could no longer be of any use to me  i left him there on the stones without much regret and whistled down a few vultures which  obediently and with serious beaks  settled down on him in order to guard him
ii a walk i walked on  unperturbed
but since  as a pedestrian  i dreaded the effort of climbing the mountainous road  i let it become gradually flatter  let it slope down into a valley in the distance
the stones vanished at my will and the wind disappeared
i walked at a brisk pace and since i was on my way down i raised my head  stiffened my body  and crossed my arms behind my head because i love pinewoods i went through woods of this kind  and since i like gazing silently up at the stars  the stars appeared slowly in the sky  as is their wont
i saw only a few fleecy clouds which a wind  blowing just at their height  pulled through the air  to the astonishment of the pedestrian
opposite and at some distance from my road  probably separated from it by a river as well  i caused to rise an enormously high mountain whose plateau  overgrown with brushwood  bordered on the sky
i could see quite clearly the little ramifications of the highest branches and their movements
this sight  ordinary as it may be  made me so happy that i  as a small bird on a twig of those distant scrubby bushes  forgot to let the moon come up
it lay already behind the mountain  no doubt angry at the delay
but now the cool light that precedes the rising of the moon spread over the mountain and suddenly the moon itself appeared from beyond one of the restless bushes
i on the other hand had meanwhile been gazing in another direction  and when i now looked ahead of me and suddenly saw it glowing in its almost full roundness  i stood still with troubled eyes  for my precipitous road seemed to lead straight into this terrifying moon
after a while  however  i grew accustomed to it and watched with composure the difficulty it had in rising  until finally  having approached one another a considerable part of the way  i felt overcome by an intense drowsiness caused  i assumed  by the fatigue of the walk  to which i was unaccustomed
i wandered on for a while with closed eyes  keeping myself awake only by a loud and regular clapping of my hands
but then  as the road threatened to slip away from under my feet and everything  as weary as i myself  began to vanish  i summoned my remaining strength and hastened to scale the slope to the right of the road in order to reach in time the high tangled pinewood where i planned to spend the night that probably lay ahead of us
the haste was necessary
the stars were already fading and i noticed the moon sink feebly into the sky as though into troubled waters
the mountain already belonged to the darkness  the road crumbled away at the point where i had turned toward the slope  and from the interior of the forest i heard the approaching crashes of collapsing trees
now i could have thrown myself down on the moss to sleep  but since i feared to sleep on the ground i crept    the trunk sliding quickly down the rings formed by my arms and legs    up a tree which was already reeling without wind i lay down on a branch and  leaning my head against the trunk  went hastily to sleep while a squirrel of my whim sat stiff tailed at the trembling end of the branch  and rocked itself
my sleep was deep and dreamless
neither the waning moon nor the rising sun awoke me
and even when i was about to wake up  i calmed myself by saying   you made a great effort yesterday  so spare your sleep   and went to sleep again
although i did not dream  my sleep was not free from a continuous slight disturbance
all night long i heard someone talking beside me
the words themselves i could hardly hear    except isolated ones like  bench

by the river    cloudlike mountains    trains


amidst shining smoke   what i did hear was the special kind of emphasis placed on them  and i remember that even in my sleep i rubbed my hands with pleasure at not being obliged to recognize single words  since i was asleep
 your life was monotonous   i said aloud in order to convince myself   it really was necessary for you to be taken somewhere else
you ought to be content  it's gay here
the sun's shining   whereupon the sun shone and the rain clouds grew white and light and small in the blue sky
they sparkled and billowed out
i saw a river in the valley
 yes  your life was monotonous  you deserve this diversion   i continued as though compelled   but was it not also perilous   at that moment i heard someone sigh terribly near
i tried to climb down quickly  but since the branch trembled as much as my hand i fell rigid from the top
i did not fall heavily  nor did i feel any pain  but i felt so weak and unhappy that i buried my face in the ground  i could not bear the strain of seeing around me the things of the earth
i felt convinced that every movement and every thought was forced  and that one had to be on one's guard against them
yet nothing seemed more natural than to lie here on the grass  my arms beside my body  my face hidden and i tried to persuade myself that i ought to be pleased to be already in this natural position  for otherwise many painful contortions  such as steps or words  would be required to arrive at it
the river was wide and its noisy little waves reflected the light
on the other shore lay meadows which farther on merged into bushes behind which  at a great distance  one could see bright avenues of fruit trees leading to green hills
pleased by this sight  i lay down and  stopping my ears against the dread sound of sobs  i thought  here i could be content
for here it is secluded and beautiful
it won't take much courage to live here
one will have to struggle here as anywhere else  but at least one won't have to do it with graceful movements
that won't be necessary
for there are only mountains and a wide river and i have sense enough to regard them as inanimate
yes  when i totter alone up the steep path through the meadows in the evening i will be no more forsaken than the mountains  except that i will feel it
but i think that this  too  will pass
thus i toyed with my future life and tried stubbornly to forget
and all the time i blinked at that sky which was of an unusually promising color
it was a long time since i'd seen it like this  i was moved and reminded of certain days when i thought i had seen it in the same way
i took my hands from my ears  spread out my arms  and let them fall in the grass i heard someone sob softly from afar
a wind sprang up and a great mass of leaves  which i had not seen before  rose rustling into the air
unripe fruit thudded senselessly from the trees onto the ground
ugly clouds rose from behind the mountain
the waves on the river creaked and receded from the wind
i got up quickly
my heart hurt  for now it seemed impossible to escape from my suffering
i was already about to turn and leave this region and go back to my former way of life when the following idea occurred to me   how strange it is that even in our time distinguished people are transported across a river in this complicated way
there's no other explanation than that it is an old custom   i shook my head  for i was surprised
iii the fat man a an address to the landscape from the thicket on the opposite bank four naked men strode vehemently forth  carrying on their shoulders a wooden litter
on this litter sat  oriental fashion  a monstrously fat man
although carried through the thicket on an untrodden path  he did not push the thorny branches apart but simply let his motionless body thrust through them
his folds of fat were so carefully spread out that although they covered the whole litter and even hung down its side like the hem of a yellowish carpet  they did not hamper him
his hairless skull was small and gleamed yellow
his face bore the artless expression of a man who meditates and makes no effort to conceal it
from time to time he closed his eyes  on opening them again his chin became distorted
 the landscape disturbs my thought   he said in a low voice
 it makes my reflections sway like suspension bridges in a furious current
it is beautiful and for this reason wants to be looked at   i close my eyes and say  you green mountain by the river  with your rocks rolling against the water  you are beautiful
but it is not satisfied  it wants me to open my eyes to it
then i might say to it with my eyes closed   mountain  i do not love you  for you remind me of the clouds  of the sunset  of the rising sky  and these are things that almost make me cry because one can never reach them while being carried on a small litter
but when showing me this  sly mountain  you block the distant view which gladdens me  for it reveals the attainable at a glance
that's why i do not love you  mountain by the water    no  i do not love you   but the mountain would be as indifferent to this speech as to my former one so long as i did not talk with my eyes open
this is the only way to please it
and must we not keep it well disposed toward us in order to keep it up at all    this mountain which has such a capricious fondness for the pulp of our brains  it might cast on me its jagged shadow  it might silently thrust terrible bare walls in front of me and my bearers would stumble over the little pebbles on the road
but it is not only the mountain that is so vain  so obtrusive and vindictive    everything else is  too
so i must go on repeating with wide open eyes    oh  how they hurt    yes  mountain  you are beautiful and the forests on your western slope delight me
   with you  flower  i am also pleased  and your pink gladdens my soul
   you  grass of the meadows  are already high and strong and refreshing
   and you  exotic bushes  you prick so unexpectedly that our thoughts start leaping
   but with you  river  i am so delighted that i will let myself be carried through your supple water   after he had shouted this paean of praise ten times  accompanied by some humble shifting of his body  he let his head droop and said with closed eyes   but now    i implore you    mountain  flowers  grass  bush  and river  give me some room so that i may breathe   at that moment the surrounding mountains began to shift in hasty obedience  then withdrew behind a curtain of fog
although the avenues stood firm for a while and guarded the width of the road  they soon merged into one another
in the sky in front of the sun lay a humid cloud with a delicately transparent edge in whose shade the country sank deeper and deeper while everything else lost its lovely outline
the sound of the bearers' steps reached my side of the river and yet i could not distinguish any details in the dark square of their faces
i only saw them bending their heads sideways and arching their backs  for their burden was excessive
i was worried about them  for i realized that they were tired
so it was in suspense that i watched them step into the rushes  then walk through the wet sand  their strides still regular  until they finally sank into the muddy swamp where the two rear bearers bent even lower so as to keep the litter in its horizontal position
i pressed my hands together
by now they had to raise their feet high at every step until their bodies glistened with sweat in the cool air of this unsettled afternoon
the fat man sat quiet  hands on his thighs  the long pointed tips of the reeds grazed him as they flipped up in the wake of the bearers in front
the bearers' movements grew more irregular the nearer they came to the water
at times the litter swayed as though it were already on the waves
small puddles in the rushes had to be jumped over or walked around  for they might possibly be deep
at one moment wild ducks rose shrieking  mounting steeply into the rain cloud
it was then that i caught a glimpse of the fat man's face  it looked alarmed
i got up and in hectic leaps i zigzagged over the stony slope separating me from the water
i paid no heed to the danger  was concerned only with helping the fat man should his servants no longer be able to carry him
i ran so recklessly that i couldn't stop  and was forced to dash into the splashing water  coming to a halt only when the water reached my knees
meanwhile the servants  with considerable distortions of their bodies  had carried the litter into the river  and holding themselves above the unruly water with one hand  they propped up the litter with four hairy arms  their muscles standing out in relief the water lapped against their chins  then rose to their mouths  the bearers bent their heads back and the litter handles fell on their shoulders
the water was already playing around the bridges of their noses  and yet they did not give up  although they had hardly reached the middle of the river
then a low wave swept over the heads of those in front and the four men drowned in silence  their desperate hands pulling the litter down with them
water gushed after them
and now the evening sun's slanting rays broke forth from behind the rims of the great cloud and illuminated the hills and mountains as far as the eye could see  while the river and the region beneath the cloud lay in an uncertain light the fat man turned slowly in the direction of the flowing water and was carried down the river like a yellow wooden idol which had become useless and so had been cast into the river
he sailed along on the reflection of the rain cloud
elongated clouds pulled and small hunched ones pushed him  creating considerable commotion  the effect of which could even be noticed by the lapping of water against my knees and the stones on the shore
i crept quickly up the slope so as to be able to accompany the fat man on his way  for i truly loved him
and perhaps i could learn something about the dangers of this apparently safe country
so i walked along a strip of sand to the narrowness of which one had to grow accustomed  hands in my pockets and my face turned at right angles to the river so that my chin rested almost on my shoulder
swallows sat on the stones by the shore
the fat man said   dear sir on the shore  don't try to rescue me
this is the water's and the wind's revenge  now i am lost
yes  revenge it is  for how often have we attacked them  i and my friend the supplicant  amidst the singing of our swords  the flash of cymbals  the great splendor of trumpets  and the leaping blaze of drums   a tiny mosquito with stretched wings flew straight through his belly without losing its speed the fat man continued  b beginning of a conversation with the supplicant there was a time when i went to a church day after day  for a girl i was in love with used to kneel there in prayer for half an hour every evening  which enabled me to watch her at my leisure once when the girl failed to appear and in dismay i was watching the other people praying  my eye was caught by a young man who had flung his long emaciated figure on the ground
from time to time he clutched his skull with all his strength and  moaning loudly  beat it in the palms of his hands on the stone floor in the church there were only a few old women who kept turning their shawled heads sideways to glance at the praying man
this attention seemed to please him  for before each of his pious outbursts he let his eyes rove about to see how many people were watching him
finding this unseemly  i decided to accost him on his way out of the church and ask him outright why he prayed in this manner
for since my arrival in this town clarity had become more important to me than anything else  even though at this moment i felt only annoyance at my girl's failure to appear
yet an hour passed before he stood up  brushed his trousers for such a long time that i felt like shouting   enough  enough  we can all see that you have trousers on   crossed himself carefully  and with the lumbering gait of a sailor walked to the font of holy water i placed myself between the font and the door  determined not to let him pass without an explanation
i screwed up my mouth  this being the best preparation for resolute speech  and supported myself by standing on my right leg while resting the left one on its toes  for this position as i have often experienced gives me a sense of stability
now it is possible that this young man had already caught sight of me while sprinkling his face with holy water  perhaps my stare had alarmed him even earlier  for he now quite unexpectedly rushed to the door and out
i involuntarily jumped to stop him
the glass door slammed
and when i passed through it a moment later i could not find him  for the narrow streets were numerous and the traffic considerable
during the following days he failed to appear  but the girl came and again prayed in a corner of a side chapel
she wore a black dress with a transparent lace yoke    the crescent of her chemise could be seen through it    from the lower edge of which the silk hung down in a finely cut frill
and now that the girl had returned i was glad to forget about the young man  ignoring him even when he continued to appear regularly and to pray in his usual fashion
yet he always passed me by in sudden haste  his face averted
while praying  on the other hand  he kept glancing at me
it almost looked as though he were angry with me for not having accosted him earlier and was thinking that for my first attempt to talk to him i had actually taken upon me the duty to do so
one day as i was following the girl out as usual after a service  i ran into him in the semidarkness and thought i saw him smile
the duty to talk to him  needless to say  did not exist  nor had i much desire to do so anymore
and even when i hurried up to the church one evening while the clock was striking seven and found  instead of the girl who of course had left long ago  only the young man exerting himself in front of the altar railings  i still hesitated at last i tiptoed to the door  slipped a coin to the blind beggar sitting there  and squeezed in beside him behind the open wing
and there for about half an hour i looked forward to the surprise i was planning to spring upon the supplicant
but this feeling did not last
before long i was morosely watching spiders creeping over my clothes and finding it tiresome to have to bend forward every time someone came breathing loud out of the darkness of the church
but finally he came
the ringing of the great bells which had started a little while ago did not agree with him  i realized
each time before taking a step he had to touch the ground lightly with his foot
i straightened myself  took a long stride forward  and grabbed him
 good evening   said i  and with my hand on his coat collar i pushed him down the steps onto the lighted square
when we had reached ground level he turned toward me while i was still holding on to him from behind  so that we stood breast to breast
 if only you'd let go of me   he said
 i don't know what you suspect me of  but i'm innocent   then he repeated once more   of course i don't know what you suspect me of    there is no question here of suspicion or innocence
i ask you not to mention it again
we are strangers  our acquaintance is no older than the church steps are high
what would happen if we were immediately to start discussing our innocence    precisely what i think   he said
 as a matter of fact  you said 'our innocence ' do you mean to suggest that if i had proved my innocence you would have to prove yours  too  is that what you mean    that or something else   i said
 i accosted you only because i wanted to ask you something  remember that    i'd like to go home   he said  and made an effort to turn
 i quite believe it
would i have accosted you otherwise  don't get the idea that i accosted you on account of your beautiful eyes    aren't you being a little too sincere    must i repeat that there's no question of such things  what has it to do with sincerity or insincerity  i ask  you answer  and then goodbye
so far as i'm concerned you can even go home  and as fast as you like    would it not be better to meet some other time  at a more suitable hour  say in a coffeehouse  besides  your fiancée left only a few minutes ago  you can easily catch her up  she has waited so long for you    no   i shouted into the noise of the passing tram
 you won't escape me
i like you more and more
you're a lucky catch
i congratulate myself   to which he said   oh god  you have a sound heart  as they say  but a head of wood
you call me a lucky catch  how lucky you must be  for my bad luck is precariously balanced and when touched it falls onto the questioner
and so  good night    fine   said i  surprised him and seized his right hand
 if you don't answer of your own accord  i'll force you
i'll follow you wherever you go  right or left  even up the stairs to your room  and in your room i'll sit down  wherever there's space
go on then  keep staring at me  i can stand it
but how     i stepped up close and because he was a head taller i spoke into his throat     how are you going to summon up the courage to stop me   whereupon  stepping back  he kissed my hands in turn  and wetted them with his tears
 one cannot deny you anything
just as you knew i want to go home  i knew even earlier that i cannot deny you anything
all i ask is that we go over there into the side street   i nodded and we went over
when a carriage separated us and i was left behind  he beckoned to me with both hands  to make me hurry
but once there  not satisfied with the darkness of the street where the lamps were widely separated from one another and almost as high as the first floor  he led me into the low hallway of an old house and under a small lamp which hung dripping in front of the wooden stairs
spreading his handkerchief over the hollow in a worn step  he invited me to be seated   it's easier for you to ask questions sitting down
i'll remain standing  it's easier for me to answer
but don't torment me   i sat down because he took it all so seriously  but nevertheless felt i had to say   you've led me to this hole as though we are conspirators  whereas i am bound to you simply by curiosity  you to me by fear
actually  all i want to ask is why you pray like that in church
the way you carry on there  like an utter fool  how ridiculous it all is  how unpleasant for the onlookers  how intolerable for the devout   he had pressed his body against the wall  only his head moved slowly in space
 you're wrong  the devout consider my behavior natural  the others consider it devout    my annoyance proves you're mistaken    your annoyance    assuming it's real    only proves that you belong neither to the devout nor to the others    you're right
i was exaggerating when i said your behavior annoyed me  no  it aroused my curiosity as i stated correctly at first
but you  to which group do you belong    oh  i just get fun out of people watching me  out of occasionally casting a shadow on the altar  so to speak    fun   i asked  making a face
 no  if you want to know
don't be angry with me for expressing it wrongly
it's not fun  for me it's a need  a need to let myself be nailed down for a brief hour by those eyes  while the whole town around me      the things you say   i cried far too loud for the insignificant remark and the low hallway  but i was afraid of falling silent or of lowering my voice
 really  the things you say  now i realize  by god  that i guessed from the very beginning the state you are in
isn't it something like a fever  a seasickness on land  a kind of leprosy  don't you feel it's this very feverishness that is preventing you from being properly satisfied with the real names of things  and that now  in your frantic haste  you're just pelting them with any old names  you can't do it fast enough
but hardly have you run away from them when you've forgotten the names you gave them
the poplar in the fields  which you've called the 'tower of babel' because you didn't want to know it was a poplar  sways again without a name  so you have to call it 'noah in his cups '   he interrupted me   i'm glad i haven't understood a word you've been saying   irritated  i said quickly   your being glad about it proves that you have understood it    didn't i say so before  one cannot deny you anything   i put my hands on a step above me  leaned back  and in this all but unassailable position  the wrestler's last resort  i asked   excuse me  but to throw back at me an explanation which i gave you is insincere   at this he grew daring
to give his body unity he clasped his hands together and said with some reluctance   you ruled out quarrels about insincerity from the very beginning
and truly  i'm no longer concerned with anything but to give you a proper explanation for my way of praying
do you know why i pray like that   he was putting me to the test
no  i didn't know  nor did i want to know
i hadn't even wanted to come here  i said to myself  but this creature had practically forced me to listen to him
so all i had to do was to shake my head and everything would be all right  but at the moment this was just what i couldn't do
the creature opposite me smiled
then he crouched down on his knees and said with a sleepy expression   now i can also tell you at last why i let you accost me
out of curiosity  from hope
your stare has been comforting me for a long time
and i hope to learn from you how things really are  why it is that around me things sink away like fallen snow  whereas for other people even a little liqueur glass stands on the table steady as a statue   as i remained silent and only an involuntary twitching passed over my face  he asked   so you don't believe this happens to other people  you really don't  just listen  then
when as a child i opened my eyes after a brief afternoon nap  still not quite sure i was alive  i heard my mother up on the balcony asking in a natural tone of voice  'what are you doing  my dear  goodness  isn't it hot ' from the garden a woman answered  'me  i'm having my tea on the lawn ' they spoke casually and not very distinctly  as though this woman had expected the question  my mother the answer   feeling that this required an answer  i put my hand in the hip pocket of my trousers as though i were looking for something
actually  i wasn't looking for anything  i just wished to change my appearance in order to show interest in the conversation
finally i said i thought this a most remarkable incident and that i couldn't make head or tail of it
i also added that i didn't believe it was true and that it must have been invented for a special reason whose purpose wasn't clear to me just now
then i closed my eyes so as to shut out the bad light
 well  isn't that encouraging  for once you agree with me  and you accosted me to tell me that out of sheer unselfishness
i lose one hope and acquire another
 why  after all  should i feel ashamed of not walking upright and taking normal steps  of not tapping the pavement with my stick  and not touching the clothes of the people who pass noisily by  am i not rather entitled to complain bitterly at having to skip along the houses like a shadow without a clear outline  sometimes disappearing in the panes of the shopwindows   oh  what dreadful days i have to live through  why is everything so badly built that high houses collapse every now and again for no apparent reason  on these occasions i clamber over the rubble  asking everyone i meet  'how could this have happened  in our town    a new house    how many does that make today     just think of it ' and no one can give me an answer
 frequently people fall in the street and lie there dead
whereupon all the shop people open their doors laden with wares  hurry busily out  cart the dead into a house  come out again all smiles  then the chatter begins  'good morning    it's a dull day    i'm selling any amount of kerchiefs    ah yes  the war ' i rush into the house  and after raising my hand several times timidly with my finger crooked  i finally knock on the janitor's little window  'good morning ' i say  'i understand a dead man was carried in here just now
would you be kind enough to let me see him ' and when he shakes his head as though unable to make up his mind  i add  'take care  i'm a member of the secret police and insist on seeing the dead man at once ' now he is no longer undecided
'out with you ' he shouts
'this riffraff is getting in the habit of snooping about here every day
there's no dead man here
maybe next door ' i raise my hat and go
 but then  on having to cross a large square  i forget everything
if people must build such huge squares from sheer wantonness  why don't they build a balustrade across them as well  today there's a southwest wind blowing
the spire of the town hall is moving in little circles
all the windowpanes are rattling  and the lampposts are bending like bamboos
the virgin mary's cloak is coiling around her pillar and the wind is tugging at it
does no one notice this  the ladies and gentlemen who should be walking on the pavement are floating
when the wind falls they stand still  say a few words  and bow to one another  but when the wind rises again they are helpless  and all their feet leave the ground at the same time
although obliged to hold on to their hats  their eyes twinkle gaily enough and no one has the slightest fault to find with the weather
i'm the only one who's afraid   to which i was able to say   that story you told me earlier about your mother and the woman in the garden i really don't find so remarkable
not only have i heard and experienced many stories of this kind  i have even taken part in some
the whole thing is perfectly natural
do you really mean to suggest that had i been on that balcony in the summer  i could not have asked the same question and given the same answer from the garden  quite an ordinary occurrence   after i had said this  he seemed relieved at last
he told me i was well dressed and that he very much liked my tie
and what a fine complexion i had
and that confessions became most comprehensible when they were retracted
c the supplicant's story then he sat down beside me  for i had grown timid and  bending my head to one side  had made room for him
nevertheless  it didn't escape my notice that he too was sitting there rather embarrassed  trying to keep some distance from me and speaking with difficulty   oh  what dreadful days i have to live through  last night i was at a party
i was just bowing to a young lady in the gaslight and saying  'i'm so glad winter's approaching'    i was just bowing with these words when to my annoyance i noticed that my right thigh had slipped out of joint
the kneecap had also become a little loose
 so i sat down  and as i always try to keep control over my sentences  i said  'for winter's much less of an effort  it's easier to comport oneself  one doesn't have to take so much trouble with one's words
don't you agree  fräulein  i do hope i'm right about this ' my right leg was now giving me a lot of trouble
at first it seemed to have fallen apart completely  and only gradually did i manage to get it more or less back into shape by manipulation and careful rearrangement
 then i heard the girl  who  out of sympathy  had also sat down  say in a low voice  'no  you don't impress me at all because   '   'just a moment ' i said  pleased and full of expectation  'you mustn't waste so much as five minutes talking to me  dear fräulein
please eat something while you're talking  i implore you '  and stretching out my arm i took a large bunch of grapes hanging heavily from a bowl held up by a bronze winged cupid  dangled it for a moment in the air  and then laid it on a small blue plate which i handed to the girl  not without a certain elegance  i trust   'you don't impress me at all ' she said  'everything you say is boring and incomprehensible  but that alone doesn't make it true
what i really think  sir    why do you always call me dear fräulein     is that you can't be bothered with the truth simply because it's too tiring '  god  how good that made me feel  'yes  fräulein  fräulein ' i almost shouted  'how right you are  dear fräulein  if you only knew what a wild joy it is to find oneself so well understood    and without having made any effort '   'there's no doubt  sir  that for you the truth is too tiring
just look at yourself  the entire length of you is cut out of tissue paper  yellow tissue paper  like a silhouette  and when you walk one ought to hear you rustle
so one shouldn't get annoyed at your attitude or opinion  for you can't help bending to whatever draft happens to be in the room '  'i don't understand that
true  several people are standing about here in this room
they lay their arms on the backs of chairs or they lean against the piano or they raise a glass tentatively to their mouths or they walk timidly into the next room  and having knocked their right shoulders against a cupboard in the dark  they stand breathing by the open window and think  there's venus  the evening star yet here i am  among them
if there is a connection  i don't understand it
but i don't even know if there is a connection
   and you see  dear fräulein  of all these people who behave so irresolutely  so absurdly as a result of their confusion  i alone seem worthy of hearing the truth about myself
and to make this truth more palatable you put it in a mocking way so that something concrete remains  like the outer walls of a house whose interior has been gutted
the eye is hardly obstructed  by day the clouds and sky can be seen through the great window holes  and by night the stars
but the clouds are often hewn out of gray stones  and the stars form unnatural constellations
   how would it be if in return i were to tell you that one day everyone wanting to live will look like me    cut out of tissue paper  like silhouettes  as you pointed out    and when they walk they will be heard to rustle  not that they will be any different from what they are now  but that is what they will look like
even you  dear fräulein   '  then i noticed that the girl was no longer sitting beside me
she must have left soon after her last words  for now she was standing far away from me by a window  surrounded by three young men who were talking and laughing out of high white collars
 so i happily drank a glass of wine and walked over to the pianist who  all alone and nodding to himself  happened to be playing something sad i bent carefully down to his ear so as not to frighten him and whispered into the melody  'be so kind  sir  as to let me play now  for i'm just beginning to feel happy '  since he paid no attention to me  i stood there for a while embarrassed  but then  overcoming my timidity  i went from one guest to another  saying casually  'today i'm going to play the piano
yes '  everyone seemed to know i couldn't play  but they smiled in a friendly way  pleased by the welcome interruption of their conversation
they paid proper attention to me only when i said to the pianist in a very loud voice  'do me the favor  sir  of letting me play now
after all  i'm just beginning to feel happy
a triumph is at stake '  although the pianist stopped  he neither left his brown bench nor appeared to understand me
he sighed and covered his face with his long fingers
 i felt a trifle sorry for him and was about to encourage him to continue playing when the hostess approached with a group of people
  'that's a funny coincidence ' they said and laughed aloud as though i were about to do something unnatural
 the girl also joined them  looked at me contemptuously  and said  'please  madame  do let him play
perhaps he wants to make some contribution to the entertainment
he ought to be encouraged
please let him '  everyone laughed  obviously thinking  as i did  that it was meant ironically
only the pianist was silent
holding his head low  he stroked the wood of the bench with the forefinger of his left hand  as though he were making designs in sand
i began to tremble  and to hide it  thrust my hands into my trouser pockets
nor could i speak clearly any longer  for my whole face wanted to cry
thus i had to choose the words in such a way that the thought of my wanting to cry would appear ludicrous to the listeners
  'madame ' i said  'i must play now because   ' as i had forgotten the reason i abruptly sat down at the piano
and then i remembered again
the pianist stood up and stepped tactfully over the bench  for i was blocking his way
'please turn out the light  i can only play in the dark ' i straightened myself
 at that moment two gentlemen seized the bench and  whistling a song and rocking me to and fro  carried me far away from the piano to the dining table
 everyone watched with approval and the girl said  'you see  madame  he played quite well
i knew he would
and you were so worried '  i understood and thanked her with a bow  which i carried out well
 they poured me some lemonade and a girl with red lips held my glass while i drank
the hostess offered me a meringue on a silver salver and a girl in a pure white dress put the meringue in my mouth
another girl  voluptuous and with a mass of fair hair  held a bunch of grapes over me  and all i had to do was pluck them off with my lips while she gazed into my receding eyes
 since everyone was treating me so well i was a little surprised that they were so unanimous in holding me back when i tried to return to the piano
  'that's enough now ' said the host  whom i had not noticed before
he went out and promptly returned with an enormous top hat and a copper brown overcoat with a flowery design
'here are your things '  they weren't my things  of course  but i didn't want to put him to the trouble of looking again
the host helped me into the overcoat which fitted beautifully  clinging tightly to my thin body
bending over slowly  a lady with a kind face buttoned the coat all the way down
  'goodbye ' said the hostess  'and come back soon
you know you're always welcome ' whereupon everyone bowed as though they thought it necessary
i tried to do likewise  but my coat was too tight
so i took my hat and  no doubt awkwardly  walked out of the room
 but as i passed through the front door with short steps i was assaulted from the sky by moon and stars and a great vaulted expanse  and from the ringplatz by the town hall  the virgin's pillar  the church
 i walked calmly from the shadow into the moonlight  unbuttoned my overcoat  and warmed myself  then i put a stop to the humming of the night by raising my hands  and began to reflect as follows    'what is it that makes you all behave as though you were real  are you trying to make me believe i'm unreal  standing here absurdly on the green pavement  you  sky  surely it's a long time since you've been real  and as for you  ringplatz  you never have been real
 'it's true  you're all still superior to me  but only when i leave you alone
  'thank god  moon  you are no longer moon  but perhaps it's negligent of me to go on calling you so called moon  moon
why do your spirits fall when i call you  forgotten paper lantern of a strange color   and why do you almost withdraw when i call you  the virgin's pillar   as for you  pillar of the virgin mary  i hardly recognize your threatening attitude when i call you  moon shedding yellow light     'it really seems to me that thinking about you doesn't do you any good  you lose in courage and health   'god  how much more profitable it would be if the thinker could learn from the drunk    'why has everything become so quiet  i think the wind has dropped
and the small houses which often used to roll across the square as though on little wheels are rooted to the spot    calm    calm    one can't even see the thin black line that used to separate them from the ground '  and i started to run
i ran unimpeded three times around the great square  and as i didn't meet a drunk i ran on toward the karlsgasse without slowing down and without any effort
my shadow  often smaller than myself  ran beside me along the wall as though in a gorge between the wall and the street level
 as i passed the fire station i heard a noise coming from the kleiner ring  and as i turned into it i saw a drunk standing by the iron railing of the fountain  his arms held out sideways and his feet in wooden shoes stamping the ground  stopping to get my breath  i went up to him  raised my top hat  and introduced myself    'good evening  gentle nobleman  i am twenty three years of age  but as yet i have no name
but you  no doubt  hail from the great city of paris    bearing extraordinary  well nigh singable names
you are surrounded by the quite unnatural odor of the dissolute court of france
no doubt your tinted eyes have beheld those great ladies standing on the high shining terrace  ironically twisting their narrow waists while the ends of their decorated trains  spread over the steps  are still lying on the sand in the garden
   and surely  menservants in daringly cut gray tailcoats and white knee breeches climb tall poles  their legs hugging them but their torsos frequently bent back and to the side  for they have to raise enormous gray linen sheets off the ground with thick ropes and spread them in the air  because the great lady has expressed the wish for a misty morning '  when he belched i felt almost frightened
'is it really true  sir ' i said  'that you hail from our paris  from that tempestuous paris    ah  from that luxuriant hailstorm '  when he belched again  i said with embarrassment  'i know  a great honor is being bestowed upon me '  and with nimble fingers i buttoned up my overcoat  then with ardor and yet timidly i said  'i know you do not consider me worthy of an answer  but if i did not ask you today my life would be spent in weeping
i ask you  much bespangled sir  is it true what i have been told  are there people in paris who consist only of sumptuous dresses  and are there houses that are only portals  and is it true that on summer days the sky over the city is a fleeting blue embellished only by little white clouds glued onto it  all in the shape of hearts  and have they a highly popular panopticon there containing nothing but trees to which small plaques are fastened bearing the names of the most famous heroes  criminals  and lovers    'and then this other piece of news  this clearly fabricated news  these paris streets  for instance  they suddenly branch off  don't they  they're turbulent  aren't they  things are not always as they should be  how could they be  after all  sometimes there's an accident  people gather together from the side streets with that urban stride that hardly touches the pavement  they are all filled with curiosity  but also with fear of disappointment  they breathe fast and stretch out their little heads but when they touch one another they bow low and apologize   i'm awfully sorry    i didn't mean it    there's such a crowd  forgive me  i beg you    it was most clumsy of me  i admit my name is    my name's jerome faroche  i'm a grocer in the rue de cabotin    allow me to invite you to lunch tomorrow    my wife would also be delighted     'so they go on talking while the street lies numb and the smoke from the chimneys falls between the houses
that's how it is
butit might happen that two carriages stop on a crowded boulevard of a distinguished neighborhood
seriouslooking menservants open the doors
eight elegant siberian wolfhounds come prancing out and jump barking across the boulevard
and it's said that they are young parisian dandies in disguise '  his eyes were almost shut
when i fell silent  he stuck both hands in his mouth and tore at his lower jaw
his clothes were covered with dirt
perhaps he had been thrown out of some tavern and hadn't yet realized it
 perhaps it was that short quiet lull between night and day when our heads loll back unexpectedly  when everything stands still without our knowing it  since we are not looking at it  and then disappears  we remain alone  our bodies bent  then look around but no longer see anything  nor even feel any resistance in the air yet inwardly we cling to the memory that at a certain distance from us stand houses with roofs and with fortunately angular chimneys down which the darkness flows through garrets into various rooms and it is fortunate that tomorrow will be a day on which  unlikely as it may seem  one will be able to see everything
 now the drunk jerked up his eyebrows so that a brightness appeared between them and his eyes  and he explained in fits and starts  'it's like this  you see    i'm sleepy  you see  so that's why i'm going to sleep
   you see  i've a brother in law on the wenzelsplatz    that's where i'm going  for i live there  for that's where i have my bed     so i'll be off   
but i don't know his name  you see  or where he lives    seems i've forgotten    but never mind  for i don't even know if i have a brother in law at all    but i'll be off now  you see   
do you think i'll find him '  to which  without thinking  i said  'that's certain
but you're coming from abroad and your servants don't happen to be with you
allow me to show you the way '  he didn't answer
so i offered him my arm  to give him some support   d continued conversation between the fat man and the supplicant for some time already i had been trying to cheer myself up
i rubbed my body and said to myself   it's time you spoke
you're becoming embarrassed
do you feel oppressed  just wait  you know these situations
think it over at your leisure
even the landscape will wait
 it's the same as it was at the party last week
someone is reading aloud from a bending over it from three sides of the table
in tears  i swear it's not my handwriting    but what is the connection with today  it's entirely up to you to start a sensible conversation
everything's peaceful
just make an effort  my friend     you surely can find an objection
   you can say  'i'm sleepy
i've a headache
goodbye ' quick then  quick  make yourself conspicuous     what's that  again obstacles and more obstacles  what does it remind you of     i remember a high plateau which rose against the wide sky as a shield to the earth
i saw it from a mountain and prepared myself to wander through it
i began to sing   my lips were dry and disobedient as i said   ought it not to be possible to live differently    no   he said  questioning  smiling
 but why do you pray in church every evening   i asked then  while everything between him and me  which until then i had been holding together  as though in my sleep  collapsed
 oh  why should we talk about it  people who live alone have no responsibility in the evenings
one fears a number of things    that one's body could vanish  that human beings may really be what they appear to be at twilight  that one might not be allowed to walk without a stick  that it might be a good idea to go to church and pray at the top of one's voice in order to be looked at and acquire a body   because he talked like that and then fell silent  i pulled my red handkerchief out of my pocket  bent my head  and wept
he stood up  kissed me  and said   what are you crying for  you're tall  i like that  you have long hands which all but obey your will  why aren't you happy about it  always wear dark cuffs  that's my advice
   no    i flatter you and yet you cry  i think you cope quite sensibly with the difficulty of living    we build useless war machines  towers  walls  curtains of silk  and we could marvel at all this a great deal if we had the time
we tremble in the balance  we don't fall  we flutter  even though we may be uglier than bats
and on a beautiful day hardly anyone can prevent us from saying  'oh god  today is a beautiful day ' for we are already established on this earth and live by virtue of an agreement
 for we are like tree trunks in the snow
they lie there apparently flat on the ground and it looks as though one could push them away with a slight kick
but no  one can't  for they are firmly stuck to the ground
so you see even this is only apparent   the following thought prevented me from sobbing   it is night and no one will reproach me tomorrow for what i might say now  for it could have been said in my sleep   then i said   yes  that's it  but what were we talking about  we can't have been talking about the light in the sky because we are standing in the darkness of a hallway
no    we could have talked about it  nevertheless  for are we not free to say what we like in conversation  after all  we're not aiming at any definite purpose or at the truth  but simply at making jokes and having a good time
even so  couldn't you tell me the story of the woman in the garden once more  how admirable  how clever this woman is  we must follow her example
how fond i am of her  so it's a good thing i met you and waylaid you as i did
it has given me great pleasure to talk to you
i've learned several things that  perhaps intentionally  were hitherto unknown to me
   i'm grateful   he looked pleased
and although contact with a human body is always repugnant to me  i couldn't help embracing him
then we stepped out of the hallway under the sky
my friend blew away a few bruised little clouds  allowing the uninterrupted surface of the stars to emerge
he walked with difficulty
iv drowning of the fat man and now everything was seized by speed and fell into the distance
the water of the river was dragged toward a precipice  tried to resist  whirled about a little at the crumbling edge  but then crashed in foaming smoke
the fat man could not go on talking  he was forced to turn and disappear in the loud roar of the waterfall
i  who had experienced so many pleasant diversions  stood on the bank and watched
 what are our lungs supposed to do   i shouted
shouted   if they breathe fast they suffocate themselves from inner poisons  if they breathe slowly they suffocate from unbreathable air  from outraged things but if they try to search for their own rhythm they perish from the mere search   meanwhile the banks of the river stretched beyond all bounds  and yet with the palm of my hand i touched the metal of a signpost which gleamed minutely in the far distance this i really couldn't quite understand
after all i was small  almost smaller than usual  and a bush of white hips shaking itself very fast towered over me
this i saw  for a moment ago it had been close to me
nevertheless i was mistaken  for my arms were as huge as the clouds of a steady country rain  save that they were more hasty i don't know why they were trying to crush my poor head
it was no larger than an ant's egg  but slightly damaged  and as a result no longer quite round
i made some beseeching  twisting movements with it  for the expression of my eyes could not have noticed  they were so small
but my legs  my impossible legs lay over the wooded mountains and gave shade to the village studded valleys
they grew and grew  they already reached into the space that no longer owned any landscape  for some time their length had gone beyond my field of vision
but no  it isn't like that    after all  i'm small  small for the time being    i'm rolling    i'm rolling    i'm an avalanche in the mountains  please  passers by  be so kind as to tell me how tall i am    just measure these arms  these legs iii  let me think   said my acquaintance  who had accompanied me from the party and was walking quietly beside me on a path up the laurenziberg
 just stand still a moment so that i can get it clear
   i have something to settle  you know
it's all such a strain    the night is radiant  though rather cold  but this discontented wind  it sometimes even seems to change the position of those acacias   the moon made the gardener's house cast a shadow over the slightly humped path on which lay scanty patches of snow when i saw the bench that stood beside the door  i pointed at it with a raised finger  and as i was not brave and expected reproaches i laid my left hand on my chest
he sat down wearily  disregarding his beautiful clothes  and astonished me by pressing his elbows against his hips and laying his forehead on the tips of his overstretched fingers  yes  now i want to say this
you know  i live a regular life
no fault can be found with it  everything i do is considered correct and generally approved
misfortune  as it is known in the society i frequent  has not spared me  as my surroundings and i have realized with satisfaction  and even the general good fortune has not failed me and i myself have been able to talk about it in a small circle of friends
true  until now i had never been really in love
i regretted it occasionally  but used the phrase when i needed it
and now i must confess  yes  i am in love and quite beside myself with excitement
i am an ardent lover  just what the girls dream of
but ought i not to have considered that just this former lack of mine gave an exceptional and gay  an especially gay  twist to my circumstances    calm yourself   i said without interest  thinking only of myself  your loved one is beautiful  as i couldn't help hearing    yes  she is beautiful
while sitting next to her  all i could think was  what an adventure    am i not daring     there i go embarking on a sea voyage    drinking wine by the gallon
but when she laughs she doesn't show her teeth as one would expect  instead  all one sees is the dark  narrow  curved opening of the mouth
now this looks sly and senile  even though she throws back her head while laughing    i can't deny that   i said  sighing
 i've probably seen it  too  for it must be conspicuous
but it's not only that
it's the beauty of girls altogether
often when i see dresses with manifold pleats  frills  and flounces smoothly clinging to beautiful bodies  it occurs to me that they will not remain like this for long  that they will get creases that cannot be ironed out  dust will gather in the trimmings too thick to be removed  and that no one will make herself so miserable and ridiculous as every day to put on the same precious dress in the morning and take it off at night
and yet i see girls who are beautiful enough  displaying all kinds of attractive muscles and little bones and smooth skin and masses of fine hair  and who appear every day in the same natural fancy dress  always laying the same face in the same palm and letting it be reflected in the mirror
only sometimes at night  on returning late from a party  this face stares out at them from the mirror worn out  swollen  already seen by too many people  hardly worth wearing any more    i've asked you several times on our walk whether you found my girl beautiful  but you always turned away without answering
tell me  are you up to some mischief  why don't you comfort me   i dug my feet into the shadow and said kindly   you don't need to be comforted
after all  you're being loved   to avoid catching cold i held over my mouth a handkerchief with a design of blue grapes
now he turned toward me and leaned his fat face against the low back of the bench   actually i've still time  you know
i can still end this budding love affair at once  either by committing some misdeed  by unfaithfulness  or by going off to some distant land
for i've grave doubts about whether i should let myself in for all this excitement
nothing is certain  no one can tell the direction or the duration for sure
if i go into a tavern with the intention of getting drunk  i know i'll be drunk that evening
but in this case  in a week's time we're planning to go on an excursion with some friends
imagine the storm this will create in the heart for the next fortnight  last night's kisses make me sleepy and prepare the way for savage dreams i fight this by going for a walk at night  with the result that i'm in a permanent state of turmoil  my face goes hot and cold as though blown about by the wind  i have to keep fingering a pink ribbon in my pocket all the time  i'm filled with the gravest apprehensions about myself which i cannot follow up  and i can even stand your company  sir  wheareas normally i would never spend so much time talking to you   i was feeling very cold and the sky was already turning a whitish color
 i'm afraid no misdeed  no unfaithfulness or departure to some distant land will be of any avail
you'll have to kill yourself   i said  adding a smile
opposite us on the other side of the avenue stood two bushes and down below these bushes was the town
there were still a few lights on
 all right   he cried  and hit the bench with his little tight fist which  however  he left lying there
 but you go on living
you don't kill yourself
no one loves you
you don't achieve anything
you can't cope with the next moment
yet you dare to talk to me like that  you brute
you're incapable of loving  only fear excites you
just take a look at my chest   whereupon he quickly opened his overcoat and waistcoat and his shirt
his chest was indeed broad and beautiful
 yes  such obstinate moods come over one sometimes   i began to say
 this summer i was in a village which lay by a river
i remember it well
i frequently sat on a bench by the shore in a twisted position
there was a hotel  and one often heard the sound of violins
young healthy people sat in the garden at tables with beer and talked of hunting and adventures
and on the other shore were cloudlike mountains   then  with a limp  distorted mouth  i got up  stepped onto the lawn behind the bench  broke a few snow covered twigs  and whispered into my acquaintance's ear   i'm engaged  i confess it   my acquaintance wasn't surprised that i had got up
 you're engaged   he sat there really quite exhausted  supported only by the back of the bench
then he took off his hat and i saw his hair which  scented and beautifully combed  set off the round head on a fleshy neck in a sharp curving line  as was the fashion that winter
i was pleased to have answered him so cleverly
 just think   i said to myself   how he moves in society with flexible neck and free swinging arms keeping up an intelligent conversation  he can steer a lady right through a drawing room  and the fact that it's raining outside  that some timid man is standing about or some other wretched thing is happening  does not make him nervous no  he goes on bowing with the same courtesy to the ladies
and there he sits now   my acquaintance mopped his brow with a batiste handkerchief
 please put your hand on my forehead   he said
 i beg you   when i didn't do so at once  he folded his hands
as though our sorrow had darkened everything  we sat high up on the mountain as in a small room  although a little earlier we had already noticed the light and the wind of the morning
we sat close together in spite of not liking one another at all  but we couldn't move far apart because the walls were firmly and definitely drawn
we could  however  behave absurdly and without human dignity  for we didn't have to be ashamed in the presence of the branches above us and the trees standing opposite us
then  without further ado  my acquaintance pulled a knife out of his pocket  opened it thoughtfully  and then  as though he were playing  he plunged it into his left upper arm  and didn't withdraw it
blood promptly began to flow
his round cheeks grew pale
i pulled out the knife  cut up the sleeve of his overcoat and jacket  tore his shirt sleeve open
then i ran a little way up and down the road to see if there was anyone who could help
all the branches were almost exaggeratedly visible and motionless
i sucked a little at the deep wound
then i remembered the gardener's cottage
i ran up the steps leading to the upper lawn on the left side of the house  quickly examined the windows and doors  rang the bell furiously  and stamped my feet  although i knew all the time that the house was uninhabited
then i looked at the wound which was bleeding in a thin trickle
having wetted his handkerchief in snow  i tied it clumsily around his arm  my dear  dear friend   said i   you've wounded yourself for my sake
you're in such a good position  you're surrounded by well meaning friends  you can go for a walk in broad daylight when any number of carefully dressed people can be seen far and near among tables or on mountain paths
just think  in the spring we'll drive into the orchard    no  not we  that's unfortunately true    but you with your annie will drive out at a happy trot
oh yes  believe me  i beg you  and the sun will show you off to everyone at your best
oh  there'll be music  the sound of horses from afar  no need to worry  there'll be shouting and barrel organs will be playing in the avenues    oh god   he said  stood up  leaned on me and we went on   oh god  that won't help
that won't make me happy
excuse me
is it late  perhaps i ought to do something in the morning
oh god   a lantern was burning close to the wall above  it threw the shadows of the tree trunks across the road and the white snow  while on the slope the shadows of all the branches lay bent  as though broken
wedding preparations in the country i when eduard raban  coming along the passage  walked into the open doorway  he saw that it was raining
it was not raining much
on the pavement straight in front of him there were many people walking in various rhythms every now and again one would step forward and cross the road
a little girl was holding a tired puppy in her outstretched hands two gentlemen were exchanging information
the one held his hands palm upward  raising and lowering them in regular motion  as though he were balancing a load
then one caught sight of a lady whose hat was heavily laden with ribbons  buckles  and flowers
and hurrying past was a young man with a thin walking stick  his left hand  as though paralyzed  flat on his chest
now and then there came men who were smoking  bearing small upright elongated clouds along ahead of them
three gentlemen    two holding lightweight overcoats on their crooked forearms    several times walked forward from the front of the buildings to the edge of the pavement  surveyed what was going on there  and then withdrew again  talking through the gaps between the passers by one could see the regularly laid stones of the carriageway
there carriages on delicate high wheels were drawn along by horses with arched necks
the people who sat at ease on the upholstered seats gazed silently at the pedestrians  the shops  the balconies  and the sky
if it happened that one carriage overtook another  then the horses would press against each other  and the harness straps hung dangling
the animals tugged at the shafts  the carriage bowled along  swaying as it gathered speed  until the swerve around the carriage ahead was completed and the horses moved apart again  only their narrow quiet heads inclined toward each other
some people came quickly toward the front entrance  stopped on the dry mosaic paving  and  turning around slowly  stood gazing out into the rain  which  wedged in by this narrow street  fell confusedly
raban felt tired
his lips were as pale as the faded red of his thick tie  which had a moorish pattern
the lady by the doorsteps over there  who had up to now been contemplating her shoes  which were quite visible under her tightly drawn skirt  now looked at him
she did so indifferently  and she was perhaps  in any case  only looking at the falling rain in front of him or at the small nameplates of firms that were fixed to the door over his head raban thought she looked amazed
 well   he thought   if i could tell her the whole story  she would cease to be astonished
one works so feverishly at the office that afterwards one is too tired even to enjoy one's holidays properly
but even all that work does not give one a claim to be treated lovingly by everyone  on the contrary  one is alone  a total stranger and only an object of curiosity
and so long as you say 'one' instead of 'i ' there's nothing in it and one can easily tell the story  but as soon as you admit to yourself that it is you yourself  you feel as though transfixed and are horrified   he put down the suitcase with the checkered cloth cover  bending his knees in doing so
the rain water was already running along the edge of the carriageway in streaks that almost extended to the lower lying gutters
 but if i myself distinguish between 'one' and 'i ' how then dare i complain about the others  probably they're not unjust  but i'm too tired to take it all in
i'm even too tired to walk all the way to the station without an effort  and it's only a short distance
so why don't i remain in town over these short holidays  in order to recuperate  how unreasonable i'm being     the journey will make me ill  i know that quite well
my room won't be comfortable enough  it can't be otherwise in the country
and we're hardly in the first half of june  the air in the country is often still very cool
of course  i've taken precautions in my clothing  but i shall have to join with people who go for walks late in the evening
there are ponds there  one will go for a walk the length of those ponds
that is where i'm sure to catch cold
on the other hand  i shall make but little showing in conversation
i shan't be able to compare the pond with other ponds in some remote country  for i've never traveled  and talking about the moon and feeling bliss and rapturously climbing up on heaps of rubble is  after all  something i'm too old to do without being laughed to scorn   people were going past with slightly bent heads  above which they carried their dark umbrellas in a loose grip
a dray also went by  on the driver's seat  which was stuffed with straw  sat a man whose legs were stretched out so negligently that one foot was almost touching the ground  while the other rested safely on straw and rags it looked as though he were sitting in a field in fine weather
yet he was holding the reins attentively so that the dray  on which iron bars were clanging against one another  made its way safely through the dense traffic
on the wet surface of the road one could see the reflection of the iron meanderingly and slowly gliding from one row of cobbles to the next
the little boy beside the lady opposite was dressed like an old vintner
his pleated dress formed a great circle at the hem and was only held in  almost under the very armpits  by a leather strap
his hemispherical cap came down to his eyebrows  and a tassel hung down from the top as far as his left ear
he was pleased by the rain
he ran out of the doorway and looked up wide eyed into the sky in order to catch more of the rain
often he jumped high into the air so that the water splashed a great deal and passers by admonished him severely
then the lady called him and henceforth held him by the hand  yet he did not cry
raban started
had it not grown late  since he wore his topcoat and jacket open  he quickly pulled out his watch
it was not going
irritably he asked a neighbor  who was standing a little farther back in the entrance  what the time was
this man was in conversation  and while still laughing together with his companion  said   certainly
past four o'clock   and turned away
raban quickly put up his umbrella and picked up his suitcase
but when he was about to step into the street  his way was blocked by several women in a hurry and these he therefore let pass first
in doing so he looked down on a little girl's hat  which was made of plaited red straw and had a little green wreath on the wavy brim
he went on remembering this even when he was in the street  which went slightly uphill in the direction he wished to follow
then he forgot it  for now he had to exert himself a little  his small suitcase was none too light  and the wind was blowing straight against him  making his coat flutter and bending the front spokes of his umbrella he had to breathe more deeply
a clock in a nearby square down below struck a quarter to five  under the umbrella he saw the light short steps of the people coming toward him  carriage wheels squeaked with the brakes on  turning more slowly  the horses stretched their thin forelegs  daring as chamois in the mountains then it seemed to raban that he would get through the long bad time of the next fortnight  too
for it was only a fortnight  that was to say  a limited period  and even if the annoyances grew ever greater  still  the time during which one had to endure them would be growing shorter and shorter
thus  undoubtedly courage would increase
 all the people who try to torment me  and who have now occupied the entire space around me  will quite gradually be thrust back by the beneficent passage of these days  without my having to help them even in the very least
and  as it will come about quite naturally  i can be weak and quiet and let everything happen to me  and yet everything must turn out well  through the sheer fact of the passing of the days
 and besides  can't i do it the way i always used to as a child in matters that were dangerous  i don't even need to go to the country myself  it isn't necessary
i'll send my clothed body
if it staggers out of the door of my room  the staggering will indicate not fear but its nothingness
nor is it a sign of excitement if it stumbles on the stairs  if it travels into the country  sobbing as it goes  and there eats its supper in tears
for i myself am meanwhile lying in my bed  smoothly covered over with the yellowbrown blanket  exposed to the breeze that is wafted through that seldom aired room
the carriages and people in the street move and walk hesitantly on shining ground  for i am still dreaming
coachmen and pedestrians are shy  and every step they want to advance they ask as a favor from me  by looking at me
i encourage them and encounter no obstacle
 as i lie in bed i assume the shape of a big beetle  a stag beetle or a cockchafer  i think   in front of a shopwindow  in which  behind a wet glass pane  little hats for men were displayed on small pegs  he stopped and looked in  his lips pursed
 well  my hat will still do for the holidays   he thought and walked on   and if nobody can stand me because of my hat  then all the better
 the form of a large beetle  yes
then i would pretend it was a matter of hibernating  and i would press my little legs to my bulging belly
and i would whisper a few words  instructions to my sad body  which stands close beside me  bent
soon i shall have done    it bows  it goes swiftly  and it will manage everything efficiently while i rest   he came to a domed arch at the top of the steep street  leading onto a small square all around which there were many shops  already lit up
in the middle of the square  somewhat obscured by the light around the edge  was a low monument  the seated meditative figure of a man
the people moved across the lights like narrow shutters  and since the puddles spread all the brilliance far and wide  the square seemed ceaselessly changing
raban pressed far on into the square  but jerkily  dodging the drifting carriages  jumping from one dry cobble to further dry cobbles  and holding the open umbrella high in his hand in order to see everything all around
finally  by a lamppost    a place where the electric tram stopped    which was set up on a small square concrete base  he halted
 but they're expecting me in the country
won't they be wondering about me by this time  still  i haven't written to her all the week she's been in the country  until this morning
so they'll end up by imagining that even my appearance is quite different
they may be thinking that i burst forward when i address a person  yet that isn't my way at all  or that i embrace people when i arrive  and that's something i don't do either
i shall make them angry if i try to pacify them
oh  if i could only make them thoroughly angry in the attempt to pacify them   at that moment an open carriage drove past  not quickly  behind its two lighted lamps two ladies could be seen sitting on dark leather seats
one was leaning back  her face hidden by a veil and the shadow of her hat
but the other lady was sitting bolt upright  her hat was small  it was edged with thin feathers
everyone could see her
her lower lip was drawn slightly into her mouth
as soon as the carriage had passed raban  some bar blocked the view of the near horse drawing the carriage  then some coachman    wearing a big top hat    on an unusually high box was moved across in front of the ladies    this was now much farther on    then their carriage drove around the corner of a small house that now became strikingly noticeable  and disappeared from sight
raban followed it with his gaze  his head lowered  resting the handle of his umbrella on his shoulder in order to see better
he had put his right thumb into his mouth and was rubbing his teeth on it
his suitcase lay beside him  one of its sides on the ground
carriages hastened from street to street across the square  the horses' bodies flew along horizontally as though they were being flung through the air  but the nodding of the head and the neck revealed the rhythm and effort of the movement
around about  on the edges of the pavements of all the three streets converging here  there were many idlers standing about  tapping the cobbles with little sticks
among the groups they formed there were little towers in which girls were pouring out lemonade  then heavy street clocks on thin bars  then men wearing before and behind them big placards announcing entertainments in multicolored letters  then carriages  driving diagonally across the square into the street leading downhill  got in the way of some gentlemen from this party  but after the second carriage    even after the first they had timidly tried to do so    these gentlemen formed into a group again with the others  with whom they then stepped onto the pavement in a long cavalcade and pushed their way through the door of a café  overwhelmed by the light of the incandescent lamps hanging over the entrance
electric tramcars moved past  huge and very close  others  vaguely visible  stood motionless far away in the streets
 how bent she is   raban thought when he looked at the photograph now
 she's never really upright and perhaps her back is round
i shall have to pay much attention to this
and her mouth is so wide  and here  beyond doubt  the lower lip protrudes  yes  now i remember that too
and what a dress  of course  i don't know anything about clothes  but these very tight sewn sleeves are ugly  i am sure  they look like bandages
and the hat  the brim at every point turned up from the face in a different curve
but her eyes are beautiful  they're brown  if i'm not mistaken
everyone says her eyes are beautiful   now an electric tramcar stopped in front of raban and many people around him pushed toward the steps  with slightly open  pointed umbrellas  which they held upright with their hands pressed to their shoulders
raban  who was holding his suitcase under his arm  was dragged off the pavement and stepped hard into an unseen puddle
inside the tram a child knelt on a seat  pressing the tips of all its fingers to its lips as though it were saying goodbye to someone going away
some passengers got out and had to walk a few paces along the tram in order to work their way out of the crowd
then a lady climbed onto the first step  her long skirt  which she hitched up with both hands  stretched tightly around her legs a gentleman held on to a brass rod and  with lifted head  recounted something to the lady
all the people who wanted to get in were impatient
the conductor shouted
raban  who now stood on the edge of the waiting group  turned around  for someone had called out his name
 ah  lement   he said slowly and held out to a young man coming toward him the little finger of the hand in which he was holding the umbrella
 so this is the bridegroom on his way to his bride
he looks frightfully in love   lement said and then smiled with his mouth shut
 yes  you must forgive my going today   raban said
 i wrote to you this afternoon  anyway
i should  of course  have liked very much to travel with you tomorrow  but tomorrow is saturday  everything'll be so crowded  it's a long journey    oh  that doesn't matter
you did promise  but when one's in love


i shall just have to travel alone   lement had set one foot on the pavement and the other on the cobbles  supporting his body now on one leg  now on the other
 you were going to get into the tram
there it goes
come  we'll walk  i'll go with you
there's still plenty of time    isn't it rather late  please tell me    it's no wonder you're nervous  but you really have got plenty of time
i'm not so nervous  and that's why i've missed gillemann now    gillemann  won't he be staying out there  too    yes  with his wife  it's next week they mean to go  and that's just why i promised gillemann i'd meet him today when he leaves the office
he wanted to give me some instructions regarding the furnishing of their house  that's why i was supposed to meet him
but now somehow i'm late  i had some errands to do
and just as i was wondering whether i shouldn't go to their apartment  i saw you  was at first astonished at the suitcase  and spoke to you
but now the evening's too far gone for paying calls  it's fairly impossible to go to gillemann now    of course
and so i shall meet people i know there  after all
not that i have ever seen frau gillemann  though    and very beautiful she is
she's fair  and pale now after her illness
she has the most beautiful eyes i've ever seen    do please tell me  what do beautiful eyes look like  is it the glance  i've never found eyes beautiful    all right  perhaps i was exaggerating slightly
still  she's a pretty woman   through the windowpane of a ground floor café  close to the window  gentlemen could be seen sitting  reading and eating  around a three sided table  one had lowered a newspaper to the table  held a little cup raised  and was looking into the street out of the corners of his eyes
beyond these window tables all the furniture and equipment in the large restaurant were hidden by the customers  who sat side by side unpleasant business  is it  many people would take on such a burden  i think   they came into a fairly dark square  which began on their side of the street  for the opposite side extended farther
on the side of the square along which they were walking  there was an uninterrupted row of houses  from the corners of which two    at first widely distant    rows of houses extended into the indiscernible distance in which they seemed to unite
the pavement was narrow by the houses  which were mostly small  there were no shops to be seen  no carriage passed
an iron post near the end of the street out of which they came had several lamps on it  which were fixed in two rings hanging horizontally  one over the other
the trapeze shaped flame between conjoined sheets of glass burned in this towerlike wide darkness as in a little room  letting darkness assert itself a few steps farther on
 but now i am sure it is too late  you have kept it a secret from me  and i shall


 yes  at most pirkershofer    well  for what he's worth    the name's mentioned  i think  in betty's letters  he's an assistant railwayclerk  isn't he    yes  an assistant railway clerk and an unpleasant person
you'll see i'm right as soon as you've got a glimpse of that small thick nose
i tell you  walking through the dreary fields with that fellow


anyway  he's been transferred now and he goes away from there  as i believe and hope  next week    wait  you said just now you advised me to stay here tonight
i've thought it over  it couldn't very well be managed
i've written to say i'm coming this evening  they'll be expecting me    that's quite easy  send a telegram    yes  that could be done    but it wouldn't be very nice if i didn't go    and i'm tired  yes  i'll go all right
if a telegram came  they'd get a fright  into the bargain
   and what for  where would we go  anyway    then it's really better for you to go
i was only thinking


anyway i couldn't go with you today  as i'm sleepy  i forgot to tell you that
and now i shall say goodbye  for i don't want to go through the wet park with you  as i should like to drop in at gillemann's  after all
it's a quarter to six  so not too late  after all  for paying calls on people you know fairly well
addio
well  a good journey  and remember me to everyone   lement turned to the right and held out his right hand to say goodbye  so that for a moment raban was walking against lement's outstretched arm  adieu   raban said
from a little distance lement then called back   i say  eduard  can you hear me  do shut your umbrella  it stopped raining ages ago
i didn't have a chance to tell you   raban did not answer  shut his umbrella  and the sky closed over him in pallid darkness
 if at least   raban thought   i were to get into a wrong train
then it would at any rate seem to me that the whole enterprise had begun  and if later  after the mistake had been cleared up  i were to arrive in this station again on my way back  then i should certainly feel much better
if the scenery does turn out to be boring  as lement says  that need not be a disadvantage at all
one will spend more time in the rooms and really never know for certain where all the others are  for if there is a ruin in the district  there will probably be a walk all together to that ruin  it will have been agreed upon some time before then  however  one must look forward to it  for that very reason one mustn't miss it
but if there is no such sight to be seen  then there will be no discussion beforehand either  for all will be expected to get together quite easily if suddenly  against all the usual practice  a larger expedition is considered right  for one only has to send the maid into the others' apartments  where they are sitting over a letter or books and are delighted by this news
well  it is not difficult to protect oneself against such invitations
and yet i don't know whether i shall be able to  for it is not so easy as i imagine it now when i am still alone and can still do everything  can still go back if i want to  for i shall have no one there whom i could pay calls on whenever i like  and no one with whom i could make more strenuous expeditions  no one there who could show me how his crops are doing or show me a quarry he is working there
for one isn't at all sure even of acquaintances of long standing
wasn't lement nice to me today     he explained some things to me  didn't he  and described everything as it will appear to me
he came up and spoke to me and then walked with me  in spite of the fact that there was nothing he wanted to find out from me and that he himself still had something else to do but now all of a sudden he has gone away  and yet i can't have offended him even with a single word
i did refuse to spend the evening in town  but that was only natural  that can't have offended him  for he is a sensible person   the station clock struck  it was a quarter to six
raban stopped because he had palpitations  then he walked quickly along the park pool  went along a narrow  badly lighted path between large shrubs  rushed into an open place with many empty benches leaning against little trees  then went more slowly through an opening in the railings into the street  crossed it  leapt through the station entrance  after a while found the booking office  and had to knock for a while on the iron shutter
then the booking clerk looked out  said it was really high time  took the bank note  and slammed down on the counter the ticket he had been asked for and the change
now raban tried to count his change quickly  thinking he ought to be getting more  but a porter who was walking nearby hurried him through a glass door onto the platform
there raban looked around  while calling out  thank you  thank you   to the porter  and since he found no guard  he climbed up the steps of the nearest coach by himself  each time putting the suitcase on the step above and then following himself  supporting himself on his umbrella with one hand  and on the handle of the suitcase with the other the coach that he entered was brightly illuminated by the great amount of light from the main hall of the station  in which it was standing  in front of many a windowpane    all were shut right up to the top    a hissing arc lamp hung at about eye level  and the many raindrops on the glass were white  often single ones would move
raban could hear the noise from the platform even when he had shut the carriage door and sat down on the last little free bit of a light brown wooden seat
he saw many people's backs  and the backs of their heads  and between them the upturned faces of people on the seat opposite
in some places smoke was curling from pipes and cigars  in one place drifting limply past the face of a girl
often the passengers would change places  discussing these changes with each other  or they would transfer their luggage  which lay in a narrow blue net over a seat  to another one
if a stick or the metal covered corner of a suitcase stuck out  then the owner would have his attention drawn to this
he would go over and straighten it
raban also bethought himself and pushed his suitcase under his seat on his left  at the window  two gentlemen were sitting opposite each other  talking about the price of goods
 they're commercial travelers   raban thought and  breathing regularly  he gazed at them
 the merchant sends them into the country  they obey  they travel by train  and in every village they go from shop to shop
sometimes they travel by carriage between the villages
they must not stay long anywhere  for everything must be done fast  and they must always talk only about their goods
with what pleasure  then  one can exert oneself in an occupation that is so agreeable   the younger man had jerked a notebook out of the hip pocket of his trousers  rapidly flicked the leaves over with a forefinger moistened on his tongue  and then at raban as he glanced up and  indeed  when he now began talking about thread prices  did not turn his face away from raban  as one gazes steadily at a point in order not to forget anything of what one wants to say
at the same time he drew his brows tightly down over his eyes
he held the half closed notebook in his left hand  with his should need to
and the notebook trembled  for he was not supporting his arm on anything  and the coach  which was now in motion  beat on the rails like a hammer
the other traveler sat leaning back  listening and nodding at regular intervals
it was evident that he was far from agreeing with everything and later would give his own opinion
raban laid his curved hands palm down on his knees and  leaning forward  between the travelers' heads he saw the window and through the window lights flitting past and others flitting away into the distance
he did not understand anything of what the traveler was talking about  nor would he understand the other's answer
much preparation would first be required  for here were people who had been concerned with goods since their youth
but if one has held a spool of thread in one's hand so often and handed it to one's customer so often  then one knows the price and can talk about it  while villages come toward us and flash past  while at the same time they turn away into the depths of the country  where for us they must disappear
and yet these villages are inhabited  and there perhaps travelers go from shop to shop
in a corner at the far end of the coach a tall man stood up  holding playing cards in his hand  and called out   i say  marie  did you pack the zephyr shirts    of course i did   said the woman  who was sitting opposite raban
she had been dozing  and now when the question waked her she answered as though she were talking to herself or to raban
 you're going to market at jungbunzlau  eh   the vivacious traveler asked her
 jungbunzlau  that's right    it's a big market this time  isn't it    a big market  that's right   she was sleepy  she rested her left elbow on a blue bundle  and her head dropped heavily against her hand  which pressed through the flesh of the cheek to the cheekbone
 how young she is   the traveler said
raban took the money that he had received from the cashier out of his waistcoat pocket and counted it over
he held up each coin firmly between thumb and forefinger for a long time and also twisted it this way and that on the inner surface of his thumb with the tip of his forefinger
he looked for a long time at the emperor's image  then he was struck by the laurel wreath and the way it was fastened with knots and bows of ribbon at the back of the head
at last he found the sum was correct and put the money into a big black purse
but now when he was about to say to the traveler   they're a married couple  don't you think   the train stopped
the noise of the journey ceased  guards shouted the name of a place  and raban said nothing
the train started again so slowly that one could picture the revolutions of the wheels  but a moment later it was racing down a slope  and all unexpectedly the tall railings of a bridge  outside the windows  were torn apart and pressed together  as it seemed
raban was now pleased that the train was going so fast  for he would not have wanted to stay in the last place
 when it is dark there  when one knows no one there  when it is such a long way home
but then it must be terrible there by day
and is it different at the next station or at the previous ones or at the later ones or at the village i am going to   the traveler was suddenly talking more loudly
 it's a long way yet   raban thought
 sir  you know just as well as i do  these manufacturers send their travelers around the most godforsaken little villages  they go crawling to the seediest of little shopkeepers  and do you think they offer them prices different from those they offer us big businessmen  sir  take it from me  exactly the same prices  only yesterday i saw it black on white
i call it villainy
they're squeezing us out of existence  under current conditions it's simply impossible for us to do business   again he looked at raban  he was not ashamed of the tears in his eyes  he pressed the knuckles of his left hand to his mouth because his lips were quivering
raban leaned back and tugged faintly at his mustache with his left hand
the shopwoman opposite woke up and smilingly passed her hands over her forehead
the traveler talked more quietly
once again the woman shifted as though settling down to sleep  half lying on her bundle  and sighed
the skirt was drawn tight over her right hip
behind her sat a gentleman with a traveling cap on his head  reading a large newspaper
the girl opposite him  who was probably a relative of his  urged him    at the same time inclining her head toward her right shoulder    to open the window  because it was so very hot
he said  without looking up  he would do it in a moment  only he must first finish reading an article in the newspaper  and he showed her which article he meant
the shopwoman could not go to sleep again  she sat upright and looked out of the window  then for a long time she looked at the oil lamp and the flame burning yellow near the ceiling of the carriage
raban shut his eyes for a little while
when he glanced up  the shopwoman was just biting into a piece of cake that was spread with brown jam
the bundle next to her was open
the traveler was smoking a cigar in silence and kept on fidgeting as though he were tapping the ash off the end of it
the other was poking about in the works of a pocket watch with the tip of a knife  so that one could hear it scraping
with his eyes almost shut raban still had time to see  in a blurred way  the gentleman in the traveling cap pulling at the window strap
there came a gust of cool air  and a straw hat fell from a hook
raban thought he was waking up and that was why his cheeks were so refreshed  or someone was opening the door and drawing him into the room  or he was in some way mistaken about things  and  breathing deeply  he quickly fell asleep
ii the steps of the coach were still shaking a little when raban climbed down them
into his face  coming out of the air of the carriage  the rain beat  and he shut his eyes
it was raining noisily on the corrugated iron roof of the station building  but out in the open country the rain fell in such a way that it sounded like the uninterrupted blowing of the wind
a barefoot boy came running up    raban did not see from where    and breathlessly asked raban to let him carry the suitcase  for it was raining  but raban said  yes  it was raining  and he would therefore go by omnibus
he did not need him  he said
thereupon the boy pulled a face as though he thought it grander to walk in the rain and have one's suitcase carried than to go by bus  and instantly turned around and ran away
when raban wanted to call him  it was already too late
there were two lighted lamps  and a station official came out of a door
without hesitation he walked through the rain to the engine  stood there motionless with his arms folded  and waited until the engine driver leaned over his rail and talked to him a porter was called  came  and was sent back again
at many of the windows in the train there were passengers standing  and since what they had to look at was an ordinary railway station their gaze was probably dim  the eyelids close together  as though the train were in motion
a girl came hurrying along from the road to the platform under a parasol with a flowered pattern  she set the open parasol on the ground and sat down  pushing her legs apart so that her skirt should dry better  and ran her fingertips over the tight stretched skirt there were only two lamps alight  her face was indistinguishable
the porter came past and complained that puddles were forming under the parasol  he held his arms in a semicircle before him in order to demonstrate the size of these puddles  and then moved his hands through the air  one after the other  like fishes sinking into deeper water  in order to make it clear that traffic was also being impeded by this parasol the train started  disappeared like a long sliding door  and behind the poplars on the far side of the railway track there was the landscape  so massive that it took away one's breath
was it a dark view through a gap or was it woods  was it a pool  or a house in which the people were already asleep  was it a church steeple or a ravine between the hills  nobody must dare to go there  but who could restrain himself  and when raban caught sight of the official    he was already at the step up to his office    he ran in front of him and stopped him   excuse me  please  is it far to the village  that's where i want to go    no  a quarter of an hour  but by bus    as it's raining    you'll be there in five minutes    it's raining it's not a very fine spring   raban said
the official had put his right hand on his hip  and through the triangle formed by the arm and the body raban saw the girl  who had now shut the parasol  on the seat where she sat
 if one is going on one's summer holidays now and is going to stay there  one can't but regret it
actually i thought i should be met   he glanced around to make it seem plausible
 you will miss the bus  i'm afraid
it doesn't wait so long
nothing to thank me for
that's the road  between the hedges   the road outside the railway station was not lighted  only from three ground floor windows in the building there came a misty glimmer  but it did not extend far
raban walked on tiptoe through the mud and shouted  driver   and  hello there   and  omnibus   and  here i am   many times
but when he landed among scarcely interrupted puddles on the dark side of the road  he had to tramp onwards with his heels down  until suddenly a horse's moist muzzle touched his forehead
there was the omnibus  he quickly climbed into the empty compartment  sat down by the windowpane behind the driver's box  and hunched his back into the corner  for he had done all that was necessary
for if the driver is asleep  he will wake up toward morning  if he is dead  then a new driver will come  or the innkeeper  and should that not happen either  then passengers will come by the early morning train  people in a hurry  making a noise
in any case one can be quiet  one may even draw the curtains over the windows and wait for the jerk with which the vehicle must start
 yes  after all i have already accomplished  it is certain that tomorrow i shall get to betty and to mamma  nobody can prevent that
yet it is true  and was indeed to be foreseen  that my letter will arrive only tomorrow  so that i might very well have remained in town and spent an agreeable night at elvy's  without having to be afraid of the next day's work  the sort of thing that otherwise ruins every pleasure for me
but look  i've got my feet wet   he lit a stub of candle that he had taken out of his waistcoat pocket and set it on the seat opposite
it was bright enough  the darkness outside made it appear as though the omnibus had black distempered walls and no glass in the windows
there was no need to think that there were wheels under the floor and in front the horse between the shafts
raban rubbed his feet thoroughly on the seat  pulled on clean socks  and sat up straight
then he heard someone from the station shouting   hi   if there was anyone in the bus he might say so
 yes  yes  and he would like to start now  too   raban answered  leaning out of the door  which he had opened  holding on to the doorpost with his right hand  the left hand held open  close to his mouth
the rain gushed down the back of his neck  inside his collar
wrapped in the canvas of two sacks that had been cut up  the driver came over  the reflection of his stable lantern jumping through the puddles at his feet
irritably he began an explanation  listen here  he said  he had been playing cards with lebeda and they had just been getting on fine when the train came
it would really have been impossible for him to take a look outside then  still  he did not mean to abuse anyone who did not understand that
apart from that  this place here was a filthy dump  and no half measures  and it was hard to see what business a gentleman like this could have here  and he would be getting there soon enough anyway  so that he need not go and complain anywhere
only just now herr pirkershofer    if you please  that's the junior assistant clerk    had come in and had said he thought a small fair man had been wanting to go by the omnibus
well  so he had at once come and asked  or hadn't he at once come and asked  the lantern was attached to the end of the shaft  the horse  having been shouted at in a muffled voice  began to pull  and the water on top of the bus  now set stirring  dripped slowly through a crack into the carriage
the road was perhaps hilly  there was surely mud flying up into the spokes  fans of puddle water formed  with a rushing sound  behind the turning wheels  it was for the most part with loose reins that the driver guided the dripping horse
   could not all this be used as reproaches against raban  many puddles were unexpectedly lit up by the lantern trembling on the shaft  and split up  in ripples  under the wheel
this happened solely because raban was traveling to his fiancée  to betty  an oldish pretty girl
and who  if one were going to speak of it at all  would appreciate what merits raban here had  even if it was only that he bore those reproaches  which admittedly nobody could make openly
of course he was doing it gladly
betty was his fiancée  he was fond of her  it would be disgusting if she were to thank him for that as well  but all the same    without meaning to  he often bumped his head on the panel against which he was leaning  then for a while he looked up at the ceiling
once his right hand slipped down from his thigh  where he had been resting it
but his elbow remained in the angle between belly and leg
the omnibus was now traveling between houses  here and there the inside of the coach had a share of the light from a room  there were some steps    to see the first of them raban would have had to stand up    built up to a church  outside a park gate there was a lamp with a large flame burning in it  but a statue of a saint stood out in black relief only because of the light from a draper's shop  and raban saw his candle  which had burnt down  the trickle of wax hanging motionless from the seat
when the bus stopped outside the inn  and the rain could be heard loudly and     probably there was a window open    so could the voices of the guests  raban wondered which would be better  to get out at once or to wait until the innkeeper came to the coach
what the custom was in this township he did not know  but it was pretty certain that betty would have spoken of her fiancé  and according to whether his arrival here was magnificent or feeble  so the esteem in which she was held here would increase or diminish  and with that  again  his own  too
but of course he knew neither what people felt about her nor what she had told them about him  and so everything was all the more disagreeable and difficult
oh  beautiful city and beautiful the way home  if it rains there  one goes home by tram over wet cobbles  here one goes in a cart through mud to an inn
    the city is far from here  and if i were now in danger of dying of homesickness  nobody could get me back there today
   well  anyway  i shouldn't die    but there i get the meal expected for that evening  set on the table  on the right behind my plate the newspaper  on the left the lamp  here i shall be given some dreadfully fat dish    they don't know that i have a weak stomach  and even if they did know    an unfamiliar newspaper    many people  whom i can already hear  will be there  and one lamp will be lit for all
what sort of light can it provide  enough to play cards by    but for reading a newspaper   the innkeeper isn't coming  he's not interested in guests  he is probably an unfriendly man
or does he know that i am betty's fiancé  and does that give him a reason for not coming to fetch me in  it would be in accord with that that the driver kept me waiting so long at the station betty has often told me  after all  how much she has been bothered by lecherous men and how she has had to rebuff their insistence  perhaps it is that here too


   [text breaks off] [second manuscript] when eduard raban  coming along the passage  walked into the open doorway  he could now see how it was raining
it was not raining much
on the pavement straight in front of him  not higher  not lower  there were  in spite of the rain  many passers by
every now and again one would step forward and cross the road
a little girl was carrying a gray dog on her outstretched arms two gentlemen were exchanging information on some subject  at times turning the whole front of their bodies to each other  and then slowly turning aside themselves again  it was like doors ajar in the wind the one held his hands palm upward  raising and lowering them in regular motion  as though he were balancing a load  testing the weight of it then one caught sight of a slim lady whose face twitched slightly  like the flickering light of the stars  and whose flat hat was loaded high and to the brim with unrecognizable objects  she appeared to be a stranger to all the passers by  without intending it  as though by some law
and hurrying past was a young man with a thin walking stick  his left hand  as though paralyzed  lying flat on his chest
many were out on business  in spite of the fact that they walked fast  one saw them longer than others  now on the pavement  now below  their coats fitted them badly  they did not care how they carried themselves  they let themselves be pushed by the people and they pushed too three gentlemen    two holding lightweight overcoats on their crooked forearms    walked from the front of the building to the edge of the pavement  in order to see what was going on in the carriageway and on the farther pavement through the gaps between the passers by  now fleetingly  then comfortably  one saw the regularly set cobbles in the carriageway  on which carriages  swaying on their wheels  were swiftly drawn by horses with arched necks
the people who sat at ease on the upholstered seats gazed in silence at the pedestrians  the shops  the balconies  and the sky
if it happened that one carriage overtook another  then the horses would press against each other  and the harness straps hung dangling
the animals tugged at the shafts  the carriage bowled along  swaying as it gathered speed  until the swerve around the carriage ahead was completed and the horses moved apart again  still with their narrow heads inclined toward each other
an elderly gentleman came quickly toward the front entrance  stopped on the dry mosaic paving  turned around
and he then gazed into the rain  which  wedged in by the narrow street  fell confusedly
raban put down the suitcase with the black cloth cover  bending his right knee a little in doing so
the rain water was already running along the edge of the carriageway in streaks that almost extended to the lower lying gutters
the elderly gentleman stood upright near raban  who was supporting himself by leaning slightly against the wooden doorpost  from time to rime he glanced toward raban  even though to do so he had to twist his neck sharply yet he did this only out of the natural desire  now that he happened to be unoccupied  to observe everything exactly  at least in his vicinity
the result of this aimless glancing hither and thither was that there was a great deal he did not notice
so  for instance  it escaped him that raban's lips were very pale  not much less so than the very faded red of his tie  which had a once striking moorish pattern
now  had he noticed this  he would certainly have made a fuss about it  at least inwardly  which  again  would not have been the right thing  for raban was always pale  even if  it was a fact  various things might have been making him especially tired just recently
 what weather   the gentleman said in a low voice  shaking his head  consciously  it was true  but still in a slightly senile way
 yes  indeed  and when one's supposed to be starting on a journey  too   raban said  quickly straightening up
 and it isn't the kind of weather that will improve   the gentleman said and  in order to make sure of it once more for the last time  bent forward to glance in scrutiny up the street  then down  and then at the sky
 it may last for days  even for weeks
so far as i recall  nothing better is forecast for june and the beginning of july  either
well  it's no pleasure to anyone  i for instance shall have to do without my walks  which are extremely important to my health   hereupon he yawned and seemed to become exhausted  since he had now heard raban's voice and  occupied with this conversation  no longer took any interest in anything  not even in the conversation
this made quite an impression on raban  since after all the gentleman had addressed him first  and he therefore tried to show off a little  although it might not even be noticed
 true   he said   in town one can very easily manage to go without what isn't good for one
if one does not do without it  then one has only oneself to blame for the bad consequences
one will be sorry and in this way come to see for the first time really clearly how to manage the next time
and even if in matters of detail

raban hastened to say  prepared to excuse the gentleman's absent mindedness in any way possible  since after all he wanted to show off a little more
 it's all just out of the book previously mentioned  which i  like other people  happen to have been reading in the evening recently
i have been mostly alone
owing to family circumstances  you see but apart from anything else  a good book is what i like best after supper
always has been
just recently i read in a prospectus a quotation from some writer or other
'a good book is the best friend there is ' and that's really true  it is so  a good book is the best friend there is    yes  when one is young     the gentleman said  meaning nothing in particular by this  merely wanting to indicate how it was raining  that the rain was heavier again  and that now it was not going to stop at all  but to raban it sounded as though at sixty the gentleman still thought of himself as young and energetic and considered raban's thirty years nothing in comparison  and as though he meant to say besides  insofar as it was permissible  that at the age of thirty he had  of course  been more sensible than raban and that he believed even if one had nothing else to do  like himself  for instance  an old man  yet it was really wasting one's time to stand about here in this hall  looking at the rain  but if one spent the time  besides  in chatter  one was wasting it doubly now raban had believed for some time that nothing other people said about his capabilities or opinions had been able to affect him  on the contrary  that he had positively abandoned the position where he had listened  all submissively  to everything that was said  so that people were now simply wasting their breath whether they happened to be against him or for him
and so he said   we are talking about different things  since you did not wait to hear what i was going to say    please go on  please go on   the gentleman said
 well  it isn't so important   raban said
 i was only going to say books are useful in every sense and quite especially in respects in which one would not expect it
for when one is about to embark on some enterprise  it is precisely the books whose contents have nothing at all in common with the enterprise that are the most useful
for the reader who does after all intend to embark on that enterprise  that is to say  who has somehow become enthusiastic (and even if  as it were  the effect of the book can penetrate only so far as that enthusiasm)  will be stimulated by the book to all kinds of thoughts concerning his enterprise
now  however  since the contents of the book are precisely something of utter indifference  the reader is not at all impeded in those thoughts  and he passes through the midst of the book with them  as once the jews passed through the red sea  that's how i should like to put it   for raban the whole person of the old gentleman now assumed an unpleasant expression
it seemed to him as though he had drawn particularly close to him    but it to say  i am only going into the country  that's all  only for a fortnight  i am taking a holiday for the first time for quite a long period  and it's necessary for other reasons too  and yet for instance a book that i was  as i have mentioned  reading recently taught me more about my little journey than you could imagine    i am listening   the gentleman said
raban was silent and  standing there so straight  put his hands into his overcoat pockets  which were rather too high
only after a while did the old gentleman say   this journey seems to be of some special importance to you    well  you see  you see   raban said  once more supporting himself against the doorpost only now did he see how the passage had filled up with people
they were standing even around the foot of the staircase  and an official  who had rented a room in the apartment of the same woman as raban had  when he came down the stairs had to ask the people to make way for him
to raban  who only pointed at the rain  he called out over several heads  which now all turned to raban   have a good journey  and reiterated a promise  obviously given earlier  definitely to visit raban the next sunday
which has always been kept open for him
he has such powers of endurance and is inwardly so gay that he does not need anyone to keep him entertained  but everyone needs him
he has always been healthy
oh  don't try to tell me
 i am not going to argue   the gentleman said
 you won't argue  but you won't admit your mistake either
why do you stick to it so  and however sharply you may recollect now  you would  i dare wager  forget everything if you were to talk to him
you would reproach me for not having refuted you more effectively now
if he so much as talks about a book
he's instantly ecstatic about everything beautiful

   the judgment it was a sunday morning in the very height of spring
georg bendemann  a young merchant  was sitting in his own room on the first floor of one of a long row of small  ramshackle houses stretching beside the river which were scarcely distinguishable from each other in height and coloring he had just finished a letter to an old friend of his who was now living abroad  had put it into its envelope in a slow and dreamy fashion  and with his elbows propped on the writing table was gazing out of the window at the river  the bridge  and the hills on the farther bank with their tender green he was thinking about his friend  who had actually run away to russia some years before  being dissatisfied with his prospects at home
now he was carrying on a business in st
petersburg  which had flourished to begin with but had long been going downhill  as he always complained on his increasingly rare visits
so he was wearing himself out to no purpose in a foreign country  the unfamiliar full beard he wore did not quite conceal the face georg had known so well since childhood  and his skin was growing so yellow as to indicate some latent disease by his own account he had no regular connection with the colony of his fellow countrymen out there and almost no social intercourse with russian families  so that he was resigning himself to becoming a permanent bachelor what could one write to such a man  who had obviously run off the rails  a man one could be sorry for but could not help
should one advise him to come home  to transplant himself and take up his old friendships again    there was nothing to hinder him    and in general to rely on the help of his friends  but that was as good as telling him  and the more kindly the more offensively  that all his efforts hitherto had miscarried  that he should finally give up  come back home  and be gaped at by everyone as a returned prodigal  that only his friends knew what was what and that he himself was just a big child who should do what his successful and home keeping friends prescribed and was it certain  besides  that all the pain one would have to inflict on him would achieve its object  perhaps it would not even be possible to get him to come home at all    he said himself that he was now out of touch with commerce in his native country    and then he would still be left an alien in a foreign land embittered by his friends' advice and more than ever estranged from them but if he did follow their advice and then didn't fit in at home    not out of malice  of course  but through force of circumstances    couldn't get on with his friends or without them  felt humiliated  couldn't be said to have either friends or a country of his own any longer  wouldn't it have been better for him to stay abroad just as he was  taking all this into account  how could one be sure that he would make a success of life at home  for such reasons  supposing one wanted to keep up correspondence with him  one could not send him any real news such as could frankly be told to the most distant acquaintance it was more than three years since his last visit  and for this he offered the lame excuse that the political situation in russia was too uncertain  which apparently would not permit even the briefest absence of a small businessman while it allowed hundreds of thousands of russians to travel peacefully abroad
but during these three years georg's own position in life had changed a lot
two years ago his mother had died  since when he and his father had shared the household together  and his friend had of course been informed of that and had expressed his sympathy in a letter phrased so dryly that the grief caused by such an event  one had to conclude  could not be realized in a distant country
since that time  however  georg had applied himself with greater determination to the business as well as to everything else perhaps during his mother's lifetime his father's insistence on having everything his own way in the business had hindered him from developing any real activity of his own  perhaps since her death his father had become less aggressive  although he was still active in the business  perhaps it was mostly due to an accidental run of good fortune    which was very probable indeed    but at any rate during those two years the business had developed in a most unexpected way  the staff had had to be doubled  the turnover was five times as great  no doubt about it  further progress lay just ahead
but georg's friend had no inkling of this improvement
in earlier years  perhaps for the last time in that letter of condolence  he had tried to persuade georg to emigrate to russia and had enlarged upon the prospects of success for precisely georg's branch of trade
the figures quoted were microscopic by comparison with the range of georg's present operations
yet he shrank from letting his friend know about his business success  and if he were to do it now retrospectively that certainly would look peculiar
so georg confined himself to giving his friend unimportant items of gossip such as rise at random in the memory when one is idly thinking things over on a quiet sunday all he desired was to leave undisturbed the idea of the home town which his friend must have built up to his own content during the long interval
and so it happened to georg that three times in three fairly widely separated letters he had told his friend about the engagement of an unimportant man to an equally unimportant girl  until indeed  quite contrary to his intentions  his friend began to show some interest in this notable event
yet georg preferred to write about things like these rather than to confess that he himself had got engaged a month ago to a fräulein frieda brandenfeld  a girl from a well to do family he often discussed this friend of his with his fiancée and the peculiar relationship that had developed between them in their correspondence
 so he won't be coming to our wedding   said she   and yet i have a right to get to know all your friends    i don't want to trouble him   answered georg   don't misunderstand me  he would probably come  at least i think so  but he would feel that his hand had been forced and he would be hurt  perhaps he would envy me and certainly he'd be discontented and without being able to do anything about his discontent he'd have to go away again alone
alone    do you know what that means    yes  but may he not hear about our wedding in some other fashion    i can't prevent that  of course  but it's unlikely  considering the way he lives    since your friends are like that  georg  you shouldn't ever have got engaged at all    well  we're both to blame for that  but i wouldn't have it any other way now   and when  breathing quickly under his kisses  she still brought out   all the same  i do feel upset   he thought it could not really involve him in trouble were he to send the news to his friend
 that's the kind of man i am and he'll just have to take me as i am   he said to himself   i can't cut myself to another pattern that might make a more suitable friend for him   and in fact he did inform his friend  in the long letter he had been writing that sunday morning  about his engagement  with these words   i have saved my best news to the end i have got engaged to a fräulein frieda brandenfeld  a girl from a well todo family  who only came to live here a long time after you went away  so that you're hardly likely to know her
there will be time to tell you more about her later  for today let me just say that i am very happy and as between you and me the only difference in our relationship is that instead of a quite ordinary kind of friend you will now have in me a happy friend
besides that  you will acquire in my fiancée  who sends her warm greetings and will soon write you herself  a genuine friend of the opposite sex  which is not without importance to a bachelor
i know that there are many reasons why you can't come to see us  but would not my wedding be precisely the right occasion for giving all obstacles the go by  still  however that may be  do just as seems good to you without regarding any interests but your own   with this letter in his hand georg had been sitting a long time at the writing table  his face turned toward the window he had barely acknowledged  with an absent smile  a greeting waved to him from the street by a passing acquaintance
at last he put the letter in his pocket and went out of his room across a small lobby into his father's room  which he had not entered for months
there was in fact no need for him to enter it  since he saw his father daily at business and they took their mid day meal together at an eating house  in the evening  it was true  each did as he pleased  yet even then  unless georg    as mostly happened    went out with friends or  more recently  visited his fiancée  they always sat for a while  each with his newspaper  in their common sitting room
it surprised georg how dark his father's room was even on this sunny morning
so it was overshadowed as much as that by the high wall on the other side of the narrow courtyard
his father was sitting by the window in a corner hung with various mementoes of georg's dead mother  reading a newspaper which he held to one side before his eyes in an attempt to overcome a defect of vision
on the table stood the remains of his breakfast  not much of which seemed to have been eaten
 ah  georg   said his father  rising at once to meet him
his heavy dressing gown swung open as he walked and the skirts of it fluttered around him
    my father is still a giant of a man   said georg to himself  it's unbearably dark here   he said aloud
 yes  it's dark enough   answered his father
 and you've shut the window  too    i prefer it like that    well  it's quite warm outside   said georg  as if continuing his previous remark  and sat down
his father cleared away the breakfast dishes and set them on a chest
 i really only wanted to tell you   went on georg  who had been vacantly following the old man's movements   that i am now sending the news of my engagement to st
petersburg   he drew the letter a little way from his pocket and let it drop back again
 to st
petersburg   asked his father
 to my friend there   said georg  trying to meet his father's eye
   in business hours he's quite different  he was thinking  how solidly he sits here with his arms crossed  oh yes
to your friend   said his father  with peculiar emphasis
 well  you know  father  that i wanted not to tell him about my engagement at first
out of consideration for him  that was the only reason
you know yourself he's a difficult man
i said to myself that someone else might tell him about my engagement  although he's such a solitary creature that that was hardly likely    i couldn't prevent that    but i wasn't ever going to tell him myself    and now you've changed your mind   asked his father  laying his enormous newspaper on the window sill and on top of it his spectacles  which he covered with one hand
 yes  i've been thinking it over
if he's a good friend of mine  i said to myself  my being happily engaged should make him happy too
and so i wouldn't put off telling him any longer
but before i posted the letter i wanted to let you know    georg   said his father  lengthening his toothless mouth   listen to me  you've come to me about this business  to talk it over with me
no doubt that does you honor
but it's nothing  it's worse than nothing  if you don't tell me the whole truth
i don't want to stir up matters that shouldn't be mentioned here
since the death of our dear mother certain things have been done that aren't right
maybe the time will come for mentioning them  and maybe sooner than we think
there's many a thing in the business i'm not aware of  maybe it's not done behind my back    i'm not going to say that it's done behind my back    i'm not equal to things any longer  my memory's failing  i haven't an eye for so many things any longer
that's the course of nature in the first place  and in the second place the death of our dear mother hit me harder than it did you
   but since we're talking about it  about this letter  i beg you  georg  don't deceive me
it's a trivial affair  it's hardly worth mentioning  so don't deceive me
do you really have this friend in st
petersburg   georg rose in embarrassment
 never mind my friends
a thousand friends wouldn't make up to me for my father
do you know what i think  you're not taking enough care of yourself
but old age must be taken care of
i can't do without you in the business  you know that very well  but if the business is going to undermine your health  i'm ready to close it down tomorrow forever
and that won't do
we'll have to make a change in your way of living
but a radical change
you sit here in the dark  and in the sitting room you would have plenty of light
you just take a bite of breakfast instead of properly keeping up your strength
you sit by a closed window  and the air would be so good for you
no  father  i'll get the doctor to come  and we'll follow his orders
we'll change your room  you can move into the front room and i'll move in here
you won't notice the change  all your things will be moved with you
but there's time for all that later  i'll put you to bed now for a little  i'm sure you need to rest
come  i'll help you to take off your things  you'll see i can do it
or if you would rather go into the front room at once  you can lie down in my bed for the present
that would be the most sensible thing   georg stood close beside his father  who had let his head with its unkempt white hair sink on his chest
 georg   said his father in a low voice  without moving
georg knelt down at once beside his father  in the old man's weary face he saw the pupils  overlarge  fixedly looking at him from the corners of the eyes
 you have no friend in st
petersburg
you've always been a leg puller and you haven't even shrunk from pulling my leg
how could you have a friend out there  i can't believe it    just think back a bit  father   said georg  lifting his father from the chair and slipping off his dressing gown as he stood feebly enough   it'll soon be three years since my friend came to see us last
i remember that you used not to like him very much
at least twice i kept you from seeing him  although he was actually sitting with me in my room
i could quite well understand your dislike of him  my friend has his peculiarities
but then  later  you got on with him very well
i was proud because you listened to him and nodded and asked him questions
if you think back you're bound to remember
he used to tell us the most incredible stories of the russian revolution
for instance  when he was on a business trip to kiev and ran into a riot  and saw a priest on a balcony who cut a broad cross in blood on the palm of his hand and held the hand up and appealed to the mob
you've told that story yourself once or twice since   meanwhile georg had succeeded in lowering his father down again and carefully taking off the woolen drawers he wore over his linen underpants and his socks
the not particularly clean appearance of his underwear made him reproach himself for having been neglectful it should have certainly been his duty to see that his father had clean changes of underwear
he had not yet explicitly discussed with his bride to be what arrangements should be made for his father in the future  for they had both of them silently taken it for granted that the old man would go on living alone in the old house
but now he made a quick  firm decision to take him into his own future establishment
it almost looked  on closer inspection  as if the care he meant to lavish there on his father might come too late
he carried his father to bed in his arms it gave him a dreadful feeling to notice that while he took the few steps toward the bed the old man on his breast was playing with his watch chain
he could not lay him down on the bed for a moment  so firmly did he hang on to the watch chain
but as soon as he was laid in bed  all seemed well
he covered himself up and even drew the blankets farther than usual over his shoulders he looked up at georg with a not unfriendly eye
 you begin to remember my friend  don't you   asked georg  giving him an encouraging nod
 am i well covered up now   asked his father  as if he were not able to see whether his feet were properly tucked in or not
 so you find it snug in bed already   said georg  and tucked the blankets more closely around him
 am i well covered up   asked the father once more  seeming to be strangely intent upon the answer
 don't worry  you're well covered up    no   cried his father  cutting short the answer  threw the blankets off with a strength that sent them all flying in a moment and sprang erect in bed
only one hand lightly touched the ceiling to steady him
 you wanted to cover me up  i know  my young sprig  but i'm far from being covered up yet
and even if this is the last strength i have  it's enough for you  too much for you
of course i know your friend
he would have been a son after my own heart
that's why you've been playing him false all these years
why else  do you think i haven't been sorry for him  and that's why you had to lock yourself up in your office    the chief is busy  mustn't be disturbed    just so that you could write your lying little letters to russia
but thank goodness a father doesn't need to be taught how to see through his son
and now that you thought you'd got him down  so far down that you could set your bottom on him and sit on him and he wouldn't move  then my fine son makes up his mind to get married   georg stared at the bogey conjured up by his father
his friend in st
petersburg  whom his father suddenly knew too well  touched his imagination as never before
lost in the vastness of russia he saw him
at the door of an empty  plundered warehouse he saw him
among the wreckage of his showcases  the slashed remnants of his wares  the falling gas brackets  he was just standing up
why did he have to go so far away   but attend to me   cried his father  and georg  almost distracted  ran toward the bed to take everything in  yet came to a stop halfway
 because she lifted up her skirts   his father began to flute   because she lifted her skirts like this  the nasty creature   and mimicking her he lifted his shirt so high that one could see the scar on his thigh from his war wound   because she lifted her skirts like this and this you made up to her  and in order to make free with her undisturbed you have disgraced your mother's memory  betrayed your friend  and stuck your father into bed so that he can't move
but he can move  or can't he   and he stood up quite unsupported and kicked his legs out
his insight made him radiant
georg shrank into a corner  as far away from his father as possible
a long time ago he had firmly made up his mind to watch closely every least movement so that he should not be surprised by any indirect attack  a pounce from behind or above
at this moment he recalled this long forgotten resolve and forgot it again  like a man drawing a short thread through the eye of a needle
 but your friend hasn't been betrayed after all   cried his father  emphasizing the point with stabs of his forefinger
 i've been representing him here on the spot    you comedian   georg could not resist the retort  realized at once the harm done and  his eyes starting in his head  bit his tongue back  only too late  till the pain made his knees give
 yes  of course i've been playing a comedy  a comedy  that's a good expression  what other comfort was left to a poor old widower  tell me    and while you're answering me be you still my living son    what else was left to me  in my back room  plagued by a disloyal staff  old to the marrow of my bones  and my son strutting through the world  finishing off deals that i had prepared for him  bursting with triumphant glee  and stalking away from his father with the closed face of a respectable businessman  do you think i didn't love you  i  from whom you are sprung   now he'll lean forward  thought georg  what if he topples and smashes himself  these words went hissing through his mind his father leaned forward but did not topple
since georg did not come any nearer  as he had expected  he straightened himself again  stay where you are  i don't need you  you think you have strength enough to come over here and that you're only hanging back of your own accord
don't be too sure  i am still much the stronger of us two
all by myself i might have had to give way  but your mother has given me so much of her strength that i've established a fine connection with your friend and i have your customers here in my pocket    he has pockets even in his shirt   said georg to himself  and believed that with this remark he could make him an impossible figure for all the world only for a moment did he think so  since he kept on forgetting everything
 just take your bride on your arm and try getting in my way  i'll sweep her from your very side  you don't know how   georg made a grimace of disbelief
his father only nodded  confirming the truth of his words  toward georg's corner
 how you amused me today  coming to ask me if you should tell your friend about your engagement
he knows it already  you stupid boy  he knows it all  i've been writing to him  for you forgot to take my writing things away from me
that's why he hasn't been here for years  he knows everything a hundred times better than you do yourself  in his left hand he crumples your letters unopened while in his right hand he holds up my letters to read through   in his enthusiasm he waved his arm over his head
 he knows everything a thousand times better   he cried
 ten thousand times   said georg  to make fun of his father  but in his very mouth the words turned into deadly earnest
 for years i've been waiting for you to come with some such question  do you think i concern myself with anything else  do you think i read my newspapers  look   and he threw georg a newspaper sheet which he had somehow taken to bed with him
an old newspaper  with a name entirely unknown to georg
 how long a time you've taken to grow up  your mother had to die  she couldn't see the happy day  your friend is going to pieces in russia  even three years ago he was yellow enough to be thrown away  and as for me  you see what condition i'm in
you have eyes in your head for that    so you've been lying in wait for me   cried georg
his father said pityingly  in an offhand manner   i suppose you wanted to say that sooner
but now it doesn't matter   and in a louder voice   so now you know what else there was in the world besides yourself  till now you've known only about yourself  an innocent child  yes  that you were  truly  but still more truly have you been a devilish human being     and therefore take note  i sentence you now to death by drowning   georg felt himself urged from the room  the crash with which his father fell on the bed behind him was still in his ears as he fled on the staircase  which he rushed down as if its steps were an inclined plane  he ran into his charwoman on her way up to do the morning cleaning of the room
 jesus   she cried  and covered her face with her apron  but he was already gone
out of the front door he rushed  across the roadway  driven toward the water
already he was grasping at the railings as a starving man clutches food
he swung himself over  like the distinguished gymnast he had once been in his youth  to his parents' pride with weakening grip he was still holding on when he spied between the railings a motor bus coming which would easily cover the noise of his fall  called in a low voice   dear parents  i have always loved you  all the same   and let himself drop at this moment an unending stream of traffic was just going over the bridge
in the penal colony  it's a remarkable piece of apparatus   said the officer to the explorer and surveyed with a certain air of admiration the apparatus which was after all quite familiar to him
the explorer seemed to have accepted merely out of politeness the commandant's invitation to witness the execution of a soldier condemned to death for disobedience and insulting behavior to a superior
nor did the colony itself betray much interest in this execution
at least  in the small sandy valley  a deep hollow surrounded on all sides by naked crags  there was no one present save the officer  the explorer  the condemned man  who was a stupid looking  wide mouthed creature with bewildered hair and face  and the soldier who held the heavy chain controlling the small chains locked on the prisoner's ankles  wrists  and neck  chains that were themselves attached to each other by communicating links in any case  the condemned man looked so like a submissive dog that one might have thought he could be left to run free on the surrounding hills and would only need to be whistled for when the execution was due to begin
the explorer did not much care about the apparatus and walked up and down behind the prisoner with almost visible indifference while the officer made the last adjustments  now creeping beneath the structure  which was bedded deep in the earth  now climbing a ladder to inspect its upper parts
these were tasks that might well have been left to a mechanic  but the officer performed them with great zeal  whether because he was a devoted admirer of the apparatus or because of other reasons the work could be entrusted to no one else
 ready now   he called at last and climbed down from the ladder
he looked uncommonly limp  breathed with his mouth wide open  and had tucked two fine ladies' handkerchiefs under the collar of his uniform
 these uniforms are too heavy for the tropics  surely   said the explorer  instead of making some inquiry about the apparatus  as the officer had expected  of course   said the officer  washing his oily and greasy hands in a bucket of water that stood ready   but they mean home to us  we don't want to forget about home
now just have a look at this machine   he added at once  simultaneously drying his hands on a towel and indicating the apparatus
 up till now a few things still had to be set by hand  but from this moment it works all by itself   the explorer nodded and followed him
the officer  anxious to secure himself against all contingencies  said   things sometimes go wrong  of course  i hope that nothing goes wrong today  but we have to allow for the possibility the machinery should go on working continuously for twelve hours
but if anything does go wrong it will only be some small matter that can be set right at once    won't you take a seat   he asked finally  drawing a cane chair out from among a heap of them and offering it to the explorer  who could not refuse it
he was now sitting at the edge of a pit  into which he glanced for a fleeting moment
it was not very deep
on one side of the pit the excavated soil had been piled up in a rampart  on the other side of it stood the apparatus
 i don't know   said the officer   if the commandant has already explained this apparatus to you   the explorer waved one hand vaguely  the officer asked for nothing better  since now he could explain the apparatus himself  this apparatus   he said  taking hold of a crank handle and leaning against it   was invented by our former commandant
i assisted at the very earliest experiments and had a share in all the work until its completion
but the credit of inventing it belongs to him alone
have you ever heard of our former commandant  no  well  it isn't saying too much if i tell you that the organization of the whole penal colony is his work
we who were his friends knew even before he died that the organization of the colony was so perfect that his successor  even with a thousand new schemes in his head  would find it impossible to alter anything  at least for many years to come
and our prophecy has come true  the new commandant has had to acknowledge its truth
a pity you never met the old commandant     but   the officer interrupted himself   i am rambling on  and here stands his apparatus before us it consists  as you see  of three parts
in the course of time each of these parts has acquired a kind of popular nickname
the lower one is called the 'bed ' the upper one the 'designer ' and this one here in the middle that moves up and down is called the 'harrow '    the harrow   asked the explorer
he had not been listening very attentively  the glare of the sun in the shadeless valley was altogether too strong  it was difficult to collect one's thoughts
all the more did he admire the officer  who in spite of his tight fitting full dress uniform coat  amply befrogged and weighed down by epaulettes  was pursuing his subject with such enthusiasm and  besides talking  was still tightening a screw here and there with a spanner
as for the soldier  he seemed to be in much the same condition as the explorer
he had wound the prisoner's chain around both his wrists  propped himself on his rifle  let his head hang  and was paying no attention to anything that did not surprise the explorer  for the officer was speaking french  and certainly neither the soldier nor the prisoner understood a word of french
it was all the more remarkable  therefore  that the prisoner was nonetheless making an effort to follow the officer's explanations
with a kind of drowsy persistence he directed his gaze wherever the officer pointed a finger  and at the interruption of the explorer's question he  too  as well as the officer  looked around
 yes  the harrow   said the officer   a good name for it
the needles are set in like the teeth of a harrow and the whole thing works something like a harrow  although its action is limited to one place and contrived with much more artistic skill
anyhow  you'll soon understand it
on the bed here the condemned man is laid    i'm going to describe the apparatus first before i set it in motion
then you'll be able to follow the proceedings better
besides  one of the cogwheels in the designer is badly worn  it creaks a lot when it's working  you can hardly hear yourself speak  spare parts  unfortunately  are difficult to get here
   well  here is the bed  as i told you
it is completely covered with a layer of cotton wool  you'll find out why later
on this cotton wool the condemned man is laid  face down  quite naked  of course  here are straps for the hands  here for the feet  and here for the neck  to bind him fast
here at the head of the bed  where the rnan  as i said  first lays down his face  is this little gag of felt  which can be easily regulated to go straight into his mouth
it is meant to keep him from screaming and biting his tongue
of course the man is forced to take the felt into his mouth  for otherwise his neck would be broken by the strap    is that cotton wool   asked the explorer  bending forward
 yes  certainly   said the officer  with a smile   feel it for yourself   he took the explorer's hand and guided it over the bed
 it's specially prepared cotton wool  that's why it looks so different  i'll tell you presently what it's for   the explorer already felt a dawning interest in the apparatus  he sheltered his eyes from the sun with one hand and gazed up at the structure
it was a huge affair
the bed and the designer were of the same size and looked like two dark wooden chests
the designer hung about two meters above the bed  each of them was bound at the corners with four rods of brass that almost flashed out rays in the sunlight
between the chests shuttled the harrow on a ribbon of steel
the officer had scarcely noticed the explorer's previous indifference  but he was now well aware of his dawning interest  so he stopped explaining in order to leave a space of time for quiet observation
the condemned man imitated the explorer  since he could not use a hand to shelter his eyes he gazed upwards without shade
 well  the man lies down   said the explorer  leaning back in his chair and crossing his legs
 yes   said the officer  pushing his cap back a little and passing one hand over his heated face   now listen  both the bed and the designer have an electric battery each  the bed needs one for itself  the designer for the harrow
as soon as the man is strapped down  the bed is set in motion
it quivers in minute  very rapid vibrations  both from side to side and up and down
you will have seen similar apparatus in hospitals  but in our bed the movements are all precisely calculated  you see  they have to correspond very exactly to the movements of the harrow
and the harrow is the instrument for the actual execution of the sentence    and how does the sentence run   asked the explorer
 you don't know that either   said the officer in amazement  and bit his lips
 forgive me if my explanations seem rather incoherent
i do beg your pardon
you see  the commandant always used to do the explaining  but the new commandant shirks this duty  yet that such an important visitor     the explorer tried to deprecate the honor with both hands  the officer  however  insisted     that such an important visitor should not even be told about the kind of sentence we pass is a new development  which     he was just on the point of using strong language but checked himself and said only   i was not informed  it is not my fault in any case  i am certainly the best person to explain our procedure  since i have here     he patted his breast pocket     the relevant drawings made by our former commandant    the commandant's own drawings   asked the explorer
 did he combine everything in himself  then  was he soldier  judge  mechanic  chemist  and draughtsman    indeed he was   said the officer  nodding assent  with a remote  glassy look then he inspected his hands critically  they did not seem clean enough to him for touching the drawings  so he went over to the bucket and washed them again
then he drew out a small leather wallet and said   our sentence does not sound severe
whatever commandment the prisoner has disobeyed is written upon his body by the harrow
this prisoner  for instance     the officer indicated the man     will have written on his body  honor thy superiors    the explorer glanced at the man  he stood  as the officer pointed him out  with bent head  apparently listening with all his ears in an effort to catch what was being said
yet the movement of his blubber lips  closely pressed together  showed clearly that he could not understand a word
many questions were troubling the explorer  but at the sight of the prisoner he asked only   does he know his sentence    no   said the officer  eager to go on with his exposition  but the explorer interrupted him   he doesn't know the sentence that has been passed on him    no   said the officer again  pausing a moment as if to let the explorer elaborate his question  and then said   there would be no point in telling him
he'll learn it on his body   the explorer intended to make no answer  but he felt the prisoner's gaze turned on him  it seemed to ask if he approved such goings on
so he bent forward again  having already leaned back in his chair  and put another question   but surely he knows that he has been sentenced    nor that either   said the officer  smiling at the explorer as if expecting him to make further surprising remarks
 no   said the explorer  wiping his forehead   then he can't know either whether his defense was effective    he has had no chance of putting up a defense   said the officer  turning his eyes away as if speaking to himself and so sparing the explorer the shame of hearing self evident matters explained  but he must have had some chance of defending himself   said the explorer  and rose from his seat the officer realized that he was in danger of having his exposition of the apparatus held up for a long time  so he went up to the explorer  took him by the arm  waved a hand toward the condemned man  who was standing very straight now that he had so obviously become the center of attention    the soldier had also given the chain a jerk    and said   this is how the matter stands
i have been appointed judge in this penal colony
despite my youth
for i was the former commandant's assistant in all penal matters and know more about the apparatus than anyone
my guiding principle is this  guilt is never to be doubted
other courts cannot follow that principle  for they consist of several opinions and have higher courts to scrutinize them
that is not the case here  or at least  it was not the case in the former commandant's time
the new man has certainly shown some inclination to interfere with my judgments  but so far i have succeeded in fending him off and will go on succeeding
you wanted to have the case explained  it is quite simple  like all of them
a captain reported to me this morning that this man  who had been assigned to him as a servant and sleeps before his door  had been asleep on duty
it is his duty  you see  to get up every time the hour strikes and salute the captain's door
not an exacting duty  and very necessary  since he has to be a sentry as well as a servant  and must be alert in both functions
last night the captain wanted to see if the man was doing his duty
he opened the door as the clock struck two and there was his man curled up asleep
he took his riding whip and lashed him across the face
instead of getting up and begging pardon  the man caught hold of his master's legs  shook him  and cried  'throw that whip away or i'll eat you alive '    that's the evidence
the captain came to me an hour ago  i wrote down his statement and appended the sentence to it
then i had the man put in chains
that was all quite simple
if i had first called the man before me and interrogated him  things would have got into a confused tangle
he would have told lies  and had i exposed these lies he would have backed them up with more lies  and so on and so forth
as it is  i've got him and i won't let him go
   is that quite clear now  but we're wasting time  the execution should be beginning and i haven't finished explaining the apparatus yet   he pressed the explorer back into his chair  went up again to the apparatus  and began   as you see  the shape of the harrow corresponds to the human form  here is the harrow for the torso  here are the harrows for the legs
for the head there is only this one small spike
is that quite clear   he bent amiably forward toward the explorer  eager to provide the most comprehensive explanations
the explorer considered the harrow with a frown
the explanation of the judicial procedure had not satisfied him
he had to remind himself that this was in any case a penal colony where extraordinary measures were needed and that military discipline must be enforced to the last he also felt that some hope might be set on the new commandant  who was apparently of a mind to bring in  although gradually  a new kind of procedure which the officer's narrow mind was incapable of understanding
this train of thought prompted his next question   will the commandant attend the execution    it is not certain   said the officer  wincing at the direct question  and his friendly expression darkened
 that is just why we have to lose no time
much as i dislike it  i shall have to cut my explanations short
but of course tomorrow  when the apparatus has been cleaned    its one drawback is that it gets so messy    i can recapitulate all the details
for the present  then  only the essentials
   when the man lies down on the bed and it begins to vibrate  the harrow is lowered onto his body
it regulates itself automatically so that the needles barely touch his skin  once contact is made the steel ribbon stiffens immediately into a rigid band
and then the performance begins
an ignorant onlooker would see no difference between one punishment and another
the harrow appears to do its work with uniform regularity
as it quivers  its points pierce the skin of the body which is itself quivering from the vibration of the bed
so that the actual progress of the sentence can be watched  the harrow is made of glass
getting the needles fixed in the glass was a technical problem  but after many experiments we overcame the difficulty
no trouble was too great for us to take  you see
and now anyone can look through the glass and watch the inscription taking form on the body
wouldn't you care to come a little nearer and have a look at the needles   the explorer got up slowly  walked across  and bent over the harrow
 you see   said the officer   there are two kinds of needles arranged in multiple patterns
each long needle has a short one beside it
the long needle does the writing  and the short needle sprays a jet of water to wash away the blood and keep the inscription clear
blood and water together are then conducted here through small runnels into this main runnel and down a waste pipe into the pit   with his finger the officer traced the exact course taken by the blood and water
to make the picture as vivid as possible he held both hands below the outlet of the waste pipe as if to catch the outflow  and when he did this the explorer drew back his head and feeling behind him with one hand sought to return to his chair
to his horror he found that the condemned man too had obeyed the officer's invitation to examine the harrow at close quarters and had followed him
he had pulled forward the sleepy soldier with the chain and was bending over the glass
one could see that his uncertain eyes were trying to perceive what the two gentlemen had been looking at  but since he had not understood the explanation he could not make head or tail of it
he was peering this way and that way
he kept running his eyes along the glass
the explorer wanted to drive him away  since what he was doing was probably culpable
but the officer firmly restrained the explorer with one hand and with the other took a clod of earth from the rampart and threw it at the soldier
he opened his eyes with a jerk  saw what the condemned man had dared to do  let his rifle fall  dug his heels into the ground  dragged his prisoner back so that he stumbled and fell immediately  and then stood looking down at him  watching him struggling and rattling in his chains
 set him on his feet   yelled the officer  for he noticed that the explorer's attention was being too much distracted by the prisoner
in fact he was even leaning right across the harrow  without taking any notice of it  intent only on finding out what was happening to the prisoner
 be careful with him   cried the officer again
he ran around the apparatus  himself caught the condemned man under the shoulders  and with the soldier's help got him up on his feet  which kept slithering from under him  now i know all about it   said the explorer as the officer came back to him
 all except the most important thing   he answered  seizing the explorer's arm and pointing upwards   in the designer are all the cogwheels that control the movements of the harrow  and this machinery is regulated according to the inscription demanded by the sentence
i am still using the guiding plans drawn by the former commandant
here they are     he extracted some sheets from the leather wallet     but i'm sorry i can't let you handle them  they are my most precious possessions
just take a seat and i'll hold them in front of you like this  then you'll be able to see everything quite well   he spread out the first sheet of paper
the explorer would have liked to say something appreciative  but all he could see was a labyrinth of lines crossing and recrossing each other  which covered the paper so thickly that it was difficult to discern the blank spaces between them
 read it   said the officer
 i can't   said the explorer
 yet it's clear enough   said the officer
 it's very ingenious   said the explorer evasively   but i can't make it out    yes   said the officer with a laugh  putting the paper away again   it's no calligraphy for school children
it needs to be studied closely
i'm quite sure that in the end you would understand it too
of course the script can't be a simple one  it's not supposed to kill a man straight off  but only after an interval of  on an average  twelve hours  the turning point is reckoned to come at the sixth hour
so there have to be lots and lots of flourishes around the actual script  the script itself runs around the body only in a narrow girdle  the rest of the body is reserved for the embellishments
can you appreciate now the work accomplished by the harrow and the whole apparatus     just watch it   he ran up the ladder  turned a wheel  called down   look out  keep to one side   and everything started working
if the wheel had not creaked  it would have been marvelous
the officer  as if surprised by the noise of the wheel  shook his fist at it  then spread out his arms in excuse to the explorer  and climbed down rapidly to peer at the working of the machine from below something perceptible to no one save himself was still not in order  he clambered up again  did something with both hands in the interior of the designer  then slid down one of the rods  instead of using the ladder  so as to get down quicker  and with the full force of his lungs  to make himself heard at all in the noise  yelled in the explorer's ear   can you follow it  the harrow is beginning to write  when it finishes the first draft of the inscription on the man's back  the layer of cotton wool begins to roll and slowly turns the body over  to give the harrow fresh space for writing meanwhile the raw part that has been written on lies on the cotton wool  which is specially prepared to staunch the bleeding and so makes all ready for a new deepening of the script
then these teeth at the edge of the harrow  as the body turns further around  tear the cotton wool away from the wounds  throw it into the pit  and there is more work for the harrow
so it keeps on writing deeper and deeper for the whole twelve hours
the first six hours the condemned man stays alive almost as before  he suffers only pain
after two hours the felt gag is taken away  for he has no longer strength to scream
here  into this electrically heated basin at the head of the bed  some warm rice pap is poured  from which the man  if he feels like it  can take as much as his tongue can lap
not one of them ever misses the chance
i can remember none  and my experience is extensive
only about the sixth hour does the man lose all desire to eat
i usually kneel down here at that moment and observe what happens
the man rarely swallows his last mouthful  he only rolls it around his mouth and spits it out into the pit
i have to duck just then or he would spit it in my face
but how quiet he grows at just about the sixth hour  enlightenment comes to the most dull witted
it begins around the eyes
from there it radiates
a moment that might tempt one to get under the harrow oneself
nothing more happens than that the man begins to understand the inscription  he purses his mouth as if he were listening
you have seen how difficult it is to decipher the script with one's eyes  but our man deciphers it with his wounds
to be sure  that is a hard task  he needs six hours to accomplish it
by that time the harrow has pierced him quite through and casts him into the pit  where he pitches down upon the blood and water and the cotton wool
then the judgment has been fulfilled  and we  the soldier and i  bury him   the explorer had inclined his ear to the officer and with his hands in his jacket pockets watched the machine at work
the condemned man watched it too  but uncomprehendingly
he bent forward a little and was intent on the moving needles when the soldier  at a sign from the officer  slashed through his shirt and trousers from behind with a knife  so that they fell off  he tried to catch at his falling clothes to cover his nakedness  but the soldier lifted him into the air and shook the last remnants from him
the officer stopped the machine  and in the sudden silence the condemned man was laid under the harrow
the chains were loosened and the straps fastened on instead  in the first moment that seemed almost a relief to the prisoner
and now the harrow was adjusted a little lower  since he was a thin man
when the needle points touched him a shudder ran over his skin  while the soldier was busy strapping his right hand  he flung out his left hand blindly  but it happened to be in the direction toward where the explorer was standing
the officer kept watching the explorer sideways  as if seeking to read from his face the impression made on him by the execution  which had been at least cursorily explained to him
the wrist strap broke  probably the soldier had drawn it too tight
the officer had to intervene  the soldier held up the broken piece of strap to show him
so the officer went over to him and said  his face still turned toward the explorer   this is a very complex machine  it can't be helped that things are breaking or giving way here and there  but one must not thereby allow oneself to be diverted in one's general judgment
in any case  this strap is easily made good  i shall simply use a chain  the delicacy of the vibrations for the right arm will of course be a little impaired   and while he fastened the chains  he added   the resources for maintaining the machine are now very much reduced
under the former commandant i had free access to a sum of money set aside entirely for this purpose
there was a store  too  in which spare parts were kept for repairs of all kinds
i confess i have been almost prodigal with them  i mean in the past  not now as the new commandant pretends  always looking for an excuse to attack our old way of doing things
now he has taken charge of the machine money himself  and if i send for a new strap they ask for the broken old strap as evidence  and the new strap takes ten days to appear and then is of shoddy material and not much good but how i am supposed to work the machine without a strap  that's something nobody bothers about   the explorer thought to himself  it's always a ticklish matter to intervene decisively in other people's affairs he was neither a member of the penal colony nor a citizen of the state to which it belonged
were he to denounce this execution or actually try to stop it  they could say to him  you are a foreigner  mind your own business
he could make no answer to that  unless he were to add that he was amazed at himself in this connection  for he traveled only as an observer  with no intention at all of altering other people's methods of administering justice yet here he found himself strongly tempted the injustice of the procedure and the inhumanity of the execution were undeniable
no one could suppose that he had any selfish interest in the matter  for the condemned man was a complete stranger  not a fellow countryman or even at all sympathetic to him
the explorer himself had recommendations from high quarters  had been received here with great courtesy  and the very fact that he had been invited to attend the execution seemed to suggest that his views would be welcome and this was all the more likely since the commandant  as he had heard only too plainly  was no upholder of the procedure and maintained an attitude almost of hostility to the officer
at that moment the explorer heard the officer cry out in rage
he had just  with considerable difficulty  forced the felt gag into the condemned man's mouth when the man in an irresistible access of nausea shut his eyes and vomited
hastily the officer snatched him away from the gag and tried to hold his head over the pit  but it was too late  the vomit was running all over the machine
 it's all the fault of that commandant   cried the officer  senselessly shaking the brass rods in front   the machine is befouled like a pigsty   with trembling hands he indicated to the explorer what had happened
 have i not tried for hours at a time to get the commandant to understand that the prisoner must fast for a whole day before the execution
but our new  mild doctrine thinks otherwise
the commandant's ladies stuff the man with sugar candy before he's led off
he has lived on stinking fish his whole life long and now he has to eat sugar candy  but it could still be possible  i should have nothing to say against it  but why won't they get me a new felt gag  which i have been begging for the last three months
how should a man not feel sick when he takes a felt gag into his mouth which more than a hundred men have already slobbered and gnawed in their dying moments   the condemned man had laid his head down and looked peaceful  the soldier was busy trying to clean the machine with the prisoner's shirt
the officer advanced toward the explorer who in some vague presentiment fell back a pace  but the officer seized him by the hand  and drew him to one side
 i should like to exchange a few words with you in confidence   he said   may i    of course   said the explorer  and listened with downcast eyes
 this procedure and method of execution  which you are now having the opportunity to admire  has at the moment no longer any open adherents in our colony
i am its sole advocate  and at the same time the sole advocate of the old commandant's tradition
i can no longer reckon on any further extension of the method  it takes all my energy to maintain it as it is
during the old commandant's lifetime the colony was full of his adherents  his strength of conviction i still have in some measure  but not an atom of his power  consequently the adherents have skulked out of sight  there are still many of them but none of them will admit it
if you were to go into the teahouse today  on execution day  and listen to what is being said  you would perhaps hear only ambiguous remarks
these would all be made by adherents  but under the present commandant and his present doctrines they are of no use to me
and now i ask you  because of this commandant and the women who influence him  is such a piece of work  the work of a lifetime     he pointed to the machine     to perish  ought one to let that happen  even if one has only come as a stranger to our island for a few days  but there's no time to lose  an attack of some kind is impending on my function as judge  conferences are already being held in the commandant's office from which i am excluded  even your coming here today seems to me a significant move  they are cowards and use you as a screen  you  a stranger    how different an execution was in the old days  a whole day before the ceremony the valley was packed with people  they all came only to look on  early in the morning the commandant appeared with his ladies  fanfares roused the whole camp  i reported that everything was in readiness  the assembled company    no high official dared to absent himself    arranged itself around the machine  this pile of cane chairs is a miserable survival from that epoch the machine was freshly cleaned and glittering  i got new spare parts for almost every execution
before hundreds of spectators    all of them standing on tiptoe as far as the heights there    the condemned man was laid under the harrow by the commandant himself what is left today for a common soldier to do was then my task  the task of the presiding judge  and was an honor for me
and then the execution began  no discordant noise spoiled the working of the machine
many did not care to watch it but lay with closed eyes in the sand  they all knew  now justice is being done
in the silence one heard nothing but the condemned man's sighs  half muffled by the felt gag
nowadays the machine can no longer wring from anyone a sigh louder than the felt gag can stifle  but in those days the writing needles let drop an acid fluid  which we're no longer permitted to use
well  and then came the sixth hour  it was impossible to grant all the requests to be allowed to watch it from nearby
the commandant in his wisdom ordained that the children should have the preference  i  of course  because of my office had the privilege of always being at hand  often enough i would be squatting there with a small child in either arm
how we all absorbed the look of transfiguration on the face of the sufferer  how we bathed our cheeks in the radiance of that justice  achieved at last and fading so quickly  what times these were  my comrade   the officer had obviously forgotten whom he was addressing  he had embraced the explorer and laid his head on his shoulder the explorer was deeply embarrassed  impatiently he stared over the officer's head
the soldier had finished his cleaning job and was now pouring rice pap from a pot into the basin
as soon as the condemned man  who seemed to have recovered entirely  noticed this action he began to reach for the rice with his tongue
the soldier kept pushing him away  since the rice pap was certainly meant for a later hour  yet it was just as unfitting that the soldier himself should thrust his dirty hands into the basin and eat out of it before the other's avid face the officer quickly pulled himself together  i didn't want to upset you   he said   i know it is impossible to make those days credible now
anyhow  the machine is still working and it is still effective in itself
it is effective in itself even though it stands alone in this valley
and the corpse still falls at the last into the pit with an incomprehensibly gentle wafting motion  even though there are no hundreds of people swarming around like flies as formerly
in those days we had to put a strong fence around the pit  it has long since been torn down   the explorer wanted to withdraw his face from the officer and looked around him at random
the officer thought he was surveying the valley's desolation  so he seized him by the hands  turned him around to meet his eyes  and asked   do you realize the shame of it   but the explorer said nothing
the officer left him alone for a little  with legs apart  hands on hips  he stood very still  gazing at the ground
then he smiled encouragingly at the explorer and said   i was quite near you yesterday when the commandant gave you the invitation
i heard him giving it
i know the commandant
i divined at once what he was after
although he is powerful enough to take measures against me  he doesn't dare to do it yet  but he certainly means to use your verdict against me  the verdict of an illustrious foreigner
he has calculated it carefully  this is your second day on the island  you did not know the old commandant and his ways  you are conditioned by european ways of thought  perhaps you object on principle to capital punishment in general and to such mechanical instruments of death in particular  besides you will see that the execution has no support from the public  a shabby ceremony    carried out with a machine already somewhat old and worn now  taking all that into consideration  would it not be likely (so thinks the commandant) that you might disapprove of my methods  and if you disapprove  you wouldn't conceal the fact (i'm still speaking from the commandant's point of view)  for you are a man to feel confidence in your own well tried conclusions
true  you have seen and learned to appreciate the peculiarities of many peoples  and so you would not be likely to take a strong line against our proceedings  as you might do in your own country
but the commandant has no need of that
a casual  even an unguarded remark will be enough
it doesn't even need to represent what you really think  so long as it can be used speciously to serve his purpose
he will try to prompt you with sly questions  of that i am certain
and his ladies will sit around you and prick up their ears  you might be saying something like this  'in our country we have a different criminal procedure ' or 'in our country the prisoner is interrogated before he is sentenced ' or 'we haven't used torture since the middle ages ' all these statements are as true as they seem natural to you  harmless remarks that pass no judgment on my methods
but how would the commandant react to them  i can see him  our good commandant  pushing his chair away immediately and rushing onto the balcony  i can see his ladies streaming out after him  i can hear his voice    the ladies call it a voice of thunder    well  and this is what he says  'a famous western investigator  sent out to study criminal procedure in all the countries of the world  has just said that our old tradition of administering justice is inhumane
such a verdict from such a personality makes it impossible for me to countenance these methods any longer
therefore from this very day i ordain

 ' and so on
you may want to interpose that you never said any such thing  that you never called my methods inhumane  on the contrary your profound experience leads you to believe they are most humane and most in consonance with human dignity  and you admire the machine greatly    but it will be too late  you won't even get onto the balcony  crowded as it will be with ladies  you may try to draw attention to yourself  you may want to scream out  but a lady's hand will close your lips    and i and the work of the old commandant will be done for   the explorer had to suppress a smile  so easy  then  was the task he had felt to be so difficult
he said evasively   you overestimate my influence  the commandant has read my letters of recommendation  he knows that i am no expert in criminal procedure
if i were to give an opinion  it would be as a private individual  an opinion no more influential than that of any ordinary person  and in any case much less influential than that of the commandant  who  i am given to understand  has very extensive powers in this penal colony
if his attitude to your procedure is as definitely hostile as you believe  then i fear the end of your tradition is at hand  even without any humble assistance from me   had it dawned on the officer at last  no  he still did not understand
he shook his head emphatically  glanced briefly around at the condemned man and the soldier  who both flinched away from the rice  came close up to the explorer  and without looking at his face but fixing his eye on some spot on his coat said in a lower voice than before   you don't know the commandant  you feel yourself    forgive the expression    a kind of outsider so far as all of us are concerned  yet  believe me  your influence cannot be rated too highly
i was simply delighted when i heard that you were to attend the execution all by yourself
the commandant arranged it to aim a blow at me  but i shall turn it to my advantage
without being distracted by lying whispers and contemptuous glances    which could not have been avoided had a crowd of people attended the execution    you have heard my explanations  seen the machine  and are now in course of watching the execution
you have doubtless already formed your own judgment  if you still have some small uncertainties the sight of the execution will resolve them
and now i make this request to you  help me against the commandant   the explorer would not let him go on
 how could i do that   he cried   it's quite impossible
i can neither help nor hinder you    yes  you can   the officer said
the explorer saw with a certain apprehension that the officer had clenched his fists
 yes  you can   repeated the officer  still more insistently
 i have a plan that is bound to succeed
you believe your influence is insufficient
i know that it is sufficient
but even granted that you are right  is it not necessary  for the sake of preserving this tradition  to try even what might prove insufficient  listen to my plan  then
the first thing necessary for you to carry it out is to be as reticent as possible today regarding your verdict on these proceedings
unless you are asked a direct question you must say nothing at all  but what you do say must be brief and general  let it be remarked that you would prefer not to discuss the matter  that you are out of patience with it  that if you are to let yourself go you would use strong language
i don't ask you to tell any lies  by no means  you should only give curt answers  such as  'yes  i saw the execution ' or 'yes  i had it explained to me ' just that  nothing more
there are grounds enough for any impatience you betray  although not such as will occur to the commandant
of course  he will mistake your meaning and interpret it to please himself that's what my plan depends on
tomorrow in the commandant's office there is to be a large conference of all the high administrative officials  the commandant presiding
of course the commandant is the kind of man to have turned these conferences into public spectacles
he has had a gallery built that is always packed with spectators
i am compelled to take part in the conferences  but they make me sick with disgust
now  whatever happens  you will certainly be invited to this conference  if you behave today as i suggest  the invitation will become an urgent request
but if for some mysterious reason you're not invited  you'll have to ask for an invitation  there's no doubt of your getting it then
so tomorrow you're sitting in the commandant's box with the ladies
he keeps looking up to make sure you're there
after various trivial and ridiculous matters  brought in merely to impress the audience    mostly harbor works  nothing but harbor works     our judicial procedure comes up for discussion too
if the commandant doesn't introduce it  or not soon enough  i'll see that it's mentioned
i'll stand up and report that today's execution has taken place
quite briefly  only a statement
such a statement is not usual  but i shall make it
the commandant thanks me  as always  with an amiable smile  and then he can't restrain himself  he seizes the excellent opportunity 'it has just been reported ' he will say  or words to that effect  'that an execution has taken place
i should like merely to add that this execution was witnessed by the famous explorer who has  as you all know  honored our colony so greatly by his visit to us
his presence at today's session of our conference also contributes to the importance of this occasion
should we not now ask the famous explorer to give us his verdict on our traditional mode of execution and the procedure that leads up to it ' of course there is loud applause  general agreement  i am more insistent than anyone
the commandant bows to you and says  'then in the name of the assembled company  i put the question to you ' and now you advance to the front of the box
lay your hands where everyone can see them  or the ladies will catch them and press your fingers
   and then at last you can speak out
i don't know how i'm going to endure the tension of waiting for that moment
don't put any restraint on yourself when you make your speech  publish the truth aloud  lean over the front of the box  shout  yes indeed  shout your verdict  your unshakable conviction  at the commandant
yet perhaps you wouldn't care to do that  it's not in keeping with your character  in your country perhaps people do these things differently  well  that's all right too  that will be quite as effective  don't even stand up  just say a few words  even in a whisper  so that only the officials beneath you will hear them  that will be quite enough  you don't even need to mention the lack of public support for the execution  the creaking wheel  the broken strap  the filthy gag of felt  no  i'll take all that upon me  and  believe me  if my indictment doesn't drive him out of the conference hall  it will force him to his knees to make the acknowledgment  old commandant  i humble myself before you
   that is my plan  will you help me to carry it out  but of course you are willing  what is more  you must   and the officer seized the explorer by both arms and gazed  breathing heavily  into his face he had shouted the last sentence so loudly that even the soldier and the condemned man were startled into attending  they had not understood a word but they stopped eating and looked over at the explorer  chewing their previous mouthfuls
from the very beginning the explorer had no doubt about what answer he must give  in his lifetime he had experienced too much to have any uncertainty here  he was fundamentally honorable and unafraid
and yet now  facing the soldier and the condemned man  he did hesitate  for as long as it took to draw one breath
at last  however  he said  as he had to   no   the officer blinked several times but did not turn his eyes away
 would you like me to explain   asked the explorer
the officer nodded wordlessly
 i do not approve of your procedure   said the explorer then   even before you took me into your confidence    of course i shall never in any circumstances betray your confidence    i was already wondering whether it would be my duty to intervene and whether my intervention would have the slightest chance of success i realized to whom i ought to turn  to the commandant  of course
you have made that fact even clearer  but without having strengthened my resolution  on the contrary  your sincere conviction has touched me  even though it cannot influence my judgment   the officer remained mute  turned to the machine  caught hold of a brass rod  and then  leaning back a little  gazed at the designer as if to assure himself that all was in order the soldier and the condemned man seemed to have come to some understanding  the condemned man was making signs to the soldier  difficult though his movements were because of the tight straps  the soldier was bending down to him  the condemned man whispered something and the soldier nodded
the explorer followed the officer and said   you don't know yet what i mean to do
i shall tell the commandant what i think of the procedure  certainly  but not at a public conference  only in private  nor shall i stay here long enough to attend any conference  i am going away early tomorrow morning  or at least embarking on my ship   it did not look as if the officer had been listening
 so you did not find the procedure convincing   he said to himself and smiled  as an old man smiles at childish nonsense and yet pursues his own meditations behind the smile  then the time has come   he said at last  and suddenly looked at the explorer with bright eyes that held some challenge  some appeal for cooperation
 the time for what   asked the explorer uneasily  but got no answer
 you are free   said the officer to the condemned man in the native tongue
the man did not believe it at first
 yes  you are set free   said the officer
for the first time the condemned man's face woke to real animation
was it true  was it only a caprice of the officer's  that might change again  had the foreign explorer begged him off  what was it  one could read these questions on his face
but not for long
whatever it might be  he wanted to be really free if he might  and he began to struggle so far as the harrow permitted him
 you'll burst my straps   cried the officer   lie still  we'll soon loosen them   and signing the soldier to help him  he set about doing so
the condemned man laughed wordlessly to himself  now he turned his face left toward the officer  now right toward the soldier  nor did he forget the explorer  draw him out   ordered the officer
because of the harrow this had to be done with some care
the condemned man had already torn himself a little in the back through his impatience from now on  however  the officer paid hardly any attention to him
he went up to the explorer  pulled out the small leather wallet again  turned over the papers in it  found the one he wanted  and showed it to the explorer
 read it   he said
 i can't   said the explorer   i told you before that i can't make out these scripts    try taking a close look at it   said the officer and came quite near to the explorer so that they might read it together
but when even that proved useless  he outlined the script with his little finger  holding it high above the paper as if the surface dared not be sullied by touch  in order to help the explorer to follow the script in that way
the explorer did make an effort  meaning to please the officer in this respect at least  but he was quite unable to follow
now the officer began to spell it  letter by letter  and then read out the words
  'be just ' is what is written there   he said   surely you can read it now   the explorer bent so close to the paper that the officer feared he might touch it and drew it farther away  the explorer made no remark  yet it was clear that he still could not decipher it
  'be just ' is what is written there   said the officer once more
 maybe   said the explorer   i am prepared to believe you    well  then   said the officer  at least partly satisfied  and climbed up the ladder with the paper  very carefully he laid it inside the designer and seemed to be changing the disposition of all the cogwheels  it was a troublesome piece of work and must have involved wheels that were extremely small  for sometimes the officer's head vanished altogether from sight inside the designer  so precisely did he have to regulate the machinery
the explorer  down below  watched the labor uninterruptedly  his neck grew stiff and his eyes smarted from the glare of sunshine over the sky
the soldier and the condemned man were now busy together
the man's shirt and trousers  which were already lying in the pit  were fished out by the point of the soldier's bayonet
the shirt was abominably dirty and its owner washed it in the bucket of water
when he put on the shirt and trousers both he and the soldier could not help guffawing  for the garments were of course slit up behind
perhaps the condemned man felt it incumbent on him to amuse the soldier  he turned around and around in his slashed garments before the soldier  who squatted on the ground beating his knees with mirth
all the same  they presently controlled their mirth out of respect for the gentlemen
when the officer had at length finished his task aloft  he surveyed the machinery in all its details once more  with a smile  but this time shut the lid of the designer  which had stayed open till now  climbed down  looked into the pit and then at the condemned man  noting with satisfaction that the clothing had been taken out  then went over to wash his hands in the water bucket  perceived too late that it was disgustingly dirty  was unhappy because he could not wash his hands  in the end thrust them into the sand    this alternative did not please him  but he had to put up with it    then stood upright and began to unbutton his uniform jacket
as he did this  the two ladies' handkerchiefs he had tucked under his collar fell into his hands
 here are your handkerchiefs   he said  and threw them to the condemned man
and to the explorer he said in explanation   a gift from the ladies   in spite of the obvious haste with which he was discarding first his uniform jacket and then all his clothing  he handled each garment with loving care  he even ran his fingers caressingly over the silver lace on the jacket and shook a tassel into place
this loving care was certainly out of keeping with the fact that as soon as he had a garment off he flung it at once with a kind of unwilling jerk into the pit
the last thing left to him was his short sword with the sword belt
he drew it out of the scabbard  broke it  then gathered all together  the bits of the sword  the scabbard  and the belt  and flung them so violently down that they clattered into the pit
now he stood naked there
the explorer bit his lips and said nothing
he knew very well what was going to happen  but he had no right to obstruct the officer in anything
if the judicial procedure which the officer cherished were really so near its end    possibly as a result of his own intervention  as to which he felt himself pledged     then the officer was doing the right thing  in his place the explorer would not have acted otherwise the soldier and the condemned man did not understand at first what was happening  at first they were not even looking on
the condemned man was gleeful at having got the handkerchiefs back  but he was not allowed to enjoy them for long  since the soldier snatched them with a sudden  unexpected grab
now the condemned man in turn was trying to twitch them from under the belt where the soldier had tucked them  but the soldier was on his guard
so they were wrestling  half in jest
only when the officer stood quite naked was their attention caught
the condemned man especially seemed struck with the notion that some great change was impending
what had happened to him was now going to happen to the officer
perhaps even to the very end
apparently the foreign explorer had given the order for it
so this was revenge
although he himself had not suffered to the end  he was to be revenged to the end a broad  silent grin now appeared on his face and stayed there all the rest of the time
the officer  however  had turned to the machine
it had been clear enough previously that he understood the machine well  but now it was almost staggering to see how he managed it and how it obeyed him
his hand had only to approach the harrow for it to rise and sink several times till it was adjusted to the right position for receiving him  he touched only the edge of the bed and already it was vibrating  the felt gag came to meet his mouth  one could see that the officer was really reluctant to take it but he shrank from it only a moment  soon he submitted and received it
everything was ready  only the straps hung down at the sides  yet they were obviously unnecessary  the officer did not need to be fastened down
then the condemned man noticed the loose straps  in his opinion the execution was incomplete unless the straps were buckled  he gestured eagerly to the soldier and they ran together to strap the officer down
the latter had already stretched out one foot to push the lever that started the designer  he saw the two men coming up  so he drew his foot back and let himself be buckled in but now he could not reach the lever  neither the soldier nor the condemned man would be able to find it  and the explorer was determined not to lift a finger it was not necessary  as soon as the straps were fastened the machine began to work  the bed vibrated  the needles flickered above the skin  the harrow rose and fell
the explorer had been staring at it quite a while before he remembered that a wheel in the designer should have been creaking  but everything was quiet  not even the slightest hum could be heard
because it was working so silently the machine simply escaped one's attention
the explorer observed the soldier and the condemned man
the latter was the more animated of the two  everything in the machine interested him  now he was bending down and now stretching up on tiptoe  his forefinger was extended all the time pointing out details to the soldier this annoyed the explorer
he was resolved to stay till the end  but he could not bear the sight of these two
 go back home   he said
the soldier would have been willing enough  but the condemned man took the order as a punishment
with clasped hands he implored to be allowed to stay  and when the explorer shook his head and would not relent  he even went down on his knees
the explorer saw that it was no use merely giving orders  he was on the point of going over and driving them away
at that moment he heard a noise above him in the designer
he looked up
was that cogwheel going to make trouble after all  but it was something quite different
slowly the lid of the designer rose up and then clicked wide open
the teeth of a cogwheel showed themselves and rose higher  soon the whole wheel was visible  it was as if some enormous force were squeezing the designer so that there was no longer room for the wheel  the wheel moved up till it came to the very edge of the designer  fell down  rolled along the sand a little on its rim  and then lay flat but a second wheel was already rising after it  followed by many others  large and small and indistinguishably minute  the same thing happened to all of them  at every moment one imagined the designer must now really be empty  but another complex of numerous wheels was already rising into sight  falling down  trundling along the sand  and lying flat
this phenomenon made the condemned man completely forget the explorer's command  the cogwheels fascinated him  he was always trying to catch one and at the same time urging the soldier to help  but always drew back his hand in alarm  for another wheel always came hopping along which  at least on its first advance  scared him off
the explorer  on the other hand  felt greatly troubled  the machine was obviously going to pieces  its silent working was a delusion  he had a feeling that he must now stand by the officer  since the officer was no longer able to look after himself but while the tumbling cogwheels absorbed his whole attention he had forgotten to keep an eye on the rest of the machine  now that the last cogwheel had left the designer  however  he bent over the harrow and had a new and still more unpleasant surprise
the harrow was not writing  it was only jabbing  and the bed was not turning the body over but only bringing it up quivering against the needles
the explorer wanted to do something  if possible  to bring the whole machine to a standstill  for this was no exquisite torture such as the officer desired  this was plain murder
he stretched out his hands but at that moment the harrow rose with the body spitted on it and moved to the side  as it usually did only when the twelfth hour had come
blood was flowing in a hundred streams  not mingled with water  the water jets too had failed to function and now the last action failed to fulfill itself  the body did not drop off the long needles  streaming with blood it went on hanging over the pit without falling into it
the harrow tried to move back to its old position  but as if it had itself noticed that it had not yet got rid of its burden it stuck after all where it was  over the pit
 come and help   cried the explorer to the other two  and himself seized the officer's feet he wanted to push against the feet while the others seized the head from the opposite side and so the officer might be slowly eased off the needles
but the other two could not make up their minds to come  the condemned man actually turned away  the explorer had to go over to them and force them into position at the officer's head
and here  almost against his will  he had to look at the face of the corpse
it was as it had been in life  no sign was visible of the promised redemption  what the others had found in the machine the officer had not found  the lips were firmly pressed together  the eyes were open  with the same expression as in life  the look was calm and convinced  through the forehead went the point of the great iron spike
as the explorer  with the soldier and the condemned man behind him  reached the first houses of the colony  the soldier pointed to one of them and said   there is the teahouse   in the ground floor of the house was a deep  low  cavernous space  its walls and ceiling blackened with smoke
it was open to the road all along its length
although this teahouse was very little different from the other houses of the colony  which were all very dilapidated  even up to the commandant's palatial headquarters  it made on the explorer the impression of a historic tradition of some kind  and he felt the power of past days
he went near to it  followed by his companions  right up between the empty tables that stood in the street before it  and breathed the cool  heavy air that came from the interior
 the old man's buried here   said the soldier   the priest wouldn't let him lie in the churchyard
nobody knew where to bury him for a while  but in the end they buried him here
the officer never told you about that  for sure  because of course that's what he was most ashamed of
he even tried several times to dig the old man up by night  but he was always chased away    where is the grave   asked the explorer  who found it impossible to believe the soldier
at once both of them  the soldier and the condemned man  ran before him pointing with outstretched hands in the direction where the grave should be they led the explorer right up to the back wall  where guests were sitting at a few tables
they were apparently dock laborers  strong men with short  glistening  full black beards
none had a jacket  their shirts were torn  they were poor  humble creatures
as the explorer drew near  some of them got up  pressed close to the wall  and stared at him
 it's a foreigner   ran the whisper around him   he wants to see the grave   they pushed one of the tables aside  and under it there was really a gravestone
it was a simple stone  low enough to be covered by a table
there was an inscription on it in very small letters  the explorer had to kneel down to read it
this was what it said   here rests the old commandant
his adherents  who now must be nameless  have dug this grave and set up this stone
there is a prophecy that after a certain number of years the commandant will rise again and lead his adherents from this house to recover the colony
have faith and wait   when the explorer had read this and risen to his feet he saw all the bystanders around him smiling  as if they too had read the inscription  had found it ridiculous  and were expecting him to agree with them
the explorer ignored this  distributed a few coins among them  waiting till the table was pushed over the grave again  quitted the teahouse  and made for the harbor
the soldier and the condemned man had found some acquaintances in the teahouse  who detained them
but they must have soon shaken them off  for the explorer was only halfway down the long flight of steps leading to the boats when they came rushing after him
probably they wanted to force him at the last minute to take them with him
while he was bargaining below with a ferryman to row him to the steamer  the two of them came headlong down the steps  in silence  for they did not dare to shout
but by the time they reached the foot of the steps the explorer was already in the boat  and the ferryman was just casting off from the shore
they could have jumped into the boat  but the explorer lifted a heavy knotted rope from the floor boards  threatened them with it  and so kept them from attempting the leap
the village schoolmaster [the giant mole] those  and i am one of them  who find even a small ordinary sized mole disgusting  would probably have died of disgust if they had seen the giant mole that a few years back was observed in the neighborhood of one of our villages  which achieved a certain transitory celebrity on account of the incident
today it has long since sunk back into oblivion again  and in that only shares the obscurity of the whole incident  which has remained quite inexplicable  but which people  it must be confessed  have also taken no great pains to explain  and as a result of an incomprehensible apathy in those very circles that should have concerned themselves with it  and who in fact have shown enthusiastic interest in far more trifling matters  the affair has been forgotten without ever being adequately investigated in any case  the fact that the village could not be reached by the railroad was no excuse
many people came from great distances out of pure curiosity  there were even foreigners among them  it was only those who should have shown something more than curiosity that refrained from coming
in fact  if a few quite simple people  people whose daily work gave them hardly a moment of leisure    if these people had not quite disinterestedly taken up the affair  the rumor of this natural phenomenon would probably have never spread beyond the locality
indeed  rumor itself  which usually cannot be held within bounds  was actually sluggish in this case  if it had not literally been given a shove it would not have spread
but even that was no valid reason for refusing to inquire into the affair  on the contrary this second phenomenon should have been investigated as well
instead the old village schoolmaster was left to write the sole account in black and white of the incident  and though he was an excellent man in his own profession  neither his abilities nor his equipment made it possible for him to produce an exhaustive description that could be used as a foundation by others  far less  therefore  an actual explanation of the occurrence
his little pamphlet was printed  and a good many copies were sold to visitors to the village about that time  it also received some public recognition  but the teacher was wise enough to perceive that his fragmentary labors  in which no one supported him  were basically without value
if in spite of that he did not relax in them  and made the question his lifework  though it naturally became more hopeless from year to year  that only shows on the one hand how powerful an effect the appearance of the giant mole was capable of producing  and on the other how much laborious effort and fidelity to his convictions may be found in an old and obscure village schoolmaster
but that he suffered deeply from the cold attitude of the recognized authorities is proved by a brief brochure with which he followed up his pamphlet several years later  by which time hardly anyone could remember what it was all about
in this brochure he complained of the lack of understanding that he had encountered in people where it was least to be expected  complaints that carried conviction less by the skill with which they were expressed than by their honesty
of such people he said very appositely   it is not i  but they  who talk like old village schoolmasters   and among other things he adduced the pronouncement of a scholar to whom he had gone expressly about his affair
the name of the scholar was not mentioned  but from various circumstances we could guess who it was after the teacher had managed with great difficulty to secure admittance  he perceived at once from the very way in which he was greeted that the savant had already acquired a rooted prejudice against the matter
the absentmindedness with which he listened to the long report which the teacher  pamphlet in hand  delivered to him  can be gauged from a remark that he let fall after a pause for ostensible reflection   the soil in your neighborhood is particularly black and rich
consequently it provides the moles with particularly rich nourishment  and so they grow to an unusual size    but not to such a size as that   exclaimed the teacher  and he measured off two yards on the wall  somewhat exaggerating the length of the mole in exasperation
 oh  and why not   replied the scholar  who obviously looked upon the whole affair as a great joke
with this verdict the teacher had to return to his home
he tells how his wife and six children were waiting for him by the roadside in the snow  and how he had to admit to them the final collapse of his hopes
when i read of the scholar's attitude toward the old man i was not yet acquainted with the teacher's pamphlet
but i at once resolved myself to collect and correlate all the information i could discover regarding the case
if i could not employ physical force against the scholar  i could at least write a defense of the teacher  or more exactly  of the good intentions of an honest but uninfluential man
i admit that i rued this decision later  for i soon saw that its execution was bound to involve me in a very strange predicament
on the one hand my own influence was far from sufficient to effect a change in learned or even public opinion in the teacher's favor  while on the other the teacher was bound to notice that i was less concerned with his main object  which was to prove that the giant mole had actually been seen  than to defend his honesty  which must naturally be self evident to him and in need of no defense
accordingly  what was bound to happen was this  i would be misunderstood by the teacher  though i wanted to collaborate with him  and instead of helping him i myself would probably require support  which was most unlikely to appear
besides  my decision would impose a great burden of work upon me
if i wanted to convince people i could not invoke the teacher  since he himself had not been able to convince them to read his pamphlet could only have led me astray  and so i refrained from reading it until i should have finished my own labors
more  i did not even get in touch with the teacher
true  he heard of my inquiries through intermediaries  but he did not know whether i was working for him or against him
in fact he probably assumed the latter  though he denied it later on  for i have proof of the fact that he put various obstacles in my way
it was quite easy for him to do that  for of course i was compelled to undertake anew all the inquiries he had already made  and so he could always steal a march on me
but that was the only objection that could be justly made to my method  an unavoidable reproach  but one that was palliated by the caution and self abnegation with which i drew my conclusions
but for the rest my pamphlet was quite uninfluenced by the teacher  perhaps on this point  indeed  i showed all too great a scrupulosity  from my words one might have thought nobody had ever inquired into the case before  and i was the first to interrogate those who had seen or heard of the mole  the first to correlate the evidence  the first to draw conclusions
when later i read the schoolmaster's pamphlet    it had a very circumstantial title   a mole  larger in size than ever seen before     i found that we actually did not agree on certain important points  though we both believed we had proved our main point  namely  the existence of the mole these differences prevented the establishment of the friendly relations with the schoolmaster that i had been looking forward to in spite of everything
on his side there developed a feeling almost of hostility
true  he was always modest and humble in his bearing toward me  but that only made his real feelings the more obvious
in other words  he was of the opinion that i had merely damaged his credit  and that my belief that i had been or could be of assistance to him was simplicity at best  but more likely presumption or artifice
he was particularly fond of saying that all his previous enemies had shown their hostility either not at all  or in private  or at most by word of mouth  while i had considered it necessary to have my censures straightway published
moreover  the few opponents of his who had really occupied themselves with the subject  if but superficially  had at least listened to his  the schoolmaster's  views before they had given expression to their own  while i  on the strength of unsystematically assembled and in part misunderstood evidence  had published conclusions which  even if they were correct as regarded the main point  must evoke incredulity  and among the public no less than the educated but the faintest hint that the existence of the mole was unworthy of credence was the worst thing that could happen in this case
to these reproaches  veiled as they were  i could easily have found an answer    for instance  that his own pamphlet achieved the very summit of the incredible    it was less easy  however  to make headway against his continual suspicion  and that was the reason why i was very reserved in my dealings with him
for in his heart he was convinced that i wanted to rob him of the fame of being the first man publicly to vindicate the mole
now of course he really enjoyed no fame whatever  but only an absurd notoriety that was shrinking more and more  and for which i had certainly no desire to compete
besides  in the foreword to my pamphlet i had expressly declared that the teacher must stand for all time as the discoverer of the mole    and he was not even that    and that only my sympathy with his unfortunate fate had spurred me on to write
 it is the aim of this pamphlet     so i ended up all too melodramatically  but it corresponded with my feelings at that time     to help in giving the schoolmaster's book the wide publicity it deserves
if i succeed in that  then may my name  which i regard as only transiently and indirectly associated with this question  be blotted from it at once   thus i disclaimed expressly any major participation in the affair  it was almost as if i had foreseen in some manner the teacher's unbelievable reproaches
nevertheless he found in that very passage a handle against me  and i do not deny that there was a faint show of justice in what he said or rather hinted  indeed i was often struck by the fact that he showed almost a keener penetration where i was concerned than he had done in his pamphlet
for he maintained that my foreword was doublefaced
if i was really concerned solely to give publicity to his pamphlet  why had i not occupied myself exclusively with him and his pamphlet  why had i not pointed out its virtues  its irrefutability  why had i not confined myself to insisting on the significance of the discovery and making that clear  why had i instead tackled the discovery itself  while completely ignoring the pamphlet  had not the discovery been made already  was there still anything left to be done in that direction  but if i really thought that it was necessary for me to make the discovery all over again  why had i disassociated myself from the discovery so solemnly in my foreword  one might put that down to false modesty  but it was something worse
i was trying to belittle the discovery  i was drawing attention to it merely for the purpose of depreciating it  while he on the other hand had inquired into and finally established it
perhaps the affair had sunk somewhat into desuetude  now i had made a noise about it again  but at the same time i had made the schoolmaster's position more difficult than ever
what did he care whether his honesty was vindicated or not  all that he was concerned with was the thing itself  and with that alone
but i was only of disservice to it  for i did not understand it  i did not prize it at its true value  i had no real feeling for it
it was infinitely above my intellectual capacity
he sat before me and looked at me  his old wrinkled face quite composed  and yet this was what he was thinking
yet it was not true that he was only concerned with the thing itself  actually he was very greedy for fame  and wanted to make money out of the business too  which  however  considering his large family  was very understandable
nevertheless my interest in the affair seemed so trivial compared with his own  that he felt he could claim to be completely disinterested without deviating very seriously from the truth
and indeed my inner doubts refused to be quite calmed by my telling myself that the man's reproaches were really due to the fact that he clung to his mole  so to speak  with both hands  and was bound to look upon anyone who laid even a finger on it as a traitor
for that was not true  his attitude was not to be explained by greed  or at any rate by greed alone  but rather by the touchiness which his great labors and their complete unsuccess had bred in him
yet even his touchiness did not explain everything
perhaps my interest in the affair was really too trivial
the schoolmaster was used to lack of interest in strangers
he regarded it as a universal evil  but no longer suffered from its individual manifestations
now a man had appeared who  strangely enough  took up the affair  and even he did not understand it
attacked from this side i can make no defense
i am no zoologist  yet perhaps i would have thrown myself into the case with my whole heart if i had discovered it  but i had not discovered it
such a gigantic mole is certainly a prodigy  yet one cannot expect the continuous and undivided attention of the whole world to be accorded it  particularly if its existence is not completely and irrefutably established  and in any case it cannot be produced
and i admit too that even if i had been the discoverer i would probably never have come forward so gladly and voluntarily in defense of the mole as i had in that of the schoolmaster
now the misunderstanding between me and the schoolmaster would probably have quickly cleared up if my pamphlet had achieved success
but success was not forthcoming
perhaps the book was not well enough written  not persuasive enough  i am a businessman  it may be that the composition of such a pamphlet was still further beyond my limited powers than those of the teacher  though in the kind of knowledge required i was greatly superior to him
besides  my unsuccess may be explicable in other ways  the time at which the pamphlet appeared may have been inauspicious
the discovery of the mole  which had failed to penetrate to a wide public at the time it took place  was not so long past on the one hand as to be completely forgotten  and thus capable of being brought alive again by my pamphlet  while on the other hand enough time had elapsed quite to exhaust the trivial interest that had originally existed
those who took my pamphlet at all seriously told themselves  in that bored tone which from the first had characterized the debate  that now the old useless labors on this wearisome question were to begin all over again  and some even confused my pamphlet with the schoolmaster's in a leading agricultural journal appeared the following comment  fortunately at the very end  and in small print   the pamphlet on the giant mole has once more been sent to us
years ago we remember having had a hearty laugh over it
since then it has not become more intelligible  nor we more hard of understanding
but we simply refuse to laugh at it a second time
instead  we would ask our teaching associations whether more useful work cannot be found for our village schoolmasters than hunting out giant moles   an unpardonable confusion of identity
they had read neither the first nor the second pamphlet  and the two perfunctorily scanned expressions   giant mole  and  village schoolmaster   were sufficient for these gentlemen  as representatives of publicly esteemed interest  to pronounce on the subject
against this attack measures might have been attempted and with success  but the lack of understanding between the teacher and myself kept me from venturing upon them
i tried instead to keep the review from his knowledge as long as i could
but he very soon discovered it  as i recognized from a sentence in one of his letters  in which he announced his intention of visiting me for the christmas holidays
he wrote   the world is full of malice  and people smooth the path for it   by which he wished to convey that i was one of the malicious  but  not content with my own innate malice  wished also to make the world's path smooth for it  in other words  was acting in such a way as to arouse the general malice and help it to victory
well  i summoned the resolution i required  and was able to await him calmly  and calmly greet him when he arrived  this time a shade less polite in his bearing than usual  he carefully drew out the journal from the breast pocket of his old fashioned padded overcoat  and opening it handed it to me
 i've seen it   i replied  handing the journal back unread
 you've seen it   he said with a sigh  he had the old teacher's habit of repeating the other person's answers
 of course i won't take this lying down   he went on  tapping the journal excitedly with his finger and glancing up sharply at me  as if i were of a different mind  he certainly had some idea of what i was about to say  for i think i have noticed  not so much from his words as from other indications  that he often has a genuine intuition of my intentions  though he never yields to them but lets himself be diverted what i said to him i can set down almost word for word  for i made a note of it shortly after our interview
 do what you like   i said   our ways part from this moment
i fancy that that is neither unexpected nor unwelcome news to you
the review in this journal is not the real reason for my decision  it has merely finally confirmed it
the real reason is this  originally i thought my intervention might be of some use to you  while now i cannot but recognize that i have damaged you in every direction
why it has turned out so i cannot say  the causes of success and unsuccess are always ambiguous  but don't look for the sole explanation in my shortcomings
consider  you too had the best intentions  and yet  if one regards the matter objectively  you failed
i don't intend it as a joke  for it would be a joke against myself  when i say that your connection with me must unfortunately be counted among your failures
it is neither cowardice nor treachery  if i withdraw from the affair now
actually it involves a certain degree of self renunciation  my pamphlet itself proves how much i respect you personally  in a certain sense you have become my teacher  and i have almost grown fond of the mole itself
nevertheless i have decided to step aside  you are the discoverer  and all that i can do is to prevent you from gaining possible fame  while i attract failure and pass it on to you
at least that is your own opinion
enough of that
the sole expiation that i can make is to beg your forgiveness and  should you require it  to publish openly  that is  in this journal  the admission i have just made to you   these were my words  they were not entirely sincere  but what was sincere in them was obvious enough
my explanation had the effect upon him that i had roughly anticipated
most old people have something deceitful  something mendacious  in their dealings with people younger than themselves  you live at peace with them  imagine you are on the best of terms with them  know their ruling prejudices  receive continual assurances of amity  take the whole thing for granted  and when something decisive happens and those peaceful relations  so long nourished  should come into effective operation  suddenly these old people rise before you like strangers  show that they have deeper and stronger convictions  and now for the first time literally unfurl their banner  and with terror you read upon it the new decree the reason for this terror lies chiefly in the fact that what the old say now is really far more just and sensible than what they had said before  it is as if even the self evident had degrees of validity  and their words now were more self evident than ever
but the final deceit that lies in their words consists in this  that at bottom they have always said what they are saying now
i must have probed deeply into the schoolmaster  seeing that his next words did not entirely take me by surprise
 child   he said  laying his hand on mine and patting it gently   how did you ever take it into your head to go into this affair  the very first i heard of it i talked it over with my wife   he pushed his chair back from the table  got up  spread out his arms  and stared at the floor  as if his tiny little wife were standing there and he were speaking to her   'we've struggled on alone ' i said to her  'for many years  now  it seems  a noble protector has risen for us in the city  a fine businessman  mr so and so we should congratulate ourselves  shouldn't we  a businessman in the city isn't to be sniffed at  when an ignorant peasant believes us and says so it doesn't help us  for what a peasant may say or do is of no account  whether he says the old village schoolmaster is right  or spits to show his contempt  the net result is the same
and if instead of one peasant ten thousand should stand up for us  the result  if possible  would only be still worse
a businessman in the city  on the other hand  that's something else again  a man like that has connections  things he says in passing  as it were  are taken up and repeated  new patrons interest themselves in the question  one of them  it may be  remarks  you can learn even from old village schoolmasters  and next day whole crowds of people are saying it to one another  people you would never imagine saying such things  to look at them next  money is found to finance the business  one gentleman goes around collecting for it and the others shower subscriptions on him  they decide that the village schoolmaster must be dragged from his obscurity  they arrive  they don't bother about his external appearance  but take him to their bosoms  and since his wife and children hang onto him  they are taken along too have you ever watched city people  they chatter without stopping
when there's a whole lot of them together you can hear their chatter running from right to left and back again  and up and down  this way and that
and so  chattering away  they push us into the coach  so that we've hardly time to bow to everybody
the gentleman on the coachman's seat puts his glasses straight  flourishes his whip  and off we go
they all wave a parting greeting to the village  as if we were still there and not sitting among them
the more impatient city people drive out in carriages to meet us
as we approach they get up from their seats and crane their necks
the gentleman who collected the money arranges everything methodically and in order
when we drive into the city we are a long procession of carriages
we think the public welcome is over  but it really only begins when we reach our hotel
in a city an announcement attracts a great many people
what interests one interests all the rest immediately
they take their views from one another and promptly make those views their own
all the people who haven't managed to drive out and meet us in carriages are waiting in front of the hotel  others could have driven out  but they were too self conscious
they're waiting too
it's extraordinary  the way that the gentleman who collected the money keeps his eye on everything and directs everything '   i had listened coolly to him  indeed i had grown cooler and cooler while he went on
on the table i had piled up all the copies of my pamphlet in my possession
only a few were missing  for during the past week i had sent out a circular demanding the return of all the copies distributed  and had received most of them back
true  from several quarters i had got very polite notes saying that so and so could not remember having received such a pamphlet  and that  if it had actually arrived  he was sorry to confess that he must have lost it
even that was gratifying  in my heart i desired nothing better
only one reader begged me to let him keep the pamphlet as a curiosity  pledging himself  in accordance with the spirit of my circular  to show it to no one for twenty years the village teacher had not yet seen my circular
i was glad that his words made it so easy for me to show it to him
i could do that without anxiety in any case  however  as i had drawn it up very circumspectly  keeping his interests in mind the whole time the crucial passage in the circular ran as follows   i do not ask for the return of the pamphlet because i retract in any way the opinions defended there or wish them to be regarded as erroneous or even undemonstrable on any point
my request has purely personal and moreover very urgent grounds  but no conclusion whatever must be drawn from it as regards my attitude to the whole matter
i beg the village schoolmaster to draw your particular attention to this  and would be glad also if you would make the fact better known   for the time being i kept my hand over the circular and said   you reproach me in your heart because things have not turned out as you hoped
why do that  don't let us embitter our last moments together
and do try to see that  though you've made a discovery  it isn't necessarily greater than every other discovery  and consequently the injustice you suffer under any greater than other injustices
i don't know the ways of learned societies  but i can't believe that in the most favorable circumstances you would have been given a reception even remotely resembling the one you seem to have described to your wife while i myself still hoped that something might come of my pamphlet  the most i expected was that perhaps the attention of a professor might be drawn to our case  that he might commission some young student to inquire into it  that this student might visit you and check in his own fashion your and my inquiries once more on the spot  and that finally  if the results seemed to him worth consideration    we must not forget that all young students are full of skepticism    he might bring out a pamphlet of his own in which your discoveries would be put on a scientific basis
all the same  even if that hope had been realized nothing very much would have been achieved
the student's pamphlet  supporting such queer opinions  would probably be held up to ridicule
if you take this agricultural journal as a sample  you can see how easily that may happen  and scientific periodicals are still more ruthless in such matters
and that's quite understandable  professors bear a great responsibility toward themselves  toward science  toward posterity  they can't take every new discovery to their bosoms straight away we others have the advantage of them there
but i'll leave that out of account and assume that the student's pamphlet has found acceptance
what would happen next  you would probably receive honorable mention  and that might perhaps benefit your profession too  people would say  'our village schoolmasters have sharp eyes'  and this journal  if journals have a memory or a conscience  would be forced to make you a public apology  also some well intentioned professor would be found to secure a scholarship for you  it's possible they might even get you to come to the city  find a post for you in some school  and so give you a chance of using the scientific resources of a city so as to improve yourself
but if i am to be quite frank  i think they would content themselves with merely trying to do all this they would summon you and you would appear  but only as an ordinary petitioner like hundreds of others  and not in solemn state  they would talk to you and praise your honest efforts  but they would see at the same time that you were an old man  that it was hopeless for anyone to begin to study science at such an age  and moreover that you had hit upon your discovery more by chance than by design  and had besides no ambition to extend your labors beyond this one case
for these reasons they would probably send you back to your village again
your discovery  of course  would be carried further  for it is not so trifling that  once having achieved recognition  it could be forgotten again
but you would not hear much more about it  and what you heard you would scarcely understand
every new discovery is assumed at once into the sum total of knowledge  and with that ceases in a sense to be a discovery  it dissolves into the whole and disappears  and one must have a trained scientific eye even to recognize it after that
for it is related to fundamental axioms of whose existence we don't even know  and in the debates of science it is raised on these axioms into the very clouds how can we expect to understand such things  often as we listen to some learned discussion we may be under the impression that it is about your discovery  when it is about something quite different  and the next time  when we think it is about something else  and not about your discovery at all  it may turn out to be about that and that alone
 don't you see that  you would remain in your village  you would be able with the extra money to feed and clothe your family a little better  but your discovery would be taken out of your hands  and without your being able with any show of justice to object  for only in the city could it be given its final seal
and people wouldn't be altogether ungrateful to you  they might build a little museum on the spot where the discovery was made  it would become one of the sights of the village  you would be given the keys to keep  and  so that you shouldn't lack some outward token of honor  they could give you a little medal to wear on the breast of your coat  like those worn by attendants in scientific institutions
all this might have been possible  but was it what you wanted   without stopping to consider his answer he turned on me and said   and so that's what you wanted to achieve for me    probably   i said   i didn't consider what i was doing carefully enough at the time to be able to answer that clearly now
i wanted to help you  but that was a failure  and the worst failure i have ever had
that's why i want to withdraw now and undo what i've done as far as i'm able    well and good   said the teacher  taking out his pipe and beginning to fill it with the tobacco that he carried loose in all his pockets
 you took up this thankless business of your own free will  and now of your own free will you withdraw
so that's all right    i'm not an obstinate man   i said
 do you find anything to object to in my proposal    no  absolutely nothing   said the schoolmaster  and his pipe was already going
i could not bear the stink of his tobacco  and so i rose and began to walk up and down the room
from previous encounters i was used to the teacher's extreme taciturnity  and to the fact that in spite of it he never seemed to have any desire to stir from my room once he was in it
that had often disturbed me before
he wants something more  i always thought at such times  and i would offer him money  which indeed he invariably accepted
yet he never went away before it suited his convenience
generally his pipe was smoked out by that time  then he would ceremoniously and respectfully push his chair in to the table  make a detour around it  seize his cane standing in the corner  press my hand warmly  and go
but today his silent presence as he sat there was an actual torture to me
when one has bidden a last farewell to someone  as i had done  a farewell accepted in good faith  surely the mutual formalities that remain should be got over as quickly as possible and one should not burden one's host purposelessly with one's silent presence
as i contemplated the stubborn fellow from behind  while he sat at the table  it seemed an impossible idea to ever show him the door
blumfeld  an elderly bachelor one evening blumfeld  an elderly bachelor  was climbing up to his apartment     a laborious undertaking  for he lived on the sixth floor
while climbing up he thought  as he had so often recently  how unpleasant this utterly lonely life was  to reach his empty rooms he had to climb these six floors almost in secret  there put on his dressing gown  again almost in secret  light his pipe  read a little of the french magazine to which he had been subscribing for years  at the same time sip at a homemade kirsch  and finally  after half an hour  go to bed  but not before having completely rearranged his bedclothes which the unteachable charwoman would insist on arranging in her own way some companion  someone to witness these activities  would have been very welcome to blumfeld
he had already been wondering whether he shouldn't acquire a little dog
these animals are gay and above all grateful and loyal  one of blumfeld's colleagues has a dog of this kind  it follows no one but its master and when it hasn't seen him for a few moments it greets him at once with loud barkings  by which it is evidently trying to express its joy at once more finding that extraordinary benefactor  its master
true  a dog also has its drawbacks
however well kept it may be  it is bound to dirty the room
this just cannot be avoided  one cannot give it a hot bath each time before letting it into the room  besides  its health couldn't stand that
blumfeld  on the other hand  can't stand dirt in his room
to him cleanliness is essential  and several times a week he is obliged to have words with his charwoman  who is unfortunately not very painstaking in this respect
since she is hard of hearing he usually drags her by the arm to those spots in the room which he finds lacking in cleanliness
by this strict discipline he has achieved in his room a neatness more or less commensurate with his wishes
by acquiring a dog  however  he would be almost deliberately introducing into his room the dirt which hitherto he had been so careful to avoid
fleas  the dog's constant companions  would appear
and once fleas were there  it would not be long before blumfeld would be abandoning his comfortable room to the dog and looking for another one
uncleanliness  however  is but one of the drawbacks of dogs
dogs also fall ill and no one really understands dogs' diseases
then the animal sits in a corner or limps about  whimpers  coughs  chokes from some pain  one wraps it in a rug  whistles a little melody  offers it milk    in short  one nurses it in the hope that this  as indeed is possible  is a passing sickness while it may be a serious  disgusting  and contagious disease
and even if the dog remains healthy  one day it will grow old  one won't have the heart to get rid of the faithful animal in time  and then comes the moment when one's own age peers out at one from the dog's oozing eyes
then one has to cope with the half blind  weak lunged animal all but immobile with fat  and in this way pay dearly for the pleasures the dog once had given
much as blumfeld would like to have a dog at this moment  he would rather go on climbing the stairs alone for another thirty years than be burdened later on by such an old dog which  sighing louder than he  would drag itself up  step by step
so blumfeld will remain alone  after all  he really feels none of the old maid's longing to have around her some submissive living creature that she can protect  lavish her affection upon  and continue to serve    for which purpose a cat  a canary  even a goldfish would suffice    or  if this cannot be  rest content with flowers on the window sill
blumfeld only wants a companion  an animal to which he doesn't have to pay much attention  which doesn't mind an occasional kick  which even  in an emergency  can spend the night in the street  but which nevertheless  when blumfeld feels like it  is promptly at his disposal with its barking  jumping  and licking of hands
this is what blumfeld wants  but since  as he realizes  it cannot be had without serious drawbacks  he renounces it  and yet    in accordance with his thoroughgoing disposition    the idea from time to time  this evening  for instance  occurs to him again
while taking the key from his pocket outside his room  he is startled by a sound coming from within
a peculiar rattling sound  very lively but very regular
since blumfeld has just been thinking of dogs  it reminds him of the sounds produced by paws pattering one after the other over a floor
but paws don't rattle  so it can't be paws
he quickly unlocks the door and switches on the light
he is not prepared for what he sees
for this is magic    two small white celluloid balls with blue stripes jumping up and down side by side on the parquet  when one of them touches the floor the other is in the air  a game they continue ceaselessly to play
at school one day blumfeld had seen some little pellets jumping about like this during a well known electrical experiment  but these are comparatively large balls jumping freely about in the room and no electrical experiment is being made
blumfeld bends down to get a good look at them
they are undoubtedly ordinary balls  they probably contain several smaller balls  and it is these that produce the rattling sound
blumfeld gropes in the air to find out whether they are hanging from some threads    no  they are moving entirely on their own
a pity blumfeld isn't a small child  two balls like these would have been a happy surprise for him  whereas now the whole thing gives him rather an unpleasant feeling
it's not quite pointless after all to live in secret as an unnoticed bachelor  now someone  no matter who  has penetrated this secret and sent him these two strange balls
he tries to catch one but they retreat before him  thus luring him on to follow them through the room
it's really too silly  he thinks  running after balls like this  he stands still and realizes that the moment he abandons the pursuit  they too remain on the same spot
i will try to catch them all the same  he thinks again  and hurries toward them
they immediately run away  but blumfeld  his legs apart  forces them into a corner of the room  and there  in front of a trunk  he manages to catch one ball
it's a small cool ball  and it turns in his hand  clearly anxious to slip away
and the other ball  too  as though aware of its comrade's distress  jumps higher than before  extending the leaps until it touches blumfeld's hand it beats against his hand  beats in ever faster leaps  alters its angle of attack  then  powerless against the hand which encloses the ball so completely  springs even higher and is probably trying to reach blumfeld's face
blumfeld could catch this ball too  and lock them both up somewhere  but at the moment it strikes him as too humiliating to take such measures against two little balls
besides  it's fun owning these balls  and soon enough they'll grow tired  roll under the cupboard  and be quiet
despite this deliberation  however  blumfeld  near to anger  flings the ball to the ground  and it is a miracle that in doing so the delicate  all but transparent celluloid cover doesn't break
without hesitation the two balls resume their former low  well coordinated jumps
blumfeld undresses calmly  arranges his clothes in the wardrobe which he always inspects carefully to make sure the charwoman has left everything in order
once or twice he glances over his shoulder at the balls  which  unpursued  seem to be pursuing him  they have followed him and are now jumping close behind him
blumfeld puts on his dressing gown and sets out for the opposite wall to fetch one of the pipes which are hanging in a rack before turning around he instinctively kicks his foot out backwards  but the balls know how to get out of its way and remain untouched
as blumfeld goes off to fetch the pipe the balls at once follow close behind him  he shuffles along in his slippers  taking irregular steps  yet each step is followed almost without pause by the sound of the balls  they are keeping pace with him to see how the balls manage to do this  blumfeld turns suddenly around
but hardly has he turned when the balls describe a semicircle and are already behind him again  and this they repeat every time he turns
like submissive companions  they try to avoid appearing in front of blumfeld
up to the present they have evidently dared to do so only in order to introduce themselves  now  however  it seems they have actually entered into his service hitherto  when faced with situations he couldn't master  blumfeld had always chosen to behave as though he hadn't noticed anything
it had often helped and usually improved the situation
this  then  is what he does now  he takes up a position in front of the pipe rack and  puffing out his lips  chooses a pipe  fills it with particular care from the tobacco pouch close at hand  and allows the balls to continue their jumping behind him
but he hesitates to approach the table  for to hear the sound of the jumps coinciding with that of his own steps almost hurts him
so there he stands  and while taking an unnecessarily long time to fill his pipe he measures the distance separating him from the table
at last  however  he overcomes his faintheartedness and covers the distance with such stamping of feet that he cannot hear the balls
but the moment he is seated he can hear them jumping up and down behind his chair as distinctly as ever
above the table  within reach  a shelf is nailed to the wall on which stands the bottle of kirsch surrounded by little glasses
beside it  in a pile  lie several copies of the french magazine
(this very day the latest issue has arrived and blumfeld takes it down
he quite forgets the kirsch  he even has the feeling that today he is proceeding with his usual activities only to console himself  for he feels no genuine desire to read magazine at random and there finds a large photograph
he forces himself to examine it in detail it shows a meeting between the czar of russia and the president of france
this takes place on a ship
all about as far as can be seen are many other ships  the smoke from their funnels vanishing in the bright sky
both czar and president have rushed toward each other with long strides and are clasping one another by the hand
behind the czar as well as behind the president stand two men
by comparison with the gay faces of the czar and the president  the faces of their attendants are very solemn  the eyes of each group focused on their master
lower down    the scene evidently takes place on the top deck    stand long lines of saluting sailors cut off by the margin
gradually blumfeld contemplates the picture with more interest  then holds it a little further away and looks at it with blinking eyes
he has always had a taste for such imposing scenes
the way the chief personages clasp each other's hand so naturally  so cordially and lightheartedly  this he finds most lifelike
and it's just as appropriate that the attendants    high ranking gentlemen  of course  with their names printed beneath    express in their bearing the solemnity of the historical moment ) and instead of helping himself to everything he needs  blumfeld sits there tense  staring at the bowl of his still unlit pipe he is lying in wait
suddenly  quite unexpectedly  his numbness leaves him and with a jerk he turns around in his chair
but the balls  equally alert  or perhaps automatically following the law governing them  also change their position the moment blumfeld turns  and hide behind his back
blumfeld now sits with his back to the table  the cold pipe in his hand
and now the balls jump under the table and  since there's a rug there  they are less audible
this is a great advantage  only faint  hollow noises can be heard  one has to pay great attention to catch their sound
blumfeld  however  does pay great attention  and hears them distinctly
but this is so only for the moment  in a little while he probably won't hear them any more
the fact that they cannot make themselves more audible on the rug strikes blumfeld as a great weakness on the part of the balls what one has to do is lay one or even better two rugs under them and they are all but powerless
admittedly only for a limited time  and besides  their very existence wields a certain power
right now blumfeld could have made good use of a dog  a wild young animal would soon have dealt with these balls  he imagines this dog trying to catch them with its paws  chasing them from their positions  hunting them all over the room  and finally getting hold of them between its teeth
it's quite possible that before long blumfeld will acquire a dog
for the moment  however  the balls have no one to fear but blumfeld  and he has no desire to destroy them just now  perhaps he lacks the necessary determination
he comes home in the evening tired from work and just when he is in need of some rest he is faced with this surprise
only now does he realize how tired he really is
no doubt he will destroy the balls  and that in the near future  but not just yet  probably not until tomorrow
if one looks at the whole thing with an unprejudiced eye  the balls behave modestly enough
from time to time  for instance  they could jump into the foreground  show themselves  and then return again to their positions  or they could jump higher so as to beat against the tabletop in order to compensate themselves for the muffling effect of the rug but this they don't do  they don't want to irritate blumfeld unduly  they are evidently confining themselves to what is absolutely necessary even this measured necessity  however  is quite sufficient to spoil blumfeld's rest at the table
he has been sitting there only a few minutes and is already considering going to bed
one of his motives for this is that he can't smoke here  for he has left the matches on his bedside table
thus he would have to fetch these matches  but once having reached the bedside table he might as well stay there and lie down for this he has an ulterior motive  he thinks that the balls  with their mania for keeping behind him  will jump onto the bed  and that there  in lying down  on purpose or not  he will squash them
the objection that what would then remain of the balls could still go on jumping  he dismisses
even the unusual must have its limits
complete balls jump anyway  even if not incessantly  but fragments of balls never jump  and consequently will not jump in this case  either
 up   he shouts  having grown almost reckless from this reflection and  the balls still behind him  he stamps off to bed
his hope seems to be confirmed  for when he purposely takes up a position quite near the bed  one ball promptly springs onto it then  however  the unexpected occurs  the other ball disappears under the bed
the possibility that the balls could jump under the bed as well had not occurred to blumfeld
he is outraged about the one ball  although he is aware how unjust this is  for by jumping under the bed the ball fulfills its duty perhaps better than the ball on the bed
now everything depends on which place the balls decide to choose  for blumfeld does not believe that they can work separately for any length of time
and sure enough a moment later the ball on the floor also jumps onto the bed
now i've got them  thinks blumfeld  hot with joy  and tears his dressing gown from his body to throw himself into bed at that moment  however  the very same ball jumps back under the bed
overwhelmed with disappointment  blumfeld almost collapses
very likely the ball just took a good look around up there and decided it didn't like it
and now the other one has followed  too  and of course remains  for it's better down there
 now i'll have these drummers with me all night   thinks blumfeld  biting his lips and nodding his head
he feels gloomy  without actually knowing what harm the balls could do him in the night
he is a good sleeper  he will easily be able to ignore so slight a noise
to make quite sure of this and mindful of his past experience  he lays two rugs on the floor
it's as if he owned a little dog for which he wants to make a soft bed
and as though the balls had also grown tired and sleepy  their jumping has become lower and slower than before
as blumfeld kneels beside the bed  lamp in hand  he thinks for a moment that the balls might come to rest on the rug    they fall so weakly  roll so slowly along
then  however  they dutifully rise again
yet it is quite possible that in the morning when blumfeld looks under the bed he'll find there two quiet  harmless children's balls
but it seems that they may not even be able to keep up their jumping until the morning  for as soon as blumfeld is in bed he doesn't hear them anymore he strains his ears  leans out of bed to listen    not a sound
the effect of the rugs can't be as strong as that  the only explanation is that the balls are no longer jumping  either because they aren't able to bounce themselves off the rug and have therefore abandoned jumping for the time being or  which is more likely  they will never jump again blumfeld could get up and see exactly what's going on  but in his relief at finding peace at last he prefers to remain where he is
he would rather not risk disturbing the pacified balls even with his eyes
even smoking he happily renounces  turns over on his side  and promptly goes to sleep
but he does not remain undisturbed  as usual he sleeps without dreaming  but very restlessly
innumerable times during the night he is startled by the delusion that someone is knocking at his door
he knows quite well that no one is knocking  who would knock at night and at his lonely bachelor's door  yet although he knows this for certain  he is startled again and again and each time glances in suspense at the door  his mouth open  eyes wide  a strand of hair trembling over his damp forehead
he tries to count how many times he has been woken but  dizzy from the huge numbers he arrives at  he falls back to sleep again
he thinks he knows where the knocking comes from  not from the door  but somewhere quite different  being heavy with sleep  however  he cannot quite remember on what his suspicions are based
all he knows is that innumerable tiny unpleasant sounds accumulate before producing the great strong knocking
he would happily suffer all the unpleasantness of the small sounds if he could be spared the actual knocking  but for some reason it's too late  he cannot interfere  the moment has passed  he can't even speak  his mouth opens but all that comes out is a silent yawn  and furious at this he thrusts his face into the pillows
thus the night passes
in the morning he is awakened by the charwoman's knocking  with a sigh of relief he welcomes the gentle tap on the door whose inaudibility has in the past always been one of his sources of complaint
he is about to shout  come in   when he hears another lively  faint  yet all but belligerent knocking
it's the balls under the bed
have they woken up  have they  unlike him  gathered new strength overnight   just a moment   shouts blumfeld to the charwoman  jumps out of bed  and  taking great care to keep the balls behind him  throws himself on the floor  his back still toward them  then  twisting his head over his shoulder  he glances at the balls and nearly lets out a curse like children pushing away blankets that annoy them at night  the balls have apparently spent all night pushing the rugs  with tiny twitching movements  so far away from under the bed that they are now once more on the parquet  where they can continue making their noise
 back onto the rugs   says blumfeld with an angry face  and only when the balls  thanks to the rugs  have become quiet again  does he call in the charwoman
while she    a fat  dull witted  stiff backed woman    is laying the breakfast on the table and doing the few necessary chores  blumfeld stands motionless in his dressing gown by his bed so as to keep the balls in their place
with his eyes he follows the charwoman to see whether she notices anything
this  since she is hard of hearing  is very unlikely  and the fact that blumfeld thinks he sees the charwoman stopping here and there  holding on to some furniture and listening with raised eyebrows  he puts down to his overwrought condition caused by a bad night's sleep
it would relieve him if he could persuade the charwoman to speed up her work  but if anything she is slower than usual
she loads herself laboriously with blumfeld's clothes and shuffles out with them into the corridor  stays away a long time  and the din she makes beating the clothes echoes in his ears with slow  monotonous thuds
and during all this time blumfeld has to remain on the bed  cannot move for fear of drawing the balls behind him  has to let the coffee    which he likes to drink as hot as possible    get cold  and can do nothing but stare at the drawn blinds behind which the day is dimly dawning
at last the charwoman has finished  bids him good morning  and is about to leave  but before she actually goes she hesitates by the door  moves her lips a little  and takes a long look at blumfeld
blumfeld is about to remonstrate when she at last departs
blumfeld longs to fling the door open and shout after her that she is a stupid  idiotic old woman
however  when he reflects on what he actually has against her  he can only think of the paradox of her having clearly noticed nothing and yet trying to give the impression that she has
how confused his thoughts have become  and all on account of a bad night
some explanation for his poor sleep he finds in the fact that last night he deviated from his usual habits by not smoking or drinking any schnapps
when for once i don't smoke or drink schnapps    and this is the result of his reflections    i sleep badly
from now on he is going to take better care of his health  and he begins by fetching some cotton wool from his medicine chest which hangs over his bedside table and putting two little wads of it into his ears then he stands up and takes a trial step
although the balls do follow he can hardly hear them  the addition of another wad makes them quite inaudible
blumfeld takes a few more steps  nothing particularly unpleasant happens
everyone for himself  blumfeld as well as the balls  and although they are bound to one another they don't disturb each other only once  when blumfeld turns around rather suddenly and one ball fails to make the countermovement fast enough  does he touch it with his knee
but this is the only incident
otherwise blumfeld calmly drinks his coffee  he is as hungry as though  instead of sleeping last night  he had gone for a long walk  he washes in cold  exceedingly refreshing water  and puts on his clothes
he still hasn't pulled up the blinds  rather  as a precaution  he has preferred to remain in semidarkness  he has no wish for the balls to be seen by other eyes
but now that he is ready to go he has somehow to provide for the balls in case they should dare    not that he thinks they will    to follow him into the street
he thinks of a good solution  opens the large wardrobe  and places himself with his back to it as though divining his intention  the balls steer clear of the wardrobe's interior  taking advantage of every inch of space between blumfeld and the wardrobe  when there's no other alternative they jump into the wardrobe for a moment  but when faced by the dark out they promptly jump again
rather than be lured over the edge further into the wardrobe  they neglect their duty and stay by blumfeld's side
but their little ruses avail them nothing  for now blumfeld himself climbs backward into the wardrobe and they have to follow him and with this their fate has been sealed  for on the floor of the wardrobe lie various smallish objects such as boots  boxes  small trunks which  although carefully arranged    blumfeld now regrets this    nevertheless considerably hamper the balls
and when blumfeld  having by now pulled the door almost to  jumps out of it with an enormous leap such as he has not made for years  slams the door  and turns the key  the balls are imprisoned  well  that worked   thinks blumfeld  wiping the sweat from his face
what a din the balls are making in the wardrobe  it sounds as though they are desperate
blumfeld  on the other hand  is very contented
he leaves the room and already the deserted corridor has a soothing effect on him
he takes the wool out of his ears and is enchanted by the countless sounds of the waking house
few people are to be seen  it's still very early
downstairs in the hall in front of the low door leading to the charwoman's basement apartment stands that woman's ten year old son
the image of his mother  not one feature of the woman has been omitted in this child's face
bandy legged  hands in his trouser pockets  he stands there wheezing  for he already has a goiter and can breathe only with difficulty
but whereas blumfeld  whenever the boy crosses his path  usually quickens his step to spare himself the spectacle  today he almost feels like pausing for a moment even if the boy has been brought into the world by this woman and shows every sign of his origin  he is nevertheless a child  the thoughts of a child still dwell in this shapeless head  and if one were to speak to him sensibly and ask him something  he would very likely answer in a bright voice  innocent and reverential  and after some inner struggle one could bring oneself to pat these cheeks
although this is what blumfeld thinks  he nevertheless passes him by
in the street he realizes that the weather is pleasanter than he had suspected from his room
the morning mist has dispersed and patches of blue sky have appeared  brushed by a strong wind
blumfeld has the balls to thank for his having left his room much earlier than usual  even the paper he has left unread on the table  in any case he has saved a great deal of time and can now afford to walk slowly
it is remarkable how little he worries about the balls now that he is separated from them
so long as they were following him they could have been considered as something belonging to him  something which  in passing judgment on his person  had somehow to be taken into consideration
now  however  they were mere toys in his wardrobe at home
and it occurs to blumfeld that the best way of rendering the balls harmless would be to put them to their original use
there in the hall stands the boy  blumfeld will give him the balls  not lend them  but actually present them to him  which is surely tantamount to ordering their destruction
and even if they were to remain intact they would mean even less in the boy's hands than in the wardrobe  the whole house would watch the boy playing with them  other children would join in  and the general opinion that the balls are things to play with and in no way life companions of blumfeld would be firmly and irrefutably established
blumfeld runs back into the house
the boy has just gone down the basement stairs and is about to open the door
so blumfeld has to call the boy and pronounce his name  a name that to him seems as ludicrous as everything else connected with the child  alfred  alfred   he shouts
the boy hesitates for a long time
 come here   shouts blumfeld   i've got something for you   the janitor's two little girls appear from the door opposite and  full of curiosity  take up positions on either side of blumfeld
they grasp the situation much more quickly than the boy and cannot understand why he doesn't come at once
without taking their eyes off blumfeld they beckon to the boy  but cannot fathom what kind of present is awaiting alfred
tortured with curiosity  they hop from one foot to the other
blumfeld laughs at them as well as at the boy
the latter seems to have figured it all out and climbs stiffly  clumsily up the steps not even in his gait can he manage to belie his mother  who  incidentally  has appeared in the basement doorway
to make sure that the charwoman also understands and in the hope that she will supervise the carrying out of his instructions  should it be necessary  blumfeld shouts excessively loud
 up in my room   says blumfeld   i have two lovely balls
would you like to have them   not knowing how to behave  the boy simply screws up his mouth  turns around  and looks inquiringly down at his mother
the girls  however  promptly begin to jump around blumfeld and ask him for the balls
 you will be allowed to play with them too   blumfeld tells them  but waits for the boy's answer
he could of course give the balls to the girls  but they strike him as too unreliable and for the moment he has more confidence in the boy
meanwhile  the latter  without having exchanged a word  has taken counsel with his mother and nods his assent to blumfeld's repeated question
 then listen   says blumfeld  who is quite prepared to receive no thanks for his gift
 your mother has the key of my door  you must borrow it from her
but here is the key of my wardrobe  and in the wardrobe you will find the balls
take good care to lock the wardrobe and the room again
but with the balls you can do what you like and you don't have to bring them back
have you understood me   unfortunately  the boy has not understood
blumfeld has tried to make everything particularly clear to this hopelessly dense creature  but for this very reason has repeated everything too often  has in turn too often mentioned keys  room  and wardrobe  and as a result the boy stares at him as though he were rather a seducer than his benefactor
the girls  on the other hand  have understood everything immediately  press against blumfeld  and stretch out their hands for the key  wait a moment   says blumfeld  by now annoyed with them all
time  moreover  is passing  he can't stand about much longer
if only the mother would say that she has understood him and take matters in hand for the boy  instead of which she still stands down by the door  smiles with the affectation of the bashful deaf  and is probably under the impression that blumfeld up there has suddenly fallen for the boy and is hearing him his lessons
blumfeld on the other hand can't very well climb down the basement stairs and shout into the charwoman's ear to make her son for god's sake relieve him of the balls  it had required enough of his self control as it was to entrust the key of his wardrobe for a whole day to this family
it is certainly not in order to save himself trouble that he is handing the key to the boy rather than himself leading the boy up and there giving him the balls but he can't very well first give the balls away and then immediately deprive the boy of them by    as would be bound to happen    drawing them after him as his followers
 so you still don't understand me   asks blumfeld almost wistfully after having started a fresh explanation which  however  he immediately interrupts at sight of the boy's vacant stare
so vacant a stare renders one helpless
it could tempt one into saying more than one intends  if only to fill the vacancy with sense
whereupon  we'll fetch the balls for him   shout the girls they are shrewd and have realized that they can obtain the balls only through using the boy as an intermediary  but that they themselves have to bring about this mediation from the janitor's room a clock strikes  warning blumfeld to hurry
 well  then  take the key   says blumfeld  and the key is more snatched from his hand than given by him
he would have handed it to the boy with infinitely more confidence
 the key to the room you'll have to get from the woman   blumfeld adds
 and when you return with the balls you must hand both keys to her    yes  yes   shout the girls and run down the steps
they know everything  absolutely everything  and as though blumfeld were infected by the boy's denseness  he is unable to understand how they could have grasped everything so quickly from his explanations
now they are already tugging at the charwoman's skirt but  tempting as it would be  blumfeld cannot afford to watch them carrying out their task  not only because it's already late  but also because he has no desire to be present at the liberation of the balls
he would in fact far prefer to be several streets away when the girls first open the door of his room
after all  how does he know what else he might have to expect from these balls  and so for the second time this morning he leaves the house
he has one last glimpse of the charwoman defending herself against the girls  and of the boy stirring his bandy legs to come to his mother's assistance
it's beyond blumfeld's comprehension why a creature like this servant should prosper and propagate in this world
while on his way to the linen factory  where blumfeld is employed  thoughts about his work gradually get the upper hand
he quickens his step and  despite the delay caused by the boy  he is the first to arrive in his office
this office is a glassenclosed room containing a writing desk for blumfeld and two standing desks for the two assistants subordinate to him
although these standing desks are so small and narrow as to suggest they are meant for schoolchildren  this office is very crowded and the assistants cannot sit down  for then there would be no place for blumfeld's chair
as a result they stand all day  pressed against their desks
for them of course this is very uncomfortable  but it also makes it very difficult for blumfeld to keep an eye on them
they often press eagerly against their desks not so much in order to work as to whisper to one another or even to take forty winks
they give blumfeld a great deal of trouble  they don't help him sufficiently with the enormous amount of work that is imposed on him
this work involves supervising the whole distribution of fabrics and cash among the women homeworkers who are employed by the factory for the manufacture of certain fancy commodities
to appreciate the magnitude of this task an intimate knowledge of the general conditions is necessary
but since blumfeld's immediate superior has died some years ago  no one any longer possesses this knowledge  which is also why blumfeld cannot grant anyone the right to pronounce an opinion on his work
the manufacturer  herr ottomar  for instance  clearly underestimates blumfeld's work  no doubt he recognizes that in the course of twenty years blumfeld has deserved well of the factory  and this he acknowledges not only because he is obliged to  but also because he respects blumfeld as a loyal  trustworthy person
   he underestimates his work  nevertheless  for he believes it could be conducted by methods more simple and therefore in every respect more profitable than those employed by blumfeld
it is said  and it is probably not incorrect  that ottomar shows himself so rarely in blumfeld's department simply to spare himself the annoyance that the sight of blumfeld's working methods causes him to be so unappreciated is undoubtedly sad for blumfeld  but there is no remedy  for he cannot very well compel ottomar to spend let us say a whole month on end in blumfeld's department in order to study the great variety of work being accomplished there  to apply his own allegedly better methods  and to let himself be convinced of blumfeld's soundness by the collapse of the department    which would be the inevitable result and so blumfeld carries on his work undeterred as before  gives a little start whenever ottomar appears after a long absence  then with the subordinate's sense of duty makes a feeble effort to explain to ottomar this or that arrangement  whereupon the latter  his eyes lowered and giving a silent nod  passes on
but what worries blumfeld more than this lack of appreciation is the thought that one day he will be compelled to leave his job  the immediate consequence of which will be pandemonium  a confusion no one will be able to straighten out because so far as he knows there isn't a single soul in the factory capable of replacing him and of carrying on his job in a manner that could be relied upon to prevent months of the most serious interruptions
needless to say  if the boss underestimates an employee the latter's colleagues try their best to surpass him in this respect
in consequence everyone underestimates blumfeld's work  no one considers it necessary to spend any time training in blumfeld's department  and when new employees are hired not one of them is ever assigned to blumfeld
as a result blumfeld's department lacks a younger generation to carry on
when blumfeld  who up to then had been managing the entire department with the help of only one servant  demanded an assistant  weeks of bitter fighting ensued
almost every day blumfeld appeared in ottomar's office and explained to him calmly and in minute detail why an assistant was needed in his department
he was needed not by any means because blumfeld wished to spare himself  blumfeld had no intention of sparing himself  he was doing more than his share of work and this he had no desire to change  but would herr ottomar please consider how in the course of time the business had grown  how every department had been correspondingly enlarged  with the exception of blumfeld's department  which was invariably forgotten  and would he consider too how the work had increased just there  when blumfeld had entered the firm  a time herr ottomar probably could not remember  they had employed some ten seamstresses  today the number varied between fifty and sixty such a job requires great energy  blumfeld could guarantee that he was completely wearing himself out in this work  but that he will continue to master it completely he can henceforth no longer guarantee true  herr ottomar had never flatly refused blumfeld's requests  this was something he could not do to an old employee  but the manner in which he hardly listened  in which he talked to others over blumfeld's head  made halfhearted promises and had forgotten everything in a few days    this behavior was insulting  to say the least
not actually to blumfeld  blumfeld is no romantic  pleasant as honor and recognition may be  blumfeld can do without them  in spite of everything he will stick to his desk as long as it is at all possible  in any case he is in the right  and right  even though on occasion it may take a long time  must prevail in the end
true  blumfeld has at last been given two assistants  but what assistants  one might have thought ottomar had realized he could express his contempt for the department even better by granting rather than by refusing it these assistants
it was even possible that ottomar had kept blumfeld waiting so long because he was looking for two assistants just like these  and    as may be imagined    took a long time to find them
and now of course blumfeld could no longer complain  if he did  the answer could easily be foreseen  after all  he had asked for one assistant and had been given two  that's how cleverly ottomar had arranged things
needless to say  blumfeld complained just the same  but only because his predicament all but forced him to do so  not because he still hoped for any redress
nor did he complain emphatically  but only by the way  whenever the occasion arose
nevertheless  among his spiteful colleagues the rumor soon spread that someone had asked ottomar if it were really possible that blumfeld  who after all had been given such unusual aid  was still complaining
to which ottomar answered that this was correct  blumfeld was still complaining  and rightly so
he  ottomar  had at last realized this and he intended gradually to assign to blumfeld one assistant for each seamstress  in other words some sixty in all in case this number should prove insufficient  however  he would let him have even more and would not cease until the bedlam  which had been developing for years in blumfeld's department  was complete
now it cannot be denied that in this remark ottomar's manner of speech had been cleverly imitated  but blumfeld had no doubts whatever that ottomar would not dream of speaking about him in such a way
the whole thing was a fabrication of the loafers in the offices on the first floor
blumfeld ignored it    if only he could as calmly have ignored the presence of the assistants  but there they stood  and could not be spirited away
pale  weak children
according to their credentials they had already passed school age  but in reality this was difficult to believe
in fact their rightful place was so clearly at their mother's knee that one would hardly have dared to entrust them to a teacher
they still couldn't even move properly  standing up for any length of time tired them inordinately  especially when they first arrived
when left to themselves they promptly doubled up in their weakness  standing hunched and crooked in their corner blumfeld tried to point out to them that if they went on giving in to their indolence they would become cripples for life
to ask the assistants to make the slightest move was to take a risk  once when one of them had been ordered to carry something a short distance  he had run so eagerly that he had banged his knee against a desk
the room had been full of seamstresses  the desks covered in merchandise  but blumfeld had been obliged to neglect everything and take the sobbing assistant into the office and there bandage his wound yet even this zeal on the part of the assistant was superficial  like actual children they tried once in a while to excel  but far more often    indeed almost always    they tried to divert their superior's attention and to cheat him
once  at a time of the most intensive work  blumfeld had rushed past them  dripping with sweat  and had observed them secretly swapping stamps among the bales of merchandise
he had felt like banging them on the head with his fists  it would have been the only possible punishment for such behavior  but they were after all only children and blumfeld could not very well knock children down
and so he continued to put up with them
originally he had imagined that the assistants would help him with the essential chores which at the moment of the distribution of goods required so much effort and vigilance
he had imagined himself standing in the center behind his desk  keeping an eye on everything  and making the entries in the books while the assistants ran to and fro  distributing everything according to his orders he had imagined that his supervision  which  sharp as it was  could not cope with such a crowd  would be complemented by the assistants' attention  he had hoped that these assistants would gradually acquire experience  cease depending entirely on his orders  and finally learn to discriminate on their own between the seamstresses as to their trustworthiness and requirements blumfeld soon realized that all these hopes had been in vain and that he could not afford to let them even talk to the seamstresses from the beginning they had ignored some of the seamstresses  either from fear or dislike  others to whom they felt partial they would sometimes run to meet at the door to them the assistants would bring whatever the women wanted  pressing it almost secretly into their hands  although the seamstresses were perfectly entitled to receive it  would collect on a bare shelf for these favorites various cuttings  worthless remnants  but also a few still useful odds and ends  waving them blissfully at the women behind blumfeld's back and in return having sweets popped into their mouths blumfeld of course soon put an end to this mischief and the moment the seamstresses arrived he ordered the assistants back into their glass enclosed cubicles but for a long time they considered this to be a grave injustice  they sulked  willfully broke their nibs  and sometimes  although not daring to raise their heads  even knocked loudly against the glass panes in order to attract the seamstresses' attention to the bad treatment that in their opinion they were suffering at blumfeld's hands the wrong they do themselves the assistants cannot see for instance  they almost always arrive late at the office
blumfeld  their superior  who from his earliest youth has considered it natural to arrive half an hour before the office opens    not from ambition or an exaggerated sense of duty but simply from a certain feeling of decency    often has to wait more than an hour for his assistants
chewing his breakfast roll he stands behind his desk  looking through the accounts in the seamstresses' little books soon he is immersed in his work and thinking of nothing else when suddenly he receives such a shock that his pen continues to tremble in his hand for some while afterwards
one of the assistants has dashed in  looking as though he is about to collapse  he is holding on to something with one hand while the other is pressed against his heaving chest
all this  however  simply means that he is making excuses for being late  excuses so absurd that blumfeld purposely ignores them  for if he didn't he would have to give the young man a well deserved thrashing
as it is  he just glances at him for a moment  points with outstretched hand at the cubicle  and turns back to his work now one really might expect the assistant to appreciate his superior's kindness and hurry to his place
no  he doesn't hurry  he dawdles about  he walks on tiptoe  slowly placing one foot in front of the other
is he trying to ridicule his superior  no
again it's just that mixture of fear and self complacency against which one is powerless
how else explain the fact that even today blumfeld  who has himself arrived unusually late in the office and now after a long wait    he doesn't feel like checking the books    sees  through the clouds of dust raised by the stupid servant with his broom  the two assistants sauntering peacefully along the street  arm in arm  they appear to be telling one another important things which  however  are sure to have only the remotest and very likely irreverent connections with the office the nearer they approach the glass door  the slower they walk
one of them seizes the door handle but fails to turn it  they just go on talking  listening  laughing
 hurry out and open the door for our gentlemen   shouts blumfeld at the servant  throwing up his hands
but when the assistants come in  blumfeld no longer feels like quarreling  ignores their greetings  and goes to his desk
he starts doing his accounts  but now and again glances up to see what his assistants are up to
one of them seems to be very tired and rubs his eyes when hanging up his overcoat he takes the opportunity to lean against the wall
on the street he seemed lively enough  but the proximity of work tires him
the other assistant  however  is eager to work  but only work of a certain kind
for a long time it has been his wish to be allowed to sweep
but this is work to which he is not entitled  sweeping is exclusively the servant's job  in itself blumfeld would have nothing against the assistant sweeping  let the assistant sweep  he can't make a worse job of it than the servant  but if the assistant wants to sweep then he must come earlier  before the servant begins to sweep  and not spend on it time that is reserved exclusively for office work
but since the young man is totally deaf to any sensible argument  at least the servant    that half blind old buffer whom the boss would certainly not tolerate in any department but blumfeld's and who is still alive only by the grace of the boss and god    at least the servant might be sensible and hand the broom for a moment to the young man who  being clumsy  would soon lose his interest and run after the servant with the broom in order to persuade him to go on sweeping it appears  however  that the servant feels especially responsible for the sweeping  one can see how he  the moment the young man approaches him  tries to grasp the broom more firmly with his trembling hands  he even stands still and stops sweeping so as to direct his full attention to the ownership of the broom
the assistant doesn't actually plead in words  for he is afraid of blumfeld  who is ostensibly doing his accounts  moreover  ordinary speech is useless  since the servant can be made to hear only by excessive shouting
so at first the assistant tugs the servant by the sleeve
the servant knows  of course  what it is about  glowers at the assistant  shakes his head  and pulls the broom nearer  up to his chest
whereupon the assistant folds his hands and pleads
actually  he has no hope of achieving anything by pleading  but the pleading amuses him and so he pleads
the other assistant follows the goings on with low laughter and seems to think  heaven knows why  that blumfeld can't hear him the pleading makes not the slightest impression on the servant  who turns around and thinks he can safely use the broom again
the assistant  however  has skipped after him on tiptoe and  rubbing his hands together imploringly  now pleads from another side
this turning of the one and skipping of the other is repeated several times
finally the servant feels cut off from all sides and realizes something which  had he been slightly less stupid  he might have realized from the beginning    that he will be tired out long before the assistant
so  looking for help elsewhere  he wags his finger at the assistant and points at blumfeld  suggesting that he will lodge a complaint if the assistant refuses to desist
the assistant realizes that if he is to get the broom at all he'll have to hurry  so he impudently makes a grab for it
an involuntary scream from the other assistant heralds the imminent decision
the servant saves the broom once more by taking a step back and dragging it after him
but now the assistant is up in arms  with open mouth and flashing eyes he leaps forward  the servant tries to escape  but his old legs wobble rather than run  the assistant tugs at the broom and though he doesn't succeed in getting it he nevertheless causes it to drop and in this way it is lost to the servant also apparently to the assistant for  the moment the broom falls  all three  the two assistants and the servant  are paralyzed  for now blumfeld is bound to discover everything
and sure enough blumfeld at his peephole glances up as though taking in the situation only now
he stares at each one with a stern and searching eye  even the broom on the floor does not escape his notice
perhaps the silence has lasted too long or perhaps the assistant can no longer suppress his desire to sweep  in any case he bends down    albeit very carefully  as though about to grab an animal rather than a broom    seizes it  passes it over the floor  but  when blumfeld jumps up and steps out of his cubicle  promptly casts it aside in alarm
 both of you back to work  and not another sound out of you   shouts blumfeld  and with an outstretched hand he directs the two assistants back to their desks they obey at once  but not shamefaced or with lowered heads  rather they squeeze themselves stiffly past blumfeld  staring him straight in the eye as though trying in this way to stop him from beating them yet they might have learned from experience that blumfeld on principle never beats anyone
but they are overapprehensive  and without any tact keep trying to protect their real or imaginary rights
the warden of the tomb small workroom  high window  beyond it a bare treetop
prince (at writing table  leaning back in chair  looking out of window)
chamberlain (white beard  youthfully squeezed into tight jacket  standing against wall near center door)
pause
prince (turning from window)  well  chamberlain  i cannot recommend it  your highness
prince  why  chamberlain  i can't quite formulate my objections at the moment
i'm expressing only a fraction of what's on my mind when i quote the universal saying  let the dead rest in peace
prince  that's my opinion  too
chamberlain  in that case i haven't properly understood
prince  so it seems pause
prince  perhaps the only thing that disconcerts you is that instead of going ahead with the arrangement  i announced it to you first
chamberlain  the announcement certainly burdens me with a great responsibility which i must endeavor to live up to
prince  don't speak of responsibility  pause
prince  let's see
hitherto the tomb in the friedrichspark has been guarded by a warden who lives in a lodge at the park's entrance
was there anything wrong with this  chamberlain  certainly not
the tomb is more than four hundred years old and has always been guarded in this way
prince  it could be an abuse
but it isn't an abuse  is it  chamberlain  it is a necessary arrangement
prince  all right then  a necessary arrangement
i've been here in the castle quite some time now  have gained some insight into details which hitherto have been entrusted to strangers    they manage fairly well    and i've come to this conclusion  the warden up there in the park is not enough
there must also be a guard down in the tomb
it probably won't be a pleasant job
but experience has proved that willing and suitable people can be found for any job
chamberlain  needless to say  any orders issued by your highness will be carried out  even if the necessity of the order is not fully understood
prince (starting up)  necessity  do you mean to say that a guard at the park gate is necessary  the friedrichspark belongs to the castle park  is entirely surrounded by it
the castle park itself is amply guarded    by the army  what's more
so why a special guard for the friedrichspark  isn't this a mere formality  a pleasant deathbed for the wretched old man who is keeping watch there  chamberlain  formality it is  but a necessary one a demonstration of reverence for the illustrious dead
prince  and what about the guard in the tomb itself  chamberlain  in my opinion this would have a police connotation
it would mean a real guarding of unreal things beyond the human sphere
prince  for my family this tomb represents the frontier between the human and the other  and it's on this frontier that i wish to post a guard
as for the police connotation  as you call it  we can question the warden himself i've sent for him
(rings a bell ) chamberlain  he's a confused old man  if i may say so  already quite out of hand
prince  if that's so  all the more reason for strengthening the guard in the way i've suggested
(enter servant ) prince  the warden of the tomb  (servant leads in warden  holding him tight around the waist to prevent him from collapsing
ancient red livery hanging loosely about warden  brightly polished silver buttons  several decorations
cap in hand  he trembles under the gentlemen's gaze ) prince  put him on the divan  (servant lays him down and goes off
pause
a faint rattling in warden's throat ) prince (again in armchair)  can you hear  warden (tries to answer but fails  is too exhausted  sinks back again)
prince  try to pull yourself together
we're waiting
chamberlain (leaning over prince)  what could this man give information about  and credible and important information at that  he ought to be taken straight to bed
warden  not to bed    still strong    fairly    can still hold my end up
prince  so you should
you've only just turned sixty
granted  you look very weak
warden  i'll pick up in no time    feel better in a minute
prince  it wasn't meant as a reproach
i'm only sorry you aren't feeling well
have you anything to complain about  warden  hard work    hard work    not complaining    but very weak    wrestling bouts every night
prince  what d'you say  warden  hard work
prince  you said something else
warden  wrestling bouts
prince  wrestling bouts  what kind of wrestling bouts  warden  with the blessed ancestors
prince  i don't understand
d'you have bad dreams  warden  no dreams    don't sleep prince  then let's hear about these    these wrestling bouts
warden (remains silent)
prince (to chamberlain)  why doesn't he speak  chamberlain (hurrying to warden)  he may die any minute
prince (stands up)
warden (as chamberlain touches him)  don't  don't  don't  (fights off chamberlain's hands  then collapses in tears ) prince  we're tormenting him
chamberlain  how  prince  i don't know
chamberlain  coming to the castle  having to present himself here  the sight of your highness  this questioning    he no longer has the wits to face all this prince (still staring at the warden)  that's not it
(goes to divan  bends over warden  takes his little skull in his hands ) mustn't cry
what are you crying for  we wish you well
i realize your job isn't easy
you've certainly deserved well of my family
so stop crying and tell us all about it
warden  but i'm so afraid of that gentleman there    (looks at chamberlain  more threateningly than afraid ) prince (to chamberlain)  if we want him to talk i'm afraid you'll have to leave
chamberlain  but look  your highness  he's foaming at the mouth
he's seriously ill
prince (absent mindedly)  please go  it won't take long
exit chamberlain
prince sits on edge of divan
pause
prince  why were you afraid of him  warden (surprisingly composed)  i wasn't afraid
me afraid of a servant  prince  he's not a servant
he's a count  free and rich
warden  a servant all the same  you are the master
prince  if you like it that way
but you said yourself that you were afraid of him
warden  i didn't want to say things in front of him which are meant only for you
haven't i already said too much in front of him  prince  so we're on terms of intimacy  and yet today is the first time i've seen you warden  seen for the first time  but you've always known that i (raising his forefinger) hold the most important position at court
you even acknowledged it publicly by awarding me the medal  red as fire   here  (holds up the medal on his coat ) prince  no  that's the medal for twenty five years' service at court
my grandfather gave you that
but i'll decorate you  too
warden  do as you please and grant me whatever you think i deserve
i've acted as your tomb warden for thirty years
prince  not mine
my reign has lasted hardly a year
warden (lost in thought)  thirty years
pause
warden (remembering only half of the prince's remark)  nights last years there
prince  i haven't yet had a report from your office
what's your work like  warden  every night the same
every night till the heart beats as if it were about to burst
prince  is it only night duty  then  night duty for an old man like you  warden  that's just it  your highness
it's day duty
a loafer's job
there one sits  at the front door  with one's mouth open in the sunshine
sometimes the watchdog pats one on the knee with its paws  and then lies down again
that's all that ever happens
prince  well  warden (nodding)  but it has been changed to night duty
prince  by whom  warden  by the lords of the tomb
prince  you know them  warden  yes
prince  they come to see you  warden  yes
prince  last night  too  warden  last night  too
prince  what was it like  warden (sitting up straight)  same as usual
prince stands up
warden  same as usual
quiet till midnight
i'm lying in bed    excuse me    smoking my pipe
my granddaughter is asleep in the next bed
at midnight comes the first knock at the window
i look at the clock
always to the minute
two more knocks  they mingle with the striking of the tower clock  but i can still hear them
these are no human knuckles
but i know all that and don't budge
then it clears its throat outside  it's surprised that in spite of all that knocking i haven't opened the window
let his princely highness be surprised  the old warden is still there  (shows his fist ) prince  you're threatening me  warden (doesn't immediately understand)  not you
the one at the window  prince  who is it  warden  he shows himself at once all of a sudden window and shutters are opened
i just have time to throw the blanket over my grandchild's face
the storm blows in  promptly puts the light out
duke friedrich  his face with beard and hair completely fills my poor window
how he has grown throughout the centuries  when he opens his mouth to speak the wind blows his old beard between his teeth and he bites on it
prince  just a moment
you say duke friedrich  which friedrich  warden  duke friedrich  just duke friedrich
prince  is that the name he gives  warden (anxiously)  no  he doesn't give it
prince  and yet you know    (breaking off)    go on  warden  shall i go on  prince  of course
all this very much concerns me
there must be an error in the distribution of labor
you're overworked
warden (kneeling)  don't take my job away  your highness
having lived for you all these years  let me also die for you  don't wall up the grave i'm struggling toward
i serve willingly and am still strong enough to serve
to be granted an audience like today's  to take a rest with my master    this gives me strength for ten years
prince (putting warden back on divan)  no one's going to take your job from you
how could i get along without your experience  but i'll appoint another warden  then you'll become head warden
warden  am i not good enough  have i ever let anyone pass  prince  into the friedrichspark  warden  no  out of the park
who'd want to come in  if ever anyone stops at the railing i beckon to him from the window and he runs away
but out  everyone wants to get out
after midnight you can see all the voices from the grave assembled around my house
i think it's only because they are so closely packed together that the whole lot of them don't burst through my narrow window
if it gets too bad  however  i grab the lantern from under my bed  swing it high  and with laughter and moaning these incredible creatures scatter in all directions
then i can hear them rustling even in the farthest bush at the end of the park
but they soon gather together again
prince  and do they tell you what they want  warden  first they give orders
especially duke friedrich
no living being could be so confident
every night for thirty years he has been expecting me to give in
prince  if he has been coming for thirty years it can't be duke friedrich  for he has been dead only fifteen years
on the other hand  he is the only one of that name in the tomb
warden (too carried away by his story}  that i don't know  your highness  i never went to school
i only know how he begins
 old dog   he begins at the window   the gentlemen are knocking and you just stay in your filthy bed   they have a particular grudge against beds  by the way
and now every night we have the same conversation  he outside  i opposite him  my back to the door
i say   i'm only on day duty   the duke turns and shouts into the park   he's only on day duty   whereupon all the assembled aristocracy burst out laughing
then the duke says to me again   but it is day   i say curtly   you're wrong   the duke   night or day  open the door   i   that's against my orders   and with my pipe i point at a notice on the door
the duke   but you're our warden   i   your warden  but employed by the reigning prince   he   our warden  that's the main thing
so open up  and be quick about it   i   no   he   idiot  you'll lose your job
prince leo has invited us for today   prince (quickly)  i  warden  you
pause
warden  when i hear your name i lose my firmness
that's why i have always taken care to lean against the door which is almost the only thing that holds me up
outside  everyone's singing your name
 where's the invitation   i ask weakly
 bedbug   he shouts   you doubt my ducal word   i say   i have no orders  so i won't open  i won't open  i won't open       he won't open   shouts the duke outside
 so come on  all of you  the whole dynasty  at the door  we'll open it ourselves   and a moment later there's nothing under my window
pause
prince  is that all  warden  all  my real service begins only now
i rush out of the door  around the house  and promptly run into the duke and there we are  locked in combat
he so big  i so small  he so broad  i so thin  i can fight only with his feet  but now and again he lifts me up in the air and then i fight up there  too
all his comrades stand around in a circle and make fun of me one  for instance  cuts open my trousers behind and they all play with the tail of my shirt while i'm fighting
can't understand why they laugh  as until now i've always won
prince  how is it possible for you to win  have you any weapons  warden  i carried weapons only during the first years
what good could they be against him  they only hampered me
we just fight with our fists  or rather with the strength of our breath
and you're in my thoughts all the time
pause
warden  but i never doubt my victory
only sometimes i'm afraid the duke will let me slip through his fingers and forget that he's fighting
prince  and when do you win  warden  at dawn
then he throws me down and spits at me
that's his confession of defeat
but i have to go on lying there for an hour before i can get my breath back properly
pause
prince (standing up)  but tell me  don't you know what they really want  warden  to get out of the park
prince  but why  warden  that i don't know
prince  haven't you asked  warden  no
prince  why not  warden  it would embarrass me
but if you wish  i'll ask them today
prince (shocked  loud)  today  warden (knowingly)  yes  today
prince  and you can't even guess what they want  warden (thoughtfully)  no
pause
warden  perhaps i ought to add that sometimes in the early mornings while i'm lying there trying to get my breath and even too weak to open my eyes  there comes a delicate  moist creature  rather hairy to the touch  a latecomer  the countess isabella
she runs her hand all over me  catches hold of my beard  her whole body glides along my neck  under my chin  and she's in the habit of saying   not the others  but me    let me out   i shake my head as much as i can
 i want to go to prince leo  to offer him my hand   i keep on shaking my head
 but me  me   i can still hear her crying  then she's gone
and my granddaughter appears with blankets  wraps me up in them  and waits with me till i can walk on my own
an exceptionally good girl
prince  isabella  the name's unknown to me
pause
prince  to offer me her hand  (goes to window  looks out ) enter servant through center door
servant  her highness  m'lady the princess  awaits you
prince (looks absent mindedly at servant
turns to warden)  wait till i come back
(exit left ) chamberlain enters at once through center door  then the lord high steward (youngish man in officer's uniform) through door on right
warden (ducks behind divan and flourishes his hands as though seeing ghosts)
steward  the prince has gone  chamberlain  following your advice  the princess sent for him
steward  good
(turns suddenly  bends over behind divan ) and you  miserable ghost  you actually dare to appear here in the princely castle  aren't you afraid of the great boot that'll kick you through the door  warden  i'm    i'm  steward  quiet  first of all keep quiet  don't utter    and sit down here in this corner  (to chamberlain) i thank you for informing me about the latest princely whim
chamberlain  you inquired about it
steward  even so
and now a confidential word
purposely in front of that creature there
you  count  are flirting with the opposition
chamberlain  is that an accusation  steward  an apprehension  so far
chamberlain  in that case i can answer
i'm not flirting with the opposition  for i don't know it
i can feel the currents  but i steer clear of them
i still represent the open policy that prevailed under duke friedrich
at that time the only policy at court was to serve the prince
this was made easier by his being a bachelor  but it should never be difficult
steward  very sensible    except that one's own nose  however reliable  never points the right way all the time
this can only be achieved by reason
but reason must make decisions
let's assume the prince is on the wrong track  does one serve him better by following him down or  with all due respect  by chasing him back  undoubtedly by chasing him back
chamberlain  you came here with the princess from a foreign court  have spent a mere six months here  and you already think you can tell the difference between good and evil in the complicated conditions of this court  steward  he who blinks sees only complications
he who keeps his eyes open sees the eternal truth in the first hours as clearly as after a hundred years
admittedly  in this case  a sad truth which in the next few days  however  may take a decisive turn for the better
chamberlain  i cannot believe that the decision which you wish to bring about and which i know only from your announcement will be a good one
i'm afraid you misunderstand our prince  the court  and everything here
steward  whether understood or misunderstood  the present situation is unbearable
chamberlain  unbearable it may be  but it is founded on the nature of things as they are here  and we are prepared to bear it to the end
steward  but not the princess  not i  not those who are on our side
chamberlain  what do you find so unbearable  steward  just because the decision is imminent i want to speak frankly
the prince has a dual nature
the one  concerning itself with government  wavers absentmindedly in public  disregarding its own privileges
the other nature admittedly searches very painstakingly for a strengthening of its foundations
it searches for them in the past  delving deeper and deeper
what a misunderstanding of the situation  a misunderstanding that doesn't lack greatness    although its defectiveness is even greater than its appearance
can you fail to see that  chamberlain  it's not the description i object to  it's the interpretation
steward  the interpretation  and to think that in the hope of getting you to agree  i have judged the situation with more leniency than i actually feel  and i'm still withholding my verdict in order to spare you
but just one thing  in reality the prince does not need a strengthening of his foundations
if he uses all the power at present at his disposal  he'll find it sufficient to bring about everything that the most extreme responsibility before god and man may demand of him
but he shies away from the balance of life  he's on his way to becoming a tyrant
chamberlain  he with his modest character  steward  it's the modesty of the one half  for he needs all his energy for the second half which scrapes together the foundation needed to build something like the tower of babel
to hinder this work should be the sole policy of all those who are interested in their personal existence  in the principality  in the princess  and possibly even in the prince
chamberlain   possibly even     you're very candid
to be equally frank  your candor makes me tremble at the imminent decision
and i regret  as i've recently come to regret more and more  that i'm devoted to the prince almost to the point of helplessness
steward  everything is clear
you are not flirting with the opposition
in fact  you are even holding out a hand
only one  which is commendable for an old courtier
and yet your only hope is that our great example carries you along
chamberlain  whatever i can do to prevent it  i shall do
steward  it doesn't frighten me anymore
(pointing to the warden ) and you who've been sitting there so quietly  have you understood everything that's been said  chamberlain  the warden of the tomb  steward  the warden of the tomb
one must probably be a stranger to size him up
isn't that so  old boy  you little old screech owl  you  have you ever seen him flying through the forest in the evening  out of any gun's reach  but by day he ducks at the slightest move
chamberlain  i don't understand
warden (almost in tears)  you're scolding me  sir  and i don't know why
please let me go home
i'm really not evil  i'm just the warden of the tomb
chamberlain  you mistrust him
steward  mistrust  no  he's too insignificant for that
but i want to keep an eye on him
for i think    call it whim or superstition  if you like    that he's not just a mere tool of evil  but an upright  active worker for evil
chamberlain  he has been serving the court quietly for thirty years    possibly without ever having been in the castle
steward  oh  moles like him build long passages before they emerge
(suddenly turns to warden ) but first of all  away with this one  (to servant) take him to the friedrichspark  stay with him  and don't let him out until further notice
warden (very frightened)  i'm supposed to wait for his highness  the prince
steward  an error
   off with you
chamberlain  he must be treated with care
he's an old and sick man  and for some reason the prince sets store by him
warden (bowing low before chamberlain)
steward  what  (to servant) treat him carefully  but for god's sake get him out of here
quick  servant (about to grab him)
chamberlain (stepping between them)  no  we must get a carriage
steward  it's the air at this court
i can't taste a grain of salt anywhere
all right then  a carriage
you take the treasure away in a carriage
but now  out of the room with you both  (to chamberlain) your behavior shows me    warden (collapses  with a little scream  on way to door)
steward (stamping his foot)  is it impossible to get rid of him  pick him up in your arms if there's no other way can't you understand what's expected of you  chamberlain  the prince  servant (opening door at left)
steward  ah  (glances at warden ) i should have known that ghosts cannot be transported
prince (enters with quick step  behind him the princess  dark young woman with teeth clenched  stops in doorway)
prince  what's happened  steward  the warden felt ill  i was about to have him taken away
prince  i should have been notified
has the doctor been sent for  chamberlain  i'll have him called
(hurries out by center door  returns at once ) prince (kneeling beside warden)  prepare a bed for him  fetch a stretcher  is the doctor on his way  he's taking a long time the pulse is very weak
i can't hear the heart
these miserable ribs  how worn out this body is  (stands up suddenly  fetches a glass of water  stares about him ) one is so helpless (kneels down again  moistens the warden's face ) now he's breathing better
it won't be so bad
healthy stock  the kind that doesn't give up  even in extremity
but the doctor  the doctor  (while he glances toward the door  the warden raises his hand and caresses the prince's cheek
princess turns her head away  toward the window
enter servants with stretcher  prince helps to lift warden ) prince  handle him gently oh  you with your great claws  lift his head a little
nearer the stretcher the pillow further down his back
his arm  his arm  you're all bad  bad nurses  i wonder if you'll ever be as tired as this man on the stretcher     there we are    and now with slow    slow    steps and above all  steadily
(turning in door to princess ) here then is the warden of the tomb
princess (nods)
prince  i had intended to show him to you differently
(after taking another step ) aren't you coming along  princess  i'm so tired
prince  the moment i've talked to the doctor i'll come back
and you  gentlemen  who wish to make your report  wait for me
steward (to princess)  does your highness require my services  princess  always
i am grateful for your vigilance
do not abandon it  even if today it was in vain
everything is at stake
you see more than i
i am always in my rooms but i know it will get more and more gloomy
this autumn is sad beyond belief
a country doctor i was in great perplexity  i had to start on an urgent journey  a seriously ill patient was waiting for me in a village ten miles off  a thick blizzard of snow filled all the wide spaces between him and me  i had a gig  a light gig with big wheels  exactly right for our country roads  muffled in furs  my bag of instruments in my hand  i was in the courtyard all ready for the journey  but there was no horse to be had  no horse
my own horse had died in the night  worn out by the fatigues of this icy winter  my servant girl was now running around the village trying to borrow a horse  but it was hopeless  i knew it  and i stood there forlornly  with the snow gathering more and more thickly upon me  more and more unable to move
in the gateway the girl appeared  alone  and waved the lantern  of course  who would lend a horse at this time for such a journey  i strode through the courtyard once more  i could see no way out  in my confused distress i kicked at the dilapidated door of the yearlong uninhabited pigsty
it flew open and flapped to and fro on its hinges
a steam and smell as of horses came out from it
a dim stable lantern was swinging inside from a rope
a man  crouching on his hams in that low space  showed an open blue eyed face  shall i yoke up   he asked  crawling out on all fours
i did not know what to say and merely stooped down to see what else was in the sty
the servant girl was standing beside me
 you never know what you're going to find in your own house   she said  and we both laughed
 hey there  brother  hey there  sister   called the groom  and two horses  enormous creatures with powerful flanks  one after the other  their legs tucked close to their bodies  each well shaped head lowered like a camel's  by sheer strength of buttocking squeezed out through the door hole which they filled entirely
but at once they were standing up  their legs long and their bodies steaming thickly
 give him a hand   i said  and the willing girl hurried to help the groom with the harnessing
yet hardly was she beside him when the groom clipped hold of her and pushed his face against hers
she screamed and fled back to me  on her cheek stood out in red the marks of two rows of teeth
 you brute   i yelled in fury   do you want a whipping   but in the same moment reflected that the man was a stranger  that i did not know where he came from  and that of his own free will he was helping me out when everyone else had failed me
as if he knew my thoughts he took no offense at my threat but  still busied with the horses  only turned around once toward me
 get in   he said then  and indeed  everything was ready
a magnificent pair of horses  i observed  such as i had never sat behind  and i climbed in happily
 but i'll drive  you don't know the way   i said
 of course   said he   i'm not coming with you anyway  i'm staying with rose    no   shrieked rose  fleeing into the house with a justified presentiment that her fate was inescapable  i heard the door chain rattle as she put it up  i heard the key turn in the lock  i could see  moreover  how she put out the lights in the entrance hall and in further flight all though the rooms to keep herself from being discovered  you're coming with me   i said to the groom   or i won't go  urgent as my journey is
i'm not thinking of paying for it by handing the girl over to you    gee up   he said  clapped his hands  the gig whirled off like a log in a freshet  i could just hear the door of my house splitting and bursting as the groom charged at it and then i was deafened and blinded by a storming rush that steadily buffeted all my senses
but this only for a moment  since  as if my patient's farmyard had opened out just before my courtyard gate  i was already there  the horses had come quietly to a standstill  the blizzard had stopped  moonlight all around  my patient's parents hurried out of the house  his sister behind them  i was almost lifted out of the gig  from their confused ejaculations i gathered not a word  in the sickroom the air was almost unbreathable  the neglected stove was smoking  i wanted to push open a window  but first i had to look at my patient
gaunt  without any fever  not cold  not warm  with vacant eyes  without a shirt  the youngster heaved himself up from under the feather bedding  threw his arms around my neck  and whispered in my ear   doctor  let me die   i glanced around the room  no one had heard it  the parents were leaning forward in silence waiting for my verdict  the sister had set a chair for my handbag  i opened the bag and hunted among my instruments  the boy kept clutching at me from his bed to remind me of his entreaty  i picked up a pair of tweezers  examined them in the candlelight  and laid them down again  yes   i thought blasphemously   in cases like this the gods are helpful  send the missing horse  add to it a second because of the urgency  and to crown everything bestow even a groom     and only now did i remember rose again  what was i to do  how could i rescue her  how could i pull her away from under that groom at ten miles' distance  with a team of horses i couldn't control
these horses  now  they had somehow slipped the reins loose  pushed the windows open from outside  i did not know how  each of them had stuck a head in at a window and  quite unmoved by the startled cries of the family  stood eyeing the patient
 better go back at once   i thought  as if the horses were summoning me to the return journey  yet i permitted the patient's sister  who fancied that i was dazed by the heat  to take my fur coat from me
a glass of rum was poured out for me  the old man clapped me on the shoulder  a familiarity justified by this offer of his treasure
i shook my head  in the narrow confines of the old man's thoughts i felt ill  that was my only reason for refusing the drink
the mother stood by the bedside and cajoled me toward it  i yielded  and  while one of the horses whinnied loudly to the ceiling  laid my head to the boy's breast  which shivered under my wet beard
i confirmed what i already knew  the boy was quite sound  something a little wrong with his circulation  saturated with coffee by his solicitous mother  but sound and best turned out of bed with one shove
i am no world reformer and so i let him lie
i was the district doctor and did my duty to the uttermost  to the point where it became almost too much
i was badly paid and yet generous and helpful to the poor
i had still to see that rose was all right  and then the boy might have his way and i wanted to die too
what was i doing there in that endless winter  my horse was dead  and not a single person in the village would lend me another
i had to get my team out of the pigsty  if they hadn't chanced to be horses i should have had to travel with swine
that was how it was
and i nodded to the family
they knew nothing about it  and  had they known  would not have believed it
to write prescriptions is easy  but to come to an understanding with people is hard
well  this should be the end of my visit  i had once more been called out needlessly  i was used to that  the whole district made my life a torment with my night bell  but that i should have to sacrifice rose this time as well  the pretty girl who had lived in my house for years almost without my noticing her    that sacrifice was too much to ask  and i had somehow to get it reasoned out in my head with the help of what craft i could muster  in order not to let fly at this family  which with the best will in the world could not restore rose to me
but as i shut my bag and put an arm out for my fur coat  the family meanwhile standing together  the father sniffing at the glass of rum in his hand  the mother  apparently disappointed in me    why  what do people expect     biting her lips with tears in her eyes  the sister fluttering a blood soaked towel  i was somehow ready to admit conditionally that the boy might be ill after all
i went toward him  he welcomed me smiling as if i were bringing him the most nourishing invalid broth    ah  now both horses were whinnying together  the noise  i suppose  was ordained by heaven to assist my examination of the patient    and this time i discovered that the boy was indeed ill
in his right side  near the hip  was an open wound as big as the palm of my hand
rosered  in many variations of shade  dark in the hollows  lighter at the edges  softly granulated  with irregular clots of blood  open as a surface mine to the daylight
that was how it looked from a distance
but on a closer inspection there was another complication
i could not help a low whistle of surprise
worms  as thick and as long as my little finger  themselves rose red and blood spotted as well  were wriggling from their fastness in the interior of the wound toward the light  with small white heads and many little legs poor boy  you were past helping
i had discovered your great wound  this blossom in your side was destroying you
the family was pleased  they saw me busying myself  the sister told the mother  the mother the father  the father told several guests who were coming in  through the moonlight at the open door  walking on tiptoe  keeping their balance with outstretched arms  will you save me   whispered the boy with a sob  quite blinded by the life within his wound that is what people are like in my district
always expecting the impossible from the doctor
they have lost their ancient beliefs  the parson sits at home and unravels his vestments  one after another  but the doctor is supposed to be omnipotent with his merciful surgeon's hand
well  as it pleases them  i have not thrust my services on them  if they misuse me for sacred ends  i let that happen to me too  what better do i want  old country doctor that i am  bereft of my servant girl  and so they came  the family and the village elders  and stripped my clothes off me  a school choir with the teacher at the head of it stood before the house and sang these words to an utterly simple tune  strip his clothes off  then he'll heal us  if he doesn't  kill him dead  only a doctor  only a doctor
then my clothes were off and i looked at the people quietly  my fingers in my beard and my head cocked to one side
i was altogether composed and equal to the situation and remained so  although it was no help to me  since they now took me by the head and feet and carried me to the bed
they laid me down in it next to the wall  on the side of the wound
then they all left the room  the door was shut  the singing stopped  clouds covered the moon  the bedding was warm around me  the horses' heads in the open windows wavered like shadows
 do you know   said a voice in my ear   i have very little confidence in you
why  you were only blown in here  you didn't come on your own feet
instead of helping me  you're cramping me on my deathbed
what i'd like best is to scratch your eyes out    right   i said   it is a shame
and yet i am a doctor
what am i to do  believe me  it is not too easy for me either    am i supposed to be content with this apology  oh  i must be  i can't help it
i always have to put up with things
a fine wound is all i brought into the world  that was my sole endowment    my young friend   said i   your mistake is  you have not a wide enough view
i have been in all the sickrooms  far and wide  and i tell you  your wound is not so bad done in a tight corner with two strokes of the ax
many a one proffers his side and can hardly hear the ax in the forest  far less that it is coming nearer to him    is that really so  or are you deluding me in my fever    it is really so  take the word of honor of an official doctor   and he took it and lay still
but now it was time for me to think of escaping
the horses were still standing faithfully in their places
my clothes  my fur coat  my bag were quickly collected  i didn't want to waste time dressing  if the horses raced home as they had come  i should only be springing  as it were  out of this bed into my own
obediently a horse backed away from the window  i threw my bundle into the gig  the fur coat missed its mark and was caught on a hook only by the sleeve
good enough
i swung myself onto the horse
with the reins loosely trailing  one horse barely fastened to the other  the gig swaying behind  my fur coat last of all in the snow
 gee up   i said  but there was no galloping  slowly  like old men  we crawled through the snowy wastes  a long time echoed behind us the new but faulty song of the children  o be joyful  all you patients  the doctor's laid in bed beside you  never shall i reach home at this rate  my flourishing practice is done for  my successor is robbing me  but in vain  for he cannot take my place  in my house the disgusting groom is raging  rose is his victim  i do not want to think about it anymore
naked  exposed to the frost of this most unhappy of ages  with an earthly vehicle  unearthly horses  old man that i am  i wander astray
my fur coat is hanging from the back of the gig  but i cannot reach it  and none of my limber pack of patients lifts a finger
betrayed  betrayed  a false alarm on the night bell once answered    it cannot be made good  not ever
the hunter gracchus two boys were sitting on the harbor wall playing with dice
a man was reading a newspaper on the steps of the monument  resting in the shadow of a hero who was flourishing his sword on high
a girl was filling her bucket at the fountain
a fruitseller was lying beside his wares  gazing at the lake
through the vacant window and door openings of a cafe one could see two men quite at the back drinking their wine
the proprietor was sitting at a table in front and dozing
a bark was silently making for the little harbor  as if borne by invisible means over the water
a man in a blue blouse climbed ashore and drew the rope through a ring
behind the boatman two other men in dark coats with silver buttons carried a bier  on which  beneath a great flower patterned fringed silk cloth  a man was apparently lying
nobody on the quay troubled about the newcomers  even when they lowered the bier to wait for the boatman  who was still occupied with his rope  nobody went nearer  nobody asked them a question  nobody accorded them an inquisitive glance
the pilot was still further detained by a woman who  a child at her breast  now appeared with loosened hair on the deck of the boat
then he advanced and indicated a yellowish two storeyed house that rose abruptly on the left near the water  the bearers took up their burden and bore it to the low but gracefully pillared door
a little boy opened a window just in time to see the party vanishing into the house  then hastily shut the window again
the door too was now shut  it was of black oak  and very strongly made
a flock of doves which had been flying around the belfry alighted in the street before the house
as if their food were stored within  they assembled in front of the door
one of them flew up to the first storey and pecked at the windowpane
they were bright hued  well tended  lively birds
the woman on the boat flung grain to them in a wide sweep  they ate it up and flew across to the woman
a man in a top hat tied with a band of black crêpe now descended one of the narrow and very steep lanes that led to the harbor
he glanced around vigilantly  everything seemed to distress him  his mouth twisted at the sight of some offal in a corner
fruit skins were lying on the steps of the monument  he swept them off in passing with his stick
he rapped at the house door  at the same time taking his top hat from his head with his black gloved hand
the door was opened at once  and some fifty little boys appeared in two rows in the long entry hall  and bowed to him
the boatman descended the stairs  greeted the gentleman in black  conducted him up to the first storey  led him around the bright and elegant loggia which encircled the courtyard  and both of them entered  while the boys pressed after them at a respectful distance  a cool spacious room looking toward the back  from whose window no habitation  but only a bare  blackish gray rocky wall was to be seen
the bearers were busied in setting up and lighting several long candles at the head of the bier  yet these did not give light  but only disturbed the shadows which had been immobile till then  and made them flicker over the walls
the cloth covering the bier had been thrown back
lying on it was a man with wildly matted hair  who looked somewhat like a hunter
he lay without motion and  it seemed  without breathing  his eyes closed  yet only his trappings indicated that this man was probably dead
the gentleman stepped up to the bier  laid his hand on the brow of the man lying upon it  then kneeled down and prayed
the boatman made a sign to the bearers to leave the room  they went out  drove away the boys who had gathered outside  and shut the door
but even that did not seem to satisfy the gentleman  he glanced at the boatman  the boatman understood  and vanished through a side door into the next room
at once the man on the bier opened his eyes  turned his face painfully toward the gentleman  and said   who are you   without any mark of surprise the gentleman rose from his kneeling posture and answered   the burgomaster of riva   the man on the bier nodded  indicated a chair with a feeble movement of his arm  and said  after the burgomaster had accepted his invitation   i knew that  of course  burgomaster  but in the first moments of returning consciousness i always forget  everything goes around before my eyes  and it is best to ask about anything even if i know
you too probably know that i am the hunter gracchus    certainly   said the burgomaster
 your arrival was announced to me during the night
we had been asleep for a good while
then toward midnight my wife cried  'salvatore'    that's my name    'look at that dove at the window ' it was really a dove  but as big as a cock
it flew over me and said in my ear  'tomorrow the dead hunter gracchus is coming  receive him in the name of the city '   the hunter nodded and licked his lips with the tip of his tongue   yes  the doves flew here before me
but do you believe  burgomaster  that i shall remain in riva    i cannot say that yet   replied the burgomaster
 are you dead    yes   said the hunter   as you see
many years ago  yes  it must be a great many years ago  i fell from a precipice in the black forest    that is in germany    when i was hunting a chamois
since then i have been dead    but you are alive too   said the burgomaster
 in a certain sense   said the hunter   in a certain sense i am alive too
my death ship lost its way  a wrong turn of the wheel  a moment's absence of mind on the pilot's part  the distraction of my lovely native country  i cannot tell what it was  i only know this  that i remained on earth and that ever since my ship has sailed earthly waters
so i  who asked for nothing better than to live among my mountains  travel after my death through all the lands of the earth    and you have no part in the other world   asked the burgomaster  knitting his brow
 i am forever   replied the hunter   on the great stair that leads up to it
on that infinitely wide and spacious stair i clamber about  sometimes up  sometimes down  sometimes on the right  sometimes on the left  always in motion
the hunter has been turned into a butterfly
do not laugh    i am not laughing   said the burgomaster in self defense
 that is very good of you   said the hunter
 i am always in motion
but when i make a supreme flight and see the gate actually shining before me i awaken presently on my old ship  still stranded forlornly in some earthly sea or other
the fundamental error of my onetime death grins at me as i lie in my cabin
julia  the wife of the pilot  knocks at the door and brings me on my bier the morning drink of the land whose coasts we chance to be passing
i lie on a wooden pallet  i wear    it cannot be a pleasure to look at me    a filthy winding sheet  my hair and beard  black tinged with gray  have grown together inextricably  my limbs are covered with a great floweredpatterned woman's shawl with long fringes
a sacramental candle stands at my head and lights me
on the wall opposite me is a little picture  evidently of a bushman who is aiming his spear at me and taking cover as best he can behind a beautifully painted shield
on shipboard one often comes across silly pictures  but that is the silliest of them all
otherwise my wooden cage is quite empty
through a hole in the side the warm airs of the southern night come in  and i hear the water slapping against the old boat
 i have lain here ever since the time when  as the hunter gracchus living in the black forest  i followed a chamois and fell from a precipice
everything happened in good order
i pursued  i fell  bled to death in a ravine  died  and this ship should have conveyed me to the next world
i can still remember how gladly i stretched myself out on this pallet for the first time never did the mountains listen to such songs from me as these shadowy walls did then
 i had been glad to live and i was glad to die
before i stepped aboard  i joyfully flung away my wretched load of ammunition  my knapsack  my hunting rifle that i had always been proud to carry  and i slipped into my winding sheet like a girl into her marriage dress i lay and waited
then came the mishap    a terrible fate   said the burgomaster  raising his hand defensively
 and you bear no blame for it    none   said the hunter
 i was a hunter  was there any sin in that  i followed my calling as a hunter in the black forest  where there were still wolves in those days
i lay in ambush  shot  hit my mark  flayed the skins from my victims  was there any sin in that  my labors were blessed 'the great hunter of the black forest' was the name i was given
was there any sin in that    i am not called upon to decide that   said the burgomaster   but to me also there seems to be no sin in such things but then  whose is the guilt    the boatman's   said the hunter
 nobody will read what i say here  no one will come to help me  even if all the people were commanded to help me  every door and window would remain shut  everybody would take to bed and draw the bedclothes over his head  the whole earth would become an inn for the night
and there is sense in that  for nobody knows of me  and if anyone knew he would not know where i could be found  and if he knew where i could be found  he would not know how to deal with me  he would not know how to help me
the thought of helping me is an illness that has to be cured by taking to one's bed
 i know that  and so i do not shout to summon help  even though at moments     when i lose control over myself  as i have done just now  for instance    i think seriously of it
but to drive out such thoughts i need only look around me and verify where i am  and    i can safely assert    have been for hundreds of years    extraordinary   said the burgomaster   extraordinary
and now do you think of staying here in riva with us    i think not   said the hunter with a smile  and  to excuse himself  he laid his hand on the burgomaster's knee  i am here  more than that i do not know  further than that i cannot go
my ship has no rudder  and it is driven by the wind that blows in the undermost regions of death   the hunter gracchus  a fragment is it true  hunter gracchus  that you have been cruising about in this old boat for hundreds of years  for fifteen hundred years
and always in this ship  always in this bark
bark  i believe  is the correct expression
you aren't familiar with nautical matters  no  i never gave them a thought until today  until i heard about you  until i boarded your ship
don't apologize
i'm from the interior  too
never been a seafarer  never wanted to be one  mountains and forests were my friends  and now    most ancient of seafarers  hunter gracchus  patron saint of sailors  hunter gracchus    the cabin boy shivering with fear in the crow's nest in the stormy night prays to me with wringing hands
don't laugh
me laugh  certainly not
with a beating heart i stood before your cabin door  with a beating heart i entered
your friendly manner has calmed me a little  but i'll never forget whose guest i am
you're right  of course
however it may be  i am hunter gracchus
won't you drink some wine  i don't know the brand  but it's sweet and heavy  the master does me proud
not just now  i'm too restless
later perhaps  if you can bear with me that long
besides  i wouldn't dare drink out of your glass
who is the master  the owner of the bark
they are excellent men  these masters
except that i don't understand them
i don't mean their language  although of course i often don't understand their language  either
but this is beside the point
over the centuries i've learned enough languages to act as interpreter between this generation and their ancestors
what i don't understand is the way the masters' minds work
perhaps you can explain it to me
i haven't much hope
how could i explain anything to you  compared with whom i am but a babbling babe  don't  don't talk like that
you'd do me a favor if you'd be a little more manly  more self assured
what am i to do with a mere shadow of a guest  i'll blow him through the porthole into the lake
i need several explanations
you who roam around outside can give me them
but if you sit trembling at my table here and by selfdeception forget the little you know  then you may as well clear out at once
what i mean  i say
there's something in that
in fact  i am superior to you in some ways
so i'll try to control myself
ask away  better  far better that you exaggerate in this direction and that you fancy yourself to be somehow superior
but you must understand me properly
i am a human being like you  i'm as many centuries more impatient as i am older than you
well  let's talk about the masters
listen  and drink some wine  to sharpen your wits
don't be shy
take a good swig
there's another large shipload there
gracchus  that's an excellent wine
long live the master  pity that he died today
he was a good man and he went peacefully
healthy  grown up children stood at his deathbed  his wife had fainted at the foot  but his last thought was for me
a good man  a hamburger
heavens above  a hamburger  and you down here in the south know that he died today  what  i not know when my master dies  you're really a bit simple minded
are you trying to insult me  not at all  i do it without meaning to
but you shouldn't be so surprised
drink more wine
as for the masters  it's like this  originally  the bark belonged to no one
gracchus  one request
first  tell me briefly but coherently how things are with you
to be truthful  i really don't know
you of course take these things for granted and assume  as is your way  that the whole world knows about them
but in this brief human life    and life really is brief  gracchus  try to grasp that    in this brief life it's as much as one can do to get oneself and one's family through
interesting as the hunter gracchus is    this is conviction  not flattery    there's no time to think of him  to find out about him  let alone worry about him
perhaps on one's deathbed  like your hamburger  this i don't know
perhaps the busy man will then have a chance to stretch out for the first time and let the green hunter gracchus pass for once through his idle thoughts but otherwise  it's as i've said  i knew nothing about you  business brought me down here to the harbor  i saw the bark  the gangplank lay ready  i walked across    but now i'd like to know something coherent about you
ah  coherent
that old  old story
all the books are full of it  teachers draw it on the blackboard in every school  the mother dreams of it while suckling her child  lovers murmur it while embracing  merchants tell it to the customers  the customers to the merchants  soldiers sing it on the march  preachers declaim it in church  historians in their studies realize with open mouths what happened long ago and never cease describing it  it is printed in the newspapers and people pass it from hand to hand  the telegraph was invented so that it might encircle the world the faster  it is excavated from ruined cities  and the elevator rushes it up to the top of the skyscraper railway passengers announce it from the windows to the countries they are passing through  but even before that the savages have howled it at them  it can be read in the stars and the lakes reflect it  the streams bring it down from the mountains and the snow scatters it again on the summit  and you  man  sit here and ask me for coherence you must have had an exceptionally dissipated youth
possibly  as is typical of any youth
but it would be very useful  i think  if you would go and have a good look around the world
strange as it may seem to you  and sitting here it surprises even me  it's a fact that you are not the talk of the town  however many subjects may be discussed you are not among them  the world goes its way and you go on your journey  but until today i have never noticed that your paths have crossed
these are your observations  my dear friend  other people have made others
there are only two possibilities here
either you conceal what you know about me  and do so with a definite motive
in which case let me tell you frankly  you are on the wrong track
or you actually think that you can't remember me  because you confuse my story with someone else's
in that case i can only tell you  i am    no  i can't  everyone knows it and of all people i should be the one to tell you  it's so long ago
ask the historians  go to them  and then come back
it's so long ago
how can i be expected to keep it in this overcrowded brain  wait  gracchus  i'll make it easier for you  i'll ask you some questions
where do you come from  from the black forest  as everyone knows
from the black forest  of course
and was it there  around about the fourth century  that you used to hunt  man alive  do you know the black forest  no
you really don't know anything
the helmsman's little child knows more than you  probably far more who on earth sent you in here  it's fate
your obtrusive modesty was indeed only too well justified
you are a nonentity whom i'm filling up with wine
now you don't even know the black forest
and i was born there
i hunted there until i was twenty five
if only the chamois had not led me astray    well  now you know it    i'd have had a long pleasant hunter's life  but the chamois led me on  i fell down a precipice and was killed on the rocks
don't ask any more
here i am  dead  dead  dead
don't know why i'm here
was loaded onto the death ship  as befits a miserable dead man  the three or four ministrations were performed upon me  as on everyone  why should they make an exception of the hunter gracchus  everything was in order  i lay stretched out in the boat the great wall of china the great wall of china was finished off at its northernmost corner
from the southeast and the southwest it came up in two sections that finally converged there
this principle of piecemeal construction was also applied on a smaller scale by both of the two great armies of labor  the eastern and the western
it was done in this way  gangs of some twenty workers were formed who had to accomplish a length  say  of five hundred yards of wall  while a similar gang built another stretch of the same length to meet the first but after the junction had been made the construction of the wall was not carried on from the point  let us say  where this thousand yards ended  instead the two groups of workers were transferred to begin building again in quite different neighborhoods
naturally in this way many great gaps were left  which were only filled in gradually and bit by bit  some  indeed  not till after the official announcement that the wall was finished
in fact it is said that there are gaps which have never been filled in at all  an assertion  however  that is probably merely one of the many legends to which the building of the wall gave rise  and which cannot be verified  at least by any single man with his own eyes and judgment  on account of the extent of the structure
now on first thoughts one might conceive that it would have been more advantageous in every way to build the wall continuously  or at least continuously within the two main divisions
after all  the wall was intended  as was universally proclaimed and known  to be a protection against the peoples of the north
but how can a wall protect if it is not a continuous structure  not only can such a wall not protect  but what there is of it is in perpetual danger
these blocks of wall left standing in deserted regions could be easily pulled down again and again by the nomads  especially as these tribes  rendered apprehensive by the building operations  kept changing their encampments with incredible rapidity  like locusts  and so perhaps had a better general view of the progress of the wall than we  the builders
nevertheless the task of construction probably could not have been carried out in any other way
to understand this we must take into account the following  the wall was to be a protection for centuries  accordingly  the most scrupulous care in the building  the application of the architectural wisdom of all known ages and peoples  an unremitting sense of personal responsibility in the builders were indispensable prerequisites for the work
true  for the more purely manual tasks ignorant day laborers from the populace  men  women  and children who offered their services for good money  could be employed  but for the supervision even of every four day laborers an expert versed in the art of building was required  a man who was capable of entering into and feeling with all his heart what was involved
and the higher the task  the greater the responsibility
and such men were actually to be had  if not indeed so abundantly as the work of construction could have absorbed  yet in great numbers
for the work had not been undertaken without thought
fifty years before the first stone was laid  the art of architecture  and especially that of masonry  had been proclaimed as the most important branch of knowledge throughout the whole area of a china that was to be walled around  and all other arts gained recognition only insofar as they had reference to it
i can still remember quite well us standing as small children  scarcely sure on our feet  in our teacher's garden  and being ordered to build a sort of wall out of pebbles  and then the teacher  girding up his robe  ran full tilt against the wall  of course knocking it down  and scolded us so terribly for the shoddiness of our work that we ran weeping in all directions to our parents
a trivial incident  but significant of the spirit of the time
i was lucky inasmuch as the building of the wall was just beginning when  at twenty  i had passed the last examination of the lowest school
i say lucky  for many who before my time had achieved the highest degree of culture available to them could find nothing year after year to do with their knowledge  and drifted uselessly about with the most splendid architectural plans in their heads  and sank by thousands into hopelessness
but those who finally came to be employed in the work as supervisors  even though it might be of the lowest rank  were truly worthy of their task
they were masons who had reflected much  and did not cease to reflect  on the building of the wall  men who with the first stone they sank in the ground felt themselves a part of the wall masons of that kind  of course  had not only a desire to perform their work in the most thorough manner  but were also impatient to see the wall finished in its complete perfection
day laborers have not this impatience  for they look only to their wages  and the higher supervisors  indeed even the supervisors of middle rank  could see enough of the manifold growth of the construction to keep their spirits confident and high
but to encourage the subordinate supervisors  intellectually so vastly superior to their apparently petty tasks  other measures must be taken
one could not  for instance  expect them to lay one stone on another for months or even years on end  in an uninhabited mountainous region  hundreds of miles from their homes  the hopelessness of such hard toil  which yet could not reach completion even in the longest lifetime  would have cast them into despair and above all made them less capable for the work
it was for this reason that the system of piecemeal building was decided on
five hundred yards could be accomplished in about five years  by that time  however  the supervisors were as a rule quite exhausted and had lost all faith in themselves  in the wall  in the world accordingly  while they were still exalted by the jubilant celebrations marking the completion of the thousand yards of wall  they were sent far  far away  saw on their journey finished sections of the wall rising here and there  came past the quarters of the high command and were presented with badges of honor  heard the rejoicings of new armies of labor streaming past from the depths of the land  saw forests being cut down to become supports for the wall  saw mountains being hewn into stones for the wall  heard at the holy shrines hymns rising in which the pious prayed for the completion of the wall
all this assuaged their impatience
the quiet life of their homes  where they rested some time  strengthened them  the humble credulity with which their reports were listened to  the confidence with which the simple and peaceful burgher believed in the eventual completion of the wall  all this filled their hearts with a new buoyancy
like eternally hopeful children they then said farewell to their homes  the desire once more to labor on the wall of the nation became irresistible
they set off earlier than they needed  half the village accompanied them for long distances
groups of people with banners and streamers waving were on all the roads  never before had they seen how great and rich and beautiful and worthy of love their country was
every fellow countryman was a brother for whom one was building a wall of protection  and who would return lifelong thanks for it with all he had and did
unity  unity  shoulder to shoulder  a ring of brothers  a current of blood no longer confined within the narrow circulation of one body  but sweetly rolling and yet ever returning throughout the endless leagues of china
thus  then  the system of piecemeal construction becomes comprehensible  but there were still other reasons for it as well
nor is there anything odd in my pausing over this question for so long  it is one of the crucial problems in the whole building of the wall  unimportant as it may appear at first glance if i am to convey and make understandable the ideas and feelings of that time i cannot go deeply enough into this very question
first  then  it must be said that in those days things were achieved scarcely inferior to the construction of the tower of babel  although as regards divine approval  at least according to human reckoning  strongly at variance with that work
i say this because during the early days of building a scholar wrote a book in which he drew the comparison in the most exhaustive way
in it he tried to prove that the tower of babel failed to reach its goal  not because of the reasons universally advanced  or at least that among those recognized reasons the most important of all was not to be found
his proofs were drawn not merely from written documents and reports  he also claimed to have made inquiries on the spot  and to have discovered that the tower failed and was bound to fail because of the weakness of the foundation
in this respect at any rate our age was vastly superior to that ancient one
almost every educated man of our time was a mason by profession and infallible in the matter of laying foundations
that  however  was not what our scholar was concerned to prove  for he maintained that the great wall alone would provide for the first time in the history of mankind a secure foundation for a new tower of babel
first the wall  therefore  and then the tower
his book was in everybody's hands at that time  but i admit that even today i cannot quite make out how he conceived this tower
how could the wall  which did not form even a circle  but only a sort of quarter  or half circle  provide the foundation for a tower  that could obviously be meant only in a spiritual sense
but in that case why build the actual wall  which after all was something concrete  the result of the lifelong labor of multitudes of people  and why were there in the book plans  somewhat nebulous plans  it must be admitted  of the tower  and proposals worked out in detail for mobilizing the people's energies for the stupendous new work  there were many wild ideas in people's heads at that time    this scholar's book is only one example    perhaps simply because so many were trying to join forces as far as they could for the achievement of a single aim
human nature  essentially changeable  unstable as the dust  can endure no restraint  if it binds itself it soon begins to tear madly at its bonds  until it rends everything asunder  the wall  the bonds  and its very self
it is possible that these very considerations  which militated against the building of the wall at all  were not left out of account by the high command when the system of piecemeal construction was decided on
we    and here i speak in the name of many people    did not really know ourselves until we had carefully scrutinized the decrees of the high command  when we discovered that without the high command neither our book learning nor our human understanding would have sufficed for the humble tasks which we performed in the great whole
in the office of the command    where it was and who sat there no one whom i have asked knew then or knows now    in that office one may be certain that all human thoughts and desires revolved in a circle  and all human aims and fulfillments in a countercircle and through the window the reflected splendors of divine worlds fell on the hands of the leaders as they traced their plans
and for that reason the incorruptible observer must hold that the command  if it had seriously desired it  could also have overcome those difficulties that prevented a system of continuous construction
there remains  therefore  nothing but the conclusion that the command deliberately chose the system of piecemeal construction
but the piecemeal construction was only a makeshift and therefore inexpedient
remains the conclusion that the command willed something inexpedient
strange conclusion  true  and yet in one respect it has much to be said for it
one can perhaps safely discuss it now
in those days many people  and among them the best  had a secret maxim which ran  try with all your might to comprehend the decrees of the high command  but only up to a certain point  then avoid further meditation
a very wise maxim  which moreover was elaborated in a parable that was later often quoted  avoid further meditation  but not because it might be harmful  it is not at all certain that it would be harmful
what is harmful or not harmful has nothing to do with the question
consider rather the river in spring
it rises until it grows mightier and nourishes more richly the soil on the long stretch of its banks  still maintaining its own course until it reaches the sea  where it is all the more welcome because it is a worthier ally thus far may you urge your meditations on the decrees of the high command
but after that the river overflows its banks  loses outline and shape  slows down the speed of its current  tries to ignore its destiny by forming little seas in the interior of the land  damages the fields  and yet cannot maintain itself for long in its new expanse  but must run back between its banks again  must even dry up wretchedly in the hot season that presently follows thus far may you not urge your meditations on the decrees of the high command
now though this parable may have had extraordinary point and force during the building of the wall  it has at most only a restricted relevance for my present essay
my inquiry is purely historical  no lightning flashes any longer from the long since vanished thunderclouds  and so i may venture to seek for an explanation of the system of piecemeal construction which goes farther than the one that contented people then
the limits that my capacity for thought imposes upon me are narrow enough  but the province to be traversed here is infinite
against whom was the great wall to serve as a protection  against the people of the north
now  i come from the southeast of china
no northern people can menace us there
we read of them in the books of the ancients  the cruelties they commit in accordance with their nature make us sigh in our peaceful arbors
the faithful representations of the artist show us these faces of the damned  their gaping mouths  their jaws furnished with great pointed teeth  their half shut eyes that already seem to be seeking out the victim which their jaws will rend and devour
when our children are unruly we show them these pictures  and at once they fly weeping into our arms but nothing more than that do we know about these northerners
we have not seen them  and if we remain in our villages we shall never see them  even if on their wild horses they should ride as hard as they can straight toward us    the land is too vast and would not let them reach us  they would end their course in the empty air
why  then  since that is so  did we leave our homes  the stream with its bridges  our mothers and fathers  our weeping wives  our children who needed our care  and depart for the distant city to be trained there  while our thoughts journeyed still farther away to the wall in the north  why  a question for the high command
our leaders know us
they  absorbed in gigantic anxieties  know of us  know our petty pursuits  see us sitting together in our humble huts  and approve or disapprove the evening prayer which the father of the house recites in the midst of his family
and if i may be allowed to express such ideas about the high command  then i must say that in my opinion the high command has existed from old time  and was not assembled  say  like a gathering of mandarins summoned hastily to discuss somebody's fine dream in a conference as hastily terminated  so that that very evening the people are drummed out of their beds to carry out what has been decided  even if it should be nothing but an illumination in honor of a god who may have shown great favor to their masters the day before  only to drive them into some dark corner with cudgel blows tomorrow  almost before the illuminations have died down
far rather do i believe that the high command has existed from all eternity  and the decision to build the wall likewise
unwitting peoples of the north  who imagined they were the cause of it  honest  unwitting emperor  who imagined he decreed it  we builders of the wall know that it was not so and hold our tongues
during the building of the wall and ever since to this very day i have occupied myself almost exclusively with the comparative history of races    there are certain questions that one can probe to the marrow  as it were  only by this method    and i have discovered that we chinese possess certain folk and political institutions that are unique in their clarity  others again unique in their obscurity
the desire to trace the cause of these phenomena  especially the latter  has always intrigued me and intrigues me still  and the building of the wall is itself essentially involved with these problems now one of the most obscure of our institutions is that of the empire itself
in peking  naturally  at the imperial court  there is some clarity to be found on this subject  though even that is more illusive than real
also the teachers of political law and history in the schools of higher learning claim to be exactly informed on these matters  and to be capable of passing on their knowledge to their students
the farther one descends among the lower schools the more  naturally enough  does one find teachers' and pupils' doubts of their own knowledge vanishing  and superficial culture mounting sky high around a few precepts that have been drilled into people's minds for centuries  precepts which  though they have lost nothing of their eternal truth  remain eternally invisible in this fog of confusion
but it is precisely this question of the empire which in my opinion the common people should be asked to answer  since after all they are the empire's final support
here  i must confess  i can only speak once more for my native place
except for the nature gods  and their ritual which fills the whole year in such beautiful and rich alternation  we think only about the emperor
but not about the present one  or rather we would think about the present one if we knew who he was or knew anything definite about him
true    and it is the sole curiosity that fills us    we are always trying to get information on this subject  but  strange as it may sound  it is almost impossible to discover anything  either from pilgrims  though they have wandered through much of our land  or from near or distant villages  or from sailors  though they have navigated not only our little stream  but also the sacred rivers one hears a great many things  true  but can gather nothing definite
so vast is our land that no fable could do justice to its vastness  the heavens can scarcely span it    and peking is only a dot in it  and the imperial palace less than a dot
the emperor as such  on the other hand  is mighty throughout all the hierarchies of the world  admitted
but the existent emperor  a man like us  lies much like us on a couch which is of generous proportions  perhaps  and yet very possibly may be quite narrow and short
like us he sometimes stretches himself and when he is very tired yawns with his delicately cut mouth but how should we know anything about that    thousands of miles away in the south    almost on the borders of the tibetan highlands  and besides  any tidings  even if they did reach us  would arrive far too late  would have become obsolete long before they reached us the emperor is always surrounded by a brilliant and yet ambiguous throng of nobles and courtiers    malice and enmity in the guise of servants and friends    who form a counterweight to the imperial power and perpetually labor to unseat the ruler from his place with poisoned arrows
the empire is immortal  but the emperor himself totters and falls from his throne  yes  whole dynasties sink in the end and breathe their last in one death rattle of these struggles and sufferings the people will never know  like tardy arrivals  like strangers in a city  they stand at the end of some densely thronged side street peacefully munching the food they have brought with them  while far away in front  in the market square at the heart of the city  the execution of their ruler is proceeding
there is a parable that describes this situation very well  the emperor  so it runs  has sent a message to you  the humble subject  the insignificant shadow cowering in the remotest distance before the imperial sun  the emperor from his deathbed has sent a message to you alone
he has commanded the messenger to kneel down by the bed  and has whispered the message to him  so much store did he lay on it that he ordered the messenger to whisper it back into his ear again
then by a nod of the head he has confirmed that it is right
yes  before the assembled spectators of his death    all the obstructing walls have been broken down  and on the spacious and loftily mounting open staircases stand in a ring the great princes of the empire    before all these he has delivered his message
the messenger immediately sets out on his journey  a powerful  an indefatigable man  now pushing with his right arm  now with his left  he cleaves a way for himself through the throng  if he encounters resistance he points to his breast  where the symbol of the sun glitters  the way is made easier for him than it would be for any other man but the multitudes are so vast  their numbers have no end
if he could reach the open fields how fast he would fly  and soon doubtless you would hear the welcome hammering of his fists on your door
but instead how vainly does he wear out his strength  still he is only making his way through the chambers of the innermost palace  never will he get to the end of them  and if he succeeded in that nothing would be gained  he must next fight his way down the stair  and if he succeeded in that nothing would be gained  the courts would still have to be crossed  and after the courts the second outer palace  and once more stairs and courts  and once more another palace  and so on for thousands of years  and if at last he should burst through the outermost gate    but never  never can that happen    the imperial capital would lie before him  the center of the world  crammed to bursting with its own sediment
nobody could fight his way through here even with a message from a dead man
but you sit at your window when evening falls and dream it to yourself
just so  as hopelessly and as hopefully  do our people regard the emperor
they do not know what emperor is reigning  and there exist doubts regarding even the name of the dynasty
in school a great deal is taught about the dynasties with the dates of succession  but the universal uncertainty in this matter is so great that even the best scholars are drawn into it
long dead emperors are set on the throne in our villages  and one that only lives on in song recently had a proclamation of his read out by the priest before the altar
battles that are old history are new to us  and one's neighbor rushes in with a jubilant face to tell the news
the wives of the emperors  pampered and overweening  seduced from noble custom by wily courtiers  swelling with ambition  vehement in their greed  uncontrollable in their lust  practice their abominations ever anew
the more deeply they are buried in time the more glaring are the colors in which their deeds are painted  and with a loud cry of woe our village eventually hears how an empress drank her husband's blood in long draughts thousands of years ago
thus  then  do our people deal with departed emperors  but the living ruler they confuse among the dead
if once  only once in a man's lifetime  an imperial official on his tour of the provinces should arrive by chance at our village  make certain announcements in the name of the government  scrutinize the tax lists  examine the school children  inquire of the priest regarding our doings and affairs  and then  before he steps into his sedan chair  should sum up his impressions in verbose admonitions to the assembled commune    then a smile flits over every face  people throw surreptitious glances at each other  and bend over their children so as not to be observed by the official
why  they think to themselves  he's speaking of a dead man as if he were alive  this emperor of his died long ago  the dynasty is blotted out  the good official is having his joke with us  but we will behave as if we did not notice it  so as not to offend him but we shall obey in earnest no one but our present ruler  for not to do so would be a crime
and behind the departing sedan chair of the official there rises in might as ruler of the village some figure fortuitously exalted from an urn already crumbled to dust
similarly our people are but little affected by revolutions in the state or contemporary wars
i recall an incident in my youth
a revolt had broken out in a neighboring  but yet quite distant  province
what caused it i can no longer remember  nor is it of any importance now  occasions for revolt can be found there any day  the people are an excitable people
well  one day a leaflet published by the rebels was brought to my father's house by a beggar who had crossed that province
it happened to be a feast day  our rooms were filled with guests  the priest sat in the center and studied the sheet suddenly everybody started to laugh  in the confusion the sheet was torn  the beggar  who however had already received abundant alms  was driven out of the room with blows  the guests dispersed to enjoy the beautiful day why  the dialect of this neighboring province differs in some essential respects from ours  and this difference occurs also in certain turns of the written word  which for us have an decision
ancient history told long ago  old sorrows long since healed
and though  so it seems to me in recollection    the gruesomeness of the living present was irrefutably conveyed by the beggar's words  we laughed and shook our heads and refused to listen any longer so eager are our people to obliterate the present
if from such appearances anyone should draw the conclusion that in reality we have no emperor  he would not be far from the truth
over and over again it must be repeated  there is perhaps no people more faithful to the emperor than ours in the south  but the emperor derives no advantage from our fidelity
true  the sacred dragon stands on the little column at the end of our village  and ever since the beginning of human memory it has breathed out its fiery breath in the direction of peking in token of homage    but peking itself is far stranger to the people in our village than the next world
can there really be a village where the houses stand side by side  covering all the fields for a greater distance than one can see from our hills  and can there be dense crowds of people packed between these houses day and night  we find it more difficult to picture such a city than to believe that peking and its emperor are one  a cloud  say  peacefully voyaging beneath the sun in the course of the ages
now the result of holding such opinions is a life on the whole free and unconstrained
by no means immoral  however  hardly ever have i found in my travels such pure morals as in my native village
but yet a life that is subject to no contemporary law  and attends only to the exhortations and warnings that come to us from olden times
i guard against generalizations  and do not assert that in all the ten thousand villages in my province it is so  far less in all the five hundred provinces of china
yet perhaps i may venture to assert on the basis of the many writings on this subject which i have read  as well as from my own observation    the building of the wall in particular  with its abundance of human material  provided a man of sensibility with the opportunity of traversing the souls of almost all the provinces    on the basis of all this  then  perhaps i may venture to assert that the prevailing attitude to the emperor shows persistently and universally something fundamentally in common with that of our village
now i have no wish whatever to represent this attitude as a virtue  on the contrary
true  the essential responsibility for it lies with the government  which in the most ancient empire in the world has not yet succeeded in developing  or has neglected to develop  the institution of the empire to such precision that its workings extend directly and unceasingly to the farthest frontiers of the land
on the other hand  however  there is also involved a certain feebleness of faith and imaginative power on the part of the people  that prevents them from raising the empire out of its stagnation in peking and clasping it in all its palpable living reality to their own breasts  which yet desire nothing better than but once to feel that touch and then to die
this attitude then is certainly no virtue
all the more remarkable is it that this very weakness should seem to be one of the greatest unifying influences among our people  indeed  if one may dare to use the expression  the very ground on which we live
to set about establishing a fundamental defect here would mean undermining not only our consciences  but  what is far worse  our feet
and for that reason i shall not proceed any further at this stage with my inquiry into these questions
the news of the building of the wall  a fragment the news of the building of the wall now penetrated into this world    late  too  some thirty years after its announcement
it was on a summer evening
i  ten years old  was standing with my father on the riverbank
in keeping with the importance of this much discussed hour  i can recall the smallest details
my father was holding me by the hand  something he was fond of doing to the end of his days  and running his other hand up and down his long  very thin pipe  as though it were a flute
with his sparse  rigid beard raised in the air  he was enjoying his pipe while gazing upwards across the river
as a result his pigtail  object of the children's veneration  sank lower  rustling faintly on the gold embroidered silk of his holiday gown
at that moment a bark drew up before us  the boatman beckoned to my father to come down the embankment  while he himself climbed up toward him they met halfway  the boatman whispered something in my father's ear  in order to come quite close he had embraced him
i could not understand what they said  i only saw that my father did not seem to believe the news  that the boatman tried to insist upon its truth  that when my father still refused to believe it the boatman  with the passion of sailors  almost tore the garment from his chest to prove the truth  whereupon my father fell silent and the boatman jumped noisily into the bark and sailed away
deep in thought my father turned toward me  knocked his pipe out and stuck it in his belt  stroked my cheek  and pulled my head toward him
that is what i liked best  it made me very happy  and so we came home
there the rice pap was already steaming on the table  several guests had assembled  the wine  was just being poured into the goblets
paying no attention to any of this and having advanced no farther than the threshold  my father started telling what he had heard
of the exact words i have of course no recollection  but owing to the exceptional circumstances which cast a spell even over the child  the meaning became so clear to me that i venture nevertheless to give some version of what my father said i am doing so because it was very characteristic of the popular point of view
my father said something like this  an unknown boatman    i know all those who usually pass by here  but this one was a stranger    has just told me that a great wall is going to be built to protect the emperor
for it seems that infidel tribes  among them demons  often assemble before the imperial palace and shoot their black arrows at the emperor a report to an academy honored members of the academy  you have done me the honor of inviting me to give your academy an account of the life i formerly led as an ape
i regret that i cannot comply with your request to the extent you desire
it is now nearly five years since i was an ape  a short space of time  perhaps  according to the calendar  but an infinitely long time to gallop through at full speed  as i have done  more or less accompanied by excellent mentors  good advice  applause  and orchestral music  and yet essentially alone  since all my escorters  to keep the image  kept well off the course
i could never have achieved what i have done had i been stubbornly set on clinging to my origins  to the remembrances of my youth
in fact  to give up being stubborn was the supreme commandment i laid upon myself  free ape as i was  i submitted myself to that yoke
in revenge  however  my memory of the past has closed the door against me more and more
i could have returned at first  had human beings allowed it  through an archway as wide as the span of heaven over the earth  but as i spurred myself on in my forced career  the opening narrowed and shrank behind me  i felt more comfortable in the world of men and fitted it better  the strong wind that blew after me out of my past began to slacken  today it is only a gentle puff of air that plays around my heels  and the opening in the distance  through which it comes and through which i once came myself  has grown so small that  even if my strength and my will power sufficed to get me back to it  i should have to scrape the very skin from my body to crawl through
to put it plainly  much as i like expressing myself in images  to put it plainly  your life as apes  gentlemen  insofar as something of that kind lies behind you  cannot be farther removed from you than mine is from me
yet everyone on earth feels a tickling at the heels  the small chimpanzee and the great achilles alike
but to a lesser extent i can perhaps meet your demand  and indeed i do so with the greatest pleasure
the first thing i learned was to give a handshake  a handshake betokens frankness  well  today  now that i stand at the very peak of my career  i hope to add frankness in words to the frankness of that first handshake
what i have to tell the academy will contribute nothing essentially new  and will fall far behind what you have asked of me and what with the best will in the world i cannot communicate    nonetheless  it should indicate the line an erstwhile ape has had to follow in entering and establishing himself in the world of men yet i could not risk putting into words even such insignificant information as i am going to give you if i were not quite sure of myself and if my position on all the great variety stages of the civilized world had not become quite unassailable
i belong to the gold coast
for the story of my capture i must depend on the evidence of others
a hunting expedition sent out by the firm of hagenbeck    by the way  i have drunk many a bottle of good red wine since then with the leader of that expedition    had taken up its position in the bushes by the shore when i came down for a drink at evening among a troop of apes
they shot at us  i was the only one that was hit  i was hit in two places
once in the cheek  a slight wound  but it left a large  naked  red scar which earned me the name of red peter  a horrible name  utterly inappropriate  which only some ape could have thought of  as if the only difference between me and the performing ape peter  who died not so long ago and had some small local reputation  were the red mark on my cheek
this by the way
the second shot hit me below the hip
it was a severe wound  it is the cause of my limping a little to this day
i read an article recently by one of the ten thousand windbags who vent themselves concerning me in the newspapers  saying  my ape nature is not yet quite under control  the proof being that when visitors come to see me  i have a predilection for taking down my trousers to show them where the shot went in the hand which wrote that should have its fingers shot away one by one
as for me  i can take my trousers down before anyone if i like  you would find nothing but a well groomed fur and the scar made    let me be particular in the choice of a word for this particular purpose  to avoid misunderstanding    the scar made by a wanton shot
everything is open and aboveboard  there is nothing to conceal  when the plain truth is in question  great minds discard the niceties of refinement
but if the writer of the article were to take down his trousers before a visitor  that would be quite another story  and i will let it stand to his credit that he does not do it
in return  let him leave me alone with his delicacy  after these two shots i came to myself    and this is where my own memories gradually begin    between decks in the hagenbeck steamer  inside a cage
it was not a four sided barred cage  it was only a three sided cage nailed to a locker  the locker made the fourth side of it
the whole construction was too low for me to stand up in and too narrow to sit down in
so i had to squat with my knees bent and trembling all the time  and also  since probably for a time i wished to see no one  and to stay in the dark  my face was turned toward the locker while the bars of the cage cut into my flesh behind
such a method of confining wild beasts is supposed to have its advantages during the first days of captivity  and out of my own experiences i cannot deny that from the human point of view this is really the case
but that did not occur to me then
for the first time in my life i could see no way out  at least no direct way out  directly in front of me was the locker  board fitted close to board
true  there was a gap running right through the boards which i greeted with the blissful howl of ignorance when i first discovered it  but the hole was not even wide enough to stick one's tail through and not all the strength of an ape could enlarge it
i am supposed to have made uncommonly little noise  as i was later informed  from which the conclusion was drawn that i would either soon die or if i managed to survive the first critical period would be very amenable to training
i did survive this period
hopelessly sobbing  painfully hunting for fleas  apathetically licking a cocoanut  beating my skull against the locker  sticking out my tongue at anyone who came near me    that was how i filled in time at first in my new life
but over and above it all only the one feeling  no way out
of course what i felt then as an ape i can represent now only in human terms  and therefore i misrepresent it  but although i cannot reach back to the truth of the old ape life  there is no doubt that it lies somewhere in the direction i have indicated until then i had had so many ways out of everything  and now i had none
i was pinned down
had i been nailed down  my right to free movement would not have been lessened
why so  scratch your flesh raw between your toes  but you won't find the answer
press yourself against the bar behind you till it nearly cuts you in two  you won't find the answer
i had no way out but i had to devise one  for without it i could not live
all the time facing that locker    i should certainly have perished
yet as far as hagenbeck was concerned  the place for apes was in front of a locker    well then  i had to stop being an ape
a fine  clear train of thought  which i must have constructed somehow with my belly  since apes think with their bellies
i fear that perhaps you do not quite understand what i mean by  way out   i use the expression in its fullest and most popular sense
i deliberately do not use the word  freedom   i do not mean the spacious feeling of freedom on all sides
as an ape  perhaps  i knew that  and i have met men who yearn for it
but for my part i desired such freedom neither then nor now
in passing  may i say that all too often men are betrayed by the word freedom
and as freedom is counted among the most sublime feelings  so the corresponding disillusionment can be also sublime
in variety theaters i have often watched  before my turn came on  a couple of acrobats performing on trapezes high in the roof
they swung themselves  they rocked to and fro  they sprang into the air  they floated into each other's arms  one hung by the hair from the teeth of the other  and that too is human freedom   i thought   self controlled movement   what a mockery of holy mother nature  were the apes to see such a spectacle  no theater walls could stand the shock of their laughter
no  freedom was not what i wanted
only a way out  right or left  or in any direction  i made no other demand  even should the way out prove to be an illusion  the demand was a small one  the disappointment could be no bigger
to get out somewhere  to get out  only not to stay motionless with raised arms  crushed against a wooden wall today i can see it clearly  without the most profound inward calm i could never have found my way out
and indeed perhaps i owe all that i have become to the calm that settled within me after my first few days in the ship
and again for that calmness it was the ship's crew i had to thank
they were good creatures  in spite of everything
i find it still pleasant to remember the sound of their heavy footfalls which used to echo through my halfdreaming head
they had a habit of doing everything as slowly as possible
if one of them wanted to rub his eyes  he lifted a hand as if it were a drooping weight
their jests were coarse  but hearty
their laughter had always a gruff bark in it that sounded dangerous but meant nothing
they always had something in their mouths to spit out and did not care where they spat it
they always grumbled that they got fleas from me  yet they were not seriously angry about it  they knew that my fur fostered fleas  and that fleas jump  it was a simple matter of fact to them
when they were off duty some of them often used to sit down in a semicircle around me  they hardly spoke but only grunted to each other  smoked their pipes  stretched out on lockers  smacked their knees as soon as i made the slightest movement  and now and then one of them would take a stick and tickle me where i liked being tickled if i were to be invited today to take a cruise on that ship i should certainly refuse the invitation  but just as certainly the memories i could recall between its decks would not all be hateful
the calmness i acquired among these people kept me above all from trying to escape
as i look back now  it seems to me i must have had at least an inkling that i had to find a way out or die  but that my way out could not be reached through flight i cannot tell now whether escape was possible  but i believe it must have been  for an ape it must always be possible
with my teeth as they are today i have to be careful even in simply cracking nuts  but at that time i could certainly have managed by degrees to bite through the lock of my cage
i did not do it
what good would it have done me  as soon as i had poked out my head i should have been caught again and put in a worse cage  or i might have slipped among the other animals without being noticed  among the pythons  say  who were opposite me  and so breathed out my life in their embrace  or supposing i had actually succeeded in sneaking out as far as the deck and leaping overboard  i should have rocked for a little on the deep sea and then been drowned
desperate remedies
i did not think it out in this human way  but under the influence of my surroundings i acted as if i had thought it out
i did not think things out  but i observed everything quietly
i watched these men go to and fro  always the same faces  the same movements  often it seemed to me there was only the same man
so this man or these men walked about unimpeded
a lofty goal faintly dawned before me
no one promised me that if i became like them the bars of my cage would be taken away
such promises for apparently impossible contingencies are not given
but if one achieves the impossible  the promises appear later retrospectively precisely where one had looked in vain for them before
now  these men in themselves had no great attraction for me had i been devoted to the aforementioned idea of freedom  i should certainly have preferred the deep sea to the way out that suggested itself in the heavy faces of these men
at any rate  i watched them for a long time before i even thought of such things  indeed  it was only the mass weight of my observations that impelled me in the right direction
it was so easy to imitate these people
i learned to spit in the very first days
we used to spit in each other's faces  the only difference was that i licked my face clean afterwards and they did not
i could soon smoke a pipe like an old hand  and if i also pressed my thumb into the bowl of the pipe  a roar of appreciation went up betweendecks  only it took me a very long time to understand the difference between a full pipe and an empty one
my worst trouble came from the schnapps bottle
the smell of it revolted me  i forced myself to it as best i could  but it took weeks for me to master my repulsion
this inward conflict  strangely enough  was taken more seriously by the crew than anything else about me
i cannot distinguish the men from each other in my recollection  but there was one of them who came again and again  alone or with friends  by day  by night  at all kinds of hours  he would post himself before me with the bottle and give me instructions he could not understand me  he wanted to solve the enigma of my being
he would slowly uncork the bottle and then look at me to see if i had followed him  i admit that i always watched him with wildly eager  too eager attention  such a student of humankind no human teacher ever found on earth
after the bottle was uncorked he lifted it to his mouth  i followed it with my eyes right up to his jaws  he would nod  pleased with me  and set the bottle to his lips  i  enchanted with my gradual enlightenment  squealed and scratched myself comprehensively wherever scratching was called for  he rejoiced  tilted the bottle  and took a drink  i  impatient and desperate to emulate him  befouled myself in my cage  which again gave him great satisfaction  and then  holding the bottle at arm's length and bringing it up with a swing  he would empty it at one draught  leaning back at an exaggerated angle for my better instruction
i  exhausted by too much effort  could follow him no farther and hung limply to the bars  while he ended his theoretical exposition by rubbing his belly and grinning
after theory came practice
was i not already quite exhausted by my theoretical instruction  indeed i was  utterly exhausted
that was part of my destiny
and yet i would take hold of the proffered bottle as well as i was able  uncork it  trembling  this successful action would gradually inspire me with new energy  i would lift the bottle  already following my original model almost exactly  put it to my lips and    and then throw it down in disgust  utter disgust  although it was empty and filled only with the smell of the spirit  throw it down on the floor in disgust
to the sorrow of my teacher  to the greater sorrow of myself  neither of us being really comforted by the fact that i did not forget  even though i had thrown away the bottle  to rub my belly most admirably and to grin
far too often my lesson ended in that way
and to the credit of my teacher  he was not angry  sometimes indeed he would hold his burning pipe against my fur  until it began to smolder in some place i could not easily reach  but then he would himself extinguish it with his own kind  enormous hand  he was not angry with me  he perceived that we were both fighting on the same side against the nature of apes and that i had the more difficult task what a triumph it was then both for him and for me  when one evening before a large circle of spectators    perhaps there was a celebration of some kind  a gramophone was playing  an officer was circulating among the crew    when on this evening  just as no one was looking  i took hold of a schnapps bottle that had been carelessly left standing before my cage  uncorked it in the best style  while the company began to watch me with mounting attention  set it to my lips without hesitation  with no grimace  like a professional drinker  with rolling eyes and full throat  actually and truly drank it empty  then threw the bottle away  not this time in despair but as an artistic performer  forgot  indeed  to rub my belly  but instead of that  because i could not help it  because my senses were reeling  called a brief and unmistakable  hallo   breaking into human speech  and with this outburst broke into the human community  and felt its echo   listen  he's talking   like a caress over the whole of my sweat drenched body
i repeat  there was no attraction for me in imitating human beings  i imitated them because i needed a way out  and for no other reason
and even that triumph of mine did not achieve much
i lost my human voice again at once  it did not come back for months  my aversion for the schnapps bottle returned again with even greater force
but the line i was to follow had in any case been decided  once for all
when i was handed over to my first trainer in hamburg i soon realized that there were two alternatives before me  the zoological gardens or the variety stage
i did not hesitate
i said to myself  do your utmost to get onto the variety stage  the zoological gardens means only a new cage  once there  you are done for
and so i learned things  gentlemen
ah  one learns when one has to  one learns when one needs a way out  one learns at all costs
one stands over oneself with a whip  one flays oneself at the slightest opposition
my ape nature fled out of me  head over heels and away  so that my first teacher was almost himself turned into an ape by it  had soon to give up teaching and was taken away to a mental hospital fortunately he was soon let out again
but i used up many teachers  indeed  several teachers at once
as i became more confident of my abilities  as the public took an interest in my progress and my future began to look bright  i engaged teachers for myself  established them in five communicating rooms  and took lessons from them all at once by dint of leaping from one room to the other that progress of mine  how the rays of knowledge penetrated from all sides into my awakening brain  i do not deny it  i found it exhilarating
but i must also confess  i did not overestimate it  not even then  much less now
with an effort which up till now has never been repeated i managed to reach the cultural level of an average european
in itself that might be nothing to speak of  but it is something insofar as it has helped me out of my cage and opened a special way out for me  the way of humanity
there is an excellent idiom  to fight one's way through the thick of things  that is what i have done  i have fought through the thick of things
there was nothing else for me to do  provided always that freedom was not to be my choice
as i look back over my development and survey what i have achieved so far  i do not complain  but i am not complacent either
with my hands in my trouser pockets  my bottle of wine on the table  i half lie and half sit in my rocking chair and gaze out of the window  if a visitor arrives  i receive him with propriety
my manager sits in the anteroom  when i ring  he comes and listens to what i have to say
nearly every evening i give a performance  and i have a success that could hardly be increased
when i come home late at night from banquets  from scientific receptions  from social gatherings  there sits waiting for me a half trained little chimpanzee and i take comfort from her as apes do
by day i cannot bear to see her  for she has the insane look of the bewildered half broken animal in her eye  no one else sees it  but i do  and i cannot bear it
on the whole  at any rate  i have achieved what i set out to achieve
but do not tell me that it was not worth the trouble
in any case  i am not appealing for any man's verdict  i am only imparting knowledge  i am only making a report
to you also  honored members of the academy  i have only made a report
a report to an academy  two fragments we all know rotpeter  just as half the world knows him
but when he came to our town for a guest performance  i decided to get to know him personally
it is not difficult to be admitted
in big cities where everyone in the know clamors to watch celebrities breathe from as close as possible  great difficulties may be encountered  but in our town one is content to marvel at the marvelous from the pit
thus i was the only one so far  as the hotel servant told me  to have announced his visit
herr busenau  the impresario  received me with extreme courtesy
i had not expected to meet a man so modest  indeed almost timid
he was sitting in the anteroom of rotpeter's apartment  eating an omelet
although it was morning he already sat there in the evening clothes in which he appears at the performances
hardly had he caught sight of me    me the unknown  the unimportant guest    when he  possessor of highly distinguished medals  king of trainers  honorary doctor of great universities  jumped up  shook me by both hands  urged me to sit down  wiped his spoon on the tablecloth  and amiably offered it to me so that i might finish his omelet
he would not accept my grateful refusal and promptly tried to feed me
i had some trouble calming him down and warding him off  as well as his spoon and plate
 very kind of you to have come   he said with a strong foreign accent
 most kind
you've also come at the right time  for alas rotpeter cannot always receive
seeing people is often repugnant to him  on these occasions no one  it does not matter who he may be  is admitted  then i  even i can see him only on business  so to speak  on the stage
and immediately after the performance i have to disappear  he drives home alone  locks himself in his room  and usually remains like that until the following evening he always has a big hamper of fruit in his bedroom  this is what he lives on at these times
but i  who of course dare not let him out of my sight  always rent the apartment opposite his and watch him from behind curtains   when i sit opposite you like this  rotpeter  listening to you talk  drinking your health  i really and truly forget    whether you take it as a compliment or not  it's the truth    that you are a chimpanzee
only gradually  when i have forced myself out of my thoughts back to reality  do my eyes show me again whose guest i am
yes
you're so silent suddenly  i wonder why  just a moment ago you were pronouncing such astonishingly correct opinions about our town  and now you're so silent
silent  is something wrong  shall i call the trainer  perhaps you're in the habit of taking a meal at this hour  no  no
it's quite all right
i can tell you what it was
sometimes i'm overcome with such an aversion to human beings that i can barely refrain from retching this  of course  has nothing to do with the individual human being  least of all with your charming presence
it concerns all human beings
there's nothing extraordinary about this
suppose  for instance  that you were to live continuously with apes  you'd probably have similar attacks  however great your self control
actually  it's not the smell of human beings that repels me so much  it's the human smell which i have contracted and which mingles with the smell from my native land
smell for yourself  here  on my chest  put your nose deeper into the fur  deeper  i say  i'm sorry  but i can't smell anything special
just the ordinary smell of a wellgroomed body  that's all
the nose of a city dweller  of course  is no fair test
you  no doubt  can scent thousands of things that evade us
once upon a time  sir  once upon a time
that's over
since you brought it up yourself  i dare to ask  how long have you actually been living among us  five years
on the fifth of april it will be five years
terrific achievement
to cast off apehood in five years and gallop through the whole evolution of mankind  certainly no one has ever done that before  on this racecourse you have no rival
it's a great deal  i know  and sometimes it surpasses even my understanding
in tranquil moments  however  i feel less exuberant about it
do you know how i was caught  i've read everything that's been printed about you
you were shot at and then caught
yes  i was hit twice  once here in the cheek    the wound of course was far larger than the scar you see    and the second time below the hip
i'll take my trousers down so you can see that scar  too
here then was where the bullet entered  this was the severe  decisive wound
i fell from the tree and when i came to i was in a cage between decks
in a cage  between decks  it's one thing to read your story  and quite another to hear you tell it  and yet another  sir  to have experienced it
until then i had never known what it means to have no way out
it was not a four sided barred cage  it had only three sides nailed to a locker  the locker forming the fourth side
the whole contrivance was so low that i could not stand upright  and so narrow that i could not even sit down
all i could do was squat there with bent knees
in my rage i refused to see anyone  and so remained facing the locker  for days and nights i squatted there with trembling knees while behind me the bars cut into my flesh
this manner of confining wild animals is considered to have its advantages during the first days of captivity  and from my experience i cannot deny that from the human point of view this actually is the case
but at that time i was not interested in the human point of view
i had the locker in front of me
break the boards  bite a hole through them  squeeze yourself through an opening which in reality hardly allows you to see through it and which  when you first discover it  you greet with the blissful howl of ignorance  where do you want to go  beyond the boards the forest begins


the refusal our little town does not lie on the frontier  nowhere near  it is so far from the frontier  in fact  that perhaps no one from our town has ever been there  desolate highlands have to be crossed as well as wide fertile plains
to imagine even part of the road makes one tired  and more than part one just cannot imagine
there are also big towns on the road  each far larger than ours
ten little towns like ours laid side by side  and ten more forced down from above  still would not produce one of these enormous  overcrowded towns
if one does not get lost on the way one is bound to lose oneself in these towns  and to avoid them is impossible on account of their size
but what is even further from our town than the frontier  if such distances can be compared at all    it's like saying that a man of three hundred years is older than one of two hundred    what is even further than the frontier is the capital
whereas we do get news of the frontier wars now and again  of the capital we learn next to nothing    we civilians that is  for of course the government officials have very good connections with the capital  they can get news from there in as little as three months  so they claim at least
now it is remarkable and i am continually being surprised by the way we in our town humbly submit to all orders issued in the capital
for centuries no political change has been brought about by the citizens themselves in the capital great rulers have superseded each other    indeed  even dynasties have been deposed or annihilated  and new ones have started  in the past century even the capital itself was destroyed  a new one was founded far away from it  later on this too was destroyed and the old one rebuilt  yet none of this had any influence on our little town
our officials have always remained at their posts  the highest officials came from the capital  the less high from other towns  and the lowest from among ourselves    that is how it has always been and it has suited us
the highest official is the chief tax collector  he has the rank of colonel  and is known as such
the present one is an old man  i've known him for years  because he was already a colonel when i was a child
at first he rose very fast in his career  but then he seems to have advanced no further  actually  for our little town his rank is good enough  a higher rank would be out of place when i try to recall him i see him sitting on the veranda of his house in the market square  leaning back  pipe in mouth
above him from the roof flutters the imperial flag  on the sides of the veranda  which is so big that minor military maneuvers are sometimes held there  washing hangs out to dry
his grandchildren  in beautiful silk clothes  play around him  they are not allowed down in the market square  the children there are considered unworthy of them  but the grandchildren are attracted by the square  so they thrust their heads between the posts of the banister and when the children below begin to quarrel they join the quarrel from above
this colonel  then  commands the town
i don't think he has ever produced a document entitling him to this position  very likely he does not possess such a thing
maybe he really is chief tax collector
but is that all  does that entitle him to rule over all the other departments in the administration as well  true  his office is very important for the government  but for the citizens it is hardly the most important
one is almost under the impression that the people here say   now that you've taken all we possess  please take us as well   in reality  of course  it was not he who seized the power  nor is he a tyrant
it has just come about over the years that the chief taxcollector is automatically the top official  and the colonel accepts the tradition just as we do
yet while he lives among us without laying too much stress on his official position  he is something quite different from the ordinary citizen
when a delegation comes to him with a request  he stands there like the wall of the world
behind him is nothingness  one imagines hearing voices whispering in the background  but this is probably a delusion  after all  he represents the end of all things  at least for us
at these receptions he really was worth seeing
once as a child i was present when a delegation of citizens arrived to ask him for a government subsidy because the poorest quarter of the town had been burned to the ground
my father  the blacksmith  a man well respected in the community  was a member of the delegation and had taken me along
there's nothing exceptional about this  everyone rushes to spectacles of this kind  one can hardly distinguish the actual delegation from the crowd
since these receptions usually take place on the veranda  there are even people who climb up by ladder from the market square and take part in the goings on from over the banister
on this occasion about a quarter of the veranda had been reserved for the colonel  the crowd filling the rest of it
a few soldiers kept watch  some of them standing around him in a semicircle
actually a single soldier would have been quite enough  such is our fear of them
i don't know exactly where these soldiers come from  in any case from a long way off  they all look very much alike  they wouldn't even need a uniform
they are small  not strong but agile people  the most striking thing about them is the prominence of their teeth which almost overcrowd their mouths  and a certain restless twitching of their small narrow eyes
this makes them the terror of the children  but also their delight  for again and again the children long to be frightened by these teeth  these eyes  so as to be able to run away in horror
even grownups probably never quite lose this childish terror  at least it continues to have an effect
there are  of course  other factors contributing to it
the soldiers speak a dialect utterly incomprehensible to us  and they can hardly get used to ours    all of which produces a certain shut off  unapproachable quality corresponding  as it happens  to their character  for they are silent  serious  and rigid
they don't actually do anything evil  and yet they are almost unbearable in an evil sense
a soldier  for example  enters a shop  buys some trifling object  and stays there leaning against the counter  he listens to the conversations  probably does not understand them  and yet gives the impression of understanding  he himself does not say a word  just stares blankly at the speaker  then back at the listeners  all the while keeping his hand on the hilt of the long knife in his belt this is revolting  one loses the desire to talk  the customers start leaving the shop  and only when it is quite empty does the soldier also leave
thus wherever the soldiers appear  our lively people grow silent
that's what happened this time  too
as on all solemn occasions the colonel stood upright  holding in front of him two poles of bamboo in his outstretched hands this is an ancient custom implying more or less that he supports the law  and the law supports him
now everyone knows  of course  what to expect up on the veranda  and yet each time people take fright all over again
on this occasion  too  the man chosen to speak could not begin  he was already standing opposite the colonel when his courage failed him and  muttering a few excuses  he pushed his way back into the crowd
no other suitable person willing to speak could be found  albeit several unsuitable ones offered themselves  a great commotion ensued and messengers were sent in search of various citizens who were well known speakers during all this time the colonel stood there motionless  only his chest moving visibly up and down to his breathing
not that he breathed with difficulty  it was just that he breathed so conspicuously  much as frogs breathe    except that with them it is normal  while here it was exceptional
i squeezed myself through the grownups and watched him through a gap between two soldiers  until one of them kicked me away with his knee
meanwhile the man originally chosen to speak had regained his composure and  firmly held up by two fellow citizens  was delivering his address
it was touching to see him smile throughout this solemn speech describing a grievous misfortune    a most humble smile which strove in vain to elicit some slight reaction on the colonel's face
finally he formulated the request    i think he was only asking for a year's tax exemption  but possibly also for timber from the imperial forests at a reduced price
then he bowed low  remaining in this position for some time  as did everyone else except the colonel  the soldiers  and a number of officials in the background
to the child it seemed ridiculous that the people on the ladders should climb down a few rungs so as not to be seen during the significant pause and now and again peer inquisitively over the floor of the veranda
after this had lasted quite a while an official  a little man  stepped up to the colonel and tried to reach the latter's height by standing on his toes
the colonel  still motionless save for his deep breathing  whispered something in his ear  whereupon the little man clapped his hands and everyone rose
 the petition has been refused   he announced
 you may go   an undeniable sense of relief passed through the crowd  everyone surged out  hardly a soul paying any special attention to the colonel  who  as it were  had turned once more into a human being like the rest of us
i still caught one last glimpse of him as he wearily let go of the poles  which fell to the ground  then sank into an armchair produced by some officials  and promptly put his pipe in his mouth
this whole occurrence is not isolated  it's in the general run of things
indeed  it does happen now and again that minor petitions are granted  but then it invariably looks as though the colonel had done it as a powerful private person on his own responsibility  and it had to be kept all but a secret from the government    not explicitly of course  but that is what it feels like
no doubt in our little town the colonel's eyes  so far as we know  are also the eyes of the government  and yet there is a difference which it is impossible to comprehend completely
in all important matters  however  the citizens can always count on a refusal
and now the strange fact is that without this refusal one simply cannot get along  yet at the same time these official occasions designed to receive the refusal are by no means a formality
time after time one goes there full of expectation and in all seriousness and then one returns  if not exactly strengthened or happy  nevertheless not disappointed or tired
about these things i do not have to ask the opinion of anyone else  i feel them in myself  as everyone does  nor do i have any great desire to find out how these things are connected
as a matter of fact there is  so far as my observations go  a certain age group that is not content    these are the young people roughly between seventeen and twenty
quite young fellows  in fact  who are utterly incapable of foreseeing the consequences of even the least significant  far less a revolutionary  idea
and it is among just them that discontent creeps in
a hunger artist during these last decades the interest in professional fasting has markedly diminished
it used to pay very well to stage such great performances under one's own management  but today that is quite impossible
we live in a different world now
at one time the whole town took a lively interest in the hunger artist  from day to day of his fast the excitement mounted  everybody wanted to see him at least once a day  there were people who bought season tickets for the last few days and sat from morning till night in front of his small barred cage  even in the nighttime there were visiting hours  when the whole effect was heightened by torch flares  on fine days the cage was set out in the open air  and then it was the children's special treat to see the hunger artist  for their elders he was often just a joke that happened to be in fashion  but the children stood openmouthed  holding each other's hands for greater security  marveling at him as he sat there pallid in black tights  with his ribs sticking out so prominently  not even on a seat but down among straw on the ground  sometimes giving a courteous nod  answering questions with a constrained smile  or perhaps stretching an arm through the bars so that one might feel how thin it was  and then again withdrawing deep into himself  paying no attention to anyone or anything  not even to the all important striking of the clock that was the only piece of furniture in his cage  but merely staring into vacancy with half shut eyes  now and then taking a sip from a tiny glass of water to moisten his lips besides casual onlookers there were also relays of permanent watchers selected by the public  usually butchers  strangely enough  and it was their task to watch the hunger artist day and night  three of them at a time  in case he should have some secret recourse to nourishment this was nothing but a formality  instituted to reassure the masses  for the initiates knew well enough that during his fast the artist would never in any circumstances  not even under forcible compulsion  swallow the smallest morsel of food  the honor of his profession forbade it not every watcher  of course  was capable of understanding this  there were often groups of night watchers who were very lax in carrying out their duties and deliberately huddled together in a retired corner to play cards with great absorption  obviously intending to give the hunger artist the chance of a little refreshment  which they supposed he could draw from some private hoard
nothing annoyed the artist more than such watchers  they made him miserable  they made his fast seem unendurable  sometimes he mastered his feebleness sufficiently to sing during their watch for as long as he could keep going  to show them how unjust their suspicions were
but that was of little use  they only wondered at his cleverness in being able to fill his mouth even while singing
much more to his taste were the watchers who sat close up to the bars  who were not content with the dim night lighting of the hall but focused him in the full glare of the electric pocket torch given them by the impresario
the harsh light did not trouble him at all  in any case he could never sleep properly  and he could always drowse a little  whatever the light  at any hour  even when the hall was thronged with noisy onlookers
he was quite happy at the prospect of spending a sleepless night with such watchers  he was ready to exchange jokes with them  to tell them stories out of his nomadic life  anything at all to keep them awake and demonstrate to them again that he had no eatables in his cage and that he was fasting as not one of them could fast
but his happiest moment was when the morning came and an enormous breakfast was brought them  at his expense  on which they flung themselves with the keen appetite of healthy men after a weary night of wakefulness of course there were people who argued that this breakfast was an unfair attempt to bribe the watchers  but that was going rather too far  and when they were invited to take on a night's vigil without a breakfast  merely for the sake of the cause  they made themselves scarce  although they stuck stubbornly to their suspicions such suspicions  anyhow  were a necessary accompaniment to the profession of fasting
no one could possibly watch the hunger artist continuously  day and night  and so no one could produce first hand evidence that the fast had really been rigorous and continuous  only the artist himself could know that  he was therefore bound to be the sole completely satisfied spectator of his own fast yet for other reasons he was never satisfied  it was not perhaps mere fasting that had brought him to such skeleton thinness that many people had regretfully to keep away from his exhibitions  because the sight of him was too much for them  perhaps it was dissatisfaction with himself that had worn him down for he alone knew  what no other initiate knew  how easy it was to fast
it was the easiest thing in the world
he made no secret of this  yet people did not believe him  at the best they set him down as modest  most of them  however  thought he was out for publicity or else was some kind of cheat who found it easy to fast because he had discovered a way of making it easy  and then had the impudence to admit the fact  more or less
he had to put up with all that  and in the course of time had got used to it  but his inner dissatisfaction always rankled  and never yet  after any term of fasting    this must be granted to his credit    had he left the cage of his own free will
the longest period of fasting was fixed by his impresario at forty days  beyond that term he was not allowed to go  not even in great cities  and there was good reason for it  too
experience had proved that for about forty days the interest of the public could be stimulated by a steadily increasing pressure of advertisement  but after that the town began to lose interest  sympathetic support began notably to fall off  there were of course local variations as between one town and another or one country and another  but as a general rule forty days marked the limit
so on the fortieth day the flower bedecked cage was opened  enthusiastic spectators filled the hall  a military band played  two doctors entered the cage to measure the results of the fast  which were announced through a megaphone  and finally two young ladies appeared  blissful at having been selected for the honor  to help the hunger artist down the few steps leading to a small table on which was spread a carefully chosen invalid repast
and at this very moment the artist always turned stubborn
true  he would entrust his bony arms to the outstretched helping hands of the ladies bending over him  but stand up he would not why stop fasting at this particular moment  after forty days of it  he had held out for a long time  an illimitably long time  why stop now  when he was in his best fasting form  or rather  not yet quite in his best fasting form  why should he be cheated of the fame he would get for fasting longer  for being not only the record hunger artist of all time  which presumably he was already  but for beating his own record by a performance beyond human imagination  since he felt that there were no limits to his capacity for fasting  his public pretended to admire him so much  why should it have so little patience with him  if he could endure fasting longer  why shouldn't the public endure it  besides  he was tired  he was comfortable sitting in the straw  and now he was supposed to lift himself to his full height and go down to a meal the very thought of which gave him a nausea that only the presence of the ladies kept him from betraying  and even that with an effort and he looked up into the eyes of the ladies who were apparently so friendly and in reality so cruel  and shook his head  which felt too heavy on its strengthless neck but then there happened yet again what always happened
the impresario came forward  without a word    for the band made speech impossible    lifted his arms in the air above the artist  as if inviting heaven to look down upon its creature here in the straw  this suffering martyr  which indeed he was  although in quite another sense  grasped him around the emaciated waist  with exaggerated caution  so that the frail condition he was in might be appreciated  and committed him to the care of the blenching ladies  not without secretly giving him a shaking so that his legs and body tottered and swayed the artist now submitted completely  his head lolled on his breast as if it had landed there by chance  his body was hollowed out  his legs in a spasm of self preservation clung close to each other at the knees  yet scraped on the ground as if it were not really solid ground  as if they were only trying to find solid ground  and the whole weight of his body  a featherweight after all  relapsed onto one of the ladies  who  looking around for help and panting a little    this post of honor was not at all what she had expected it to be    first stretched her neck as far as she could to keep her face at least free from contact with the artist  then finding this impossible  and her more fortunate companion not coming to her aid but merely holding extended in her own trembling hand the little bunch of knucklebones that was the artist's  to the great delight of the spectators burst into tears and had to be replaced by an attendant who had long been stationed in readiness then came the food  a little of which the impresario managed to get between the artist's lips  while he sat in a kind of half fainting trance  to the accompaniment of cheerful patter designed to distract the public's attention from the artist's condition  after that  a toast was drunk to the public  supposedly prompted by a whisper from the artist in the impresario's ear  the band confirmed it with a mighty flourish  the spectators melted away  and no one had any cause to be dissatisfied with the proceedings  no one except the hunger artist himself  he only  as always so he lived for many years  with small regular intervals of recuperation  in visible glory  honored by the world  yet in spite of that troubled in spirit  and all the more troubled because no one would take his trouble seriously
what comfort could he possibly need  what more could he possibly wish for  and if some good natured person  feeling sorry for him  tried to console him by pointing out that his melancholy was probably caused by fasting  it could happen  especially when he had been fasting for some time  that he reacted with an outburst of fury and to the general alarm began to shake the bars of his cage like a wild animal
yet the impresario had a way of punishing these outbreaks which he rather enjoyed putting into operation
he would apologize publicly for the artist's behavior  which was only to be excused  he admitted  because of the irritability caused by fasting  a condition hardly to be understood by well fed people  then by natural transition he went on to mention the artist's equally incomprehensible boast that he could fast for much longer than he was doing  he praised the high ambition  the good will  the great self denial undoubtedly implicit in such a statement  and then quite simply countered it by bringing out photographs  which were also on sale to the public  showing the artist on the fortieth day of a fast lying in bed almost dead from exhaustion
this perversion of the truth  familiar to the artist though it was  always unnerved him afresh and proved too much for him
what was a consequence of the premature ending of his fast was here presented as the cause of it  to fight against this lack of understanding  against a whole world of nonunderstanding  was impossible
time and again in good faith he stood by the bars listening to the impresario  but as soon as the photographs appeared he always let go and sank with a groan back onto his straw  and the reassured public could once more come close and gaze at him
a few years later when the witnesses of such scenes called them to mind  they often failed to understand themselves at all for meanwhile the aforementioned change in public interest had set in  it seemed to happen almost overnight  there may have been profound causes for it  but who was going to bother about that  at any rate the pampered hunger artist suddenly found himself deserted one fine day by the amusement seekers  who went streaming past him to other more favored attractions for the last time the impresario hurried him over half europe to discover whether the old interest might still survive here and there  all in vain  everywhere  as if by secret agreement  a positive revulsion from professional fasting was in evidence
of course it could not really have sprung up so suddenly as all that  and many premonitory symptoms which had not been sufficiently remarked or suppressed during the rush and glitter of success now came retrospectively to mind  but it was now too late to take any countermeasures fasting would surely come into fashion again at some future date  yet that was no comfort for those living in the present
what  then  was the hunger artist to do  he had been applauded by thousands in his time and could hardly come down to showing himself in a street booth at village fairs  and as for adopting another profession  he was not only too old for that but too fanatically devoted to fasting so he took leave of the impresario  his partner in an unparalleled career  and hired himself to a large circus  in order to spare his own feelings he avoided reading the conditions of his contract a large circus with its enormous traffic in replacing and recruiting men  animals  and apparatus can always find a use for people at any time  even for a hunger artist  provided of course that he does not ask too much  and in this particular case anyhow it was not only the artist who was taken on but his famous and long known name as well  indeed considering the peculiar nature of his performance  which was not impaired by advancing age  it could not be objected that here was an artist past his prime  no longer at the height of his professional skill  seeking a refuge in some quiet corner of a circus  on the contrary  the hunger artist averred that he could fast as well as ever  which was entirely credible  he even alleged that if he were allowed to fast as he liked  and this was at once promised him without more ado  he could astound the world by establishing a record never yet achieved  a statement that certainly provoked a smile among the other professionals  since it left out of account the change in public opinion  which the hunger artist in his zeal conveniently forgot
he had not  however  actually lost his sense of the real situation and took it as a matter of course that he and his cage should be stationed  not in the middle of the ring as a main attraction  but outside  near the animal cages  on a site that was after all easily accessible
large and gaily painted placards made a frame for the cage and announced what was to be seen inside it
when the public came thronging out in the intervals to see the animals  they could hardly avoid passing the hunger artist's cage and stopping there for a moment  perhaps they might even have stayed longer had not those pressing behind them in the narrow gangway  who did not understand why they should be held up on their way toward the excitements of the menagerie  made it impossible for anyone to stand gazing quietly for any length of time
and that was the reason why the hunger artist  who had of course been looking forward to these visiting hours as the main achievement of his life  began instead to shrink from them
at first he could hardly wait for the intervals  it was exhilarating to watch the crowds come streaming his way  until only too soon    not even the most obstinate self deception  clung to almost consciously  could hold out against the fact    the conviction was borne in upon him that these people  most of them  to judge from their actions  again and again  without exception  were all on their way to the menagerie
and the first sight of them from the distance remained the best
for when they reached his cage he was at once deafened by the storm of shouting and abuse that arose from the two contending factions  which renewed themselves continuously  of those who wanted to stop and stare at him    he soon began to dislike them more than the others    not out of real interest but only out of obstinate self assertiveness  and those who wanted to go straight on to the animals when the first great rush was past  the stragglers came along  and these  whom nothing could have prevented from stopping to look at him as long as they had breath  raced past with long strides  hardly even glancing at him  in their haste to get to the menagerie in time
and all too rarely did it happen that he had a stroke of luck  when some father of a family fetched up before him with his children  pointed a finger at the hunger artist  and explained at length what the phenomenon meant  telling stories of earlier years when he himself had watched similar but much more thrilling performances  and the children  still rather uncomprehending  since neither inside nor outside school had they been sufficiently prepared for this lesson    what did they care about fasting     yet showed by the brightness of their intent eyes that new and better times might be coming perhaps  said the hunger artist to himself many a time  things would be a little better if his cage were set not quite so near the menagerie that made it too easy for people to make their choice  to say nothing of what he suffered from the stench of the menagerie  the animals' restlessness by night  the carrying past of raw lumps of flesh for the beasts of prey  the roaring at feeding times  which depressed him continually but he did not dare to lodge a complaint with the management  after all  he had the animals to thank for the troops of people who passed his cage  among whom there might always be one here and there to take an interest in him  and who could tell where they might seclude him if he called attention to his existence and thereby to the fact that  strictly speaking  he was only an impediment on the way to the menagerie
a small impediment  to be sure  one that grew steadily less
people grew familiar with the strange idea that they could be expected  in times like these  to take an interest in a hunger artist  and with this familiarity the verdict went out against him
he might fast as much as he could  and he did so  but nothing could save him now  people passed him by
just try to explain to anyone the art of fasting  anyone who has no feeling for it cannot be made to understand it
the fine placards grew dirty and illegible  they were torn down  the little notice board telling the number of fast days achieved  which at first was changed carefully every day  had long stayed at the same figure  for after the first few weeks even this small task seemed pointless to the staff  and so the artist simply fasted on and on  as he had once dreamed of doing  and it was no trouble to him  just as he had always foretold  but no one counted the days  no one  not even the artist himself  knew what records he was already breaking  and his heart grew heavy and when once in a while some leisurely passer by stopped  made merry over the old figure on the board  and spoke of swindling  that was in its way the stupidest lie ever invented by indifference and inborn malice  since it was not the hunger artist who was cheating  he was working honestly  but the world was cheating him of his reward
many more days went by  however  and that too came to an end
an overseer's eye fell on the cage one day and he asked the attendants why this perfectly good cage should be left standing there unused with dirty straw inside it  nobody knew  until one man  helped out by the notice board  remembered about the hunger artist
they poked into the straw with sticks and found him in it
 are you still fasting   asked the overseer   when on earth do you mean to stop    forgive me  everybody   whispered the hunger artist  only the overseer  who had his ear to the bars  understood him
 of course   said the overseer  and tapped his forehead with a finger to let the attendants know what state the man was in   we forgive you    i always wanted you to admire my fasting   said the hunger artist
 we do admire it   said the overseer  affably
 but you shouldn't admire it   said the hunger artist
 well then we don't admire it   said the overseer   but why shouldn't we admire it    because i have to fast  i can't help it   said the hunger artist
 what a fellow you are   said the overseer   and why can't you help it    because   said the hunger artist  lifting his head a little and speaking  with his lips pursed  as if for a kiss  right into the overseer's ear  so that no syllable might be lost   because i couldn't find the food i liked
if i had found it  believe me  i should have made no fuss and stuffed myself like you or anyone else   these were his last words  but in his dimming eyes remained the firm though no longer proud persuasion that he was still continuing to fast
 well  clear this out now   said the overseer  and they buried the hunger artist  straw and all
into the cage they put a young panther
even the most insensitive felt it refreshing to see this wild creature leaping around the cage that had so long been dreary
the panther was all right
the food he liked was brought him without hesitation by the attendants  he seemed not even to miss his freedom  his noble body  furnished almost to the bursting point with all that it needed  seemed to carry freedom around with it too  somewhere in his jaws it seemed to lurk  and the joy of life streamed with such ardent passion from his throat that for the onlookers it was not easy to stand the shock of it
but they braced themselves  crowded around the cage  and did not want ever to move away investigations of a dog how much my life has changed  and yet how unchanged it has remained at bottom  when i think back and recall the time when i was still a member of the canine community  sharing in all its preoccupations  a dog among dogs  i find on closer examination that from the very beginning i sensed some discrepancy  some little maladjustment  causing a slight feeling of discomfort which not even the most decorous public functions could eliminate  more  that sometimes  no  not sometimes  but very often  the mere look of some fellow dog of my own circle that i was fond of  the mere look of him  as if i had just caught it for the first time  would fill me with helpless embarrassment and fear  even with despair
i tried to quiet my apprehensions as best i could  friends  to whom i divulged them  helped me  more peaceful times came    times  it is true  in which these sudden surprises were not lacking  but in which they were accepted with more philosophy  fitted into my life with more philosophy  inducing a certain melancholy and lethargy  it may be  but nevertheless allowing me to carry on as a somewhat cold  reserved  shy  and calculating  but all things considered normal enough dog
how  indeed  without these breathing spells  could i have reached the age that i enjoy at present  how could i have fought my way through to the serenity with which i contemplate the terrors of youth and endure the terrors of age  how could i have come to the point where i am able to draw the consequences of my admittedly unhappy  or  to put it more moderately  not very happy disposition  and live almost entirely in accordance with them  solitary and withdrawn  with nothing to occupy me save my hopeless but  as far as i am concerned  indispensable little investigations  that is how i live  yet in my distant isolation i have not lost sight of my people  news often penetrates to me  and now and then i even let news of myself reach them
the others treat me with respect but do not understand my way of life  yet they bear me no grudge  and even young dogs whom i sometimes see passing in the distance  a new generation of whose childhood i have only a vague memory  do not deny me a reverential greeting
for it must not be assumed that  for all my peculiarities  which lie open to the day  i am so very different from the rest of my species
indeed when i reflect on it    and i have time and disposition and capacity enough for that    i see that dogdom is in every way a marvelous institution
apart from us dogs there are all sorts of creatures in the world  wretched  limited  dumb creatures who have no language but mechanical cries  many of us dogs study them  have given them names  try to help them  educate them  uplift them  and so on for my part i am quite indifferent to them except when they try to disturb me  i confuse them with one another  i ignore them
but one thing is too obvious to have escaped me  namely how little inclined they are  compared with us dogs  to stick together  how silently and unfamiliarly and with what a curious hostility they pass each other by  how only the basest of interests can bind them together for a little in ostensible union  and how often these very interests give rise to hatred and conflict
consider us dogs  on the other hand  one can safely say that we all live together in a literal heap  all of us  different as we are from one another on account of numberless and profound modifications which have arisen in the course of time
all in one heap  we are drawn to each other and nothing can prevent us from satisfying that communal impulse  all our laws and institutions  the few that i still know and the many that i have forgotten  go back to this longing for the greatest bliss we are capable of  the warm comfort of being together
but now consider the other side of the picture
no creatures to my knowledge live in such wide dispersion as we dogs  none have so many distinctions of class  of kind  of occupation  distinctions too numerous to review at a glance  we  whose one desire is to stick together    and again and again we succeed at transcendent moments in spite of everything    we above all others live so widely separated from one another  engaged in strange vocations that are often incomprehensible even to our canine neighbors  holding firmly to laws that are not those of the dog world  but are actually directed against it
how baffling these questions are  questions on which one would prefer not to touch    i understand that standpoint too  even better than my own    and yet questions to which i have completely capitulated
why do i not do as the others  live in harmony with my people and accept in silence whatever disturbs the harmony  ignoring it as a small error in the great account  always keeping in mind the things that bind us happily together  not those that drive us again and again  as though by sheer force  out of our social circle  i can recall an incident in my youth  i was at the time in one of those inexplicable blissful states of exaltation which everyone must have experienced as a child  i was still quite a puppy  everything pleased me  everything was my concern
i believed that great things were going on around me of which i was the leader and to which i must lend my voice  things which must be wretchedly thrown aside if i did not run for them and wag my tail for them    childish fantasies that faded with riper years but at the time their power was very great  i was completely under their spell  and presently something actually did happen  something so extraordinary that it seemed to justify my wild expectations
in itself it was nothing very extraordinary  for i have seen many such things  and more remarkable things too  often enough since  but at the time it struck me with all the force of a first impression  one of those impressions which can never be erased and influence much of one's later conduct
i encountered  in short  a little company of dogs  or rather i did not encounter them  they appeared before me
before that i had been running along in darkness for some time  filled with a premonition of great things    a premonition that may well have been delusive  for i always had it
i had run in darkness for a long time  up and down  blind and deaf to everything  led on by nothing but a vague desire  and now i suddenly came to a stop with the feeling that i was in the right place  and looking up saw that it was bright day  only a little hazy  and everywhere a blending and confusion of the most intoxicating smells  i greeted the morning with an uncertain barking  when    as if i had conjured them up    out of some place of darkness  to the accompaniment of terrible sounds such as i had never heard before  seven dogs stepped into the light
had i not distinctly seen that they were dogs and that they  themselves brought the sound with them    though i could not recognize how they produced it    i would have run away at once  but as it was i stayed at that time i still knew hardly anything of the creative gift for music with which the canine race alone is endowed  it had naturally enough escaped my but slowly developing powers of observation  for though music had surrounded me as a perfectly natural and indispensable element of existence ever since i was a suckling  an element which nothing impelled me to distinguish from the rest of existence  my elders had drawn my attention to it only by such hints as were suitable for a childish understanding  all the more astonishing  then  indeed devastating  were these seven great musical artists to me
they did not speak  they did not sing  they remained generally silent  almost determinedly silent  but from the empty air they conjured music
everything was music  the lifting and setting down of their feet  certain turns of the head  their running and their standing still  the positions they took up in relation to one another  the symmetrical patterns which they produced by one dog setting his front paws on the back of another and the rest following suit until the first bore the weight of the other six  or by all lying flat on the ground and going through complicated concerted evolutions  and none made a false move  not even the last dog  though he was a little unsure  did not always establish contact at once with the others  sometimes hesitated  as it were  on the stroke of the beat  but yet was unsure only by comparison with the superb sureness of the others  and even if he had been much more unsure  indeed quite unsure  would not have been able to do any harm  the others  great masters all of them  keeping the rhythm so unshakably
but it is too much to say that i even saw them  that i actually even saw them
they appeared from somewhere  i inwardly greeted them as dogs  and although i was profoundly confused by the sounds that accompanied them  yet they were dogs nevertheless  dogs like you and me  i regarded them by force of habit simply as dogs i had happened to meet on my road  and felt a wish to approach them and exchange greetings  they were quite near too  dogs much older than me  certainly  and not of my woolly  long haired kind  but yet not so very alien in size and shape  indeed quite familiar to me  for i had already seen many such or similar dogs  but while i was still involved in these reflections the music gradually got the upper hand  literally knocked the breath out of me and swept me far away from those actual little dogs  and quite against my will  while i howled as if some pain were being inflicted upon me  my mind could attend to nothing but this blast of music which seemed to come from all sides  from the heights  from the deeps  from everywhere  surrounding the listener  overwhelming him  crushing him  and over his swooning body still blowing fanfares so near that they seemed far away and almost inaudible
and then a respite came  for one was already too exhausted  too annulled  too feeble to listen any longer  a respite came and i beheld again the seven little dogs carrying out their evolutions  making their leaps  i longed to shout to them in spite of their aloofness  to beg them to enlighten me  to ask them what they were doing    i was a child and believed i could ask anybody about anything    but hardly had i begun  hardly did i feel on good and familiar doggish terms with the seven  when the music started again  robbed me of my wits  whirled me around in its circles as if i myself were one of the musicians instead of being only their victim  cast me hither and thither  no matter how much i begged for mercy  and rescued me finally from its own violence by driving me into a labyrinth of wooden bars which rose around that place  though i had not noticed it before  but which now firmly caught me  kept my head pressed to the ground  and though the music still resounded in the open space behind me  gave me a little time to get my breath back i must admit that i was less surprised by the artistry of the seven dogs    it was incomprehensible to me  and also quite definitely beyond my capacities    than by their courage in facing so openly the music of their own making  and their power to endure it calmly without collapsing
but now from my hiding hole i saw  on looking more closely  that it was not so much coolness as the most extreme tension that characterized their performance  these limbs apparently so sure in their movements quivered at every step with a perpetual apprehensive twitching  as if rigid with despair the dogs kept their eyes fixed on one another  and their tongues  whenever the tension weakened for a moment  hung wearily from their jowls
it could not be fear of failure that agitated them so deeply  dogs that could dare and achieve such things had no need to fear that
then why were they afraid  who then forced them to do what they were doing  and i could no longer restrain myself  particularly as they now seemed in some incomprehensible way in need of help  and so through all the din of the music i shouted out my questions loudly and challengingly
but they    incredible  incredible      they never replied  behaved as if i were not there
dogs who make no reply to the greeting of other dogs are guilty of an offense against good manners which the humblest dog would never pardon any more than the greatest
perhaps they were not dogs at all  but how should they not be dogs  could i not actually hear on listening more closely the subdued cries with which they encouraged each other  drew each other's attention to difficulties  warned each other against errors  could i not see the last and youngest dog  to whom most of those cries were addressed  often stealing a glance at me as if he would have dearly wished to reply  but refrained because it was not allowed  but why should it not be allowed  why should the very thing which our laws unconditionally command not be allowed in this one case  i became indignant at the thought and almost forgot the music
those dogs were violating the law
great magicians they might be  but the law was valid for them too  i knew that quite well though i was a child
and having recognized that  i now noticed something else
they had good grounds for remaining silent  that is  assuming that they remained silent from a sense of shame
for how were they conducting themselves  because of all the music i had not noticed it before  but they had flung away all shame  the wretched creatures were doing the very thing which is both most ridiculous and indecent in our eyes  they were walking on their hind legs fie on them  they were uncovering their nakedness  blatantly making a show of their nakedness  they were doing that as though it were a meritorious act  and when  obeying their better instincts for a moment  they happened to let their front paws fall  they were literally appalled as if at an error  as if nature were an error  hastily raised their legs again  and their eyes seemed to be begging for forgiveness for having been forced to cease momentarily from their abomination was the world standing on its head  where could i be  what could have happened  if only for my own sake i dared not hesitate any longer now  i dislodged myself from the tangle of bars  took one leap into the open and made toward the dogs    i  the young pupil  must be the teacher now  must make them understand what they were doing  must keep them from committing further sin
 and old dogs too  and old dogs too   i kept on saying to myself
but scarcely was i free and only a leap or two away from the dogs  when the music again had me in its power
perhaps in my eagerness i might even have managed to withstand it  for i knew it better now  if in the midst of all its majestic amplitude  which was terrifying  but still not inconquerable  a clear  piercing  continuous note which came without variation literally from the remotest distance    perhaps the real melody in the midst of the music    had not now rung out  forcing me to my knees
oh  the music these dogs made almost drove me out of my senses  i could not move a step farther  i no longer wanted to instruct them  they could go on raising their front legs  committing sin and seducing others to the sin of silently regarding them  i was such a young dog    who could demand such a difficult task from me  i made myself still more insignificant than i was  i whimpered  and if the dogs had asked me now what i thought of their performance  probably i would have had not a word to say against it
besides  it was not long before the dogs vanished with all their music and their radiance into the darkness from which they had emerged
as i have already said  this whole episode contains nothing of much note  in the course of a long life one encounters all sorts of things which  taken from their context and seen through the eyes of a child  might well seem far more astonishing
besides  one may  of course    in the pungent popular phrase    have  got it all wrong   as well as everything connected with it  then it could bedemonstrated that this was simply a case where seven musicians had assembled to practice their art in the morning stillness  that a very young dog had strayed to the place  a burdensome intruder whom they had tried to drive away by particularly terrifying or lofty music  unfortunately without success
he pestered them with his questions  were they  already disturbed enough by the mere presence of the stranger  to be expected to attend to his distracting interruptions as well and make them worse by responding to them  even if the law commands us to reply to everybody  was such a tiny stray dog in truth a somebody worthy of the name  and perhaps they did not even understand him  for he likely enough barked his questions very indistinctly
or perhaps they did understand him and with great self control answered his questions  but he  a mere puppy unaccustomed to music  could not distinguish the answer from the music
and as for walking on their hind legs  perhaps  unlike other dogs  they actually used only these for walking  if it was a sin  well  it was a sin
but they were alone  seven friends together  an intimate gathering within their own four walls so to speak  quite private so to speak  for one's friends  after all  are not the public  and where the public is not present an inquisitive little street dog is certainly not capable of constituting it  but  granting this  is it not as if nothing at all had happened  it is not quite so  but very nearly so  and parents should not let their children run about so freely  and had much better teach them to hold their tongues and respect the aged
if all this is admitted  then it disposes of the whole case
but many things that are disposed of in the minds of grownups are not yet settled in the minds of the young
i rushed about  told my story  asked questions  made accusations and investigations  tried to drag others to the place where all this had happened  and burned to show everybody where i had stood and where the seven had stood  and where and how they had danced and made their music  and if anyone had come with me  instead of shaking me off and laughing at me  i would probably have sacrificed my innocence and tried myself to stand on my hind legs so as to reconstruct the scene clearly
now children are blamed for all they do  but also in the last resort forgiven for all they do
and i have preserved my childlike qualities  and in spite of that have grown to be an old dog
well  just as at that time i kept on unceasingly discussing the foregoing incident    which today i must confess i lay far less importance upon    analyzing it into constituent parts  arguing it with my listeners without regard to the company i found myself in  devoting my whole time to the problem  which i found as wearisome as everybody else  but which    that was the difference    for that very reason i was resolved to pursue indefatigably until i solved it  so that i might be left free again to regard the ordinary  calm  happy life of every day
just so have i  though with less childish means     yet the difference is not so very great    labored in the years since and go on laboring today
but it began with that concert
i do not blame the concert  it is my innate disposition that has driven me on  and it would certainly have found some other opportunity of coming into action had the concert never taken place
yet the fact that it happened so soon used to make me feel sorry for myself  it robbed me of a great part of my childhood  the blissful life of the young dog  which many can spin out for years  in my case lasted for only a few short months
so be it
there are more important things than childhood
and perhaps i have the prospect of far more childlike happiness  earned by a life of hard work  in my old age than any actual child would have the strength to bear  but which then i shall possess
i began my inquiries with the simplest things  there was no lack of material  it is the actual superabundance  unfortunately  that casts me into despair in my darker hours
i began to inquire into the question what the canine race nourished itself upon
now that is  if you like  by no means a simple question  of course  it has occupied us since the dawn of time  it is the chief object of all our meditation  countless observations and essays and views on this subject have been published  it has grown into a province of knowledge which in its prodigious compass is not only beyond the comprehension of any single scholar  but of all our scholars collectively  a burden which cannot be borne except by the whole of the dog community  and even then with difficulty and not quite in its totality  for it ever and again crumbles away like a neglected ancestral inheritance and must laboriously be rehabilitated anew    not to speak at all of the difficulties and almost unfulfillable conditions of my investigation
no one need point all this out to me  i know it all as well as any average dog  i have no ambition to meddle with real scientific matters  i have all the respect for knowledge that it deserves  but to increase knowledge i lack the equipment  the diligence  the leisure  and    not least  and particularly during the past few years    the desire as well
i swallow down my food  but the slightest preliminary methodical politico economical observation of it does not seem to me worth while
in this connection the essence of all knowledge is enough for me  the simple rule with which the mother weans her young ones from her teats and sends them out into the world   water the ground as much as you can   and in this sentence is not almost everything contained  what has scientific inquiry  ever since our first fathers inaugurated it  of decisive importance to add to this  mere details  mere details  and how uncertain they are  but this rule will remain as long as we are dogs
it concerns our main staple of food  true  we have also other resources  but only at a pinch  and if the year is not too bad we could live on this main staple of our food  this food we find on the earth  but the earth needs our water to nourish it and only at that price provides us with our food  the emergence of which  however  and this should not be forgotten  can also be hastened by certain spells  songs  and ritual movements
but in my opinion that is all  there is nothing else that is fundamental to be said on the question
in this opinion  moreover  i am at one with the vast majority of the dog community  and must firmly dissociate myself from all heretical views on this point
quite honestly i have no ambition to be peculiar  or to pose as being in the right against the majority  i am only too happy when i can agree with my comrades  as i do in this case my own inquiries  however  are in another direction
my personal observation tells me that the earth  when it is watered and scratched according to the rules of science  extrudes nourishment  and moreover in such quality  in such abundance  in such ways  in such places  at such hours as the laws partially or completely established by science demand
i accept all this  my question  however  is the following   whence does the earth procure this food   a question which people in general pretend not to understand  and to which the best answer they can give is   if you haven't enough to eat  we'll give you some of ours   now consider this answer
i know that it is not one of the virtues of dogdom to share with others food that one has once gained possession of
life is hard  the earth stubborn  science rich in knowledge but poor in practical results  anyone who has food keeps it to himself  that is not selfishness  but the opposite  dog law  the unanimous decision of the people  the outcome of their victory over egoism  for the possessors are always in a minority and for that reason this answer   if you haven't enough to eat  we'll give you some of ours  is merely a way of speaking  a jest  a form of raillery
i have not forgotten that
but all the more significant did it seem to me  when i was rushing about everywhere with my questions during those days  that they put mockery aside as far as i was concerned  true  they did not actually give me anything to eat    where could they have found it at a moment's notice     and even if anyone chanced to have some food  naturally he forgot everything else in the fury of his hunger  yet they all seriously meant what they said when they made the offer  and here and there  right enough  i was presently allowed some slight trifle if i was only smart enough to snatch it quickly
how came it that people treated me so strangely  pampered me  favored me  because i was a lean dog  badly fed and neglectful of my needs  but there were countless badly fed dogs running about  and the others snatched even the wretchedest scrap from under their noses whenever they could  and often not from greed  but rather on principle no  they treated me with special favor  i cannot give much detailed proof of this  but i have a firm conviction that it was so
was it my questions  then  that pleased them  and that they regarded as so clever  no  my questions did not please them and were generally looked on as stupid
and yet it could only have been my questions that won me their attention
it was as if they would rather do the impossible  that is  stop my mouth with food    they did not do it  but they would have liked to do it    than endure my questions
but in that case they would have done better to drive me away and refuse to listen to my questions
no  they did not want to do that  they did not indeed want to listen to my questions  but it was because i asked these questions that they did not want to drive me away
that was the time    much as i was ridiculed and treated as a silly puppy  and pushed here and pushed there    the time when i actually enjoyed most public esteem  never again was i to enjoy anything like it  i had free entry everywhere  no obstacle was put in my way  i was actually flattered  though the flattery was disguised as rudeness
and all really because of my questions  my impatience  my thirst for knowledge
did they want to lull me to sleep  to divert me  without violence  almost lovingly  from a false path  yet a path whose falseness was not so completely beyond all doubt that violence was permissible  also a certain respect and fear kept them from employing violence
i divined even in those days something of this  today i know it quite well  far better than those who actually practiced it at the time  what they wanted to do was really to divert me from my path
they did not succeed  they achieved the opposite  my vigilance was sharpened
more  it became clear to me that it was i who was trying to seduce the others  and that i was actually successful up to a certain point
only with the assistance of the whole dog world could i begin to understand my own questions
for instance when i asked   whence does the earth procure this food   was i troubled  as appearances might quite well indicate  about the earth  was i troubled about the labors of the earth  not in the least  that  as i very soon recognized  was far from my mind  all that i cared for was the race of dogs  that and nothing else
for what is there actually except our own species  to whom but it can one appeal in the wide and empty world  all knowledge  the totality of all questions and all answers  is contained in the dog
if one could but realize this knowledge  if one could but bring it into the light of day  if we dogs would but own that we know infinitely more than we admit to ourselves  even the most loquacious dog is more secretive of his knowledge than the places where good food can be found
trembling with desire  whipping yourself with your own tail  you steal cautiously upon your fellow dog  you ask  you beg  you howl  you bite  and achieve    and achieve what you could have achieved just as well without any effort  amiable attention  friendly contiguity  honest acceptance  ardent embraces  barks that mingle as one  everything is directed toward achieving an ecstasy  a forgetting and finding again  but the one thing that you long to win above all  the admission of knowledge  remains denied to you
to such prayers  whether silent or loud  the only answers you get  even after you have employed your powers of seduction to the utmost  are vacant stares  averted glances  troubled and veiled eyes
it is much the same as it was when  a mere puppy  i shouted to the dog musicians and they remained silent
now one might say   you complain about your fellow dogs  about their silence on crucial questions  you assert that they know more than they admit  more than they will allow to be valid  and that this silence  the mysterious reason for which is also  of course  tacitly concealed  poisons existence and makes it unendurable for you  so that you must either alter it or have done with it  that may be  but you are yourself a dog  you have also the dog knowledge  well  bring it out  not merely in the form of a question  but as an answer
if you utter it  who will think of opposing you  the great choir of dogdom will join in as if it had been waiting for you
then you will have clarity  truth  avowal  as much of them as you desire
the roof of this wretched life  of which you say so many hard things  will burst open  and all of us  shoulder to shoulder  will ascend into the lofty realm of freedom and if we should not achieve that final consummation  if things should become worse than before  if the whole truth should be more insupportable than the half truth  if it should be proved that the silent are in the right as the guardians of existence  if the faint hope that we still possess should give way to complete hopelessness  the attempt is still worth the trial  since you do not desire to live as you are compelled to live
well  then  why do you make it a reproach against the others that they are silent  and remain silent yourself   easy to answer  because i am a dog  in essentials just as locked in silence as the others  stubbornly resisting my own questions  dour out of fear
to be precise  is it in the hope that they might answer me that i have questioned my fellow dogs  at least since my adult years  have i any such foolish hope  can i contemplate the foundations of our existence  divine their profundity  watch the labor of their construction  that dark labor  and expect all this to be forsaken  neglected  undone  simply because i ask a question  no  that i truly expect no longer
i understand my fellow dogs  am flesh of their flesh  of their miserable  ever renewed  ever desirous flesh
but it is not merely flesh and blood that we have in common  but knowledge also  and not only knowledge  but the key to it as well
i do not possess that key except in common with all the others  i cannot grasp it without their help
the hardest bones  containing the richest marrow  can be conquered only by a united crunching of all the teeth of all dogs
that of course is only a figure of speech and exaggerated  if all teeth were but ready they would not need even to bite  the bones would crack themselves and the marrow would be freely accessible to the feeblest of dogs if i remain faithful to this metaphor  then the goal of my aims  my questions  my inquiries  appears monstrous  it is true for i want to compel all dogs thus to assemble together  i want the bones to crack open under the pressure of their collective preparedness  and then i want to dismiss them to the ordinary life that they love  while all by myself  quite alone  i lap up the marrow
that sounds monstrous  almost as if i wanted to feed on the marrow  not merely of a bone  but of the whole canine race itself
but it is only a metaphor
the marrow that i am discussing here is no food  on the contrary  it is a poison
my questions only serve as a goad to myself  i only want to be stimulated by the silence which rises up around me as the ultimate answer
 how long will you be able to endure the fact that the world of dogs  as your researches make more and more evident  is pledged to silence and always will be  how long will you be able to endure it   that is the real great question of my life  before which all smaller ones sink into insignificance  it is put to myself alone and concerns no one else
unfortunately i can answer it more easily than the smaller  specific questions  i shall probably hold out till my natural end  the calm of old age will put up a greater and greater resistance to all disturbing questions
i shall very likely die in silence and surrounded by silence  indeed almost peacefully  and i look forward to that with composure
an admirably strong heart  lungs that it is impossible to use up before their time  have been given to us dogs as if in malice  we survive all questions  even our own  bulwarks of silence that we are
recently i have taken more and more to casting up my life  looking for the decisive  the fundamental  error that i must surely have made  and i cannot find it
and yet i must have made it  for if i had not made it and yet were unable by the diligent labor of a long life to achieve my desire  that would prove that my desire is impossible  and complete hopelessness must follow
behold  then  the work of a lifetime
first of all my inquiries into the question  whence does the earth procure the food it gives us  a young dog  at bottom naturally greedy for life  i renounced all enjoyments  apprehensively avoided all pleasures  buried my head between my front paws when i was confronted by temptation  and addressed myself to my task
i was no scholar  neither in the information i acquired  nor in method  nor in intention
that was probably a defect  but it could not have been a decisive one
i had had little schooling  for i left my mother's care at an early age  soon got used to independence  led a free life  and premature independence is inimical to systematic learning
but i have seen much  listened to much  spoken with dogs of all sorts and conditions  understood everything  i believe  fairly intelligently  and correlated my particular observations fairly intelligently  that has compensated somewhat for my lack of scholarship  not to mention that independence  if it is a disadvantage in learning things  is an actual advantage when one is making one's own inquiries
in my case it was all the more necessary as i was not able to employ the real method of science  to avail myself  that is  of the labors of my predecessors  and establish contact with contemporary investigators
i was entirely cast on my own resources  began at the very beginning  and with the consciousness  inspiriting to youth  but utterly crushing to age  that the fortuitous point to which i carried my labors must also be the final one
was i really so alone in my inquiries  at the beginning and up to now  yes and no
it is inconceivable that there must not always have been and that there are not today individual dogs in the same case as myself
i cannot be so accursed as that
i do not deviate from the dog nature by a hairbreadth
every dog has like me the impulse to question  and i have like every dog the impulse not to answer
everyone has the impulse to question
how otherwise could my questions have affected my hearers in the slightest    and they were often affected  to my ecstatic delight  an exaggerated delight  i must confess    and how otherwise could i have been prevented from achieving much more than i have done  and that i have the compulsion to remain silent needs unfortunately no particular proof
i am at bottom  then  no different from any other dog  everybody  no matter how he may differ in opinion from me and reject my views  will gladly admit that  and i in turn will admit as much of any other dog
only the mixture of the elements is different  a difference very important for the individual  insignificant for the race
and now can one credit that the composition of these available elements has never chanced through all the past and present to result in a mixture similar to mine  one  moreover  if mine be regarded as unfortunate  more unfortunate still  to think so would be contrary to all experience
we dogs are all engaged in the strangest occupations  occupations in which one would refuse to believe if one had not the most reliable information concerning them
the best example that i can quote is that of the soaring dog
the first time i heard of one i laughed and simply refused to believe it
what  one was asked to believe that there was a very tiny species of dog  not much bigger than my head even when it was full grown  and this dog  who must of course be a feeble creature  an artificial  weedy  brushed and curled fop by all accounts  incapable of making an honest jump  this dog was supposed  according to people's stories  to remain for the most part high up in the air  apparently doing nothing at all but simply resting there  no  to try to make me swallow such things was exploiting the simplicity of a young dog too outrageously  i told myself
but shortly afterwards i heard from another source an account of another soaring dog
could there be a conspiracy to fool me  but after that i saw the dog musicians with my own eyes  and from that day i considered everything possible  no prejudices fettered my powers of apprehension  i investigated the most senseless rumors  following them as far as they could take me  and the most senseless seemed to me in this senseless world more probable than the sensible  and moreover particularly fertile for investigation
so it was too with the soaring dogs
i discovered a great many things about them  true  i have succeeded to this day in seeing none of them  but of their existence i have been firmly convinced for a long time  and they occupy an important place in my picture of the world
as usual  it is not  of course  their technique that chiefly gives me to think
it is wonderful    who can gainsay it     that these dogs should be able to float in the air  in my amazed admiration for that i am at one with my fellow dogs
but far more strange to my mind is the senselessness  the dumb senselessness of these existences
they have no relation whatever to the general life of the community  they hover in the air  and that is all  and life goes on its usual way  someone now and then refers to art and artists  but there it ends
but why  my good dogs  why on earth do these dogs float in the air  what sense is there in their occupation  why can one get no word of explanation regarding them  why do they hover up there  letting their legs  the pride of dogs  fall into desuetude  preserving a detachment from the nourishing earth  reaping without having sowed  being particularly well provided for  as i hear  and at the cost of the dog community too
i can flatter myself that my inquiries into these matters made some stir
people began to investigate after a fashion  to collect data  they made a beginning  at least  although they are never likely to go farther
but after all that is sornething
and though the truth will not be discovered by such means    never can that stage be reached    yet they throw light on some of the profounder ramifications of falsehood
for all the senseless phenomena of our existence  and the most senseless most of all  are susceptible to investigation
not completely  of course    that is the diabolical jest    but sufficiently to spare one painful questions
take the soaring dogs once more as an example  they are not haughty as one might imagine at first  but rather particularly dependent upon their fellow dogs  if one tries to put oneself in their place one will see that
for they must do what they can to obtain pardon  and not openly    that would be a violation of the obligation to keep silence    they must do what they can to obtain pardon for their way of life  or else divert attention from it so that it may be forgotten     and they do this  i have been told  by means of an almost unendurable volubility
they are perpetually talking  partly of their philosophical reflections  with which  seeing that they have completely renounced bodily exertion  they can continuously occupy themselves  partly of the observations which they have made from their exalted stations  and although  as is very understandable considering their lazy existence  they are not much distinguished for intellectual power  and their philosophy is as worthless as their observations  and science can make hardly any use of their utterances  and besides is not reduced to draw assistance from such wretched sources  nevertheless if one asks what the soaring dogs are really doing one will invariably receive the reply that they contribute a great deal to knowledge  that is true   remarks someone   but their contributions are worthless and wearisome   the reply to that is a shrug  or a change of the subject  or annoyance  or laughter  and in a little while  when you ask again  you learn once more that they contribute to knowledge  and finally when you are asked the question you yourself will reply    if you are not careful    to the same effect and perhaps indeed it is well not to be too obstinate  but to yield to public sentiment  to accept the extant soaring dogs  and without recognizing their right to existence  which cannot be done  yet to tolerate them
but more than this must not be required  that would be going too far  and yet the demand is made
we are perpetually being asked to put up with new soaring dogs who are always appearing
one does not even know where they come from
do these dogs multiply by propagation  have they actually the strength for that     for they are nothing much more than a beautiful coat of hair  and what is there in that to propagate  but even if that improbable contingency were possible  when could it take place  for they are invariably seen alone  self complacently floating high up in the air  and if once in a while they descend to take a run  it lasts only for a minute or two  a few mincing struts and also always in strict solitude  absorbed in what is supposed to be profound thought  from which  even when they exert themselves to the utmost  they cannot tear themselves free  or at least so they say but if they do not propagate their kind  is it credible that there can be dogs who voluntarily give up life on the solid ground  voluntarily become soaring dogs  and merely for the sake of the comfort and a certain technical accomplishment choose that empty life on cushions up there  it is unthinkable  neither propagation nor voluntary transition is thinkable
the facts  however  show that there are always new soaring dogs in evidence  from which one must conclude that  in spite of obstacles which appear insurmountable to our understanding  no dog species  however curious  ever dies out  once it exists  or  at least  not without a tough struggle  not without being capable of putting up a successful defense for a long time
but if that is valid for such an out of the way  externally odd  inefficient species as the soaring dog  must i not also accept it as valid for mine  besides  i am not in the least queer outwardly  an ordinary middle class dog such as is very prevalent  in this neighborhood  at least  i am neither particularly exceptional in any way  nor particularly repellent in any way  and in nay youth and to some extent also in maturity  so long as i attended to my appearance and had lots of exercise  i was actually considered a very handsome dog
my front view was particularly admired  my slim legs  the fine set of my head  but my silvery white and yellow coat  which curled only at the hair tips  was very pleasing too  in all that there was nothing strange  the only strange thing about me is my nature  yet even that  as i am always careful to remember  has its foundation in universal dog nature
now if not even the soaring dogs live in isolation  but invariably manage to encounter their fellows somewhere or other in the great dog world  and even to conjure new generations of themselves out of nothingness  then i too can live in the confidence that i am not quite forlorn certainly the fate of types like mine must be a strange one  and the existence of my colleagues can never be of visible help to me  if for no other reason than that i should scarcely ever be able to recognize them
we are the dogs who are crushed by the silence  who long to break through it  literally to get a breath of fresh air  the others seem to thrive on silence  true  that is only so in appearance  as in the case of the musical dogs  who ostensibly were quite calm when they played  but in reality were in a state of intense excitement  nevertheless the illusion is very strong  one tries to make a breach in it  but it mocks every attempt
what help  then  do my colleagues find  what kind of attempts do they make to manage to go on living in spite of everything  these attempts may be of various kinds
my own bout of questioning while i was young was one
so i thought that perhaps if i associated with those who asked many questions i might find my real comrades well  i did so for some time  with great self control  a self control made necessary by the annoyance i felt when i was interrupted by perpetual questions that i mostly could not answer myself  for the only thing that concerns me is to obtain answers
moreover  who but is eager to ask questions when he is young  and how  when so many questions are going about  are you to pick out the right questions  one question sounds like another  it is the intention that counts  but that is often hidden even from the questioner
and besides  it is a peculiarity of dogs to be always asking questions  they ask them confusedly all together  it is as if in doing that they were trying to obliterate every trace of the genuine questions
no  my real colleagues are not to be found among the youthful questioners  and just as little among the old and silent  to whom i now belong
but what good are all these questions  for they have failed me completely  apparently my colleagues are cleverer dogs than i  and have recourse to other excellent methods that enable them to bear this life  methods which  nevertheless  as i can tell from my own experience  though they may perhaps help at a pinch  though they may calm  lull to rest  distract  are yet on the whole as impotent as my own  for  no matter where i look  i can see no sign of their success
i am afraid that the last thing by which i can hope to recognize my real colleagues is their success
but where  then  are my real colleagues  yes  that is the burden of my complaint  that is the kernel of it
where are they  everywhere and nowhere
perhaps my next door neighbor  only three jumps away  is one of them  we often bark across to each other  he calls on me sometimes too  though i do not call on him
is he my real colleague  i do not know  i certainly see no sign of it in him  but it is possible
it is possible  but all the same nothing is more improbable
when he is away i can amuse myself  drawing on my fancy  by discovering in him many things that have a suspicious resemblance to myself  but once he stands before me all my fancies become ridiculous
an old dog  a little smaller even than myself    and i am hardly medium size    brown  short haired  with a tired hang of the head and a shuffling gait  on top of all this he trails his left hind leg behind him a little because of some disease
for a long time now i have been more intimate with him than with anybody else  i am glad to say that i can still get on tolerably well with him  and when he goes away i shout the most friendly greetings after him  though not out of affection  but in anger at myself  for if i follow him i find him just as disgusting again  slinking along there with his trailing leg and his much too low hindquarters
sometimes it seems to me as if i were trying to humiliate myself by thinking of him as my colleague nor in our talks does he betray any trace of similarity of thought  true  he is clever and cultured enough as these things go here  and i could learn much from him  but is it for cleverness and culture that i am looking  we converse usually about local questions  and i am astonished    my isolation has made me more clear sighted in such matters    how much intelligence is needed even by an ordinary dog even in average and not unfavorable circumstances  if he is to live out his life and defend himself against the greater of life's customary dangers true  knowledge provides the rules one must follow  but even to grasp them imperfectly and in rough outline is by no means easy  and when one has actually grasped them the real difficulty still remains  namely to apply them to local conditions    here almost nobody can help  almost every hour brings new tasks  and every new patch of earth its specific problems  no one can maintain that he has settled everything for good and that henceforth his life will go on  so to speak  of itself  not even i myself  though my needs shrink literally from day to day and all this ceaseless labor    to what end  merely to entomb oneself deeper and deeper in silence  it seems  so deep that one can never be dragged out of it again by anybody people often praise the universal progress made by the dog community throughout the ages  and probably mean by that more particularly the progress in knowledge
certainly knowledge is progressing  its advance is irresistible  it actually progresses at an accelerating speed  always faster  but what is there to praise in that  it is as if one were to praise someone because with the years he grows older  and in consequence comes nearer and nearer to death with increasing speed
that is a natural and moreover an ugly process  in which i find nothing to praise
i can only see decline everywhere  in saying which  however  i do not mean that earlier generations were essentially better than ours  but only younger  that was their great advantage  their memory was not so overburdened as ours today  it was easier to get them to speak out  and even if nobody actually succeeded in doing that  the possibility of it was greater  and it is indeed this greater sense of possibility that moves us so deeply when we listen to those old and strangely simple stories
here and there we catch a curiously significant phrase and we would almost like to leap to our feet  if we did not feel the weight of centuries upon us
no  whatever objection i may have to my age  former generations were not better  indeed in a sense they were far worse  far weaker
even in those days wonders did not openly walk the streets for anyone to seize  but all the same  dogs    i cannot put it in any other way    had not yet become so doggish as today  the edifice of dogdom was still loosely put together  the true word could still have intervened  planning or replanning the structure  changing it at will  transforming it into its opposite  and the word was there  was very near at least  on the tip of everybody's tongue  anyone might have hit upon it
and what has become of it today  today one may pluck out one's very heart and not find it
our generation is lost  it may be  but it is more blameless than those earlier ones
i can understand the hesitation of my generation  indeed it is no longer mere hesitation  it is the thousandth forgetting of a dream dreamt a thousand times and forgotten a thousand times  and who can damn us merely for forgetting for the thousandth time  but i fancy i understand the hesitation of our forefathers too  we would probably have acted just as they did  indeed i could almost say  well for us that it was not we who had to take the guilt upon us  that instead we can hasten in almost guiltless silence toward death in a world darkened by others
when our first fathers strayed they had doubtless scarcely any notion that their aberration was to be an endless one  they could still literally see the crossroads  it seemed an easy matter to turn back whenever they pleased  and if they hesitated to turn back it was merely because they wanted to enjoy a dog's life for a little while longer  it was not yet a genuine dog's life  and already it seemed intoxicatingly beautiful to them  so what must it become in a little while  a very little while  and so they strayed farther
they did not know what we can now guess at  contemplating the course of history  that change begins in the soul before it appears in ordinary existence  and that  when they began to enjoy a dog's life  they must already have possessed real old dogs' souls  and were by no means so near their starting point as they thought  or as their eyes feasting on all doggish joys tried to persuade them
but who can still speak of youth today  these were the really young dogs  but their sole ambition unfortunately was to become old dogs  truly a thing which they could not fail to achieve  as all succeeding generations show  and ours  the last  most clearly of all
naturally i do not talk to my neighbor of these things  but often i cannot but think of them when i am sitting opposite him    that typical old dog    or bury my nose in his coat  which already has a whiff of the smell of cast off hides
to talk to him  or even to any of the others  about such things would be pointless
i know what course the conversation would take
he would urge a slight objection now and then  but finally he would agree    agreement is the best weapon of defense    and the matter would be buried  why indeed trouble to exhume it at all  and in spite of this there is a profounder understanding between my neighbor and me  going deeper than mere words
i shall never cease to maintain that  though i have no proof of it and perhaps am merely suffering from an ordinary delusion  caused by the fact that for a long time this dog has been the only one with whom i have held any communication  and so i am bound to cling to him
 are you after all my colleague in your own fashion  and ashamed because everything has miscarried with you  look  the same fate has been mine
when i am alone i weep over it  come  it is sweeter to weep in company   i often have such thoughts as these and then i give him a prolonged look
he does not lower his glance  but neither can one read anything from it  he gazes at me dully  wondering why i am silent and why i have broken off the conversation
but perhaps that very glance is his way of questioning me  and i disappoint him just as he disappoints me
in my youth  if other problems had not been more important to me then  and i had not been perfectly satisfied with my own company  i would probably have asked him straight out and received an answer flatly agreeing with me  and that would have been worse even than today's silence but is not everybody silent exactly in the same way  what is there to prevent me from believing that everyone is my colleague  instead of thinking that i have only one or two fellow inquirers    lost and forgotten along with their petty achievements  so that i can never reach them by any road through the darkness of ages or the confused throng of the present  why not believe that all dogs from the beginning of time have been my colleagues  all diligent in their own way  all unsuccessful in their own way  all silent or falsely garrulous in their own way  as hopeless research is apt to make one  but in that case i need not have severed myself from my fellows at all  i could have remained quietly among the others  i had no need to fight my way out like a stubborn child through the closed ranks of the grownups  who indeed wanted as much as i to find a way out  and who seemed incomprehensible to me simply because of their knowledge  which told them that nobody could ever escape and that it was stupid to use force
such ideas  however  are definitely due to the influence of my neighbor  he confuses me  he fills me with dejection  and yet in himself he is happy enough  at least when he is in his own quarters i often hear him shouting and singing  it is really unbearable it would be a good thing to renounce this last tie also  to cease giving way to the vague dreams which all contact with dogs unavoidably provokes  no matter how hardened one may consider oneself  and to employ the short time that still remains for me exclusively in prosecuting my researches the next time he comes i shall slip away  or pretend i am asleep  and keep up the pretense until he stops visiting me
also my researches have fallen into desuetude  i relax  i grow weary  i trot mechanically where once i raced enthusiastically
i think of the time when i began to inquire into the question   whence does the earth procure this food   then indeed i really lived among the people  i pushed my way where the crowd was thickest  wanted everybody to know my work and be my audience  and my audience was even more essential to me than my work  i still expected to produce some effect or other  and that naturally gave me a great impetus  which now that i am solitary is gone
but in those days i was so full of strength that i achieved something unprecedented  something at variance with all our principles  and that every contemporary eyewitness assuredly recalls now as an uncanny feat
our scientific knowledge  which generally makes for an extreme specialization  is remarkably simple in one province
i mean where it teaches that the earth engenders our food  and then  after having laid down this hypothesis  gives the methods by which the different foods may be achieved in their best kinds and greatest abundance
now it is of course true that the earth brings forth all food  of that there can be no doubt  but as simple as people generally imagine it to be the matter is not  and their belief that it is simple prevents further inquiry
take an ordinary occurrence that happens every day
if we were to be quite inactive  as i am almost completely now  and after a perfunctory scratching and watering of the soil lay down and waited for what was to come  then we should find the food on the ground  assuming  that is  that a result of some kind is inevitable
nevertheless that is not what usually happens
those who have preserved even a little freedom of judgment on scientific matters    and their numbers are truly small  for science draws a wider and wider circle around itself    will easily see  without having to make any specific experiment  that the main part of the food that is discovered on the ground in such cases comes from above  indeed customarily we snap up most of our food  according to our dexterity and greed  before it has reached the ground at all
in saying that  however  i am saying nothing against science  the earth  of course  brings forth this kind of food too
whether the earth draws one kind of food out of itself and calls down another kind from the skies perhaps makes no essential difference  and science  which has established that in both cases it is necessary to prepare the ground  need not perhaps concern itself with such distinctions  for does it not say   if you have food in your jaws you have solved all questions for the time being   but it seems to me that science nevertheless takes a veiled interest  at least to some extent  in these matters  inasmuch as it recognizes two chief methods of procuring food  namely the actual preparation of the ground  and secondly the auxiliary perfecting processes of incantation  dance  and song i find here a distinction in accordance with the one i have myself made  not a definitive distinction  perhaps  but yet clear enough
the scratching and watering of the ground  in my opinion  serves to produce both kinds of food  and remains indispensable  incantation  dance  and song  however  are concerned less with the ground food in the narrower sense  and serve principally to attract the food from above
tradition fortifies me in this interpretation
the ordinary dogs themselves set science right here without knowing it  and without science being able to venture a word in reply if  as science claims  these ceremonies minister only to the soil  giving it the potency  let us say  to attract food from the air  then logically they should be directed exclusively to the soil  it is the soil that the incantations must be whispered to  the soil that must be danced to and to the best of my knowledge science ordains nothing else than this
but now comes the remarkable thing  the people in all their ceremonies gaze upwards
this is no insult to science  since science does not forbid it  but leaves the husbandman complete freedom in this respect  in its teaching it takes only the soil into account  and if the husbandman carries out its instructions concerning the preparation of the ground it is content  yet  in my opinion  it should really demand more than this if it is logical
and  though i have never been deeply initiated into science  i simply cannot conceive how the learned can bear to let our people  unruly and passionate as they are  chant their incantations with their faces turned upwards  wail our ancient folk songs into the air  and spring high in their dances as though  forgetting the ground  they wished to take flight from it forever
i took this contradiction as my starting point  and whenever  according to the teachings of science  the harvest time was approaching  i restricted my attention to the ground  it was the ground that i scratched in the dance  and i almost gave myself a crick in the neck keeping my head as close to the ground as i could
later i dug a hole for my nose  and sang and declaimed into it so that only the ground might hear  and nobody else beside or above me
the results of my experiment were meager
sometimes the food did not appear  and i was already preparing to rejoice at this proof  but then the food would appear  it was exactly as if my strange performance had caused some confusion at first  but had shown itself later to possess advantages  so that in my case the usual barking and leaping could be dispensed with
often  indeed  the food appeared in greater abundance than formerly  but then again it would stay away altogether
with a diligence hitherto unknown in a young dog i drew up exact reports of all my experiments  fancied that here and there i was on a scent that might lead me further  but then it lost itself again in obscurity
my inadequate grounding in science also undoubtedly held me up here
what guarantee had i  for instance  that the absence of the food was not caused by unscientific preparation of the ground rather than by my experiments  and if that should be so  then all my conclusions were invalid
in certain circumstances i might have been able to achieve an almost scrupulously exact experiment  namely  if i had succeeded only once in bringing down food by an upward incantation without preparing the ground at all  and then had failed to extract food by an incantation directed exclusively to the ground i attempted indeed something of this kind  but without any real belief in it and without the conditions being quite perfect  for it is my fixed opinion that a certain amount of ground preparation is always necessary  and even if the heretics who deny this are right  their theory can never be proved in any case  seeing that the watering of the ground is done under a kind of compulsion  and within certain limits simply cannot be avoided
another and somewhat tangential experiment succeeded better and aroused some public attention
arguing from the customary method of snatching food while still in the air  i decided to allow the food to fall to the ground  but to make no effort to snatch it
accordingly i always made a small jump in the air when the food appeared  but timed it so that it might always fail of its object  in the majority of instances the food fell dully and indifferently to the ground in spite of this  and i flung myself furiously upon it  with the fury both of hunger and of disappointment
but in isolated cases something else happened  something really strange  the food did not fall but followed me through the air  the food pursued the hungry
that never went on for long  always for only a short stretch  then the food fell after all  or vanished completely  or    the most common case    my greed put a premature end to the experiment and i swallowed down the tempting food all the same i was happy at that time  a stir of curiosity ran through my neighborhood  i attracted uneasy attention  i found my acquaintances more accessible to my questions  i could see in their eyes a gleam that seemed like an appeal for help  and even if it was only the reflection of my own glance i asked for nothing more
i was satisfied
until at last i discovered    and the others discovered it simultaneously    that this experiment of mine was a commonplace of science  had already succeeded with others far more brilliantly than with me  and though it had not been attempted for a long time on account of the extreme self control it required  had also no need to be repeated  for scientifically it had no value at all
it only proved what was already known  that the ground not only attracts food vertically from above  but also at a slant  indeed sometimes in spirals
so there i was left with my experiment  but i was not discouraged  i was too young for that  on the contrary  this disappointment braced me to attempt perhaps the greatest achievement of my life
i did not believe the scientists' depreciations of my experiment  yet belief was of no avail here  but only proof  and i resolved to set about establishing that and thus raise my experiment from its original irrelevance and set it in the very center of the field of research
i wished to prove that when i retreated before the food it was not the ground that attracted it at a slant  but i who drew it after me
this first experiment  it is true  i could not carry any farther  to see the food before one and experiment in a scientific spirit at the same time    one cannot keep that up indefinitely
but i decided to do something else  i resolved to fast completely as long as i could stand it  and at the same time avoid all sight of food  all temptation
if i were to withdraw myself in this manner  remain lying day and night with closed eyes  trouble myself neither to snatch food from the air nor to lift it from the ground  and if  as i dared not expect  yet faintly hoped  without taking any of the customary measures  and merely in response to the unavoidable irrational watering of the ground and the quiet recitation of the incantations and songs (the dance i wished to omit  so as not to weaken my powers) the food were to come of itself from above  and without going near the ground were to knock at my teeth for admittance    if that were to happen  then  even if science was not confuted  for it has enough elasticity to admit exceptions and isolated cases    i asked myself what would the other dogs say  who fortunately do not possess such extreme elasticity  for this would be no exceptional case like those handed down by history  such as the incident  let us say  of the dog who refuses  because of bodily illness or trouble of mind  to prepare the ground  to track down and seize his food  upon which the whole dog community recite magical formulae and by this means succeed in making the food deviate from its customary route into the jaws of the invalid
i  on the contrary  was perfectly sound and at the height of my powers  my appetite so splendid that it prevented me all day from thinking of anything but itself  i submitted  moreover  whether it be credited or not  voluntarily to my period of fasting  was myself quite able to conjure down my own supply of food and wished also to do so  and so i asked no assistance from the dog community  and indeed rejected it in the most determined manner
i sought a suitable place for myself in an outlying clump of bushes  where i would have to listen to no talk of food  no sound of munching jaws and bones being gnawed  i ate my fill for the last time and laid me down
as far as possible i wanted to pass my whole time with closed eyes  until the food came it would be perpetual night for me  even though my vigil might last for days or weeks
during that time  however  i dared not sleep much  better indeed if i did not sleep at all    and that made everything much harder    for i must not only conjure the food down from the air  but also be on my guard lest i should be asleep when it arrived  yet on the other hand sleep would be very welcome to me  for i would manage to fast much longer asleep than awake
for those reasons i decided to arrange my time prudently and sleep a great deal  but always in short snatches
i achieved this by always resting my head while i slept on some frail twig  which soon snapped and so awoke me
so there i lay  sleeping or keeping watch  dreaming or singing quietly to myself
my first vigils passed uneventfully  perhaps in the place whence the food came no one had yet noticed that i was lying there in resistance to the normal course of things  and so there was no sign
i was a little disturbed in my concentration by the fear that the other dogs might miss me  presently find me  and attempt something or other against me
a second fear was that at the mere wetting of the ground  though it was unfruitful ground according to the findings of science  some chance nourishment might appear and seduce me by its smell
but for a time nothing of that kind happened and i could go on fasting
apart from such fears i was more calm during this first stage than i could remember ever having been before
although in reality i was laboring to annul the findings of science  i felt within me a deep reassurance  indeed almost the proverbial serenity of the scientific worker
in my thoughts i begged forgiveness of science  there must be room in it for my researches too  consolingly in my ears rang the assurance that no matter how great the effect of my inquiries might be  and indeed the greater the better  i would not be lost to ordinary dog life  science regarded my attempts with benevolence  it itself would undertake the interpretation of my discoveries  and that promise already meant fulfillment  while until now i had felt outlawed in my innermost heart and had run my head against the traditional walls of my species like a savage  i would now be accepted with great honor  the long yearned for warmth of assembled canine bodies would lap around me  i would ride uplifted high on the shoulders of my fellows
remarkable effects of my first hunger
my achievement seemed so great to me that i began to weep with emotion and self pity there among the quiet bushes  which it must be confessed was not very understandable  for when i was looking forward to my wellearned reward why should i weep  probably out of pure happiness
it is always when i am happy  and that is seldom enough  that i weep
after that  however  these feelings soon passed
my beautiful fancies fled one by one before the increasing urgency of my hunger  a little longer and i was  after an abrupt farewell to all my imaginations and my sublime feelings  totally alone with the hunger burning in my entrails
 that is my hunger   i told myself countless times during this stage  as if i wanted to convince myself that my hunger and i were still two things and i could shake it off like a burdensome lover  but in reality we were very painfully one  and when i explained to myself   that is my hunger   it was really my hunger that was speaking and having its joke at my expense
a bad  bad time  i still shudder to think of it  and not merely on account of the suffering i endured then  but mainly because i was unable to finish it then and consequently shall have to live through that suffering once more if i am ever to achieve anything  for today i still hold fasting to be the final and most potent means of my research
the way goes through fasting  the highest  if it is attainable  is attainable only by the highest effort  and the highest effort among us is voluntary fasting
so when i think of those times    and i would gladly pass my life in brooding over them    i cannot help thinking also of the time that still threatens me
it seems to me that it takes almost a lifetime to recuperate from such an attempt  my whole life as an adult lies between me and that fast  and i have not recovered yet when i begin upon my next fast i shall perhaps have more resolution than the first time  because of my greater experience and deeper insight into the need for the attempt  but my powers are still enfeebled by that first essay  and so i shall probably begin to fail at the mere approach of these familiar horrors
my weaker appetite will not help me  it will only reduce the value of the attempt a little  and will  indeed  probably force me to fast longer than would have been necessary the first time
i think i am clear on these and many other matters  the long interval has not been wanting in trial attempts  often enough i have literally got my teeth into hunger  but i was still not strong enough for the ultimate effort  and now the unspoiled ardor of youth is of course gone forever
it vanished in the great privations of that first fast
all sorts of thoughts tormented me
our forefathers appeared threateningly before me
true  i held them responsible for everything  even if i dared not say so openly  it was they who involved our dog life in guilt  and so i could easily have responded to their menaces with countermenaces  but i bow before their knowledge  it came from sources of which we know no longer  and for that reason  much as i may feel compelled to oppose them  i shall never actually overstep their laws  but content myself with wriggling out through the gaps  for which i have a particularly good nose
on the question of fasting i appealed to the wellknown dialogue in the course of which one of our sages once expressed the intention of forbidding fasting  but was dissuaded by a second with the words   but who would ever think of fasting   whereupon the first sage allowed himself to be persuaded and withdrew the prohibition but now arises the question   is not fasting really forbidden after all   the great majority of commentators deny this and regard fasting as freely permitted  and holding as they think with the second sage do not worry in the least about the evil consequences that may result from erroneous interpretations
i had naturally assured myself on this point before i began my fast
but now that i was twisted with the pangs of hunger  and in my distress of mind sought relief in my own hind legs  despairingly licking and gnawing at them up to the very buttocks  the universal interpretation of this dialogue seemed to me entirely and completely false  i cursed the commentators' science  i cursed myself for having been led astray by it  for the dialogue contained  as any child could see  more than merely one prohibition of fasting  the first sage wished to forbid fasting  what a sage wishes is already done  so fasting was forbidden  as for the second sage  he not only agreed with the first  but actually considered fasting impossible  piled therefore on the first prohibition a second  that of dog nature itself  the first sage saw this and thereupon withdrew the explicit prohibition  that was to say  he imposed upon all dogs  the matter being now settled  the obligation to know themselves and to make their own prohibitions regarding fasting so here was a threefold prohibition instead of merely one  and i had violated it
now i could at least have obeyed at this point  though tardily  but in the midst of my pain i felt a longing to go on fasting  and i followed it as greedily as if it were a strange dog
i could not stop  perhaps too i was already too weak to get up and seek safety for myself in familiar scenes
i tossed about on the fallen forest leaves  i could no longer sleep  i heard noises on every side  the world  which had been asleep during my life hitherto  seemed to have been awakened by my fasting  i was tortured by the fancy that i would never be able to eat again  and i must eat so as to reduce to silence this world rioting so noisily around me  and i would never be able to do so  but the greatest noise of all came from my own belly  i often laid my ear against it with startled eyes  for i could hardly believe what i heard
and now that things were becoming unendurable my very nature seemed to be seized by the general frenzy  and made senseless attempts to save itself  the smell of food began to assail me  delicious dainties that i had long since forgotten  delights of my childhood  yes  i could smell the very fragrance of my mother's teats  i forgot my resolution to resist all smells  or rather i did not forget it  i dragged myself to and fro  never for more than a few yards  and sniffed as if that were in accordance with my resolution  as if i were looking for food simply to be on my guard against it
the fact that i found nothing did not disappoint me  the food must be there  only it was always a few steps away  my legs failed me before i could reach it
but simultaneously i knew that nothing was there  and that i made those feeble movements simply out of fear lest i might collapse in this place and never be able to leave it
my last hopes  my last dreams vanished  i would perish here miserably  of what use were my researches     childish attempts undertaken in childish and far happier days  here and now was the hour of deadly earnest  here my inquiries should have shown their value  but where had they vanished  only a dog lay here helplessly snapping at the empty air  a dog who  though he still watered the ground with convulsive haste at short intervals and without being aware of it  could not remember even the shortest of the countless incantations stored in his memory  not even the little rhyme which the newly born puppy says when it snuggles under its mother it seemed to me as if i were separated from all my fellows  not by a quite short stretch  but by an infinite distance  and as if i would die less of hunger than of neglect for it was clear that nobody troubled about me  nobody beneath the earth  on it  or above it  i was dying of their indifference  they said indifferently
 he is dying   and it would actually come to pass
and did i not myself assent  did i not say the same thing  had i not wanted to be forsaken like this  yes  brothers  but not so as to perish in that place  but to achieve truth and escape from this world of falsehood  where there is no one from whom you can learn the truth  not even from me  born as i am a citizen of falsehood
perhaps the truth was not so very far off  and i not so forsaken  therefore  as i thought  or i may have been forsaken less by my fellows than by myself  in yielding and consenting to die
but one does not die so easily as a nervous dog imagines
i merely fainted  and when i came to and raised my eyes a strange hound was standing before me
i did not feel hungry  but rather filled with strength  and my limbs  it seemed to me  were light and agile  though i made no attempt to prove this by getting to my feet
my visual faculties in themselves were no keener than usual  a beautiful but not at all extraordinary hound stood before me  i could see that  and that was all  and yet it seemed to me that i saw something more in him there was blood under me  at first i took it for food  but i recognized it immediately as blood that i had vomited
i turned my eyes from it to the strange hound
he was lean  long legged  brown with a patch of white here and there  and had a fine  strong  piercing glance
 what are you doing here   he asked
 you must leave this place    i can't leave it just now   i said  without trying to explain  for how could i explain everything to him  besides  he seemed to be in a hurry
 please go away   he said  impatiently lifting his feet and setting them down again
 let me be   i said   leave me to myself and don't worry about me  the others don't    i ask you to go for your own sake   he said
 you can ask for any reason you like   i replied
 i can't go even if i wanted to    you need have no fear of that   he said  smiling
 you can go all right
it's because you seem to be feeble that i ask you to go now  and you can go slowly if you like  if you linger now you'll have to race off later on    that's my affair   i replied
 it's mine too   he said  saddened by my stubbornness  yet obviously resolved to let me lie for the time being  but at the same time to seize the opportunity of paying court to me
at any other time i would gladly have submitted to the blandishments of such a beautiful creature  but at that moment  why  i cannot tell  the thought filled me with terror
 get out   i screamed  and all the louder as i had no other means of protecting myself
 all right  i'll leave you then   he said  slowly retreating
 you're wonderful
don't i please you    you'll please me by going away and leaving me in peace   i said  but i was no longer so sure of myself as i tried to make him think
my senses  sharpened by fasting  suddenly seemed to see or hear something about him  it was just beginning  it was growing  it came nearer  and i knew that this hound had the power to drive me away  even if i could not imagine to myself at the moment how i was ever to get to my feet
and i gazed at him    he had merely shaken his head sadly at my rough answer    with ever mounting desire
 who are you   i asked
 i'm a hunter   he replied
 and why won't you let me lie here   i asked
 you disturb me   he said
 i can't hunt while you're here    try   i said   perhaps you'll be able to hunt after all    no   he said   i'm sorry  but you must go    don't hunt for this one day   i implored him
 no   he said   i must hunt    i must go  you must hunt   i said   nothing but musts
can you explain to me why we must    no   he replied   but there's nothing that needs to be explained  these are natural  self evident things    not quite so self evident as all that   i said   you're sorry that you must drive me away  and yet you do it    that's so   he replied
 that's so   i echoed him crossly   that isn't an answer
which sacrifice would you rather make  to give up your hunting  or give up driving me away    to give up my hunting   he said without hesitation
 there   said i   don't you see that you're contradicting yourself    how am i contradicting myself   he replied
 my dear little dog  can it be that you really don't understand that i must  don't you understand the most self evident fact   i made no answer  for i noticed  and new life ran through me  life such as terror gives    i noticed from almost invisible indications  which perhaps nobody but myself could have noticed  that in the depths of his chest the hound was preparing to upraise a song
 you're going to sing   i said
 yes   he replied gravely   i'm going to sing  soon  but not yet    you're beginning already   i said
 no   he said   not yet
but be prepared    i can hear it already  though you deny it   i said  trembling
he was silent  and then i thought i saw something such as no dog before me had ever seen  at least there is no slightest hint of it in our tradition  and i hastily bowed my head in infinite fear and shame in the pool of blood lying before me
i thought i saw that the hound was already singing without knowing it  nay  more  that the melody  separated from him  was floating on the air in accordance with its own laws  and  as though he had no part in it  was moving toward me  toward me alone
today  of course  i deny the validity of all such perceptions and ascribe them to my overexcitation at that time  but even if it was an error it had nevertheless a sort of grandeur  and is the sole  even if delusive  reality that i have carried over into this world from my period of fasting  and shows at least how far we can go when we are beyond ourselves
and i was actually quite beyond myself
in ordinary circumstances i would have been very ill  incapable of moving  but the melody  which the hound soon seemed to acknowledge as his  was quite irresistible it grew stronger and stronger  its waxing power seemed to have no limits  and already almost burst my eardrums but the worst was that it seemed to exist solely for my sake  this voice before whose sublimity the woods fell silent  to exist solely for my sake  who was i  that i could dare to remain here  lying brazenly before it in my pool of blood and filth
i tottered to my feet and looked down at myself  this wretched body can never run  i still had time to think  but already  spurred on by the melody  i was careering from the spot in splendid style i said nothing to my friends  probably i could have told them all when i first arrived  but i was too feeble  and later it seemed to me that such things could not be told
hints which i could not refrain from occasionally dropping were quite lost in the general conversation
for the rest i recovered physically in a few hours  but spiritually i still suffer from the effects of that experiment
nevertheless  i next carried my researches into music
true  science had not been idle in this sphere either  the science of music  if i am correctly informed  is perhaps still more comprehensive than that of nurture  and in any case established on a firmer basis
that may be explained by the fact that this province admits of more objective inquiry than the other  and its knowledge is more a matter of pure observation and systematization  while in the province of food the main object is to achieve practical results
that is the reason why the science of music is accorded greater esteem than that of nurture  but also why the former has never penetrated so deeply into the life of the people
i myself felt less attracted to the science of music than to any other until i heard that voice in the forest
my experience with the musical dogs had indeed drawn my attention to music  but i was still too young at that time
nor is it by any means easy even to come to grips with that science  it is regarded as very esoteric and politely excludes the crowd
besides  although what struck me most deeply at first about these dogs was their music  their silence seemed to me still more significant  as for their affrighting music  probably it was quite unique  so that i could leave it out of account  but thenceforth their silence confronted me everywhere and in all the dogs i met
so for penetrating into real dog nature  research into food seemed to me the best method  calculated to lead me to my goal by the straightest path
perhaps i was mistaken
a border region between these two sciences  however  had already attracted my attention
i mean the theory of incantation  by which food is called down
here again it is very much against me that i have never seriously tackled the science of music and in this sphere cannot even count myself among the halfeducated  the class on whom science looks down most of all
this fact i cannot get away from
i could not    i have proof of that  unfortunately    i could not pass even the most elementary scientific examination set by an authority on the subject
of course  quite apart from the circumstances already mentioned  the reason for that can be found in my incapacity for scientific investigation  my limited powers of thought  my bad memory  but above all in my inability to keep my scientific aim continuously before my eyes all this i frankly admit  even with a certain degree of pleasure
for the more profound cause of my scientific incapacity seems to me to be an instinct  and indeed by no means a bad one if i wanted to brag i might say that it was this very instinct that invalidated my scientific capacities  for it would surely be a very extraordinary thing if one who shows a tolerable degree of intelligence in dealing with the ordinary daily business of life  which certainly cannot be called simple  and moreover one whose findings have been checked and verified  where that was possible  by individual scientists if not by science itself  should a priori be incapable of planting his paw even on the first rung of the ladder of science
it was this instinct that made me    and perhaps for the sake of science itself  but a different science from that of today  an ultimate science    prize freedom higher than everything else
freedom  certainly such freedom as is possible today is a wretched business but nevertheless freedom  nevertheless a possession
a little woman she is a little woman  naturally quite slim  she is tightly laced as well  she is always in the same dress when i see her  it is made of grayish yellow stuff something the color of wood and is trimmed discreetly with tassels or buttonlike hangings of the same color  she never wears a hat  her dull  fair hair is smooth and not untidy  but worn very loose
although she is tightly laced she is quick and light in her movements  actually she rather overdoes the quickness  she loves to put her hands on her hips and abruptly turn the upper part of her body sideways with a suddenness that is surprising
the impression her hand makes on me i can convey only by saying that i have never seen a hand with the separate fingers so sharply differentiated from each other as hers  and yet her hand has no anatomical peculiarities  it is an entirely normal hand
this little woman  then  is very ill pleased with me  she always finds something objectionable in me  i am always doing the wrong thing to her  i annoy her at every step  if a life could be cut into the smallest of small pieces and every scrap of it could be separately assessed  every scrap of my life would certainly be an offense to her
i have often wondered why i am such an offense to her  it may be that everything about me outrages her sense of beauty  her feeling for justice  her habits  her traditions  her hopes  there are such completely incompatible natures  but why does that upset her so much  there is no connection between us that could force her to suffer because of me
all she has to do is to regard me as an utter stranger  which i am  and which i do not object to being  indeed i should welcome it  she only needs to forget my existence  which i have never thrust upon her attention  nor ever would  and obviously her torments would be at an end
i am not thinking of myself  i am quite leaving out of account the fact that i find her attitude of course rather trying  leaving it out of account because i recognize that my discomfort is nothing to the suffering she endures
all the same i am well aware that hers is no affectionate suffering  she is not concerned to make any real improvement in me  besides  whatever she finds objectionable in me is not of a nature to hinder my development
yet she does not care about my development either  she cares only for her personal interest in the matter  which is to revenge herself for the torments i cause her now and to prevent any torments that threaten her from me in the future
i have already tried once to indicate the best way of putting a stop to this perpetual resentment of hers  but my very attempt wrought her up to such a pitch of fury that i shall never repeat it
i feel too a certain responsibility laid upon me  if you like to put it that way  for strangers as we are to each other  the little woman and myself  and however true it is that the sole connection between us is the vexation i cause her  or rather the vexation she lets me cause her  i ought not to feel indifferent to the visible physical suffering which this induces in her
every now and then  and more frequently of late  information is brought to me that she has risen of a morning pale  unslept  oppressed by headache  and almost unable to work  her family are worried about her  they wonder what can have caused her condition  and they have not yet found the answer
i am the only one who knows that it is her settled and daily renewed vexation with me
true  i am not so worried about her as her family  she is hardy and tough  anyone who is capable of such strong feeling is likely also to be capable of surviving its effects  i have even a suspicion that her sufferings    or some of them  at least    are only a pretense put up to bring public suspicion on me
she is too proud to admit openly what a torment my very existence is to her  to make any appeal to others against me she would consider beneath her dignity  it is only disgust  persistent and active disgust  that drives her to be preoccupied with me  to discuss in public this unclean affliction of hers would be too shameful
but to keep utterly silent about something that so persistently rankles would be also too much for her
so with feminine guile she steers a middle course  she keeps silent but betrays all the outward signs of a secret sorrow in order to draw public attention to the matter
perhaps she even hopes that once public attention is fixed on me a general public rancor against me will rise up and use all its great powers to condemn me definitively much more effectively and quickly than her relatively feeble private rancor could do  she would then retire into the background  draw a breath of relief  and turn her back on me
well  if that is what her hopes are really set on  she is deluding herself
public opinion will not take over her role  public opinion would never find me so infinitely objectionable  even under its most powerful magnifying glass
i am not so altogether useless a creature as she thinks  i don't want to boast and especially not in this connection  but if i am not conspicuous for specially useful qualities  i am certainly not conspicuous for the lack of them  only to her  only to her almost bleached eyes  do i appear so  she won't be able to convince anyone else
so in this respect i can feel quite reassured  can i  no  not at all  for if it becomes generally known that my behavior is making her positively ill  which some observers  those who most industriously bring me information about her  for instance  are not far from perceiving  or at least look as if they perceived it  and the world should put questions to me  why am i tormenting the poor little woman with my incorrigibility  and do i mean to drive her to her death  and when am i going to show some sense and have enough decent human feeling to stop such goings on    if the world were to ask me that  it would be difficult to find an answer
should i admit frankly that i don't much believe in these symptoms of illness  and thus produce the unfavorable impression of being a man who blames others to avoid being blamed himself  and in such an ungallant manner  and how could i say quite openly that even if i did believe that she were really ill  i should not feel the slightest sympathy for her  since she is a complete stranger to me and any connection between us is her own invention and entirely one sided i don't say that people wouldn't believe me  they wouldn't be interested enough to get so far as belief  they would simply note the answer i gave concerning such a frail  sick woman  and that would be little in my favor
any answer i made would inevitably come up against the world's incapacity to keep down the suspicion that there must be a love affair behind such a case as this  although it is as clear as daylight that such a relationship does not exist  and that if it did it would come from my side rather than hers  since i should be really capable of admiring the little woman for the decisive quickness of her judgment and her persistent vitality in leaping to conclusions  if these very qualities were not always turned as weapons against me
she  at any rate  shows not a trace of friendliness toward me  in that she is honest and true  therein lies my last hope  not even to help on her campaign would she so far forget herself as to let any such suspicion arise
but public opinion which is wholly insensitive in such matters would abide by its prejudices and always denounce me
so the only thing left for me to do would be to change myself in time  before the world could intervene  just sufficiently to lessen the little woman's rancor  not to wean her from it altogether  which is unthinkable
and indeed i have often asked myself if i am so pleased with my present self as to be unwilling to change it  and whether i could not attempt some changes in myself  even though i should be doing so not because i found them needful but merely to propitiate the little woman
and i have honestly tried  taking some trouble and care  it even did me good  it was almost a diversion  some changes resulted which were visible a long way off  i did not need to draw her attention to them  she perceives all that kind of thing much sooner than i do  she can even perceive by my expression beforehand what i have in mind  but no success crowned my efforts
how could it possibly do so  her objection to me  as i am now aware  is a fundamental one  nothing can remove it  not even the removal of myself  if she heard that i had committed suicide she would fall into transports of rage
now i cannot imagine that such a sharp witted woman as she is does not understand as well as i do both the hopelessness of her own course of action and the helplessness of mine  my inability  with the best will in the world  to conform to her requirements
of course she understands it  but being a fighter by nature she forgets it in the lust of battle  and my unfortunate disposition  which i cannot help since it is mine by nature  conditions me to whisper gentle admonitions to anyone who flies into a violent passion
in this way  naturally  we shall never come to terms i shall keep on leaving the house in the gay mood of early morning only to meet that countenance of hers  lowering at the sight of me  the contemptuous curl of her lips  the measuring glance  aware beforehand of what it is going to find  that sweeps over me and however fleeting misses nothing  the sarcastic smile furrowing her girlish cheek  the complaining lift of the eyes to heaven  the planting of the hands on the hips  to fortify herself  and then the access of rage that brings pallor with it and trembling
not long ago i took occasion  for the very first time as i realized with some astonishment  to mention the matter to a very good friend of mine  just in passing  casually  in a word or two  reducing it to even less than its just proportions  trivial as it is in essence when looked at objectively
it was curious that my friend all the same did not ignore it  indeed of his own accord he even made more of it than i had done  would not be sidetracked  and insisted on discussing it
but it was still more curious that in one important particular he underestimated it  for he advised me seriously to go away for a short time
no advice could be less understandable  the matter was simple enough  anyone who looked closely at it could see right through it  yet it was not so simple that my mere departure would set all of it right  or even the greater part of it
on the contrary  such a departure is just what i must avoid  if i am to follow a plan at all it must be that of keeping the affair within its present narrow limits which do not yet involve the outside world  that is to say  i must stay quietly where i am and not let it affect my behavior as far as can be seen  and that includes mentioning it to no one  but not at all because it is a kind of dangerous mystery  merely because it is a trivial  purely personal matter and as such to be taken lightly  and to be kept on that level
so my friend's remarks were not profitless after all  they taught me nothing new yet they strengthened my original resolution
and on closer reflection it appears that the developments which the affair seems to have undergone in the course of time are not developments in the affair itself  but only in my attitude to it  insofar as that has become more composed on the one hand  more manly  penetrating nearer the heart of the matter  while on the other hand  under the influence of the continued nervous strain which i cannot overcome  however slight  it has increased in irritability i am less upset by the affair now that i think i perceive how unlikely it is to come to any decisive crisis  imminent as that sometimes seems to be  one is easily disposed  especially when one is young  to exaggerate the speed with which decisive moments arrive  whenever my small critic  grown faint at the very sight of me  sank sideways into a chair  holding on to the back of it with one hand and plucking at her bodice strings with the other  while tears of rage and despair rolled down her cheeks  i used to think that now the moment had come and i was just on the point of being summoned to answer for myself yet there was no decisive moment  no summons  women faint easily  the world has no time to notice all their doings
and what has really happened in all these years  nothing except that such occasions have repeated themselves  sometimes more and sometimes less violently  and that their sum total has increased accordingly and that people are hanging around in the offing and would like to interfere if they could find some way of doing it  but they can find none  so up till now they have had to rely on what they could smell out  and although that by itself is fully qualified to keep the owners of the noses busy it can't do anything more
yet the situation was always like that  fundamentally  always provided with superfluous bystanders and nosy onlookers  who always justified their presence by some cunning excuse  for preference claiming to be relatives  always stretching their necks and sniffing trouble  but all they have achieved is to be still standing by the only difference is that i have gradually come to recognize them and distinguish one face from another  once upon a time i believed that they had just gradually trickled in from outside  that the affair was having wider repercussions  which would themselves compel a crisis  today i think i know that these onlookers were always there from the beginning and have little or nothing to do with the imminence of a crisis and the crisis itself  why should i dignify it by such a name  if it ever should happen    and certainly not tomorrow or the day after tomorrow  most likely never    that public opinion concerns itself with the affair  which  i must repeat  is beyond its competence  i certainly won't escape unharmed  but on the other hand people are bound to take into account that i am not unknown to the public  that i have lived for long in the full light of publicity  trustingly and trustworthily  and that this distressed little woman  this latecomer in my life  who  let me remark in passing  another man might have brushed off like a burr and privately trodden underfoot without a sound  that this woman at the very worst could add only an ugly little flourish to the diploma in which public opinion long ago certified me to be a respectable member of society
that is how things stand today  little likely to cause me any uneasiness
the fact that in the course of years i have all the same become somewhat uneasy has nothing to do with the real significance of this affair  a man simply cannot endure being a continual target for someone's spite  even when he knows well enough that the spite is gratuitous  he grows uneasy  he begins  in a kind of physical way only  to expect final decisions  even when like a sensible man he does not much believe that they are forthcoming
partly  too  it is a symptom of increasing age  youth sheds a bloom over everything  awkward characteristics are lost to sight in the endless upwelling of youthful energy  if as a youth a man has a somewhat wary eye it is not counted against him  it is not noticed at all  even by himself  but the things that survive in old age are residues  each is necessary  none is renewed  each is under scrutiny  and the wary eye of an aging man is clearly a wary eye and is not difficult to recognize only  as also in this case  it is not an actual degeneration of his condition
so from whatever standpoint i consider this small affair  it appears  and this i will stick to  that if i keep my hand over it  even quite lightly  i shall quietly continue to live my own life for a long time to come  untroubled by the world  despite all the outbursts of the woman
the burrow i have completed the construction of my burrow and it seems to be successful all that can be seen from outside is a big hole  that  however  really leads nowhere  if you take a few steps you strike against natural firm rock
i can make no boast of having contrived this ruse intentionally  it is simply the remains of one of my many abortive building attempts  but finally it seemed to me advisable to leave this one hole without filling it in
true  some ruses are so subtle that they defeat themselves  i know that better than anyone  and it is certainly a risk to draw attention by this hole to the fact that there may be something in the vicinity worth inquiring into but you do not know me if you think i am afraid  or that i built my burrow simply out of fear
at a distance of some thousand paces from this hole lies  covered by a movable layer of moss  the real entrance to the burrow  it is secured as safely as anything in this world can be secured  yet someone could step on the moss or break through it  and then my burrow would lie open  and anybody who liked    please note  however  that quite uncommon abilities would also be required    could make his way in and destroy everything for good
i know that very well  and even now  at the zenith of my life  i can scarcely pass an hour in complete tranquility  at that one point in the dark moss i am vulnerable  and in my dreams i often see a greedy muzzle sniffing around it persistently it will be objected that i could quite well have filled in the entrance too  with a thin layer of hard earth on top and with loose soil further down  so that it would not cost me much trouble to dig my way out again whenever i liked
but that plan is impossible  prudence itself demands that i should have a way of leaving at a moment's notice if necessary  prudence itself demands  as alas  so often  to risk one's life
all this involves very laborious calculation  and the sheer pleasure of the mind in its own keenness is often the sole reason why one keeps it up
i must have a way of leaving at a moment's notice  for  despite all my vigilance  may i not be attacked from some quite unexpected quarter  i live in peace in the inmost chamber of my house  and meanwhile the enemy may be burrowing his way slowly and stealthily straight toward me
i do not say that he has a better scent than i  probably he knows as little about me as i of him
but there are insatiable robbers who burrow blindly through the ground  and to whom the very size of my house gives the hope of hitting by chance on some of its far flung passages
i certainly have the advantage of being in my own house and knowing all the passages and how they run
a robber may very easily become my victim and a succulent one too
but i am growing old  i am not as strong as many others  and my enemies are countless  it could well happen that in flying from one enemy i might run into the jaws of another
anything might happen  in any case i must have the confident knowledge that somewhere there is an exit easy to reach and quite free  where i have to do nothing whatever to get out  so that i might never    heaven shield us     suddenly feel the teeth of the pursuer in my flank while i am desperately burrowing away  even if it is at loose easy soil
and it is not only by external enemies that i am threatened
there are also enemies in the bowels of the earth
i have never seen them  but legend tells of them and i firmly believe in them
they are creatures of the inner earth  not even legend can describe them
their very victims can scarcely have seen them  they come  you hear the scratching of their claws just under you in the ground  which is their element  and already you are lost here it is of no avail to console yourself with the thought that you are in your own house  far rather are you in theirs
not even my exit could save me from them  indeed in all probability it would not save me in any case  but rather betray me  yet it is a hope  and i cannot live without it
apart from this main exit i am also connected with the outer world by quite narrow  tolerably safe passages which provide me with good fresh air to breathe
they are the work of the field mice
i have made judicious use of them  transforming them into an organic part of my burrow
they also give me the possibility of scenting things from afar  and thus serve as a protection
all sorts of small fry  too  come running through them  and i devour these  so i can have a certain amount of subterranean hunting  sufficient for a modest way of life  without leaving my burrow at all  and that is naturally a great advantage
but the most beautiful thing about my burrow is the stillness
of course  that is deceptive
at any moment it may be shattered and then all will be over
for the time being  however  the silence is still with me
for hours i can stroll through my passages and hear nothing except the rustling of some little creature  which i immediately reduce to silence between my jaws  or the pattering of soil  which draws my attention to the need for repair  otherwise all is still
the fragrance of the woods floats in  the place feels both warm and cool
sometimes i lie down and roll about in the passage with pure joy
when autumn sets in  to possess a burrow like mine  and a roof over your head  is great good fortune for anyone getting on in years
every hundred yards i have widened the passages into little round cells  there i can curl myself up in comfort and lie warm
there i sleep the sweet sleep of tranquility  of satisfied desire  of achieved ambition  for i possess a house
i do not know whether it is a habit that still persists from former days  or whether the perils even of this house of mine are great enough to awaken me  but invariably every now and then i start up out of profound sleep and listen  listen into the stillness which reigns here unchanged day and night  smile contentedly  and then sink with loosened limbs into still profounder sleep
poor homeless wanderers in the roads and woods  creeping for warmth into a heap of leaves or a herd of their comrades  delivered to all the perils of heaven and earth  i lie here in a room secured on every side    there are more than fifty such rooms in my burrow    and pass as much of my time as i choose between dozing and unconscious sleep not quite in the center of the burrow  carefully chosen to serve as a refuge in case of extreme danger from siege if not from immediate pursuit  lies the chief cell while all the rest of the burrow is the outcome rather of intense intellectual than of physical labor  this castle keep was fashioned by the most arduous labor of my whole body
several times  in the despair brought on by physical exhaustion  i was on the point of giving up the whole business  flung myself down panting and cursed the burrow  dragged myself outside and left the place lying open to all the world
i could afford to do that  for i had no longer any wish to return to it  until at last  after four hours or days  back i went repentantly  and when i saw that the burrow was unharmed i could almost have raised a hymn of thanksgiving  and in sincere gladness of heart started on the work anew
my labors on the castle keep were also made harder  and unnecessarily so (unnecessarily in that the burrow derived no real benefit from those labors)  by the fact that just at the place where  according to my calculations  the castle keep should be  the soil was very loose and sandy and had literally to be hammered and pounded into a firm state to serve as a wall for the beautifully vaulted chamber
but for such tasks the only tool i possess is my forehead
so i had to run with my forehead thousands and thousands of times  for whole days and nights  against the ground  and i was glad when the blood came  for that was a proof that the walls were beginning to harden  and in that way  as everybody must admit  i richly paid for my castle keep
in the castle keep i assemble my stores  everything over and above my daily wants that i capture inside the burrow  and everything i bring back with me from my hunting expeditions outside  i pile up here
the place is so spacious that food for half a year scarcely fills it
consequently i can divide up my stores  walk about among them  play with them  enjoy their plenty and their various smells  and reckon up exactly how much they represent
that done  i can always arrange accordingly  and make my calculations and hunting plans for the future  taking into account the season of the year
there are times when i am so well provided for that in my indifference to food i never even touch the smaller fry that scuttle about the burrow  which  however  is probably imprudent of me
my constant preoccupation with defensive measures involves a frequent alteration or modification  though within narrow limits  of my views on how the building can best be organized for that end
then it sometimes seems risky to make the castle keep the basis of defense  the ramifications of the burrow present me with manifold possibilities  and it seems more in accordance with prudence to divide up my stores somewhat  and put part of them in certain of the smaller rooms  thereupon i mark off every third room  let us say  as a reserve storeroom  or every fourth room as a main and every second as an auxiliary storeroom  and so forth or i ignore certain passages altogether and store no food in them  so as to throw any enemy off the scent  or i choose quite at random a very few rooms according to their distance from the main exit each of these new plans involves of course heavy work  i have to make my calculations and then carry my stores to their new places
true  i can do that at my leisure and without any hurry  and it is not at all unpleasant to carry such good food in your jaws  to lie down and rest whenever you like  and to nibble an occasional tasty tidbit
but it is not so pleasant when  as sometimes happens  you suddenly fancy  starting up from your sleep  that the present distribution of your stores is completely and totally wrong  might lead to great dangers  and must be set right at once  no matter how tired or sleepy you may be  then i rush  then i fly  then i have no time for calculation  and although i was about to execute a perfectly new  perfectly exact plan  i now seize whatever my teeth hit upon and drag it or carry it away  sighing  groaning  stumbling  and even the most haphazard change in the present situation  which seems so terribly dangerous  can satisfy me until little by little full wakefulness sobers me  and i can hardly understand my panic haste  breathe in deeply the tranquility of my house  which i myself have disturbed  return to my resting place  fall asleep at once in a new won exhaustion  and on awakening find hanging from my jaws  say  a rat  as indubitable proof of night labors which already seem almost unreal
then again there are times when the storing of all my food in one place seems the best plan of all of what use to me could my stores in the smaller rooms be  how much could i store there in any case  and whatever i put there would block the passage  and be a greater hindrance than help to me if i were pursued and had to fly besides  it is stupid but true that one's self conceit suffers if one cannot see all one's stores together  and so at one glance know how much one possesses
and in dividing up my food in those various ways might not a great deal get lost  i can't be always scouring through all my passages and cross passages so as to make sure that everything is in order
the idea of dividing up my stores is of course a good one  but only if one had several rooms similar to my castle keep several such rooms  indeed  and who is to build them  in any case  they could not be worked into the general plan of my burrow at this late stage but i will admit that that is a fault in my burrow  it is always a fault to have only one piece of anything
and i confess too that during the whole time i was constructing the burrow a vague idea that i should have more such cells stirred in my mind  vaguely  yet clearly enough if i had only welcomed it  i did not yield to it  i felt too feeble for the enormous labor it would involve  more  i felt too feeble even to admit to myself the necessity for that labor  and comforted myself as best i could with the vague hope that a building which in any other case would clearly be inadequate  would in my own unique  exceptional  favored case suffice  presumably because providence was interested in the preservation of my forehead  that unique instrument
so i have only one castle keep  but my dark premonitions that one would not suffice have faded
however that may be  i must content myself with the one big chamber  the smaller ones are simply no substitute for it  and so  when this conviction has grown on me  i begin once more to haul all my stores back from them to the castle keep
for some time afterwards i find a certain comfort in having all the passages and rooms free  in seeing my stores growing in the castle keep and emitting their variegated and mingled smells  each of which delights me in its own fashion  and every one of which i can distinguish even at a distance  as far as the very remotest passages then i usually enjoy periods of particular tranquility  in which i change my sleeping place by stages  always working in toward the center of the burrow  always steeping myself more profoundly in the mingled smells  until at last i can no longer restrain myself and one night rush into the castle keep  mightily fling myself upon my stores  and glut myself with the best that i can seize until i am completely gorged
happy but dangerous hours  anyone who knew how to exploit them could destroy me with ease and without any risk
here too the absence of a second or third large storeroom works to my detriment  for it is the single huge accumulated mass of food that seduces me
i try to guard myself in various ways against this danger  the distribution of my stores in the smaller rooms is really one of these expedients  but unfortunately  like other such expedients  it leads through renunciation to still greater greed  which  overruling my intelligence  makes me arbitrarily alter my plans of defense to suit its ends to regain my composure after such lapses i make a practice of reviewing the burrow  and after the necessary improvements have been carried out  frequently leave it  though only for a short spell
even at such moments the hardship of being without it for a long time seems too punitive to me  yet i recognize clearly the need for occasional short excursions it is always with a certain solemnity that i approach the exit again
during my spells of home life i avoid it  steer clear even of the outer windings of the corridor that leads to it  besides  it is no easy job to wander about out there  for i have contrived there a whole little maze of passages  it was there that i began my burrow  at a time when i had no hope of ever completing it according to my plans  i began  half in play  at that corner  and so my first joy in labor found riotous satisfaction there in a labyrinthine burrow which at the time seemed to me the crown of all burrows  but which i judge today  perhaps with more justice  to be too much of an idle tour de force  not really worthy of the rest of the burrow  and though perhaps theoretically brilliant    here is my main entrance  i said in those days  ironically addressing my invisible enemies and seeing them all already caught and stifled in the outer labyrinth    is in reality a flimsy piece of jugglery that would hardly withstand a serious attack or the struggles of an enemy fighting for his life should i reconstruct this part of my burrow  i keep on postponing the decision  and the labyrinth will probably remain as it is
apart from the sheer hard work that i should have to face  the task would also be the most dangerous imaginable
when i began the burrow i could work away at it in comparative peace of mind  the risk wasn't much greater than any other risk  but to attempt that today would be to draw the whole world's attention  and gratuitously  to my burrow  today the whole thing is impossible
i am almost glad of that  for i still have a certain sentiment about this first achievement of mine
and if a serious attack were attempted  what pattern of entrance at all would be likely to save me  an entrance can deceive  can lead astray  can give the attacker no end of worry  and the present one too can do that at a pinch
but a really serious attack has to be met by an instantaneous mobilization of all the resources in the burrow and all the forces of my body and soul    that is self evident
so this entrance can very well remain where it is
the burrow has so many unavoidable defects imposed by natural causes that it can surely stand this one defect for which i am responsible  and which i recognize as a defect  even if only after the event
in spite of that  however  i do not deny that this fault worries me from time to time  indeed always
if on my customary rounds i avoid this part of the burrow  the fundamental reason is that the sight of it is painful to me  because i don't want to be perpetually reminded of a defect in my house  even if that defect is only too disturbingly present in my mind
let it continue to exist ineradicably at the entrance  i can at least refuse to look at it as long as that is possible
if i merely walk in the direction of the entrance  even though i may be separated from it by several passages and rooms  i find myself sensing an atmosphere of great danger  actually as if my hair were growing thin and in a moment might fly off and leave me bare and shivering  exposed to the howls of my enemies yes  the mere thought of the door itself  the end of the domestic protection  brings such feelings with it  yet it is the labyrinth leading up to it that torments me most of all
sometimes i dream  that i have reconstructed it  transformed it completely  quickly  in a night  with a giant's strength  nobody having noticed  and now it is impregnable  the nights in which such dreams come to me are the sweetest i know  tears of joy and deliverance still glisten on my beard when i awaken so i must thread the tormenting complications of this labyrinth physically as well as mentally whenever i go out  and i am both exasperated and touched when  as sometimes happens  i lose myself for a moment in my own maze  and the work of my hands seems to be still doing its best to prove its sufficiency to me  its maker  whose final judgment has long since been passed on it but then i find myself beneath the mossy covering  which has been left untouched for so long    for i stay for long spells in my house    that it has grown fast to the soil around it  and now only a little push with my head is needed and i am in the upper world
for a long time i do not dare to make that little movement  and if it were not that i would have to traverse the labyrinth once more  i would certainly leave the matter for the time being and turn back again
just think
your house is protected and self sufficient
you live in peace  warm  well nourished  master  sole master of all your manifold passages and rooms  and all this you are prepared    not to give up  of course    but to risk it  so to speak  you nurse the confident hope  certainly  that you will regain it  yet is it not a dangerous  a far too dangerous stake that you are playing for  can there be any reasonable grounds for such a step  no  for such acts as these there can be no reasonable grounds but all the same  i then cautiously raise the trap door and slip outside  let it softly fall back again  and fly as fast as i can from the treacherous spot
yet i am not really free
true  i am no longer confined by narrow passages  but hunt through the open woods  and feel new powers awakening in my body for which there was no room  as it were  in the burrow  not even in the castle keep  though it had been ten times as big
the food too is better up here  though hunting is more difficult  success more rare  the results are more valuable from every point of view  i do not deny all this  i appreciate it and take advantage of it at least as fully as anyone else  and probably more fully  for i do not hunt like a vagrant out of mere idleness or desperation  but calmly and methodically
also i am not permanently doomed to this free life  for i know that my term is measured  that i do not have to hunt here forever  and that  whenever i am weary of this life and wish to leave it  someone  whose invitation i shall not be able to withstand  will  so to speak  summon me to him
and so i can pass my time here quite without care and in complete enjoyment  or rather i could  and yet i cannot
my burrow takes up too much of my thoughts
i fled from the entrance fast enough  but soon i am back at it again
i seek out a good hiding place and keep watch on the entrance of my house    this time from outside    for whole days and nights
call it foolish if you like  it gives me infinite pleasure and reassures me
at such times it is as if i were not so much looking at my house as at myself sleeping  and had the joy of being in a profound slumber and simultaneously of keeping vigilant guard over myself
i am privileged  as it were  not only to dream about the specters of the night in all the helplessness and blind trust of sleep  but also at the same time to confront them in actuality with the calm judgment of the fully awake
and strangely enough i discover that my situation is not so bad as i had often thought  and will probably think again when i return to my house
in this connection    it may be in others too  but in this one especially    these excursions of mine are truly indispensable
carefully as i have chosen an out of the way place for my door  the traffic that passes it is nevertheless  if one takes a week's observation  very great  but so it is  no doubt  in all inhabited regions  and probably it is actually better to hazard the risks of dense traffic  whose very impetus carries it past  than to be delivered in complete solitude to the first persistently searching intruder
here enemies are numerous and their allies and accomplices still more numerous  but they fight one another  and while thus employed rush past my burrow without noticing it
in all my time i have never seen anyone investigating the actual door of my house  which is fortunate both for me and for him  for i would certainly have launched myself at his throat  forgetting everything else in my anxiety for the burrow
true  creatures come  in whose vicinity i dare not remain  and from whom i have to fly as soon as i scent them in the distance  on their attitude to the burrow i really can't pronounce with certainty  but it is at least a reassurance that when i presently return i never find any of them there  and the entrance is undamaged
there have been happy periods in which i could almost assure myself that the enmity of the world toward me had ceased or been assuaged  or that the strength of the burrow had raised me above the destructive struggle of former times
the burrow has probably protected me in more ways than i thought or dared think while i was inside it
this fancy used to have such a hold over me that sometimes i have been seized by the childish desire never to return to the burrow again  but to settle down somewhere close to the entrance  to pass my life watching the entrance  and gloat perpetually upon the reflection    and in that find my happiness    how steadfast a protection my burrow would be if i were inside it
well  one is soon roughly awakened from childish dreams what does this protection which i am looking at here from the outside amount to after all  dare i estimate the danger which i run inside the burrow from observations which i make when outside  can my enemies  to begin with  have any proper awareness of me if i am not in my burrow  a certain awareness of me they certainly have  but not full awareness
and is not that full awareness the real definition of a state of danger  so the experiments i attempt here are only half experiments or even less  calculated merely to reassure my fears and by giving me false reassurance to lay me open to great perils
no  i do not watch over my own sleep  as i imagined  rather it is i who sleep  while the destroyer watches
perhaps he is one of those who pass the entrance without seeming to notice it  concerned merely to ascertain  just like myself  that the door is still untouched and waits for their attack  and only pass because they know that the master of the house is out  or because they are quite aware that he is guilelessly lying on the watch in the bushes close by
and i leave my post of observation and find i have had enough of this outside life  i feel that there is nothing more that i can learn here  either now or at any time
and i long to say a last goodbye to everything up here  to go down into my burrow never to return again  let things take their course  and not try to retard them with my profitless vigils
but spoiled by seeing for such a long time everything that happened around the entrance  i find great difficulty in summoning the resolution to carry out the actual descent  which might easily draw anyone's attention  and without knowing what is happening behind my back and behind the door after it is fastened
i take advantage of stormy nights to get over the necessary preliminaries  and quickly bundle in my spoil  that seems to have come off  but whether it has really come off will only be known when i myself have made the descent  it will be known  but not by me  or by me  but too late so i give up the attempt and do not make the descent
i dig an experimental burrow  naturally at a good distance from the real entrance  a burrow just as long as myself  and seal it also with a covering of moss
i creep into my hole  close it after me  wait patiently  keep vigil for long or short spells  and at various hours of the day  then fling off the moss  issue from my hole  and summarize my observations
these are extremely heterogeneous  and both good and bad  but i have never been able to discover a universal principle or an infallible method of descent
in consequence of all this i have not yet summoned the resolution to make my actual descent  and am thrown into despair at the necessity of doing it soon
i almost screw myself to the point of deciding to emigrate to distant parts and take up my old comfortless life again  which had no security whatever  but was one indiscriminate succession of perils  yet in consequence prevented one from perceiving and fearing particular perils  as i am constantly reminded by comparing my secure burrow with ordinary life
certainly such a decision would be an arrant piece of folly  produced simply by living too long in senseless freedom  the burrow is still mine  i have only to take a single step and i am safe
and i tear myself free from all my doubts and by broad daylight rush to the door  quite resolved to raise it now  but i cannot  i rush past it and fling myself into a thorn bush  deliberately  as a punishment  a punishment for some sin i do not know of
then  at the last moment  i am forced to admit to myself that i was right after all  and that it was really impossible to go down into the burrow without exposing the thing i love best  for a little while at least  to all my enemies  on the ground  in the trees  in the air
and the danger is by no means a fanciful one  but very real
it need not be any particular enemy that is provoked to pursue me  it may very well be some chance innocent little creature  some disgusting little beast which follows me out of curiosity  and thus  without knowing it  becomes the leader of all the world against me  nor need it be even that  it may be    and that would be just as bad  indeed in some respects worse    it may be someone of my own kind  a connoisseur and prizer of burrows  a hermit  a lover of peace  but all the same a filthy scoundrel who wishes to be housed where he has not built
if he were actually to arrive now  if in his obscene lust he were to discover the entrance and set about working at it  lifting the moss  if he were actually to succeed  if he were actually to wriggle his way in in my stead  until only his hindquarters still showed  if all this were actually to happen  so that at last  casting all prudence to the winds  i might in my blind rage leap on him  maul him  tear the flesh from his bones  destroy him  drink his blood  and fling his corpse among the rest of my spoil  but above all    that is the main thing    were at last back in my burrow once more  i would have it in my heart to greet the labyrinth itself with rapture  but first i would draw the moss covering over me  and i would want to rest  it seems to me  for all the remainder of my life but nobody comes and i am left to my own resources
perpetually obsessed by the sheer difficulty of the attempt  i lose much of my timidity  i no longer attempt even to appear to avoid the entrance  but make a hobby of prowling around it  by now it is almost as if i were the enemy spying out a suitable opportunity for successfully breaking in
if i only had someone i could trust to keep watch at post of observation  then of course i could descend in perfect peace of mind
i would make an agreement with this trusty confederate of mine that he would keep a careful note of the state of things during my descent and for quite a long time afterwards  and if he saw any sign of danger knock on the moss covring  and if he saw nothing do nothing
with that a clean sweep would be made of all my fears  no residue would be left  or at most my confidant
for would he not demand some counterservice from me  would he not at least want to see the burrow  that in itself  to let anyone freely into my burrow  would be exquisitely painful to me
i built it for myself  not for visitors  and i think i would refuse to admit him  not even though he alone made it possible for me to get into the burrow would i let him in
but i simply could not admit him  for either i must let him go in first by himself  which is simply unimaginable  or we must both descend at the same time  in which case the advantage i am supposed to derive from him  that of being kept watch over  would be lost and what trust can i really put in him  can i trust one whom i have had under my eyes just as fully when i can't see him  and the moss covering separates us  it is comparatively easy to trust anyone if you are supervising him or at least can supervise him  perhaps it is possible even to trust someone at a distance  but completely to trust someone outside the burrow when you are inside the burrow  that is  in a different world  that  it seems to me  is impossible but such considerations are not in the least necessary  the mere reflection is enough that during or after my descent one of the countless accidents of existence might prevent my confidant from fulfilling his duty  and what incalculable results might not the smallest accident of that kind have for me  no  if one takes it by and large  i have no right to complain that i am alone and have nobody that i can trust
i certainly lose nothing by that and probably spare myself trouble
i can only trust myself and my burrow
i should have thought of that before and taken measures to meet the difficulty that worries me so much now
when i began the burrow it would at least have been partly possible
i should have so constructed the first passage that it had two entrances at a moderate distance from each other  so that after descending through the one entrance with that slowness which is unavoidable  i might rush at once through the passage to the second entrance  slightly raise the moss covering  which would be so arranged as to make that easy  and from there keep watch on the position for several days and nights
that would have been the only right way of doing it
true  the two entrances would double the risk  but that consideration need not delay me  for one of the entrances  serving merely as a post of observation  could be quite narrow
and with that i lose myself in a maze of technical speculations  i begin once more to dream my dream of a completely perfect burrow  and that somewhat calms me  with closed eyes i behold with delight perfect or almost perfect structural devices for enabling me to slip out and in unobserved while i lie there thinking such things i admire these devices very greatly  but only as technical achievements  not as real advantages  for this freedom to slip out and in at will  what does it amount to  it is the mark of a restless nature  of inner uncertainty  disreputable desires  evil propensities that seem still worse when one thinks of the burrow  which is there at one's hand and can flood one with peace if one only remains quite open and receptive to it
for the present  however  i am outside it seeking some possibility of returning  and for that the necessary technical devices would be very desirable
but perhaps not so very desirable after all
is it not a very grave injustice to the burrow to regard it in moments of nervous panic as a mere hole into which one can creep and be safe  certainly it is a hole among other things  and a safe one  or should be  and when i picture myself in the midst of danger  then i insist with clenched teeth and all my will that the burrow should be nothing but a hole set apart to save me  and that it should fufill that clearly defined function with the greatest possible efficiency  and i am ready to absolve it from every other duty
now the truth of the matter    and one has no eye for that in times of great peril  and only by a great effort even in times when danger is threatening    is that in reality the burrow does provide a considerable degree of security  but by no means enough  for is one ever free from anxieties inside it  these anxieties are different from ordinary ones  prouder  richer in content  often long repressed  but in their destructive effects they are perhaps much the same as the anxieties that existence in the outer world gives rise to
had i constructed the burrow exclusively to assure my safety i would not have been disappointed  it is true  nevertheless the relation between the enormous labor involved and the actual security it would provide  at least insofar as i could feel it and profit by it  would not have been in my favor
it is extremely painful to have to admit such things to oneself  but one is forced to do it  confronted by that entrance over there which now literally locks and bars itself against me  the builder and possessor
yet the burrow is not a mere hole for taking refuge in
when i stand in the castle keep surrounded by my piled up stores  surveying the ten passages which begin there  raised and sunken passages  vertical and rounded passages  wide and narrow passages  as the general plan dictates  and all alike still and empty  ready by their various routes to conduct me to all the other rooms  which are also still and empty    then all thought of mere safety is far from my mind  then i know that here is my castle  which i have wrested from the refractory soil with tooth and claw  with pounding and hammering blows  my castle which can never belong to anyone else  and is so essentially mine that i can calmly accept in it even my enemy's mortal stroke at the final hour  for my blood will ebb away here in my own soil and not be lost and what but that is the meaning of the blissful hours which i pass  now peacefully slumbering  now happily keeping watch  in these passages  these passages which suit me so well  where one can stretch oneself out in comfort  roll about in childish delight  lie and dream  or sink into blissful sleep and the smaller rooms  each familiar to me  so familiar that in spite of their complete similarity i can clearly distinguish one from the other with my eyes shut by the mere feel of the wall  they enclose me more peacefully and warmly than a bird is enclosed in its nest and all  all still and empty
but if that is the case  why do i hang back  why do i dread the thought of the intruding enemy more than the possibility of never seeing my burrow again  well  the latter alternative is fortunately an impossibility  there is no need for me even to take thought to know what the burrow means to me  i and the burrow belong so indissolubly together that in spite of all my fears i could make myself quite comfortable out here  and not even need to overcome my repugnance and open the door  i could be quite content to wait here passively  for nothing can part us for long  and somehow or other i shall quite certainly find myself in my burrow again
but on the other hand how much time may pass before then  and how many things may happen in that time  up here no less than down there  and it lies with me solely to curtail that interval and to do what is necessary at once
and then  too exhausted to be any longer capable of thought  my head hanging  my legs trembling with fatigue  half asleep  feeling my way rather than walking  i approach the entrance  slowly raise the moss covering  slowly descend  leaving the door open in my distraction for a needlessly long time  and presently remember my omission  and get out again to make it good    but what need was there to get out for that  all that was needed was to draw to the moss covering  right  so i creep in again and now at last draw to the moss covering
only in this state  and in this state alone  can i achieve my descent
so at last i lie down beneath the moss on the top of my bloodstained spoil and can now enjoy my longed for sleep
nothing disturbs me  no one has tracked me down  above the moss everything seems to be quiet thus far at least  but even if all were not quiet i question whether i could stop to keep watch now  i have changed my place  i have left the upper world and am in my burrow  and i feel its effect at once it is a new world  endowing me with new powers  and what i felt as fatigue up there is no longer that here
i have returned from a journey dog tired with my wanderings  but the sight of the old house  the thought of all the things that are waiting to be done  the necessity at least to cast a glance at all the rooms  but above all to make my way immediately to the castle keep  all this transforms my fatigue into ardent zeal  it is as though at the moment when i set foot in the burrow i had wakened from a long and profound sleep my first task is a very laborious one and requires all my attention  i mean getting my spoil through the narrow and thin walled passages of the labyrinth
i shove with all my might  and the work gets done too  but far too slowly for me  to hasten it i drag part of my flesh supply back again and push my way over it and through it  now i have only a portion of my spoil before me and it is easier to make progress  but my road is so blocked by all this flesh in these narrow passages  through which it is not always easy for me to make my way even when i am alone  that i could quite easily smother among my own stores  sometimes i can only rescue myself from their pressure by eating and drinking a clear space for myself
but the work of transport is successful  i finish it in quite a reasonable time  the labyrinth is behind me  i reach an ordinary passage and breathe freely  push my spoil through a communication passage into a main passage expressly designed for the purpose  a passage sloping down steeply to the castle keep
what is left to be done is not really work at all  my whole load rolls and flows down the passage almost of itself
the castle keep at last  at last i can dare to rest
everything is unchanged  no great mishap seems to have occurred  the few little defects that i note at a first glance can soon be repaired  first  however  i must go my long round of all the passages  but that is no hardship  that is merely to commune again with friends  as i often did in the old days or    i am not so very old yet  but my memory of many things is already quite confused    as i often did  or as i have often heard that it was done now i begin with the second passage  purposefully slow  now that i have seen the castle keep i have endless time    inside the burrow i always have endless time    for everything i do there is good and important and satisfies me somehow
i begin with the second passage  but break off in the middle and turn into the third passage and let it take me back again to the castle keep  and now of course i have to begin at the second passage once more  and so i play with my task and lengthen it out and smile to myself and enjoy myself and become quite dazed with all the work in front of me  but never think of turning aside from it
it is for your sake  ye passages and rooms  and you  castle keep  above all  that i have come back  counting my own life as nothing in the balance  after stupidly trembling for it for so long  and postponing my return to you what do i care for danger now that i am with you  you belong to me  i to you  we are united  what can harm us  what if my foes should be assembling even now up above there and their muzzles be preparing to break through the moss  and with its silence and emptiness the burrow answers me  confirming my words
but now a feeling of lassitude overcomes me and in some favorite room i curl myself up tentatively  i have not yet surveyed everything by a long way  though still resolved to examine everything to the very end  i have no intention of sleeping here  i have merely yielded to the temptation of making myself comfortable and pretending i want to sleep  i merely wish to find out if this is as good a place for sleeping as it used to be
it is  but it is a better place for sleep than for waking  and i remain lying where i am in deep slumber
i must have slept for a long time
i was only wakened when i had reached the last light sleep which dissolves of itself  and it must have been very light  for it was an almost inaudible whistling noise that wakened me
i recognized what it was immediately  the small fry  whom i had allowed far too much latitude  had burrowed a new channel somewhere during my absence  this channel must have chanced to intersect an older one  the air was caught there  and that produced the whistling noise
what an indefatigably busy lot these small fry are  and what a nuisance their diligence can be  first i shall have to listen at the walls of my passages and locate the place of disturbance by experimental excavations  and only then will i be able to get rid of the noise
however  this new channel may be quite welcome as a further means of ventilation  if it can be fitted into the plan of the burrow
but after this i shall keep a much sharper eye on the small fry than i used to  i shall spare none of them
as i have a good deal of experience in investigations of this kind the work probably will not take me long and i can start upon it at once  there are other jobs awaiting me  it is true  but this is the most urgent
i must have silence in my passages
this noise  however  is a comparatively innocent one  i did not hear it at all when i first arrived  although it must certainly have been there  i must first feel quite at home before i could hear it  it is  so to speak  audible only to the ear of the householder
and it is not even constant  as such noises usually are  there are long pauses  obviously the right place to begin at  and though i cut a few trenches i do it at random  naturally that has no effect  and the hard work of digging and the still harder work of filling the trenches up again and beating the earth firm is so much labor lost
i don't seem to be getting any nearer to the place where the noise is  it goes on always on the same thin note  with regular pauses  now a sort of whistling  but again like a kind of piping
now i could leave it to itself for the time being  it is very disturbing  certainly  but there can hardly be any doubt that its origin is what i took it to be at first  so it can scarcely become louder  on the contrary  such noises may quite well    though until now i have never had to wait so long for that to happen    may quite well vanish of themselves in the course of time through the continued labors of these little burrowers  and apart from that  often chance itself puts one on the track of the disturbance  where systematic investigation has failed for a long time in such ways i comfort myself  and resolve simply to continue my tour of the passages  and visit the rooms  many of which i have not even seen yet since my return  and enjoy myself contemplating the castle keep now and then between times  but my anxiety will not let me  and i must go on with my search these little creatures take up much  far too much  time that could be better employed
in such cases as the present it is usually the technical problem that attracts me  for example  from the noise  which my ear can distinguish in all its finest shades  so that it has a perfectly clear outline to me  i deduce its cause  and now i am on fire to discover whether my conclusion is valid
and with good reason  for as long as that is not established i cannot feel safe  even if it were merely a matter of discovering where a grain of sand that had fallen from one of the walls had rolled to
and a noise such as this is by no means a trifling matter  regarded from that angle
but whether trifling or important  i can find nothing  no matter how hard i search  or it may be that i find too much
this had to happen just in my favorite room  i think to myself  and i walk a fair distance away from it  almost halfway along the passage leading to the next room  i do this more as a joke  pretending to myself that my favorite room is not alone to blame  but that there are disturbances elsewhere as well  and with a smile on my face i begin to listen  but soon i stop smiling  for  right enough  the same whistling meets me here too
it is really nothing to worry about  sometimes i think that nobody but myself would hear it  it is true  i hear it now more and more distinctly  for my ear has grown keener through practice  though in reality it is exactly the same noise wherever i may hear it  as i have convinced myself by comparing my impressions
nor is it growing louder  i recognize this when i listen in the middle of the passage instead of pressing my ear against the wall
then it is only with an effort  indeed with great intentness  that i can more guess at than hear the merest trace of a noise now and then
but it is this very uniformity of the noise everywhere that disturbs me most  for it cannot be made to agree with my original assumption
had i rightly divined the cause of the noise  then it must have issued with greatest force from some given place  which it would be my task to discover  and after that have grown fainter and fainter
but if my hypothesis does not meet the case  what can the explanation be  there still remains the possibility that there are two noises  that up to now i have been listening at a good distance from the two centers  and that while its noise increases  when i draw near to one of them  the total result remains approximately the same for the ear in consequence of the lessening volume of sound from the other center
already i have almost fancied sometimes  when i have listened carefully  that i could distinguish  if very indistinctly  differences of tone which support this new assumption
in any case i must extend my sphere of investigation much farther than i have done
accordingly i descend the passage to the castle keep and begin to listen there
strange  the same noise there too
now it is a noise produced by the burrowing of some species of small fry who have infamously exploited my absence  in any case they have no intention of doing me harm  they are simply busied with their own work  and so long as no obstacle comes in their way they will keep on in the direction they have taken  i know all this  yet that they should have dared to approach the very castle keep itself is incomprehensible to me and fills me with agitation  and confuses the faculties which i need so urgently for the work before me
here i have no wish to discover whether it is the unusual depth at which the castle keep lies  or its great extent and correspondingly powerful air suction  calculated to scare burrowing creatures away  or the mere fact that it is the castle keep  that by some channel or other has penetrated to their dull minds
in any case  i have never noticed any sign of burrowing in the walls of the castle keep until now
crowds of little beasts have come here  it is true  attracted by the powerful smells  here i have had a constant hunting ground  but my quarry has always burrowed a way through in the upper passages  and come running down here  somewhat fearfully  but unable to withstand such a temptation
but now  it seems  they are burrowing in all the passages if i had only carried out the best of the grand plans i thought out in my youth and early manhood  or rather  if i had only had the strength to carry them out  for there would have been no lack of will
one of these favorite plans of mine was to isolate the castle keep from its surroundings  that is to say  to restrict the thickness of its walls to about my own height  and leave a free space of about the same width all around the castle keep  except for a narrow foundation  which unfortunately would have to be left to bear up the whole
i had always pictured this free space  and not without reason  as the loveliest imaginable haunt
what a joy to lie pressed against the rounded outer wall  pull oneself up  let oneself slide down again  miss one's footing and find oneself on firm earth  and play all those games literally upon the castle keep and not inside it  to avoid the castle keep  to rest one's eyes from it whenever one wanted  to postpone the joy of seeing it until later and yet not have to do without it  but literally hold it safe between one's claws  a thing that is impossible if you have only an ordinary open entrance to it  but above all to be able to stand guard over it  and in that way to be so completely compensated for renouncing the actual sight of it that  if one had to choose between staying all one's life in the castle keep or in the free space outside it  one would choose the latter  content to wander up and down there all one's days and keep guard over the castle keep
then there would be no noises in the walls  no insolent burrowing up to the very keep itself  then peace would be assured there and i would be its guardian  then i would not have to listen with loathing to the burrowing of the small fry  but with delight to something that i cannot hear now at all  the murmurous silence of the castle keep
but that beautiful dream is past and i must set to work  almost glad that now my work has a direct connection with the castle keep  for that wings it
certainly  as i can see more and more clearly  i need all my energies for this task  which at first seemed quite a trifling one
i listen now at the walls of the castle keep  and wherever i listen  high or low  at the roof or the floor  at the entrance or in the corners  everywhere  everywhere  i hear the same noise
and how much time  how much care must be wasted in listening to that noise  with its regular pauses
one can  if one wishes  find a tiny deceitful comfort in the fact that here in the castle keep  because of its vastness  one hears nothing at all  as distinguished from the passages  when one stands back from the walls
simply as a rest and a means to regain my composure i often make this experiment  listen intently and am overjoyed when i hear nothing
but the question still remains  what can have happened  confronted with this phenomenon my original explanation completely falls to the ground
but i must also reject other explanations which present themselves to me one could assume  for instance  that the noise i hear is simply that of the small fry themselves at their work but all my experience contradicts this  i cannot suddenly begin to hear now a thing that i have never heard before though it was always there
my sensitiveness to disturbances in the burrow has perhaps become greater with the years  yet my hearing has by no means grown keener
it is of the very nature of small fry not to be heard
would i have tolerated them otherwise  even at the risk of starvation i would have exterminated them
but perhaps    this idea now insinuates itself    i am concerned here with some animal unknown to me
that is possible
true  i have observed the life down here long and carefully enough  but the world is full of diversity and is never wanting in painful surprises
yet it cannot be a single animal  it must be a whole swarm that has suddenly fallen upon my domain  a huge swarm of little creatures  which  as they are audible  must certainly be bigger than the small fry  but yet cannot be very much bigger  for the sound of their labors is itself very faint
it may be  then  a swarm of unknown creatures on their wanderings  who happen to be passing by my way  who disturb me  but will presently cease to do so
so i could really wait for them to pass  and need not put myself to the trouble of work that will be needless in the end
yet if these creatures are strangers  why is it that i never see any of them  i have already dug a host of trenches  hoping to catch one of them  but i can find not a single one
then it occurs to me that they may be quite tiny creatures  far tinier than any i am acquainted with  and that it is only the noise they make that is greater
accordingly i investigate the soil i have dug up  i cast the lumps into the air so that they break into quite small particles  but the noisemakers are not among them
slowly i come to realize that by digging such small fortuitous trenches i achieve nothing  in doing that i merely disfigure the walls of my burrow  scratching hastily here and there without taking time to fill up the holes again  at many places already there are heaps of earth which block my way and my view
still  that is only a secondary worry  for now i can neither wander about my house  nor review it  nor rest  often already i have fallen asleep at my work in some hole or other  with one paw clutching the soil above me  from which in a semistupor i have been trying to tear a lump
i intend now to alter my methods
i shall dig a wide and carefully constructed trench in the direction of the noise and not cease from digging until  independent of all theories  i find the real cause of the noise
then i shall eradicate it  if that is within my power  and if it is not  at least i shall know the truth
that truth will bring me either peace or despair  but whether the one or the other  it will be beyond doubt or question
this decision strengthens me
all that i have done till now seems to me far too hasty  in the excitement of my return  while i had not yet shaken myself free from the cares of the upper world  and was not yet completely penetrated by the peace of the burrow  but rather hypersensitive at having had to renounce it for such a long time  i was thrown into complete confusion of mind by an unfamiliar noise and what was it  a faint whistling  audible only at long intervals  a mere nothing to which i don't say that one could actually get used  for no one could get used to it  but which one could  without actually doing anything about it at once  observe for a while  that is  listen every few hours  let us say  and patiently register the results  instead of  as i had done  keeping one's ear fixed to the wall and at every hint of noise tearing out a lump of earth  not really hoping to find anything  but simply so as to do something to give expression to one's inward agitation
all that will be changed now  i hope
and then  with furious shut eyes  i have to admit to myself that i hope nothing of the kind  for i am still trembling with agitation just as i was hours ago  and if my reason did not restrain me i would probably like nothing better than to start stubbornly and defiantly digging  simply for the sake of digging  at some place or other  whether i heard anything there or not  almost like the small fry  who burrow either without any object at all or simply because they eat the soil
my new and reasonable plan both tempts me and leaves me cold
there is nothing in it to object to  i at least know of no objection  it is bound  so far as i can see  to achieve my aim
and yet at bottom i do not believe in it  i believe in it so little that i do not even fear the terrors which its success may well bring  i do not believe even in a dreadful denouement  indeed it seems to me that i have been thinking ever since the first appearance of the noise of such a methodical trench  and have not begun upon it until now simply because i put no trust in it in spite of that i shall of course start on the trench  i have no other alternative  but i shall not start at once  i shall postpone the task for a little while
if reason is to be reinstated on the throne  it must be completely reinstated  i shall not rush blindly into my task
in any case i shall first repair the damage that i have done to the burrow with my wild digging  that will take a good long time  but it is necessary  if the new trench is really to reach its goal it will probably be long  and if it should lead to nothing at all it will be endless  in any case this task means a longish absence from the burrow  though an absence by no means so painful as an absence in the upper world  for i can interrupt my work whenever i like and pay a visit to my house  and even if i should not do that the air of castle keep will be wafted to me and surround me while i work  nevertheless it means leaving the burrow and surrendering myself to an uncertain fate  and consequently i want to leave the burrow in good order behind me  it shall not be said that i  who am fighting for its peace  have myself destroyed that peace without reinstating it at once
so i begin by shoveling the soil back into the holes from which it was taken  a kind of work i am familiar with  that i have done countless times almost without regarding it as work  and at which  particularly as regards the final pressing and smoothing down    and this is no empty boast  but the simple truth    i am unbeatable
but this time everything seems difficult  i am too distracted  every now and then  in the middle of my work  i press my ear to the wall and listen  and without taking any notice let the soil that i have just lifted trickle back into the passage again the final embellishments  which demand a stricter attention  i can hardly achieve at all
hideous protuberances  disturbing cracks remain  not to speak of the fact that the old buoyancy simply cannot be restored again to a wall patched up in such a way
i try to comfort myself with the reflection that my present work is only temporary
when i return after peace has been restored i shall repair everything properly  work will be mere play to me then
oh yes  work is mere play in fairy tales  and this comfort of mine belongs to the realm of fairy tales too
it would be far better to do the work thoroughly now  at once  far more reasonable than perpetually to interrupt it and wander off through the passages to discover new sources of noise  which is easy enough  all that is needed being to stop at any point one likes and listen
and that is not the end of my useless discoveries
sometimes i fancy that the noise has stopped  for it makes long pauses  sometimes such a faint whistling escapes one  one's own blood is pounding all too loudly in one's ears  then two pauses come one after another  and for a while one thinks that the whistling has stopped forever
i listen no longer  i jump up  all life is transfigured  it is as if the fountains from which flows the silence of the burrow were unsealed
i refrain from verifying my discovery at once  i want first to find someone to whom in all good faith i can confide it  so i rush to the castle keep  i remember  for i and everything in me has awakened to new life  that i have eaten nothing for a long time  i snatch something or other from among my store of food half buried under the debris and hurriedly begin to swallow it while i hurry back to the place where i made my incredible discovery  i only want to assure myself about it incidentally  perfunctorily  while i am eating  i listen  but the most perfunctory listening shows at once that i was shamefully deceived  away there in the distance the whistling still remains unshaken
and i spit out my food  and would like to trample it underfoot  and go back to my task  not caring which i take up  anyplace where it seems to be needed  and there are enough places like that  i mechanically start on something or other  just as if the overseer had appeared and i must make a pretense of working for his benefit but hardly have i begun to work in this fashion when it may happen that i make a new discovery
the noise seems to have become louder  not much louder  of course    here it is always a matter of the subtlest shades    but all the same sufficiently louder for the ear to recognize it clearly and this growing louder is like a coming nearer  still more distinctly than you hear the increasing loudness of the noise  you can literally see the step that brings it closer to you
you leap back from the wall  you try to grasp at once all the possible consequences that this discovery will bring with it
you feel as if you had never really organized the burrow for defense against attack  you had intended to do so  but despite all your experience of life the danger of an attack  and consequently the need to organize the place for defense  seemed remote    or rather not remote (how could it possibly be )    but infinitely less important than the need to put it in a state where one could live peacefully  and so that consideration was given priority in everything relating to the burrow
many things in this direction might have been done without affecting the plan of the whole  most incomprehensibly they have been neglected
i have had a great deal of luck all those years  luck has spoiled me  i have had anxieties  but anxiety leads to nothing when you have luck to back you
the thing to do  really to do now  would be to go carefully over the burrow and consider every possible means of defending it  work out a plan of defense and a corresponding plan of construction  and then start on the work at once with the vigor of youth
that is the work that would really be needed  for which  i may add  it is now far too late in the day  yet that is what would really be needed  and not the digging of a grand experimental trench  whose only real result would be to deliver me hand and foot to the search for danger  out of the foolish fear that it will not arrive quickly enough of itself
suddenly i cannot comprehend my former plan
i can find no slightest trace of reason in what had seemed so reasonable  once more i lay aside my work and even my listening  i have no wish to discover any further signs that the noise is growing louder  i have had enough of discoveries  i let everything slide  i would be quite content if i could only still the conflict going on within me
once more i let my passages lead me where they will  i come to more and more remote ones that i have not yet seen since my return  and that are quite unsullied by my scratching paws  and whose silence rises up to meet me and sinks into me
i do not surrender to it  i hurry on  i do not know what i want  probably simply to put off the hour
i stray so far that i find myself at the labyrinth  the idea of listening beneath the moss covering tempts me  such distant things  distant for the moment  chain my interest
i push my way up and listen
deep stillness  how lovely it is here  outside there nobody troubles about my burrow  everybody has his own affairs  which have no connection with me  how have i managed to achieve this  here under the moss covering is perhaps the only place in my burrow now where i can listen for hours and hear nothing
a complete reversal of things in the burrow  what was once the place of danger has become a place of tranquility  while the castle keep has been plunged into the melee of the world and all its perils
still worse  even here there is no peace in reality  here nothing has changed  silent or vociferous  danger lies in ambush as before above the moss  but i have grown insensitive to it  my mind is far too much taken up with the whistling in my walls
is my mind really taken up with it  it grows louder  it comes nearer  but i wriggle my way through the labyrinth and make a couch for myself up here under the moss  it is almost as if i were already leaving the house to the whistler  content if i can only have a little peace up here
to the whistler  have i come  then  to a new conclusion concerning the cause of the noise  but surely the noise is caused by the channels bored by the small fry  is not that my considered opinion  it seems to me that i have not retreated from it thus far and if the noise is not caused directly by these channels  it is indirectly
and even if it should have no connection with them whatever  one is not at liberty to make a priori assumptions  but must wait until one finds the cause  or it reveals itself
one could play with hypotheses  of course  even at this stage  for instance  it is possible that there has been a water burst at some distance away  and what seems a piping or whistling to me is in reality a gurgling but apart from the fact that i have no experience in that sphere    the groundwater that i found at the start i drained away at once  and in this sandy soil it has never returned    apart from this fact the noise is undeniably a whistling and simply not to be translated into a gurgling
but what avail all exhortations to be calm  my imagination will not rest  and i have actually come to believe    it is useless to deny it to myself    that the whistling is made by some beast  and moreover not by a great many small ones  but by a single big one
many signs contradict this
the noise can be heard everywhere and always at the same strength  and moreover uniformly  both by day and night
at first  therefore  one cannot but incline to the hypothesis of a great number of little animals  but as i must have found some of them during my digging and i have found nothing  it only remains for me to assume the existence of a great beast  especially as the things that seem to contradict the hypothesis are merely things which make the beast  not so much impossible  as merely dangerous beyond all one's powers of conception
for that reason alone have i resisted this hypothesis
i shall cease from this self deception
for a long time already i have played with the idea that the beast can be heard at such a great distance because it works so furiously  it burrows as fast through the ground as another can walk on the open road  the ground still trembles at its burrowing when it has ceased  this reverberation and the noise of the boring itself unite into one sound at such a great distance  and i  as i hear only the last dying ebb of that sound  hear it always at the same uniform strength
it follows from this also that the beast is not making for me  seeing that the noise never changes  more likely it has a plan in view whose purpose i cannot decipher  i merely assume that the beast    and i make no claim whatever that it knows of my existence    is encircling me  it has probably made several circles around my burrow already since i began to observe it
the nature of the noise  the piping or whistling  gives me much food for thought
when i scratch and scrape in the soil in my own fashion the sound is quite different
i can explain the whistling only in this way  that the beast's chief means of burrowing is not its claws  which it probably employs merely as a secondary resource  but its snout or its muzzle  which  of course  apart from its enormous strength  must also be fairly sharp at the point
it probably bores its snout into the earth with one mighty push and tears out a great lump  while it is doing that i hear nothing  that is the pause  but then it draws in the air for a new push
this indrawal of its breath  which must be an earthshaking noise  not only because of the beast's strength  but of its haste  its furious lust for work as well  this noise i hear then as a faint whistling
but quite incomprehensible remains the beast's capacity to work without stopping  perhaps the short pauses provide also the opportunity of snatching a moment's rest  but apparently the beast has never yet allowed itself a really long rest  day and night it goes on burrowing  always with the same freshness and vigor  always thinking of its object  which must be achieved with the utmost expedition  and which it has the ability to achieve with ease
now i could not have foreseen such an opponent
but apart altogether from the beast's peculiar characteristics  what is happening now is only something which i should really have feared all the time  something against which i should have been constantly prepared  the fact that someone would come
by what chance can everything have flowed on so quietly and happily for such a long time  who can have diverted my enemies from their path  and forced them to make a wide detour around my property  why have i been spared for so long  only to be delivered to such terrors now  compared with this  what are all the petty dangers in brooding over which i have spent my life  had i hoped  as owner of the burrow  to be in a stronger position than any enemy who might chance to appear  but simply by virtue of being owner of this great vulnerable edifice i am obviously defenseless against any serious attack
the joy of possessing it has spoiled me  the vulnerability of the burrow has made me vulnerable  any wound to it hurts me as if i myself were hit
it is precisely this that i should have foreseen  instead of thinking only of my own defense    and how perfunctorily and vainly i have done even that    i should have thought of the defense of the burrow
above all  provision should have been made for cutting off sections of the burrow  and as many as possible of them  from the endangered sections when they are attacked  this should have been done by means of improvised landslides  calculated to operate at a moment's notice  moreover these should have been so thick  and have provided such an effectual barrier  that the attacker would not even guess that the real burrow only began at the other side
more  these landslides should have been so devised that they not only concealed the burrow  but also entombed the attacker
not the slightest attempt have i made to carry out such a plan  nothing at all has been done in this direction  i have been as thoughtless as a child  i have passed my manhood's years in childish games  i have done nothing but play even with the thought of danger  i have shirked really taking thought for actual danger
and there has been no lack of warning
nothing  of course  approaching the present situation has happened before  nevertheless there was an incident not unlike it when the burrow was only beginning
the main difference between that time and this is simply that the burrow was only beginning then


in those days i was literally nothing more than a humble apprentice  the labyrinth was only sketched out in rough outline  i had already dug a little room  but the proportions and the execution of the walls were sadly bungled  in short  everything was so tentative that it could only be regarded as an experiment  as something which  if one lost patience some day  one could leave behind without much regret then one day as i lay on a heap of earth resting from my labors    i have rested far too often from my labors all my life    suddenly i heard a noise in the distance
being young at the time  i was less frightened than curious
i left my work to look after itself and set myself to listen  i listened and listened  and had no wish to fly up to my moss covering and stretch myself out there so that i might not have to hear i did listen  at least
i could clearly recognize that the noise came from some kind of burrowing similar to my own  it was somewhat fainter  of course  but how much of that might be put down to the distance one could not tell
i was intensely interested  but otherwise calm and cool
perhaps i am in somebody else's burrow  i thought to myself  and now the owner is boring his way toward me
if that assumption had proved to be correct i would have gone away  for i have never had any desire for conquest or bloodshed  and begun building somewhere else
but after all i was still young and still without a burrow  so i could remain quite cool
besides  the further course of the noise brought no real cause for apprehension  except that it was not easy to explain
if whoever was boring there was really making for me  because he had heard me boring  then if he changed his direction  as now actually happened  it could not be told whether he did this because my pause for rest had deprived him of any definite point to make toward  or because    which was more plausible    he had himself changed his plans but perhaps i had been deceived altogether  and he had never been actually making in my direction  at any rate the noise grew louder for a while as if he were drawing nearer  and being young at that time i probably would not have been displeased to see the burrower suddenly rising from the ground  but nothing of that kind happened  at a certain point the sound of boring began to weaken  it grew fainter and fainter  as if the burrower were gradually diverging from his first route  and suddenly it broke off altogether  as if he had decided now to take the diametrically opposite direction and were making straight away from me into the distance
for a long time i still went on listening for him in the silence  before i returned once more to my work
now that warning was definite enough  but i soon forgot it  and it scarcely influenced my building plans
between that day and this lie my years of maturity  but is it not as if there were no interval at all between them  i still take long rests from my labors and listen at the wall  and the burrower has changed his intention anew  he has turned back  he is returning from his journey  thinking he has given me ample time in the interval to prepare for his reception
but on my side everything is worse prepared for than it was then  the great burrow stands defenseless  and i am no longer a young apprentice  but an old architect  and the powers i still have fail me when the decisive hour comes  yet old as i am it seems to me that i would gladly be still older  so old that i should never be able to rise again from my resting place under the moss for to be honest i cannot endure the place  i rise up and rush  as if i had filled myself up there with new anxieties instead of peace  down into the house again
what was the state of things the last time i was here  had the whistling grown fainter  no  it had grown louder
i listen at ten places chosen at random and clearly notice the deception  the whistling is just the same as ever  nothing has altered
over there  there are no changes  there one is calm and not worried about time  but here every instant frets and gnaws at the listener
i go once more the long road to the castle keep  all my surroundings seem filled with agitation  seem to be looking at me  and then look away again so as not to disturb me  yet cannot refrain the very next moment from trying to read the saving solution from my expression
i shake my head  i have not yet found any solution
nor do i go to the castle keep in pursuance of any plan
i pass the spot where i had intended to begin the experimental trench  i look it over once more  it would have been an admirable place to begin at  the trench's course would have been in the direction where lay the majority of the tiny ventilation holes  which would have greatly lightened my labors  perhaps i should not have had to dig very far  should not even have had to dig to the source of the noise  perhaps if i had listened at the ventilation holes it would have been enough
but no consideration is potent enough to animate me to this labor of digging
this trench will bring me certainty  you say  i have reached the stage where i no longer wish to have certainty
in the castle keep i choose a lovely piece of flayed red flesh and creep with it into one of the heaps of earth  there i shall have silence at least  such silence  at any rate  as still can be said to exist here
i munch and nibble at the flesh  think of the strange beast going its own road in the distance  and then again that i should enjoy my store of food as fully as possible  while i still have the chance
this last is probably the sole plan i have left that i can carry out
for the rest i try to unriddle the beast's plans
is it on its wanderings  or is it working on its own burrow  if it is on its wanderings then perhaps an understanding with it might be possible
if it should really break through to the burrow i shall give it some of my stores and it will go on its way again
it will go its way again  a fine story  lying in my heap of earth i can naturally dream of all sorts of things  even of an understanding with the beast  though i know well enough that no such thing can happen  and that at the instant when we see each other  more  at the moment when we merely guess at each other's presence  we shall both blindly bare our claws and teeth  neither of us a second before or after the other  both of us filled with a new and different hunger  even if we should already be gorged to bursting
and with entire justice  for who  even if he were merely on his wanderings  would not change his itinerary and his plans for the future on catching sight of the burrow  but perhaps the beast is digging in its own burrow  in which case i cannot even dream of an understanding
even if it should be such a peculiar beast that its burrow could tolerate a neighbor  my burrow could not tolerate a neighbor  at least not a clearly audible one
now actually the beast seems to be a great distance away  if it would only withdraw a little farther the noise too would probably disappear  perhaps in that case everything would be peaceful again as in the old days  all this would then become a painful but salutary lesson  spurring me on to make the most diverse improvements on the burrow  if i have peace  and danger does not immediately threaten me  i am still quite fit for all sorts of hard work  perhaps  considering the enormous possibilities which its powers of work open before it  the beast has given up the idea of extending'its burrow in my direction  and is compensating itself for that in some other one that consummation also cannot  of course  be brought about by negotiation  but only by the beast itself  or by some compulsion exercised from my side
in both cases the decisive factor will be whether the beast knows about me  and if so what it knows
the more i reflect upon it the more improbable does it seem to me that the beast has even heard me  it is possible  though i can't imagine it  that it can have received news of me in some other way  but it has certainly never heard me
so long as i still knew nothing about it  it simply cannot have heard me  for at that time i kept very quiet  nothing could be more quiet than my return to the burrow  afterwards  when i dug the experimental trenches  perhaps it could have heard me  though my style of digging makes very little noise  but if it had heard me i must have noticed some sign of it  the beast must at least have stopped its work every now and then to listen
but all remained unchanged
josephine the singer  or the mouse folk our singer is called josephine
anyone who has not heard her does not know the power of song
there is no one but is carried away by her singing  a tribute all the greater as we are not in general a music loving race
tranquil peace is the music we love best  our life is hard  we are no longer able  even on occasions when we have tried to shake off the cares of daily life  to rise to anything so high and remote from our usual routine as music
but we do not much lament that  we do not get even so far  a certain practical cunning  which admittedly we stand greatly in need of  we hold to be our greatest distinction  and with a smile born of such cunning we are wont to console ourselves for all shortcomings  even supposing    only it does not happen    that we were to yearn once in a way for the kind of bliss which music may provide
josephine is the sole exception  she has a love for music and knows too how to transmit it  she is the only one  when she dies  music    who knows for how long    will vanish from our lives
i have often thought about what this music of hers really means
for we are quite unmusical  how is it that we understand josephine's singing or  since josephine denies that  at least think we can understand it
the simplest answer would be that the beauty of her singing is so great that even the most insensitive cannot be deaf to it  but this answer is not satisfactory
if it were really so  her singing would have to give one an immediate and lasting feeling of being something out of the ordinary  a feeling that from her throat something is sounding which we have never heard before and which we are not even capable of hearing  something that josephine alone and no one else can enable us to hear
but in my opinion that is just what does not happen  i do not feel this and have never observed that others feel anything of the kind
among intimates we admit freely to one another that josephine's singing  as singing  is nothing out of the ordinary
is it in fact singing at all  although we are unmusical we have a tradition of singing  in the old days our people did sing  this is mentioned in legends and some songs have actually survived  which  it is true  no one can now sing
thus we have an inkling of what singing is  and josephine's art does not really correspond to it
so is it singing at all  is it not perhaps just a piping  and piping is something we all know about  it is the real artistic accomplishment of our people  or rather no mere accomplishment but a characteristic expression of our life
we all pipe  but of course no one dreams of making out that our piping is an art  we pipe without thinking of it  indeed without noticing it  and there are even many among us who are quite unaware that piping is one of our characteristics so if it were true that josephine does not sing but only pipes and perhaps  as it seems to me at least  hardly rises above the level of our usual piping    yet  perhaps her strength is not even quite equal to our usual piping  whereas an ordinary farmhand can keep it up effortlessly all day long  besides doing his work    if that were all true  then indeed josephine's alleged vocal skill might be disproved  but that would merely clear the ground for the real riddle which needs solving  the enormous influence she has after all  it is only a kind of piping that she produces
if you post yourself quite far away from her and listen  or  still better  put your judgment to the test  whenever she happens to be singing along with others  by trying to identify her voice  you will undoubtedly distinguish nothing but a quite ordinary piping tone  which at most differs a little from the others through being delicate or weak
yet if you sit down before her  it is not merely a piping  to comprehend her art it is necessary not only to hear but to see her
even if hers were only our usual workaday piping  there is first of all this peculiarity to consider  that here is someone making a ceremonial performance out of doing the usual thing
to crack a nut is truly no feat  so no one would ever dare to collect an audience in order to entertain it with nut cracking
but if all the same one does do that and succeeds in entertaining the public  then it cannot be a matter of simple nut cracking
or it is a matter of nut cracking  but it turns out that we have overlooked the art of cracking nuts because we were too skilled in it and that this newcomer to it first shows us its real nature  even finding it useful in making his effects to be rather less expert in nut cracking than most of us
perhaps it is much the same with josephine's singing  we admire in her what we do not at all admire in ourselves  in this respect  i may say  she is of one mind with us
i was once present when someone  as of course often happens  drew her attention to the folk piping everywhere going on  making only a modest reference to it  yet for josephine that was more than enough
a smile so sarcastic and arrogant as she then assumed i have never seen  she  who in appearance is delicacy itself  conspicuously so even among our people who are prolific in such feminine types  seemed at that moment actually vulgar  she was at once aware of it herself  by the way  with her extreme sensibility  and controlled herself
at any rate she denies any connection between her art and ordinary piping
for those who are of the contrary opinion she has only contempt and probably unacknowledged hatred
this is not simple vanity  for the opposition  with which i too am half in sympathy  certainly admires her no less than the crowd does  but josephine does not want mere admiration  she wants to be admired exactly in the way she prescribes  mere admiration leaves her cold
and when you take a seat before her  you understand her  opposition is possible only at a distance  when you sit before her  you know  this piping of hers is no piping
since piping is one of our thoughtless habits  one might think that people would pipe up in josephine's audience too  her art makes us feel happy  and when we are happy we pipe  but her audience never pipes  it sits in mouselike stillness  as if we had become partakers in the peace we long for  from which our own piping at the very least holds us back  we make no sound
is it her singing that enchants us or is it not rather the solemn stillness enclosing her frail little voice  once it happened while josephine was singing that some silly little thing in all innocence began to pipe up too
now it was just the same as what we were hearing from josephine  in front of us the piping sound that despite all rehearsal was still tentative and here in the audience the unselfconscious piping of a child  it would have been impossible to define the difference  but yet at once we hissed and whistled the interrupter down  although it would not really have been necessary  for in any case she would certainly have crawled away in fear and shame  whereas josephine struck up her most triumphal notes and was quite beyond herself  spreading her arms wide and stretching her throat as high as it could reach that is what she is like always  every trifle  every casual incident  every nuisance  a creaking in the parquet  a grinding of teeth  a failure in the lighting incites her to heighten the effectiveness of her song  she believes anyhow that she is singing to deaf ears  there is no lack of enthusiasm and applause  but she has long learned not to expect real understanding  as she conceives it so all disturbance is very welcome to her  whatever intervenes from outside to hinder the purity of her song  to be overcome with a slight effort  even with no effort at all  merely by confronting it  can help to awaken the masses  to teach them not perhaps understanding but awed respect
and if small events do her such service  how much more do great ones
our life is very uneasy  every day brings surprises  apprehensions  hopes  and terrors  so that it would be impossible for a single individual to bear it all did he not always have by day and night the support of his fellows  but even so it often becomes very difficult  frequently as many as a thousand shoulders are trembling under a burden that was really meant only for one pair
then josephine holds that her time has come
so there she stands  the delicate creature  shaken by vibrations especially below the breastbone  so that one feels anxious for her  it is as if she has concentrated all her strength on her song  as if from everything in her that does not directly subserve her singing all strength has been withdrawn  almost all power of life  as if she were laid bare  abandoned  committed merely to the care of good angels  as if while she is so wholly withdrawn and living only in her song a cold breath blowing upon her might kill her
but just when she makes such an appearance  we who are supposed to be her opponents are in the habit of saying   she can't even pipe  she has to put such a terrible strain on herself to force out not a song    we can't call it song    but some approximation to our usual customary piping   so it seems to us  but this impression although  as i said  inevitable is yet fleeting and transient we too are soon sunk in the feeling of the mass  which  warmly pressed body to body  listens with indrawn breath
and to gather around her this mass of our people who are almost always on the run and scurrying hither and thither for reasons that are often not very clear  josephine mostly needs to do nothing else than take up her stand  head thrown back  mouth half open  eyes turned upwards  in the position that indicates her intention to sing
she can do this where she likes  it need not be a place visible a long way off  any secluded corner pitched on in a moment's caprice will serve as well
the news that she is going to sing flies around at once and soon whole processions are on the way there
now  sometimes  all the same  obstacles intervene  josephine likes best to sing just when things are most upset  many worries and dangers force us then to take devious ways  with the best will in the world we cannot assemble ourselves as quickly as josephine wants  and on occasion she stands there in ceremonial state for quite a time without a sufficient audience    then indeed she turns furious  then she stamps her feet  swearing in most unmaidenly fashion  she actually bites
but even such behavior does no harm to her reputation  instead of curbing a little her excessive demands  people exert themselves to meet them  messengers are sent out to summon fresh hearers  she is kept in ignorance of the fact that this is being done  on the roads all around sentries can be seen posted who wave on newcomers and urge them to hurry  this goes on until at last a tolerably large audience is gathered what drives the people to make such exertions for josephine's sake  this is no easier to answer than the first question about josephine's singing  with which it is closely connected
one could eliminate that and combine them both in the second question  if it were possible to assert that because of her singing our people are unconditionally devoted to josephine
but this is simply not the case  unconditional devotion is hardly known among us  ours are people who love slyness beyond everything  without any malice  to be sure  and childish whispering and chatter  innocent  superficial chatter  to be sure  but people of such a kind cannot go in for unconditional devotion  and that josephine herself certainly feels  that is what she is fighting against with all the force of her feeble throat
in making such generalized pronouncements  of course  one should not go too far  our people are all the same devoted to josephine  only not unconditionally
for instance  they would not be capable of laughing at josephine
it can be admitted  in josephine there is much to make one laugh  and laughter for its own sake is never far away from us  in spite of all the misery of our lives quiet laughter is always  so to speak  at our elbows  but we do not laugh at josephine
many a time i have had the impression that our people interpret their relationship to josephine in this way  that she  this frail creature  needing protection and in some way remarkable  in her own opinion remarkable for her gift of song  is entrusted to their care and they must look after her  the reason for this is not clear to anyone  only the fact seems to be established but what is entrusted to one's care one does not laugh at  to laugh would be a breach of duty  the utmost malice which the most malicious of us wreak on josephine is to say now and then   the sight of josephine is enough to make one stop laughing   so the people look after josephine much as a father takes into his care a child whose little hand    one cannot tell whether in appeal or command    is stretched out to him one might think that our people are not fitted to exercise such paternal duties  but in reality they discharge them  at least in this case  admirably  no single individual could do what in this respect the people as a whole are capable of doing
to be sure  the difference in strength between the people and the individual is so enormous that it is enough for the nursling to be drawn into the warmth of their nearness and he is sufficiently protected
to josephine  certainly  one does not dare mention such ideas
 your protection isn't worth an old song   she says then
sure  sure  old song  we think
and besides her protest is no real contradiction  it is rather a thoroughly childish way of doing  and childish gratitude  while a father's way of doing is to pay no attention to it
yet there is something else behind it which is not so easy to explain by this relationship between the people and josephine
josephine  that is to say  thinks just the opposite  she believes it is she who protects the people
when we are in a bad way politically or economically  her singing is supposed to save us  nothing less than that  and if it does not drive away the evil  at least gives us the strength to bear it
she does not put it in these words or in any other  she says very little anyhow  she is silent among the chatterers  but it flashes from her eyes  on her closed lips    few among us can keep their lips closed  but she can    it is plainly legible
whenever we get bad news    and on many days bad news comes thick and fast at once  lies and half truths included    she rises up at once  whereas usually she sits listlessly on the ground  she rises up and stretches her neck and tries to see over the heads of her flock like a shepherd before a thunderstorm it is certainly a habit of children  in their wild  impulsive fashion  to make such claims  but josephine's are not quite so unfounded as children's true  she does not save us and she gives us no strength  it is easy to stage oneself as a savior of our people  inured as they are to suffering  not sparing themselves  swift in decision  well acquainted with death  timorous only to the eye in the atmosphere of reckless daring which they constantly breathe  and as prolific besides as they are bold    it is easy  i say  to stage oneself after the event as the savior of our people  who have always somehow managed to save themselves  although at the cost of sacrifices which make historians    generally speaking we ignore historical research entirely    quite horror struck and yet it is true that just in emergencies we hearken better than at other times to josephine's voice
the menaces that loom over us make us quieter  more humble  more submissive to josephine's domination  we like to come together  we like to huddle close to each other  especially on an occasion set apart from the troubles preoccupying us  it is as if we were drinking in all haste    yes  haste is necessary  josephine too often forgets that    from a cup of peace in common before the battle  it is not so much a performance of songs as an assembly of the people  and an assembly where except for the small piping voice in front there is complete stillness  the hour is much too grave for us to waste it in chatter
a relationship of this kind  of course  would never content josephine
despite all the nervous uneasiness that fills josephine because her position has never been quite defined  there is still much that she does not see  blinded by her self conceit  and she can be brought fairly easily to overlook much more  a swarm of flatterers is always busy about her to this end  thus really doing a public service    and yet to be only an incidental  unnoticed performer in a corner of an assembly of the people  for that  although in itself it would be no small thing  she would certainly not make us the sacrifice of her singing
nor does she need to  for her art does not go unnoticed
although we are at bottom preoccupied with quite other things and it is by no means only for the sake of her singing that stillness prevails and many a listener does not even look up but buries his face in his neighbor's fur  so that josephine up in front seems to be exerting herself to no purpose  there is yet something    it cannot be denied    that irresistibly makes its way into us from josephine's piping this piping  which rises up where everyone else is pledged to silence  comes almost like a message from the whole people to each individual  josephine's thin piping amidst grave decisions is almost like our people's precarious existence amidst the tumult of a hostile world
josephine exerts herself  a mere nothing in voice  a mere nothing in execution  she asserts herself and gets across to us  it does us good to think of that
a really trained singer  if ever such a one should be found among us  we could certainly not endure at such a time and we should unanimously turn away from the senselessness of any such performance
may josephine be spared from perceiving that the mere fact of our listening to her is proof that she is no singer
an intuition of it she must have  else why does she so passionately deny that we do listen  only she keeps on singing and piping her intuition away
but there are other things she could take comfort from  we do really listen to her in a sense  probably much as one listens to a trained singer  she gets effects which a trained singer would try in vain to achieve among us and which are only produced precisely because her means are so inadequate
for this  doubtless  our way of life is mainly responsible
among our people there is no age of youth  scarcely the briefest childhood
regularly  it is true  demands are put forward that the children should be granted a special freedom  a special protection  that their right to be a little carefree  to have a little senseless giddiness  a little play  that this right should be respected and the exercise of it encouraged  such demands are put forward and nearly everyone approves them  there is nothing one could approve more  but there is also nothing  in the reality of our daily life  that is less likely to be granted  one approves these demands  one makes attempts to meet them  but soon all the old ways are back again
our life happens to be such that a child  as soon as it can run about a little and a little distinguish one thing from another  must look after itself just like an adult  the areas on which  for economic reasons  we have to live in dispersion are too wide  our enemies too numerous  the dangers lying everywhere in wait for us too incalculable    we cannot shelter our children from the struggle for existence  if we did so  it would bring them to an early grave
these depressing considerations are reinforced by another  which is not depressing  the fertility of our race
one generation    and each is numerous    treads on the heels of another  the children have no time to be children
other races may foster their children carefully  schools may be erected for their little ones  out of these schools the children may come pouring daily  the future of the race  yet among them it is always the same children that come out day after day for a long time
we have no schools  but from our race come pouring at the briefest intervals the innumerable swarms of our children  merrily lisping or chirping so long as they cannot yet pipe  rolling or tumbling along by sheer impetus so long as they cannot yet run  clumsily carrying everything before them by mass weight so long as they cannot yet see  our children  and not the same children  as in those schools  no  always new children again and again  without end  without a break  hardly does a child appear than it is no more a child  while behind it new childish faces are already crowding so fast and so thick that they are indistinguishable  rosy with happiness truly  however delightful this may be and however much others may envy us for it  and rightly  we simply cannot give a real childhood to our children
and that has its consequences
a kind of unexpended  ineradicable childishness pervades our people  in direct opposition to what is best in us  our infallible practical common sense  we often behave with the utmost foolishness  with exactly the same foolishness as children  senselessly  wastefully  grandiosely  irresponsibly  and all that often for the sake of some trivial amusement
and although our enjoyment of it cannot of course be so wholehearted as a child's enjoyment  something of this survives in it without a doubt
from this childishness of our people josephine too has profited since the beginning
yet our people are not only childish  we are also in a sense prematurely old
childhood and old age come upon us not as upon others
we have no youth  we are all at once grown up  and then we stay grown up too long  a certain weariness and hopelessness spreading from that leaves a broad trail through our people's nature  tough and strong in hope that it is in general  our lack of musical gifts has surely some connection with this  we are too old for music  its excitement  its rapture do not suit our heaviness  wearily we wave it away  we content ourselves with piping  a little piping here and there  that is enough for us
who knows  there may be talents for music among us  but if there were  the character of our people would suppress them before they could unfold
josephine on the other hand can pipe as much as she will  or sing or whatever she likes to call it  that does not disturb us  that suits us  that we can well put up with  any music there may be in it is reduced to the least possible trace  a certain tradition of music is preserved  yet without making the slightest demand upon us
but our people  being what they are  get still more than this from josephine
at her concerts  especially in times of stress  it is only the very young who are interested in her singing as singing  they alone gaze in astonishment as she purses her lips  expels the air between her pretty front teeth  half dies in sheer wonderment at the sounds she herself is producing and after such a swooning swells her performance to new and more incredible heights  whereas the real mass of the people    this is plain to see    are quite withdrawn into themselves here in the brief intervals between their struggles our people dream  it is as if the limbs of each were loosened  as if the harried individual once in a while could relax and stretch himself at ease in the great  warm bed of the community and into these dreams josephine's piping drops note by note  she calls it pearl like  we call it staccato  but at any rate here it is in its right place  as nowhere else  finding the moment wait for it as music scarcely ever does something of our poor brief childhood is in it  something of lost happiness that can never be found again  but also something of active daily life  of its small gaieties  unaccountable and yet springing up and not to be obliterated and indeed this is all expressed not in full round tones but softly  in whispers  confidentially  sometimes a little hoarsely
of course it is a kind of piping
why not  piping is our people's daily speech  only many a one pipes his whole life long and does not know it  where here piping is set free from the fetters of daily life and it sets us free too for a little while
we certainly should not want to do without these performances
but from that point it is a long  long way to josephine's claim that she gives us new strength and so on and so forth
for ordinary people  at least  not for her train of flatterers
 what other explanation could there be      they say with quite shameless sauciness     how else could you explain the great audiences  especially when danger is most imminent  which have even often enough hindered proper precautions being taken in time to avert danger   now  this last statement is unfortunately true  but can hardly be counted as one of josephine's titles to fame  especially considering that when such large gatherings have been unexpectedly flushed by the enemy and many of our people left lying for dead  josephine  who was responsible for it all  and indeed perhaps attracted the enemy by her piping  has always occupied the safest place and was always the first to whisk away quietly and speedily under cover of her escort
still  everyone really knows that  and yet people keep running to whatever place josephine decides on next  at whatever time she rises up to sing
one could argue from this that josephine stands almost beyond the law  that she can do what she pleases  at the risk of actually endangering the community  and will be forgiven for everything
if this were so  even josephine's claims would be entirely comprehensible  yes  in this freedom to be allowed her  this extraordinary gift granted to her and to no one else in direct contravention of the laws  one could see an admission of the fact that the people do not understand josephine  just as she alleges  that they marvel helplessly at her art  feel themselves unworthy of it  try to assuage the pity she rouses in them by making really desperate sacrifices for her and  to the same extent that her art is beyond their comprehension  consider her personality and her wishes to lie beyond their jurisdiction well  that is simply not true at all  perhaps as individuals the people may surrender too easily to josephine  but as a whole they surrender unconditionally to no one  and not to her either
for a long time back  perhaps since the very beginning of her artistic career  josephine has been fighting for exemption from all daily work on account of her singing  she should be relieved of all responsibility for earning her daily bread and being involved in the general struggle for existence  which    apparently    should be transferred on her behalf to the people as a whole
a facile enthusiast    and there have been such    might argue from the mere unusualness of this demand  from the spiritual attitude needed to frame such a demand  that it has an inner justification
but our people draw other conclusions and quietly refuse it
nor do they trouble much about disproving the assumptions on which it is based
josephine argues  for instance  that the strain of working is bad for her voice  that the strain of working is of course nothing to the strain of singing  but it prevents her from being able to rest sufficiently after singing and to recuperate for more singing  she has to exhaust her strength completely and yet  in these circumstances  can never rise to the peak of her abilities the people listen to her arguments and pay no attention
our people  so easily moved  sometimes cannot be moved at all
their refusal is sometimes so decided that even josephine is taken aback  she appears to submit  does her proper share of work  sings as best she can  but all only for a time  then with renewed strength    for this purpose her strength seems inexhaustible    she takes up the fight again now it is clear that what josephine really wants is not what she puts into words
she is honorable  she is not work shy  shirking in any case is quite unknown among us  if her petition were granted she would certainly live the same life as before  her work would not at all get in the way of her singing nor would her singing grow any better    what she wants is public  unambiguous  permanent recognition of her art  going far beyond any precedent so far known
but while almost everything else seems within her reach  this eludes her persistently perhaps she should have taken a different line of attack from the beginning  perhaps she herself sees that her approach was wrong  but now she cannot draw back  retreat would be self betrayal  now she must stand or fall by her petition
if she really had enemies  as she avers  they could get much amusement from watching this struggle  without having to lift a finger
but she has no enemies  and even though she is often criticized here and there  no one finds this struggle of hers amusing
just because of the fact that the people show themselves here in their cold  judicial aspect  which is otherwise rarely seen among us and however one may approve it in this case  the very idea that such an aspect might be turned upon oneself some day prevents amusement from breaking in
the important thing  both in the people's refusal and in josephine's petition  is not the action itself  but the fact that the people are capable of presenting a stony  impenetrable front to one of their own  and that it is all the more impenetrable because in other respects they show an anxious paternal care  and more than paternal care  for this very member of the people
suppose that instead of the people one had an individual to deal with  one might imagine that this man had been giving in to josephine all the time while nursing a wild desire to put an end to his submissiveness one fine day  that he had made superhuman sacrifices for josephine in the firm belief that there was a natural limit to his capacity for sacrifice  yes  that he had sacrificed more than was needful merely to hasten the process  merely to spoil josephine and encourage her to ask for more and more until she did indeed reach the limit with this last petition of hers  and that he then cut her off with a final refusal which was curt because long held in reserve
now  this is certainly not how the matter stands  the people have no need of such guile  besides  their respect for josephine is well tried and genuine  and josephine's demands are after all so far reaching that any simple child could have told her what the outcome would be  yet it may be that such considerations enter into josephine's way of taking the matter and so add a certain bitterness to the pain of being refused
but whatever her ideas on the subject  she does not let them deter her from pursuing the campaign
recently she has even intensified her attack  hitherto she has used only words as her weapons but now she is beginning to have recourse to other means  which she thinks will prove more efficacious but which we think will run her into greater dangers
many believe that josephine is becoming so insistent because she feels herself growing old and her voice falling off  and so she thinks it high time to wage the last battle for recognition
i do not believe it
josephine would not be josephine if that were true
for her there is no growing old and no falling off in her voice
if she makes demands it is not because of outward circumstances but because of an inner logic she reaches for the highest garland not because it is momentarily hanging a little lower but because it is the highest  if she had any say in the matter she would have it still higher
this contempt for external difficulties  to be sure  does not hinder her from using the most unworthy methods
her rights seem beyond question to her  so what does it matter how she secures them  especially since in this world  as she sees it  honest methods are bound to fail
perhaps that is why she has transferred the battle for her rights from the field of song to another which she cares little about
her supporters have let it be known that  according to herself  she feels quite capable of singing in such a way that all levels of the populace  even to the remotest corners of the opposition  would find it a real delight  a real delight not by popular standards  for the people affirm that they have always delighted in her singing  but a delight by her own standards
however  she adds  since she cannot falsify the highest standards nor pander to the lowest  her singing will have to stay as it is
but when it comes to her campaign for exemption from work  we get a different story  it is of course also a campaign on behalf of her singing  yet she is not fighting directly with the priceless weapon of her song  so any instrument she uses is good enough
thus  for instance  the rumor went around that josephine meant to cut short her grace notes if her petition were not granted
i know nothing about grace notes  and have never noticed any in josephine's singing
but josephine is going to cut short her grace notes  not  for the present  to cut them out entirely  only to cut them short
presumably she has carried out her threat  although i for one have observed no difference in her performance
the people as a whole listened in the usual way without making any pronouncement on the grace notes  nor did their response to her petition vary by a jot
it must be admitted that josephine's way of thinking  like her figure  is often very charming
and so  for instance  after that performance  just as if her decision about the grace notes had been too severe or too sudden a move against the people  she announced that next time she would put in all the grace notes again
yet after the next concert she changed her mind once more  there was to be definitely an end of these great arias with the grace notes  and until her petition was favorably regarded they would never recur
well  the people let all these announcements  decisions and counterdecisions go in at one ear and out at the other  like a grown up person deep in thought turning a deaf ear to a child's babble  fundamentally well disposed but not accessible
josephine  however  does not give in
the other day  for instance  she claimed that she had hurt her foot at work  so that it was difficult for her to stand up to sing  but since she could not sing except standing up  her songs would now have to be cut short
although she limps and leans on her supporters  no one believes that she is really hurt
granted that her frail body is extra sensitive  she is yet one of us and we are a race of workers  if we were to start limping every time we got a scratch  the whole people would never be done limping
yet though she lets herself be led about like a cripple  though she shows herself in this pathetic condition oftener than usual  the people all the same listen to her singing thankfully and appreciatively as before  but do not bother much about the shortening of her songs
since she cannot very well go on limping forever  she thinks of something else  she pleads that she is tired  not in the mood for singing  feeling faint
and so we get a theatrical performance as well as a concert
we see josephine's supporters in the background begging and imploring her to sing
she would be glad to oblige  but she cannot
they comfort and caress her with flatteries  they almost carry her to the selected spot where she is supposed to sing
at last  bursting inexplicably into tears  she gives way  but when she stands up to sing  obviously at the end of her resources  weary  her arms not widespread as usual but hanging lifelessly down  so that one gets the impression that they are perhaps a little too short    just as she is about to strike up  there  she cannot do it after all  an unwilling shake of the head tells us so and she breaks down before our eyes to be sure  she pulls herself together again and sings  i fancy  much as usual  perhaps  if one has an ear for the finer shades of expression  one can hear that she is singing with unusual feeling  which is  however  all to the good
and in the end she is actually less tired than before  with a firm tread  if one can use such a term for her tripping gait  she moves off  refusing all help from her supporters and measuring with cold eyes the crowd which respectfully makes way for her
that happened a day or two ago  but the latest is that she has disappeared  just at a time when she was supposed to sing
it is not only her supporters who are looking for her  many are devoting themselves to the search  but all in vain  josephine has vanished  she will not sing  she will not even be cajoled into singing  this time she has deserted us entirely curious  how mistaken she is in her calculations  the clever creature  so mistaken that one might fancy she has made no calculations at all but is only being driven on by her destiny  which in our world cannot be anything but a sad one
of her own accord she abandons her singing  of her own accord she destroys the power she has gained over people's hearts
how could she ever have gained that power  since she knows so little about these hearts of ours  she hides herself and does not sing  but our people  quietly  without visible disappointment  a self confident mass in perfect equilibrium  so constituted  even though appearances are misleading  that they can only bestow gifts and not receive them  even from josephine  our people continue on their way
josephine's road  however  must go downhill
the time will soon come when her last notes sound and die into silence
she is a small episode in the eternal history of our people  and the people will get over the loss of her
not that it will be easy for us  how can our gatherings take place in utter silence  still  were they not silent even when josephine was present  was her actual piping notably louder and more alive than the memory of it will be  was it even in her lifetime more than a simple memory  was it not rather because josephine's singing was already past losing in this way that our people in their wisdom prized it so highly  so perhaps we shall not miss so very much after all  while josephine  redeemed from the earthly sorrows which to her thinking lay in wait for all chosen spirits  will happily lose herself in the numberless throng of the heroes of our people  and soon  since we are no historians  will rise to the heights of redemption and be forgotten like all her brothers
children on a country road i heard the wagons rumbling past the garden fence  sometimes i even saw them through gently swaying gaps in the foliage
how the wood of their spokes and shafts creaked in the summer heat  laborers were coming from the fields and laughing so that it was a scandal
i was sitting on our little swing  just resting among the trees in my parents' garden
on the other side of the fence the traffic never stopped
children's running feet were past in a moment  harvest wagons with men and women perched on and around the sheaves darkened the flower beds  toward evening i saw a gentleman slowly promenading with a walking stick  and a couple of girls who met him arm in arm stepped aside into the grass as they greeted him
then birds flew up as if in showers  i followed them with my eyes and saw how high they soared in one breath  till i felt not that they were rising but that i was falling  and holding fast to the ropes began to swing a little out of sheer weakness
soon i was swinging more strongly as the air blew colder and instead of soaring birds trembling stars appeared
i was given my supper by candlelight
often both my arms were on the wooden board and i was already weary as i bit into my bread and butter the coarse mesh window curtains bellied in the warm wind and many a time some passer by outside would stay them with his hands as if he wanted to see me better and speak to me
usually the candle soon went out and in the sooty candle smoke the assembled midges went on circling for a while
if anyone asked me a question from the window i would gaze at him as if at a distant mountain or into vacancy  nor did he particularly care whether he got an answer or not
but if one jumped over the window sill and announced that the others were already waiting  then i did get to my feet with a sigh
 what are you sighing for  what's wrong  has something dreadful happened that can never be made good  shan't we ever recover from it  is everything lost   nothing was lost
we ran to the front of the house
 thank god  here you are at last       you're always late       why just me       especially you  why don't you stay at home if you don't want to come       no quarter       no quarter  what kind of way is that to talk   we ran our heads full tilt into the evening
there was no daytime and no nighttime
now our waistcoat buttons would be clacking together like teeth  again we would be keeping a steady distance from each other as we ran  breathing fire like wild beasts in the tropics
like cuirassiers in old wars  stamping and springing high  we drove each other down the short alley and with this impetus in our legs a farther stretch along the main road stray figures went into the ditch  hardly had they vanished down the dusky escarpment when they were standing like newcomers on the field path above and looking down
 come on down       come on up first       so's you can push us down  no thanks  we're not such fools       you're afraid  you mean
come on up  you cowards        afraid  of the likes of you  you're going to push us down  are you  that's a good one   we made the attempt and were pushed head over heels into the grass of the roadside ditch  tumbling of our own free will
everything was equably warm to us  we felt neither warmth nor chill in the grass  only one got tired
turning on one's right side  with a hand under the ear  one could easily have fallen asleep there
but one wanted to get up again with chin uplifted  only to roll into a deeper ditch
then with an arm thrust out crosswise and legs threshing to the side one thought to launch into the air again only to fall for certain into a still deeper ditch
and of this one never wanted to make an end
how one might stretch oneself out  especially in the knees  properly to sleep in the last ditch  was something scarcely thought of  and one simply lay on one's back  like an invalid  inclined to weep a little one blinked as now and then a youngster with elbows pressed to his sides sprang over one's head with dark looming soles  in a leap from the escarpment to the roadway
the moon was already some way up in the sky  in its light a mail coach drove past
a small wind began to blow everywhere  even in the ditch one could feel it  and nearby the forest began to rustle
then one was no longer so anxious to be alone
 where are you       come here       all together       what are you hiding for  drop your nonsense       don't you know the mail's gone past already       not already       of course  it went past while you were sleeping       i wasn't sleeping
what an idea       oh shut up  you're still half asleep       but i wasn't       come on   we ran bunched more closely together  many of us linked hands  one's head could not be held high enough  for now the way was downhill
someone whooped an indian war cry  our legs galloped us as never before  the wind lifted our hips as we sprang
nothing could have checked us  we were in such full stride that even in overtaking others we could fold our arms and look quietly around us at the bridge over the brook we came to a stop  those who had overrun it came back
the water below lapped against stones and roots as if it were not already late evening
there was no reason why one of us should not jump onto the parapet of the bridge
from behind clumps of trees in the distance a railway train came past  all the carriages were lit up  the windowpanes were certainly let down
one of us began to sing a popular catch  but we all felt like singing
we sang much faster than the train was going  we waved our arms because our voices were not enough  our voices rushed together in an avalanche of sound that did us good when one joins in song with others it is like being drawn on by a fish hook
so we sang  the forest behind us  for the ears of the distant travelers
the grownups were still awake in the village  the mothers were making down the beds for the night
our time was up
i kissed the one next to me  reached hands to the three nearest  and began to run home  none called me back
at the first crossroads where they could no longer see me i turned off and ran by the field paths into the forest again
i was making for that city in the south of which it was said in our village   there you'll find queer folk  just think  they never sleep    and why not    because they never get tired    and why not    because they're fools    don't fools get tired    how could fools get tired   the trees for we are like tree trunks in the snow
in appearance they lie sleekly and a little push should be enough to set them rolling
no  it can't be done  for they are firmly wedded to the ground
but see  even that is only appearance
clothes often when i see clothes with manifold pleats  frills  and appendages which fit so smoothly onto lovely bodies i think they won't keep that smoothness long  but will get creases that can't be ironed out  dust lying so thick in the embroidery that it can't be brushed away  and that no one would want to be so unhappy and so foolish as to wear the same valuable gown every day from early morning till night
and yet i see girls who are lovely enough and display attractive muscles and small bones and smooth skin and masses of delicate hair  and nonetheless appear day in  day out  in this same natural fancy dress  always propping the same face on the same palms and letting it be reflected from the looking glass only sometimes at night  on coming home late from a party  it seems in the looking glass to be worn out  puffy  dusty  already seen by too many people  and hardly wearable any longer excursion into the mountains  i don't know   i cried without being heard   i do not know
if nobody comes  then nobody comes
i've done nobody any harm  nobody's done me any harm  but nobody will help me
a pack of nobodies
yet that isn't all true
only  that nobody helps me    a pack of nobodies would be rather fine  on the other hand
i'd love to go on an excursion    why not     with a pack of nobodies
into the mountains  of course  where else  how these nobodies jostle each other  all these lifted arms linked together  these numberless feet treading so close  of course they are all in dress suits we go so gaily  the wind blows through us and the gaps in our company
our throats swell and are free in the mountains  it's a wonder that we don't burst into song   rejection when i meet a pretty girl and beg her   be so good as to come with me   and she walks past without a word  this is what she means to say   you are no duke with a famous name  no broad american with a red indian figure  level  brooding eyes and a skin tempered by the air of the prairies and the rivers that flow through them  you have never journeyed to the seven seas and voyaged on them wherever they may be  i don't know where
so why  pray  should a pretty girl like myself go with you    you forget that no automobile swings you through the street in long thrusts  i see no gentlemen escorting you in a close half circle  pressing on your skirts from behind and murmuring blessings on your head  your breasts are well laced into your bodice  but your thighs and hips make up for that restraint  you are wearing a taffeta dress with a pleated skirt such as delighted all of us last autumn  and yet you smile    inviting mortal danger    from time to time    yes  we're both in the right  and to keep us from being irrevocably aware of it  hadn't we better just go our separate ways home   the street window whoever leads a solitary life and yet now and then wants to attach himself somewhere  whoever  according to changes in the time of day  the weather  the state of his business  and the like  suddenly wishes to see any arm at all to which he might cling    he will not be able to manage for long without a window looking on to the street and if he is in the mood of not desiring anything and only goes to his window sill a tired man  with eyes turning from his public to heaven and back again  not wanting to look out and having thrown his head up a little  even then the horses below will draw him down into their train of wagons and tumult  and so at last into the human harmony
the tradesman it is possible that some people are sorry for me  but i am not aware of it
my small business fills me with worries that make my forehead and temples ache inside yet without giving any prospect of relief  for my business is a small business
i have to spend hours beforehand making things ready  jogging the caretaker's memory  warning him about mistakes he is likely to commit  and puzzling out in one season of the year what the next season's fashions are to be  not such as are followed by the people i know but those that will appeal to inaccessible peasants in the depths of the country
my money is in the hands of strangers  the state of their affairs must be a mystery to me  the ill luck that might overwhelm them i cannot foresee  how could i possibly avert it  perhaps they are running into extravagance and giving a banquet in some inn garden  some of them may be attending the banquet as a brief respite before their flight to america
when at the close of a working day i turn the key on my business and suddenly see before me hours in which i shall be able to do nothing to satisfy its never ending demands  then the excitement which i drove far away from me in the morning comes back like a returning tide  but cannot be contained in me and sweeps me aimlessly away with it
and yet i can make no use of this impulse  i can only go home  for my face and hands are dirty and sweaty  my clothes are stained and dusty  my working cap is on my head  and my shoes are scratched with the nails of crates
i go home as if lifted on a wave  snapping the fingers of both hands  and caress the hair of any children i meet
but the way is short
soon i reach my house  open the door of the lift  and step in
i see that now  of a sudden  i am alone
others who have to climb stairways tire a little as they climb  have to wait with quick panting breath till someone opens the door of the flat  which gives them an excuse for being irritable and impatient  have to traverse the hallway where hats are hung up  and not until they go down a lobby past several glass doors and come into their own room are they alone
but i am alone in the lift  immediately  and on my knees gaze into the narrow looking glass
as the lift begins to rise  i say   quiet now  back with you  is it the shadow of the trees you want to make for  or behind the window curtains  or into the garden arbor   i say that behind my teeth  and the staircase flows down past the opaque glass panes like running water
 fly then  let your wings  which i have never seen  carry you into the village hollow or as far as paris  if that's where you want to go
 but enjoy yourselves there looking out of the window  see the processions converging out of three streets at once  not giving way to each other but marching through each other and leaving the open space free again as their last ranks draw off
wave your handkerchiefs  be indignant  be moved  acclaim the beautiful lady who drives past
 cross over the stream on the wooden bridge  nod to the children bathing and gape at the hurrah  rising from the thousand sailors on the distant battleship
 follow the trail of the inconspicuous little man  and when you have pushed him into a doorway  rob him  and then watch him  each with your hands in your pockets  as he sadly goes his way along the left hand street
 the police dispersed on galloping horses rein in their mounts and thrust you back
let them  the empty streets will dishearten them  i know
what did i tell you  they are riding away already in couples  slowly around the corners  at full speed across the squares   then i have to leave the lift  send it down again  and ring the bell  and the maid opens the door while i say  good evening
absent minded window gazing what are we to do with these spring days that are now fast coming on  early this morning the sky was gray  but if you go to the window now you are surprised and lean your cheek against the latch of the casement
the sun is already setting  but down below you see it lighting up the face of the little girl who strolls along looking about her  and at the same time you see her eclipsed by the shadow of the man behind overtaking her
and then the man has passed by and the little girl's face is quite bright
the way home see what a persuasive force the air has after a thunderstorm  my merits become evident and overpower me  though i don't put up any resistance  i grant you
i stride along and my tempo is the tempo of all my side of the street  of the whole street  of the whole quarter
mine is the responsibility  and rightly so  for all the raps on doors or on the flat of a table  for all toasts drunk  for lovers in their beds  in the scaffolding of new buildings  pressed to each other against the house walls in dark alleys  or on the divans of a brothel
i weigh my past against my future  but find both of them admirable  cannot give either the preference  and find nothing to grumble at save the injustice of providence that has so clearly favored me
only as i come into my room i feel a little meditative  without having met anything on the stairs worth meditating about
it doesn't help me much to open the window wide and hear music still playing in a garden
passers by when you go walking by night up a street and a man  visible a long way off    for the street mounts uphill and there is a full moon    comes running toward you  well  you don't catch hold of him  not even if he is a feeble and ragged creature  not even if someone chases yelling at his heels  but you let him run on
for it is night  and you can't help it if the street goes uphill before you in the moonlight  and besides  these two have maybe started that chase to amuse themselves  or perhaps they are both chasing a third  perhaps the first is an innocent man and the second wants to murder him and you would become an accessory  perhaps they don't know anything about each other and are merely running separately home to bed  perhaps they are night birds  perhaps the first man is armed and anyhow  haven't you a right to be tired  haven't you been drinking a lot of wine  you're thankful that the second man is now long out of sight
on the tram i stand on the end platform of the tram and am completely unsure of my footing in this world  in this town  in my family
not even casually could i indicate any claims that i might rightly advance in any direction i have not even any defense to offer for standing on this platform  holding on to this strap  letting myself be carried along by this tram  nor for the people who give way to the tram or walk quietly along or stand gazing into shopwin dows
nobody asks me to put up a defense  indeed  but that is irrelevant
the tram approaches a stopping place and a girl takes up her position near the step  ready to alight
she is as distinct to me as if i had run my hands over her
she is dressed in black  the pleats of her skirt hang almost still  her blouse is tight and has a collar of white fine meshed lace  her left hand is braced flat against the side of the tram  the umbrella in her right hand rests on the second top step
her face is brown  her nose  slightly pinched at the sides  has a broad round tip
she has a lot of brown hair and stray little tendrils on the right temple
her small ear is close set  but since i am near her i can see the whole ridge of the whorl of her right ear and the shadow at the root of it
at that point i asked myself  how is it that she is not amazed at herself  that she keeps her lips closed and makes no such remark  reflections for gentlemen jockeys when you think it over  winning a race is nothing to sigh for
the fame of being hailed as the best rider in the country is too intoxicating a pleasure when the applause strikes up not to bring a reaction the morning after
the envy of your opponents  cunning and fairly influential men  must trouble you in the narrow enclosure you now traverse after the flat racecourse  which soon lay empty before you save for some laggards of the previous round  small figures charging the horizon
many of your friends are rushing to gather their winnings and only cry  hurrah   to you over their shoulders from distant pay boxes  your best friends laid no bet on your horse  since they feared that they would have to be angry with you if you lost  and now that your horse has come in first and they have won nothing  they turn away as you pass and prefer to look along the stands
your rivals behind you  firmly in the saddle  are trying to ignore the bad luck that has befallen them and the injustice they have somehow suffered  they are putting a brave new face on things  as if a different race were due to start  and this time a serious one after such child's play
for many ladies the victor cuts a ridiculous figure because he is swelling with importance and yet cannot cope with the never ending handshaking  saluting  bowing  and waving  while the defeated keep their mouths shut and casually pat the necks of their whinnying horses
and finally from the now overcast sky rain actually begins to fall
the wish to be a red indian if one were only an indian  instantly alert  and on a racing horse  leaning against the wind  kept on quivering jerkily over the quivering ground  until one shed one's spurs  for there needed no spurs  threw away the reins  for there needed no reins  and hardly saw that the land before one was smoothly shorn heath when horse's neck and head would be already gone
unhappiness when it was becoming unbearable    once toward evening in november    and i ran along the narrow strip of carpet in my room as on a racetrack  shrank from the sight of the lit up street  then turning to the interior of the room found a new goal in the depths of the looking glass and screamed aloud  to hear only my own scream which met no answer nor anything that could draw its force away  so that it rose up without check and could not stop even when it ceased being audible  the door in the wall opened toward me  how swiftly  because swiftness was needed and even the cart horses down below on the paving stones were rising in the air like horses driven wild in a battle  their throats bare to the enemy
like a small ghost a child blew in from the pitch dark corridor  where the lamp was not yet lit  and stood a tiptoe on a floor board that quivered imperceptibly
at once dazzled by the twilight in my room she made to cover her face quickly with her hands  but contented herself unexpectedly with a glance at the window  where the mounting vapor of the street lighting had at last settled under its cover of darkness behind the crossbars
with her right elbow she supported herself against the wall in the open doorway and let the draught from outside play along her ankles  her throat  and her temples
i gave her a brief glance  then said  good day   and took my jacket from the hood of the stove  since i didn't want to stand there half undressed
for a little while i let my mouth hang open  so that my agitation could find a way out
i had a bad taste in my mouth  my eyelashes were fluttering on my cheeks  in short this visit  though i had expected it  was the one thing needful
the child was still standing by the wall on the same spot  she had pressed her right hand against the plaster and was quite taken up with finding  her cheeks all pink  that the whitewashed walls had a rough surface and chafed her finger tips
i said   are you really looking for me  isn't there some mistake  nothing easier than to make a mistake in this big building
i'm called so and so and i live on the third floor
am i the person you want to find    hush  hush   said the child over her shoulder   it's all right    then come farther into the room  i'd like to shut the door    i've shut it this very minute
don't bother
just be easy in your mind    it's no bother
but there's a lot of people living on this corridor  and i know them all  of course  most of them are coming back from work now  if they hear someone talking in a room  they simply think they have a right to open the door and see what's happening
they're just like that
they've turned their backs on their daily work and in their provisionally free evenings they're not going to be dictated to by anyone
besides  you know that as well as i do
let me shut the door    why  what's the matter with you  i don't mind if the whole house comes in
anyhow  as i told you  i've already shut the door  do you think you're the only person who can shut doors  i've even turned the key in the lock    that's all right then
i couldn't ask for more
you didn't need to turn the key  either
and now that you are here  make yourself comfortable
you are my guest
you can trust me entirely
just make yourself at home and don't be afraid
i won't compel you either to stay or to go away
do i have to tell you that  do you know me so little    no
you really didn't need to tell me that
what's more  you shouldn't have told me
i'm just a child  why stand on so much ceremony with me    it's not so bad as that
a child  of course
but not so very small
you're quite big
if you were a young lady  you wouldn't dare to lock yourself so simply in a room with me    we needn't worry about that
i just want to say  my knowing you so well isn't much protection to me  it only relieves you of the effort of keeping up pretenses before me
and yet you're paying me a compliment
stop it  i beg you  do stop it
anyhow  i don't know you everywhere and all the time  least of all in this darkness
it would be much better if you were to light up
no  perhaps not
at any rate i'll keep it in mind that you have been threatening me    what  am i supposed to have threatened you  but  look here
i'm so pleased that you've come at last
i say 'at last' because it's already rather late
i can't understand why you've come so late
but it's possible that in the joy of seeing you i have been speaking at random and you took up my words in the wrong sense
i'll admit ten times over that i said something of the kind  i've made all kinds of threats  anything you like
only no quarreling  for heaven's sake  but how could you think of such a thing  how could you hurt me so  why do you insist on spoiling this brief moment of your presence here  a stranger would be more obliging than you are    that i can well believe  that's no great discovery
no stranger could come any nearer to you than i am already by nature
you know that  too  so why all this pathos  if you're only wanting to stage a comedy i'll go away immediately    what  you have the impudence to tell me that  you make a little too bold
after all  it's my room you're in
it's my wall you're rubbing your fingers on like mad
my room  my wall  and besides  what you are saying is ridiculous as well as impudent
you say your nature forces you to speak to me like that
is that so  your nature forces you  that's kind of your nature
your nature is mine  and if i feel friendly to you by nature  then you mustn't be anything else    is that friendly    i'm speaking of earlier on    do you know how i'll be later on    i don't know anything   and i went to the bed table and lit the candle on it
at that time i had neither gas nor electric light in my room
then i sat for a while at the table till i got tired of it  put on my greatcoat  took my hat from the sofa  and blew out the candle
as i went out i tripped over the leg of a chair
on the stairs i met one of the tenants from my floor
 going out again already  you rascal   he asked  pausing with his legs firmly straddled over two steps
 what can i do   i said   i've just had a ghost in my room    you say that exactly as if you had just found a hair in your soup    you're making a joke of it
but let me tell you  a ghost is a ghost    how true
but what if one doesn't believe in ghosts at all    well  do you think i believe in ghosts  but how can my not believing help me    quite simply
you don't need to feel afraid if a ghost actually turns up    oh  that's only a secondary fear
the real fear is a fear of what caused the apparition
and that fear doesn't go away
i have it fairly powerfully inside me now   out of sheer nervousness i began to hunt through all my pockets
 but since you weren't afraid of the ghost itself  you could easily have asked it how it came to be there    obviously you've never spoken to a ghost
one never gets straight information from them
it's just a hither and thither
these ghosts seem to be more dubious about their existence than we are  and no wonder  considering how frail they are    but i've heard that one can fatten them up    how well informed you are
it's quite true
but is anyone likely to do it    why not  if it were a feminine ghost  for instance   said he  swinging onto the top step
 aha   said i   but even then it's not worth while   i thought of something else
my neighbor was already so far up that in order to see me he had to bend over the well of the staircase
 all the same   i called up   if you steal my ghost from me all is over between us  forever    oh  i was only joking   he said and drew his head back
 that's all right   said i  and now i really could have gone quietly for a walk
but because i felt so forlorn i preferred to go upstairs again and so went to bed
bachelor's ill luck it seems so dreadful to stay a bachelor  to become an old man struggling to keep one's dignity while begging for an invitation whenever one wants to spend an evening in company  to lie ill gazing for weeks into an empty room from the corner where one's bed is  always having to say good night at the front door  never to run up a stairway beside one's wife  to have only side doors in one's room leading into other people's living rooms  having to carry one's supper home in one's hand  having to admire other people's children and not even being allowed to go on saying   i have none myself   modeling oneself in appearance and behavior on one or two bachelors remembered from one's youth that's how it will be  except that in reality  both today and later  one will stand there with a palpable body and a real head  a real forehead  that is  for smiting on with one's hand
unmasking a confidence trickster at last  about ten o'clock at night  i came to the doorway of the fine house where i was invited to spend the evening  after the man beside me  whom i was barely acquainted with and who had once again thrust himself unasked upon me  had marched me for two long hours around the streets  well   i said  and clapped my hands to show that i really had to bid him goodbye
i had already made several less explicit attempts to get rid of him
i was tired out
 are you going straight in   he asked
i heard a sound in his mouth that was like the snapping of teeth
 yes   i had been invited out  i told him when i met him
but it was to enter a house where i longed to be that i had been invited  not to stand here at the street door looking past the ears of the man before me
nor to fall silent with him  as if we were doomed to stay for a long time on this spot
and yet the houses around us at once took a share in our silence  and the darkness over them  all the way up to the stars
and the steps of invisible passers by  which one could not take the trouble to elucidate  and the wind persistently buffeting the other side of the street  and a gramophone singing behind the closed windows of some room    they all announced themselves in this silence  as if it were their own possession for the time past and to come and my companion subscribed to it in his own name and    with a smile    in mine too  stretched his right arm up along the wall and leaned his cheek upon it  shutting his eyes but i did not wait to see the end of that smile  for shame suddenly caught hold of me
it had needed that smile to let me know that the man was a confidence trickster  nothing else
and yet i had been months in the town and thought i knew all about confidence tricksters  how they came slinking out of side streets by night to meet us with outstretched hands like tavernkeepers  how they haunted the advertisement pillars we stood beside  sliding around them as if playing hide and seek and spying on us with at least one eye  how they suddenly appeared on the curb of the pavement at cross streets when we were hesitating  i understood them so well  they were the first acquaintances i had made in the town's small taverns  and to them i owed my first inkling of a ruthless hardness which i was now so conscious of  everywhere on earth  that i was even beginning to feel it in myself how persistently they blocked our way  even when we had long shaken ourselves free  even when  that is  they had nothing more to hope for  how they refused to give up  to admit defeat  but kept shooting glances at us that even from a distance were still compelling  and the means they employed were always the same  they planted themselves before us  looking as large as possible  tried to hinder us from going where we purposed  offered us instead a habitation in their own bosoms  and when at last all our balked feelings rose in revolt they welcomed that like an embrace into which they threw themselves face foremost and it had taken me such a long time in this man's company to recognize the same old game
i rubbed my finger tips together to wipe away the disgrace
my companion was still leaning there as before  still believing himself a successful trickster  and his self complacency glowed pink on his free cheek  caught in the act   said i  tapping him lightly on the shoulder
then i ran up the steps  and the disinterested devotion on the servants' faces in the hall delighted me like an unexpected treat
i looked at them all  one after another  while they took my greatcoat off and wiped my shoes clean
with a deep breath of relief and straightening myself to my full height  i then entered the drawing room
the sudden walk when it looks as if you had made up your mind finally to stay at home for the evening  when you have put on your house jacket and sat down after supper with a light on the table to the piece of work or the game that usually precedes your going to bed  when the weather outside is unpleasant so that staying indoors seems natural  and when you have already been sitting quietly at the table for so long that your departure must occasion surprise to everyone  when  besides  the stairs are in darkness and the front door locked  and in spite of all that you have started up in a sudden fit of restlessness  changed your jacket  abruptly dressed yourself for the street  explained that you must go out and with a few curt words of leave taking actually gone out  banging the flat door more or less hastily according to the degree of displeasure you think you have left behind you  and when you find yourself once more in the street with limbs swinging extra freely in answer to the unexpected liberty you have procured for them  when as a result of this decisive action you feel concentrated within yourself all the potentialities of decisive action  when you recognize with more than usual significance that your strength is greater than your need to accomplish effortlessly the swiftest of changes and to cope with it  when in this frame of mind you go striding down the long streets    then for that evening you have completely got away from your family  which fades into insubstantiality  while you yourself  a firm  boldly drawn black figure  slapping yourself on the thigh  grow to your true stature all this is still heightened if at such a late hour in the evening you look up a friend to see how he is getting on
resolutions to lift yourself out of a miserable mood  even if you have to do it by strength of will  should be easy
i force myself out of my chair  stride around the table  exercise my head and neck  make my eyes sparkle  tighten the muscles around them
defy my own feelings  welcome a
enthusiastically supposing he comes to see me  amiably tolerate b
in my room  swallow all that is said at c 's  whatever pain and trouble it may cost me  in long draughts
yet even if i manage that  one single slip  and a slip cannot be avoided  will stop the whole process  easy and painful alike  and i will have to shrink back into my own circle again
so perhaps the best resource is to meet everything passively  to make yourself an inert mass  and  if you feel that you are being carried away  not to let yourself be lured into taking a single unnecessary step  to stare at others with the eyes of an animal  to feel no compunction  in short  with your own hand to throttle down whatever ghostly life remains in you  that is  to enlarge the final peace of the graveyard and let nothing survive save that
a characteristic movement in such a condition is to run your little finger along your eyebrows
a dream josef k
was dreaming
it was a beautiful day and k
felt like going for a walk
but hardly had he taken a couple of steps when he was already at the cemetery
the paths there were very winding  ingeniously made  and unpractical  but he glided along one of them as if on a rushing stream with unshaken poise and balance
from a long way off his eye was caught by a freshly heaped grave mound which he wanted to pause beside
this grave mound exerted almost a fascination over him and he felt he could not reach it fast enough
but he often nearly lost sight of it  for his view was obscured by banners which veered and flapped against each other with great force  one could not see the standard bearers  but there seemed to be a very joyous celebration going on
while he was still peering into the distance  he suddenly saw the grave mound quite near his path  indeed he was almost leaving it behind him
he made a hasty spring onto the grass
but since the path went rushing on under his shifting foot  he tottered and fell on his knees just in front of the grave mound
two men were standing behind the grave and were holding a gravestone between them in the air  scarcely had k
arrived when they thrust the stone into the earth and it stood as if cemented there
out of some bushes there came at once a third man  whom k
recognized immediately as an artist
he was clad only in trousers and a badly buttoned shirt  on his head was a velvet cap  in his hand he held an ordinary pencil with which he was already drawing figures in the air as he approached
with this pencil he now addressed himself to the top end of the gravestone  the stone was very tall  he did not have to bend down  though he had to bend forward  since the grave mound  on which he shrank from setting foot  came between him and the stone so he stood on tiptoe and steadied himself with his left hand on the stone's flat surface with an astonishing turn of skill he managed to produce golden letters from his ordinary pencil  he wrote  here lies    every letter was clear and beautifully made  deeply incised and of the purest gold
when he had inscribed these two words he looked at k
over his shoulder  k   who was very eager to know how the inscription would go  paid hardly any attention to the man but was intent only on the stone
and in fact the man turned again to continue writing  but he could not go on  something was hindering him  he let the pencil sink and once more turned toward k
this time k
looked back at him and noted that he was deeply embarrassed and yet unable to explain himself all his earlier vivacity had vanished
that made k
feel embarrassed too  they exchanged helpless glances  there was some dreadful misunderstanding between them which neither could resolve
an untimely little bell now began to ring from the cemetery chapel  but the artist made a sign with uplifted hand and the bell stopped
in a little while it began again  this time quite softly and without any insistence  breaking off again at once  as if it were only testing its own tone
k
felt miserable because of the artist's predicament  he began to cry and sobbed for a long time into his cupped hands
the artist waited until k
had calmed down and then decided  since there was no help for it  just to go on with the inscription
the first small stroke that he made was a relief to k   but the artist obviously achieved it only with the greatest reluctance  the work  too  was no longer beautifully finished  above all there seemed to be a lack of gold leaf  pale and uncertain the stroke straggled down  only it turned into a very big letter
it was a j  it was almost finished  and at that moment the artist stamped angrily on the grave mound with one foot so that the soil all around flew up in the air
at long last k
understood him  it was too late to start apologizing now  with all his fingers he dug into the earth which offered almost no resistance  everything seemed prepared beforehand  a thin crust of earth had been constructed only for the look of the thing  immediately beneath it a great hole opened out  with steep sides  into which k
sank  wafted onto his back by a gentle current
and while he was already being received into impenetrable depths  his head still straining upwards on his neck  his own name raced across the stone above him in great flourishes
enchanted by the sight  he woke up
up in the gallery if some frail  consumptive equestrienne in the circus were to be urged around and around on an undulating horse for months on end without respite by a ruthless  whip flourishing ringmaster  before an insatiable public  whizzing along on her horse  throwing kisses  swaying from the waist  and if this performance were likely to continue in the infinite perspective of a drab future to the unceasing roar of the orchestra and hum of the ventilators  accompanied by ebbing and renewed swelling bursts of applause which are really steam hammers    then  perhaps  a young visitor to the gallery might race down the long stairs through all the circles  rush into the ring  and yell  stop  against the fanfares of the orchestra still playing the appropriate music
but since that is not so  a lovely lady  pink and white  floats in between the curtains  which proud lackeys open before her  the ringmaster  deferentially catching her eye  comes toward her breathing animal devotion  tenderly lifts her up on the dapple gray  as if she were his own most precious granddaughter about to start on a dangerous journey  cannot make up his mind to give the signal with his whip  finally masters himself enough to crack the whip loudly  runs along beside the horse  openmouthed  follows with a sharp eye the leaps taken by its rider  finds her artistic skill almost beyond belief  calls to her with english shouts of warning  angrily exhorts the grooms who hold the hoops to be most closely attentive  before the great somersault lifts up his arms and implores the orchestra to be silent  finally lifts the little one down from her trembling horse  kisses her on both cheeks  and finds that all the ovation she gets from the audience is barely sufficient  while she herself  supported by him  right up on the tips of her toes  in a cloud of dust  with outstretched arms and small head thrown back  invites the whole circus to share her triumph    since that is so  the visitor to the gallery lays his face on the rail before him and  sinking into the closing march as into a heavy dream  weeps without knowing it a fratricide the evidence shows that this is how the murder was committed  schmar  the murderer  took up his post about nine o'clock one night in clear moonlight by the corner where wese  his victim  had to turn from the street where his office was into the street he lived in the night air was shivering cold
yet schmar was wearing only a thin blue suit  the jacket was unbuttoned  too
he felt no cold  besides  he was moving about all the time
his weapon  half a bayonet and half a kitchen knife  he kept firmly in his grasp  quite naked
he looked at the knife against the light of the moon  the blade glittered  not enough for schmar  he struck it against the bricks of the pavement till the sparks flew  regretted that  perhaps  and to repair the damage drew it like a violin bow across his boot sole while he bent forward  standing on one leg  and listened both to the whetting of the knife on his boot and for any sound out of the fateful side street
why did pallas  the private citizen who was watching it all from his window nearby in the second storey  permit it to happen  unriddle the mysteries of human nature  with his collar turned up  his dressing gown girt around his portly body  he stood looking down  shaking his head
and five houses further along  on the opposite side of the street  mrs wese  with a fox fur coat over her nightgown  peered out to look for her husband who was lingering unusually late tonight at last there rang out the sound of the doorbell before wese's office  too loud for a doorbell  right over the town and up to heaven  and wese  the industrious nightworker  issued from the building  still invisible in that street  only heralded by the sound of the bell  at once the pavement registered his quiet footsteps
pallas bent far forward  he dared not miss anything
mrs wese  reassured by the bell  shut her window with a clatter but schmar knelt down  since he had no other parts of his body bare  he pressed only his face and his hands against the pavement  where everything else was freezing  schmar was glowing hot
at the very corner dividing the two streets wese paused  only his walking stick came around into the other street to support him
a sudden whim
the night sky invited him  with its dark blue and its gold
unknowing  he gazed up at it  unknowing he lifted his hat and stroked his hair  nothing up there drew together in a pattern to interpret the immediate future for him  everything stayed in its senseless  inscrutable place
in itself it was a highly reasonable action that wese should walk on  but he walked onto schmar's knife
 wese   shrieked schmar  standing on tiptoe  his arm outstretched  the knife sharply lowered   wese  you will never see julia again   and right into the throat and left into the throat and a third time deep into the belly stabbed schmar's knife water rats  slit open  give out such a sound as came from wese
 done   said schmar  and pitched the knife  now superfluous blood stained ballast  against the nearest house front
 the bliss of murder  the relief  the soaring ecstasy from the shedding of another's blood  wese  old nightbird  friend  alehouse crony  you are oozing away into the dark earth below the street
why aren't you simply a bladder of blood so that i could stamp on you and make you vanish into nothingness
not all we want comes true  not all the dreams that blossomed have borne fruit  your solid remains lie here  already indifferent to every kick what's the good of the dumb question you are asking   pallas  choking on the poison in his body  stood at the double leafed door of his house as it flew open
 schmar  schmar  i saw it all  i missed nothing   pallas and schmar scrutinized each other
the result of the scrutiny satisfied pallas  schmar came to no conclusion
mrs wese  with a crowd of people on either side  came rushing up  her face grown quite old with the shock her fur coat swung open  she collapsed on top of wese  the nightgowned body belonged to wese  the fur coat spreading over the couple like the smooth turf of a grave belonged to the crowd
schmar  fighting down with difficulty the last of his nausea  pressed his mouth against the shoulder of the policeman who  stepping lightly  led him away
the next village my grandfather used to say   life is astoundingly short
to me  looking back over it  life seems so foreshortened that i scarcely understand  for instance  how a young man can decide to ride over to the next village without being afraid that    not to mention accidents    even the span of a normal happy life may fall far short of the time needed for such a journey   a visit to a mine today the chief engineers have been down to our part of the mine the management has issued some instructions or other about boring new galleries  and so the engineers arrived to make the initial survey
how young these men are and yet how different from each other  they have all grown up in freedom and show clearly defined characters without self consciousness even in their youth
one  a lively man with black hair  has eyes that take in everything
a second with a notebook makes jottings as he goes  looks around him  compares  notes down
a third  his hands in his coat pockets  so that everything about him is taut  walks very upright  maintains his dignity  only the fact that he keeps biting his lips betrays his impatient  irrepressible youth
a fourth showers explanations on the third  who does not ask for them  smaller than the other  trotting beside him like a temper  his index finger always in the air  he seems to be making a running commentary on everything he sees a fifth  perhaps the senior in rank  suffers no one to accompany him  now he is in front  now behind  the group accommodates its pace to him  he is pallid and frail  responsibility has made his eyes hollow  he often presses his hand to his forehead in thought
the sixth and seventh walk leaning forward a little  their heads close together  arm in arm  in confidential talk  if this were not unmistakably our coal mine and our working station in the deepest gallery  one could easily believe that these bony  cleanshaven  knobbly nosed gentlemen were young clerics
one of them laughs mostly to himself with a catlike purring  the other  smiling too  leads the conversation and beats some kind of time to it with his free hand how sure these two must be of their position  yes  what services must they have already rendered to our mine in spite of their youth  to be able here  on such an important survey  under the eyes of their chief  to devote themselves so unwaveringly to their own affairs  or at least to affairs that have nothing to do with the immediate task  or might it be possible that  in spite of their laughter and apparent inattention  they are very well aware of whatever is needful  one scarcely ventures to pass a decisive judgment on gentlemen like these on the other hand  there is no doubt at all that the eighth man  for instance  is incomparably more intent on his work than these two  indeed more than all the other gentlemen
he has to touch everything and tap it with a little hammer which he keeps taking out of his pocket and putting back again
he often goes down on his knees in the dirt  despite his elegant attire  and taps the ground  then again taps the walls as he walks along or the roof over his head
once he stretched himself out at full length and lay still  we were beginning to think something had gone wrong with him  then with a sudden recoil of his lithe body he sprang to his feet he had only been making another investigation we fancy that we know our mine and its rock formations  but what this engineer can be sounding all the time in such a manner lies beyond our comprehension
a ninth man pushes a kind of perambulator in front of him with the surveying instruments
extremely expensive apparatus  deeply embedded in the softest cotton wool
the office porter ought really to be pushing this vehicle  but he is not trusted with it  an engineer has to do it  and one can see that he does it with good will
he is probably the youngest  perhaps he doesn't even understand all the apparatus yet  but he keeps his eye on the instruments all the time  which brings him often into danger of running his vehicle into the wall
but there is another engineer walking alongside who prevents that from happening
obviously he understands the apparatus thoroughly and seems to be really the man in charge of it from time to time  without stopping the vehicle  he takes up a part of some instrument  peers through it  screws it open or shut  shakes it and taps it  holds it to his ear and listens  and finally  while the man pushing the instruments usually stands still  he lays the small thing  which one can scarcely discern at a distance  back into its packing with great care
this engineer is a little domineering  but only in the service of his instruments
ten paces ahead of the perambulator we have to give way to it at a wordless sign of his finger  even where there is no room for us to make way
behind these two gentlemen stalks the office porter  with nothing to do
the gentlemen  as is to be expected from men of their great knowledge  have long dropped any arrogance they ever had  but the porter seems to have picked it all up and kept it with one hand tucked behind him  the other in front fingering the gilt buttons or fine facecloth of his uniform  he keeps bowing to right and left as if we had saluted him and he were answering  or rather as if he assumed that we had saluted him  he being too high and mighty to see any salutes
of course we do not salute him  yet one could almost believe  to look at him  that it is a great distinction to be a porter at the head office of the mine
behind his back  to be sure  we burst out laughing  but as not even a thunderbolt could make him look around  he remains an unsolved riddle for us to respect
today we shall not do much work  the interruption has been too interesting  such a visit draws away with it all thoughts of work
it is too tempting to stand gazing after the gentlemen as they vanish into the darkness of the trial gallery
besides  our shift will soon come to an end  we shall not be here to see them coming back
jackals and arabs we were camping in the oasis
my companions were asleep
the tall  white figure of an arab passed by  he had been seeing to the camels and was on his way to his own sleeping place
i threw myself on my back in the grass  i tried to fall asleep  i could not  a jackal howled in the distance  i sat up again
and what had been so far away was all at once quite near
jackals were swarming around me  eyes gleaming dull gold and vanishing again  lithe bodies moving nimbly and rhythmically  as if at the crack of a whip
one jackal came from behind me  nudging right under my arm  pressing against me  as if he needed my warmth  and then stood before me and spoke to me almost eye to eye
 i am the oldest jackal far and wide
i am delighted to have met you here at last
i had almost given up hope  since we have been waiting endless years for you  my mother waited for you  and her mother  and all our foremothers right back to the first mother of all the jackals
it is true  believe me    that is surprising   said i  forgetting to kindle the pile of firewood which lay ready to smoke away jackals   that is very surprising for me to hear
it is by pure chance that i have come here from the far north  and i am making only a short tour of your country
what do you jackals want  then   as if emboldened by this perhaps too friendly inquiry the ring of jackals closed in on me  all were panting and openmouthed
 we know   began the eldest   that you have come from the north  that is just what we base our hopes on
you northerners have the kind of intelligence that is not to be found among arabs
not a spark of intelligence  let me tell you  can be struck from their cold arrogance
they kill animals for food  and carrion they despise    not so loud   said i   there are arabs sleeping nearby    you are indeed a stranger here   said the jackal   or you would know that never in the history of the world has any jackal been afraid of an arab
why should we fear them  is it not misfortune enough for us to be exiled among such creatures    maybe  maybe   said i   matters so far outside my province i am not competent to judge  it seems to me a very old quarrel  i suppose it's in the blood  and perhaps will only end with it    you are very clever   said the old jackal  and they all began to pant more quickly  the air pumped out of their lungs although they were statiding still  a rank smell which at times i had to set my teeth to endure streamed from their open jaws   you are very clever  what you have just said agrees with our old tradition so we shall draw blood from them and the quarrel will be over    oh   said i  more vehemently than i intended   they'll defend themselves  they'll shoot you down in dozens with their muskets    you misunderstand us   said he   a human failing which persists apparently even in the far north we're not proposing to kill them
all the water in the nile couldn't cleanse us of that
why  the mere sight of their living flesh makes us turn tail and flee into cleaner air  into the desert  which for that very reason is our home   and all the jackals around  including many newcomers from farther away  dropped their muzzles between their forelegs and wiped them with their paws  it was as if they were trying to conceal a disgust so overpowering that i felt like leaping over their heads to get away
 then what are you proposing to do   i asked  trying to rise to my feet  but i could not get up  two young beasts behind me had locked their teeth through my coat and shirt  i had to go on sitting
 these are your trainbearers   explained the old jackal  quite seriously   a mark of honor    they must let go   i cried  turning now to the old jackal  now to the youngsters
 they will  of course   said the old one   if that is your wish
but it will take a little time  for they have got their teeth well in  as is our custom  and must first loosen their jaws bit by bit
meanwhile  give ear to our petition    your conduct hasn't exactly inclined me to grant it   said i
 don't hold it against us that we are clumsy   said he  and now for the first time had recourse to the natural plaintiveness of his voice   we are poor creatures  we have nothing but our teeth  whatever we want to do  good or bad  we can tackle it only with our teeth    well  what do you want   i asked  not much mollified  sir   he cried  and all the jackals howled together  very remotely it seemed to resemble a melody
 sir  we want you to end this quarrel that divides the world
you are exactly the man whom our ancestors foretold as born to do it
we want to be troubled no more by arabs  room to breathe  a skyline cleansed of them  no more bleating of sheep knifed by an arab  every beast to die a natural death  no interference till we have drained the carcass empty and picked its bones clean
cleanliness  nothing but cleanliness is what we want     and now they were all lamenting and sobbing     how can you bear to live in such a world  o noble heart and kindly bowels  filth is their white  filth is their black  their beards are a horror  the very sight of their eye sockets makes one want to spit  and when they lift an arm  the murk of hell yawns in the armpit
and so  sir  and so  dear sir  by means of your all powerful hands slit their throats through with these scissors   and in answer to a jerk of his head a jackal came trotting up with a small pair of sewing scissors  covered with ancient rust  dangling from an eyetooth
 well  here's the scissors at last  and high time to stop   cried the arab leader of our caravan who had crept upwind toward us and now cracked his great whip
the jackals fled in haste  but at some little distance rallied in a close huddle  all the brutes so tightly packed and rigid that they looked as if penned in a small fold girt by flickering will o' the wisps
 so you've been treated to this entertainment too  sir   said the arab  laughing as gaily as the reserve of his race permitted
 you know  then  what the brutes are after   i asked
 of course   said he   it's common knowledge  so long as arabs exist  that pair of scissors goes wandering through the desert and will wander with us to the end of our days
every european is offered it for the great work  every european is just the man that fate has chosen for them
they have the most lunatic hopes  these beasts  they're just fools  utter fools
that's why we like them  they are our dogs  finer dogs than any of yours
watch this  now  a camel died last night and i have had it brought here   four men came up with the heavy carcass and threw it down before us
it had hardly touched the ground before the jackals lifted up their voices
as if irresistibly drawn by cords each of them began to waver forward  crawling on his belly
they had forgotten the arabs  forgotten their hatred  the all obliterating immediate presence of the stinking carrion bewitched them
one was already at the camel's throat  sinking his teeth straight into an artery
like a vehement small pump endeavoring with as much determination as hopefulness to extinguish some raging fire  every muscle in his body twitched and labored at the task
in a trice they were all on top of the carcass  laboring in common  piled mountain high
and now the caravan leader lashed his cutting whip crisscross over their backs
they lifted their heads  half swooning in ecstasy  saw the arabs standing before them  felt the sting of the whip on their muzzles  leaped and ran backwards a stretch but the camel's blood was already lying in pools  reeking to heaven  the carcass was torn wide open in many places
they could not resist it  they were back again  once more the leader lifted his whip  i stayed his arm
 you are right  sir   said he   we'll leave them to their business  besides  it's time to break camp
well  you've seen them
marvelous creatures  aren't they  and how they hate us   the bridge i was stiff and cold  i was a bridge  i lay over a ravine
my toes on one side  my fingers clutching the other  i had clamped myself fast into the crumbling clay
the tails of my coat fluttered at my sides
far below brawled the icy trout stream
no tourist strayed to this impassable height  the bridge was not yet traced on any map
so i lay and waited  i could only wait
without falling  no bridge  once spanned  can cease to be a bridge
it was toward evening one day    was it the first  was it the thousandth  i cannot tell    my thoughts were always in confusion and perpetually moving in a circle
it was toward evening in summer  the roar of the stream had grown deeper  when i heard the sound of a human step  to me  to me
straighten yourself  bridge  make ready  railless beams  to hold up the passenger entrusted to you if his steps are uncertain  steady them unobtrusively  but if he stumbles show what you are made of and like a mountain god hurl him across to land
he came  he tapped me with the iron point of his stick  then he lifted my coattails with it and put them in order upon me
he plunged the point of his stick into my bushy hair and let it lie there for a long time  forgetting me no doubt while he wildly gazed around him
but then    i was just following him in thought over mountain and valley    he jumped with both feet on the middle of my body
i shuddered with wild pain  not knowing what was happening
who was it  a child  a dream  a wayfarer  a suicide  a tempter  a destroyer  and i turned around so as to see him
a bridge to turn around  i had not yet turned quite around when i already began to fall  i fell and in a moment i was torn and transpierced by the sharp rocks which had always gazed up at me so peacefully from the rushing water
the bucket rider coal all spent  the bucket empty  the shovel useless  the stove breathing out cold  the room freezing  the trees outside the window rigid  covered with rime  the sky a silver shield against anyone who looks for help from it
i must have coal  i cannot freeze to death  behind me is the pitiless stove  before me the pitiless sky  so i must ride out between them and on my journey seek aid from the coaldealer
but he has already grown deaf to ordinary appeals  i must prove irrefutably to him that i have not a single grain of coal left  and that he means to me the very sun in the firmament
i must approach like a beggar  who  with the death rattle already in his throat  insists on dying on the doorstep  and to whom the cook accordingly decides to give the dregs of the coffeepot  just so must the coaldealer  filled with rage  but acknowledging the command  thou shalt not kill   fling a shovelful of coal into my bucket
my mode of arrival must decide the matter  so i ride off on the bucket
seated on the bucket  my hands on the handle  the simplest kind of bridle  i propel myself with difficulty down the stairs  but once downstairs my bucket ascends  superbly  superbly  camels humbly squatting on the ground do not rise with more dignity  shaking themselves under the sticks of their drivers through the hard frozen streets we go at a regular canter  often i am upraised as high as the first storey of a house  never do i sink as low as the house doors
and at last i float at an extraordinary height above the vaulted cellar of the dealer  whom i see far below crouching over his table  where he is writing  he has opened the door to let out the excessive heat
 coaldealer   i cry in a voice burned hollow by the frost and muffled in the cloud made by my breath   please  coaldealer  give me a little coal
my bucket is so light that i can ride on it
be kind
when i can i'll pay you   the dealer puts his hand to his ear
 do i hear right   he throws the question over his shoulder to his wife
 do i hear right  a customer    i hear nothing   says his wife  breathing in and out peacefully while she knits on  her back pleasantly warmed by the heat
 oh yes  you must hear   i cry
 it's me  an old customer  faithful and true  only without means at the moment    wife   says the dealer   it's someone  it must be  my ears can't have deceived me so much as that  it must be an old  a very old customer  that can move me so deeply    what ails you  man   says his wife  ceasing from her work for a moment and pressing her knitting to her bosom
 it's nobody  the street is empty  all our customers are provided for  we could close down the shop for several days and take a rest    but i'm sitting up here on the bucket   i cry  and numb  frozen tears dim my eyes   please look up here  just once  you'll see me directly  i beg you  just a shovelful  and if you give me more it'll make me so happy that i won't know what to do
all the other customers are provided for
oh  if i could only hear the coal clattering into the bucket    i'm coming   says the coaldealer  and on his short legs he makes to climb the steps of the cellar  but his wife is already beside him  holds him back by the arm and says   you stay here  seeing you persist in your fancies i'll go myself
think of the bad fit of coughing you had during the night
but for a piece of business  even if it's one you've only fancied in your head  you're prepared to forget your wife and child and sacrifice your lungs
i'll go    then be sure to tell him all the kinds of coal we have in stock  i'll shout out the prices after you    right   says his wife  climbing up to the street
naturally she sees me at once
 frau coaldealer   i cry   my humblest greetings  just one shovelful of coal  here in my bucket  i'll carry it home myself
one shovelful of the worst you have
i'll pay you in full for it  of course  but not just now  not just now   what a knell like sound the words  not just now  have  and how bewilderingly they mingle with the evening chimes that fall from the church steeple nearby   well  what does he want   shouts the dealer
 nothing   his wife shouts back   there's nothing here  i see nothing  i hear nothing  only six striking  and now we must shut up the shop
the cold is terrible  tomorrow we'll likely have lots to do again   she sees nothing and hears nothing  but all the same she loosens her apron strings and waves her apron to waft me away
she succeeds  unluckily
my bucket has all the virtues of a good steed except powers of resistance  which it has not  it is too light  a woman's apron can make it fly through the air
 you bad woman   i shout back  while she  turning into the shop  halfcontemptuous  half reassured  flourishes her fist in the air
 you bad woman  i begged you for a shovelful of the worst coal and you would not give it me   and with that i ascend into the regions of the ice mountains and am lost forever
the new advocate we have a new advocate  dr
bucephalus
there is little in his appearance to remind you that he was once alexander of macedon's battle charger
of course  if you know his story  you are aware of something
but even a simple usher whom i saw the other day on the front steps of the law courts  a man with the professional appraisal of the regular small bettor at a racecourse  was running an admiring eye over the advocate as he mounted the marble steps with a high action that made them ring beneath his feet
in general the bar approves the admission of bucephalus
with astonishing insight people tell themselves that  modern society being what it is  bucephalus is in a difficult position  and therefore  considering also his importance in the history of the world  he deserves at least a friendly reception nowadays    it cannot be denied    there is no alexander the great
there are plenty of men who know how to murder people  the skill needed to reach over a banqueting table and pink a friend with a lance is not lacking  and for many macedonia is too confining  so that they curse philip  the father    but no one  no one at all  can blaze a trail to india
even in his day the gates of india were beyond reach  yet the king's sword pointed the way to them
today the gates have receded to remoter and loftier places  no one points the way  many carry swords  but only to brandish them  and the eye that tries to follow them is confused
so perhaps it is really best to do as bucephalus has done and absorb oneself in law books
in the quiet lamplight  his flanks unhampered by the thighs of a rider  free an old manuscript it looks as if much had been neglected in our country's system of defense
we have not concerned ourselves with it until now and have gone about our daily work  but things that have been happening recently begin to trouble us
i have a cobbler's workshop in the square that lies before the emperor's palace
scarcely have i taken my shutters down  at the first glimmer of dawn  when i see armed soldiers already posted in the mouth of every street opening on the square
but these soldiers are not ours  they are obviously nomads from the north
in some way that is incomprehensible to me they have pushed right into the capital  although it is a long way from the frontier
at any rate  here they are  it seems that every morning there are more of them as is their nature  they camp under the open sky  for they abominate dwelling houses
they busy themselves sharpening swords  whittling arrows  and practicing horsemanship this peaceful square  which was always kept so scrupulously clean  they have made literally into a stable
we do try every now and then to run out of our shops and clear away at least the worst of the filth  but this happens less and less often  for the labor is in vain and brings us besides into danger of falling under the hoofs of the wild horses or of being crippled with lashes from the whips
speech with the nomads is impossible
they do not know our language  indeed they hardly have a language of their own
they communicate with each other much as jackdaws do
a screeching as of jackdaws is always in our ears
our way of living and our institutions they neither understand nor care to understand
and so they are unwilling to make sense even out of our sign language
you can gesture at them till you dislocate your jaws and your wrists and still they will not have understood you and will never understand
they often make grimaces  then the whites of their eyes turn up and foam gathers on their lips  but they do not mean anything by that  not even a threat  they do it because it is their nature to do it
whatever they need  they take
you cannot call it taking by force
they grab at something and you simply stand aside and leave them to it
from my stock  too  they have taken many good articles
but i cannot complain when i see how the butcher  for instance  suffers across the street
as soon as he brings in any meat the nomads snatch it all from him and gobble it up
even their horses devour flesh  often enough a horseman and his horse are lying side by side  both of them gnawing at the same joint  one at either end
the butcher is nervous and does not dare to stop his deliveries of meat
we understand that  however  and subscribe money to keep him going
if the nomads got no meat  who knows what they might think of doing  who knows anyhow what they may think of  even though they get meat every day
not long ago the butcher thought he might at least spare himself the trouble of slaughtering  and so one morning he brought along a live ox but he will never dare to do that again
i lay for a whole hour flat on the floor at the back of my workshop with my head muffled in all the clothes and rugs and pillows i had simply to keep from hearing the bellowing of that ox  which the nomads were leaping on from all sides  tearing morsels out of its living flesh with their teeth
it had been quiet for a long time before i risked coming out  they were lying overcome around the remains of the carcass like drunkards around a wine cask
this was the occasion when i fancied i actually saw the emperor himself at a window of the palace  usually he never enters these outer rooms but spends all his time in the innermost garden  yet on this occasion he was standing  or so at least it seemed to me  at one of the windows  watching with bent head the goings on before his residence  what is going to happen   we all ask ourselves
 how long can we endure this burden and torment  the emperor's palace has drawn the nomads here but does not know how to drive them away again
the gate stays shut  the guards  who used to be always marching out and in with ceremony  keep close behind barred windows
it is left to us artisans and tradesmen to save our country  but we are not equal to such a task  nor have we ever claimed to be capable of it
this is a misunderstanding of some kind  and it will be the ruin of us   the knock at the manor gate it was summer  a hot day
with my sister i was passing the gate of a great house on our way home
i cannot tell now whether she knocked on the gate out of mischief or out of absence of mind  or merely threatened it with her fist and did not knock at all
a hundred paces further on along the road  which here turned to the left  began the village
we did not know it very well  but no sooner had we passed the first house when people appeared and made friendly or warning signs to us  they were themselves apparently terrified  bowed down with terror they pointed toward the manor house that we had passed and reminded us of the knock on the gate
the proprietor of the manor would charge us with it  the interrogation would begin immediately
i remained quite calm and also tried to calm my sister's fears
probably she had not struck the door at all  and if she had  nowhere in the world would that be a reason for prosecution
i tried to make this clear to the people around us  they listened to me but refrained from passing any opinion
later they told me that not only my sister  but i too  as her brother  would be charged
i nodded and smiled
we all gazed back at the manor  as one watches a distant smoke cloud and waits for the flames to appear
and right enough we presently saw horsemen riding in through the wide open gate
dust rose  concealing everything  only the tops of the tall spears glittered
and hardly had the troop vanished into the manor courtyard before they seemed to have turned their horses again  for they were already on their way to us
i urged my sister to leave me  i myself would set everything right
she refused to leave me
i told her that she should at least change  so as to appear in better clothes before these gentlemen
at last she obeyed and set out on the long road to our home
already the horsemen were beside us  and even before dismounting they inquired after my sister
she wasn't here at the moment  was the apprehensive reply  but she would come later
the answer was received almost with indifference  the important thing seemed their having found me
the chief members of the party appeared to be a young lively fellow  who was a judge  and his silent assistant  who was called assmann
i was asked to enter the farmhouse
shaking my head and hitching up my trousers  i slowly began to move  while the sharp eyes of the party scrutinized me
i still half believed that a word would be enough to free me  a city man  and with honor too  from this peasant folk
but when i had stepped over the threshold of the parlor the judge  who had hastened in front and was already awaiting me  said   i'm really sorry for this man   and it was beyond all possibility of doubt that by this he did not mean my present state  but something that was to happen to me
the room looked more like a prison cell than the parlor of a farmhouse
great stone flags on the floor  dark  quite bare walls  into one of which an iron ring was fixed  in the middle something that looked half a pallet  half an operating table
could i still endure any other air than prison air  that is the great question  or rather it would be if i still had any prospect of release
eleven sons i have eleven sons
the first is outwardly very plain  but serious and clever  yet  although i love him as i love all my children  i do not rate him very highly
his mental processes seem to me to be too simple
he looks neither to right nor to left  nor into the far distance  he runs around all the time  or rather revolves  within his own little circle of thoughts
the second is handsome  slim  well made  one draws one's breath with delight to watch him with a fencing foil
he is clever too  but has experience of the world as well  he has seen much  and therefore even our native country seems to yield more secrets to him than to the stay at home yet i am sure that this advantage is not only and not even essentially due to his travels  it is rather an attribute of his own inimitable nature  which is acknowledged for instance by everyone who has ever tried to copy him in  let us say  the fancy high dive he does into the water  somersaulting several times over  yet with almost violent self control
to the very end of the springboard the emulator keeps up his courage and his desire to follow  but at that point  instead of leaping into the air  he sits down suddenly and lifts his arms in excuse    and despite all this (i ought really to feel blessed with such a son) my attachment to him is not untroubled
his left eye is a little smaller than his right and blinks a good deal  only a small fault  certainly  and one which even lends more audacity to his face than it would otherwise have  nor  considering his unapproachable self sufficiency  would anyone think of noticing and finding fault with this smaller eye and the way it blinks
yet i  his father  do so
of course  it is not the physical blemish that worries me  but a small irregularity of the spirit that somehow corresponds to it  a kind of stray poison in the blood  a kind of inability to develop to the full the potentialities of his nature which i alone can see
on the other hand  this is just what makes him again my own true son  for this fault of his is a fault of our whole family and in him it is only too apparent
my third son is handsome too  but not in a way that i appreciate
he has the good looks of a singer  the curving lips  the dreaming eye  the kind of head that asks for drapery behind it to make it effective  the too deeply arched chest  hands that are quick to fly up and much too quick to fall limp  legs that move delicately because they cannot support a weight
and besides  the tone of his voice is not round and full  it takes you in for a moment  the connoisseur pricks up his ears  but almost at once its breath gives out
   although  in general  everything tempts me to bring this son of mine into the limelight  i prefer to keep him in the background  he himself is not insistent  yet not because he is aware of his shortcomings but out of innocence moreover  he does not feel at home in our age  as if he admitted belonging to our family  yet knew that he belonged also to another which he has lost forever  he is often melancholy and nothing can cheer him
my fourth son is perhaps the most companionable of all
a true child of his age  he is understood by everyone  he stands on what is common ground to all men  and everyone feels inclined to give him a nod
perhaps this universal appreciation is what makes his nature rather facile  his movements rather free  his judgments rather unconcerned
many of his remarks are worth quoting over and over again  but by no means all of them  for by and large his extreme facility becomes irritating
he is like a man who makes a wonderful take off from the ground  cleaves the air like a swallow  and after all comes down helplessly in a desert waste  a nothing
such reflections gall me when i look at him
my fifth son is kind and good  promised less than he performed  used to be so insignificant that one literally felt alone in his presence  but has achieved a certain reputation
if i were asked how this came about  i could hardly tell you
perhaps innocence makes its way easiest through the elemental chaos of this world  and innocent he certainly is
perhaps too innocent
friendly to everyone
perhaps too friendly
i confess  i don't feel comfortable when i hear him praised
it seems to make praise rather too cheap to bestow it on anyone so obviously praiseworthy as this son of mine my sixth son seems  at first glance anyhow  the most thoughtful of all he is given to hanging his head  and yet he is a great talker
so he is not easy to get at
if he is on the down grade  he falls into impenetrable melancholy  if he is in the ascendant  he maintains his advantage by sheer talk
yet i grant him a certain self forgetful passionate absorption  in the full light of day he often fights his way through a tangle of thoughts as if in a dream
without being ill    his health on the contrary is very good    he sometimes staggers  especially in the twilight  but he needs no help  he never falls
perhaps his physical growth is the cause of this phenomenon  he is much too tall for his age
that makes him look ugly in general  although he has remarkable beauty in detail  in hands and feet  for instance
his forehead  too  is ugly  both its skin and its bone formation are somehow arrested in their development
the seventh son belongs to me perhaps more than all the others
the world would not know how to appreciate him  it does not understand his peculiar brand of wit
i do not overvalue him  i know he is of little enough importance  if the world had no other fault than that of not appreciating him  it would still be blameless
but within the family circle i should not care to be without this son of mine
he contributes a certain restlessness as well as a reverence for tradition  and combines them both  at least that is how i feel it  into an incontestable whole
true  he knows less than anyone what to do with this achievement  the wheel of the future will never be started rolling by him  but his disposition is so stimulating  so rich in hope  i wish that he had children and children's children
unfortunately he does not seem inclined to fulfill my wish
with a self satisfaction that i understand as much as i deplore  and which stands in magnificent contrast to the verdict of the world  he goes everywhere alone  pays no attention to girls  and yet will never lose his good humor
my eighth son is my child of sorrow  and i do not really know why
he keeps me at a distance and yet i feel a close paternal tie binding me to him
time has done much to lessen the pain  but once i used often to tremble at the mere thought of him
he goes his own way  he has broken off all communication with me  and certainly with his hard head  his small athletic body    only his legs were rather frail when he was a boy  but perhaps that has meanwhile righted itself    he will make a success of anything he chooses
many a time i used to want to call him back  to ask him how things really were with him  why he cut himself off so completely from his father  and what his fundamental purpose was in life  but now he is so far away and so much time has passed that things had better stay as they are i hear that he is the only one of my sons to grow a full beard  that cannot look well  of course  on a man so small as he is
my ninth son is very elegant and has what women consider a definitely melting eye
so melting that there are occasions when he can cajole even me  although i know that a wet sponge is literally enough to wipe away all that unearthly brilliance
but the curious thing about the boy is that he makes no attempt to be seductive  he would be content to spend his life lying on the sofa and wasting his glances on the ceiling  or still better  keeping them to himself under his eyelids when he is lying in this favorite position  he enjoys talking and talks quite well  concisely and pithily  but still only within narrow limits  once he oversteps these  which he cannot avoid doing since they are so narrow  what he says is quite empty
one would sign him to stop  if one had any hope that such slumbrous eyes were even aware of the gesture
my tenth son is supposed to be an insincere character
i shall not entirely deny or confirm this supposition
certainly anyone who sees him approaching with the pomposity of a man twice his age  in a frock coat always tightly buttoned  an old but meticulously brushed black hat  with an expressionless face  slightly jutting chin  protruding eyelids that mask the light behind them  two fingers very often at his lips    anyone seeing him thus is bound to think  what an utter hypocrite
but then  just listen to him talking  with understanding  thoughtfully  brusquely  cutting across questions with satirical vivacity  in complete accord with the universe  an accord that is surprising  natural and gay  an accord that of necessity straightens the neck and makes the body proud
many who think themselves very clever and for this reason  as they fancied  felt a dislike for his outward appearance  have become strongly attached to him because of his conversation there are other people  again  who are unaffected by his appearance but who find his conversation hypocritical
i  being his father  will not pronounce a verdict  but i must admit that the latter critics are at least to be taken more seriously than the former
my eleventh son is delicate  probably the frailest of my sons  but deceptive in his weakness  for at times he can be strong and resolute  though even then there is somehow always an underlying weakness
yet it is not a weakness to be ashamed of  merely something that appears as weakness only on this solid earth of ours
for instance  is not a readiness for flight a kind of weakness too  since it consists in a wavering  an unsteadiness  a fluttering  something of that nature characterizes my son
these are not  of course  the characteristics to rejoice a father  they tend obviously to destroy a family
sometimes he looks at me as if he would say   i shall take you with me  father   then i think   you are the last person i would trust myself to   and again his look seems to say   then let me be at least the last   these are my eleven sons my neighbor my business rests entirely on my own shoulders
two girl clerks with typewriters and ledgers in the anteroom  my own room with writing desk  safe  consulting table  easy chair  and telephone  such is my entire working apparatus
so simple to control  so easy to direct
i'm quite young  and lots of business comes my way
i don't complain  i don't complain
at the beginning of the year a young man snapped up the empty premises next to mine  which very foolishly i had hesitated to rent until it was too late
they also consist of a room and an anteroom  with a kitchen  however  thrown in    the room and anteroom i would certainly have found some use for  my two girl clerks feel somewhat overdriven as it is    but what use would a kitchen have been to me  this petty consideration was solely responsible for my allowing the premises to be snatched from under my nose
now that young man sits there
harras  his name is
what he actually does there i have no idea
on the door is a sign   harras bureau   i have made inquiries and i am told it is a business similar to mine
one can't exactly warn people against extending the fellow credit  for after all he is a young and pushing man who probably has a future  yet one can't go so far as to advise it  for by all appearances he has no assets yet
the usual thing said by people who don't know
sometimes i meet harras on the stairs  he seems always to be in an extraordinary hurry  for he literally shoots past me i have never got a good look at him yet  for his office key is always in his hand when he passes me
in a trice he has the door open
like the tail of a rat he has slipped through and i'm left standing again before the sign  harras bureau   which i have read already far oftener than it deserves
the wretchedly thin walls betray the honorable and capable man  but shield the dishonest my telephone is fixed to the wall that separates me from my neighbor
but i single that out merely as a particularly ironical circumstance for even if it hung on the opposite wall  everything could be heard in the next room
i have accustomed myself to refrain from naming the names of my customers when speaking on the telephone to them
but of course it does not need much skill to guess the names from characteristic but unavoidable turns of the conversation
sometimes i absolutely dance with apprehension around the telephone  the receiver at my ear  and yet can't help divulging secrets
because of all this my business decisions have naturally become unsure  my voice nervous
what is harras doing while i am telephoning  if i wanted to exaggerate    and one must often do that so as to make things clear in one's mind    i might assert that harras does not require a telephone  he uses mine  he pushes his sofa against the wall and listens  while i at the other side must fly to the telephone  listen to all the requests of my customers  come to difficult and grave decisions  carry out long calculations    but worst of all  during all this time  involuntarily give harras valuable information through the wall
perhaps he doesn't wait even for the end of the conversation  but gets up at the point where the matter has become clear to him  flies through the town with his usual haste  and  before i have hung up the receiver  is already at his goal working against me
a crossbreed [a sport] i have a curious animal  half kitten  half lamb
it is a legacy from my father
but it only developed in my time  formerly it was far more lamb than kitten
now it is both in about equal parts
from the cat it takes its head and claws  from the lamb its size and shape  from both its eyes  which are wild and flickering  its hair  which is soft  lying close to its body  its movements  which partake both of skipping and slinking
lying on the window sill in the sun it curls up in a ball and purrs  out in the meadow it rushes about like mad and is scarcely to be caught
it flees from cats and makes to attack lambs
on moonlight nights its favorite promenade is along the eaves
it cannot mew and it loathes rats
beside the hen coop it can lie for hours in ambush  but it has never yet seized an opportunity for murder
i feed it on milk  that seems to suit it best in long draughts it sucks the milk in through its fanglike teeth
naturally it is a great source of entertainment for children
sunday morning is the visiting hour
i sit with the little beast on my knees  and the children of the whole neighborhood stand around me
then the strangest questions are asked  which no human being could answer  why there is only one such animal  why i rather than anybody else should own it  whether there was ever an animal like it before and what would happen if it died  whether it feels lonely  why it has no children  what it is called  etc i never trouble to answer  but confine myself without further explanation to exhibiting my possession
sometimes the children bring cats with them  once they actually brought two lambs
but against all their hopes there was no scene of recognition
the animals gazed calmly at each other with their animal eyes  and obviously accepted their reciprocal existence as a divine fact
sitting on my knees  the beast knows neither fear nor lust of pursuit
pressed against me it is happiest
it remains faithful to the family that brought it up
in that there is certainly no extraordinary mark of fidelity  but merely the true instinct of an animal which  though it has countless step relations in the world  has perhaps not a single blood relation  and to which consequently the protection it has found with us is sacred
sometimes i cannot help laughing when it sniffs around me and winds itself between my legs and simply will not be parted from me
not content with being lamb and cat  it almost insists on being a dog as well
once when  as may happen to anyone  i could see no way out of my business problems and all that they involved  and was ready to let everything go  and in this mood was lying in my rocking chair in my room  the beast on my knees  i happened to glance down and saw tears dropping from its huge whiskers were they mine  or were they the animal's  had this cat  along with the soul of a lamb  the ambitions of a human being  i did not inherit much from my father  but this legacy is quite remarkable
it has the restlessness of both beasts  that of the cat and that of the lamb  diverse as they are
for that reason its skin feels too tight for it
sometimes it jumps up on the armchair beside me  plants its front legs on my shoulder  and put its muzzle to my ear
it is as if it were saying something to me  and as a matter of fact it turns its head afterwards and gazes in my face to see the impression its communication has made
and to oblige it i behave as if i had understood  and nod
then it jumps to the floor and dances about with joy
perhaps the knife of the butcher would be a release for this animal  but as it is a legacy i must deny it that
so it must wait until the breath voluntarily leaves its body  even though it sometimes gazes at me with a look of human understanding  challenging me to do the thing of which both of us are thinking
the cares of a family man some say the word odradek is of slavonic origin  and try to account for it on that basis
others again believe it to be of german origin  only influenced by slavonic
the uncertainty of both interpretations allows one to assume with justice that neither is accurate  especially as neither of them provides an intelligent meaning of the word
no one  of course  would occupy himself with such studies if there were not a creature called odradek at first glance it looks like a flat star shaped spool for thread  and indeed it does seem to have thread wound upon it  to be sure  they are only old  broken off bits of thread  knotted and tangled together  of the most varied sorts and colors
but it is not only a spool  for a small wooden crossbar sticks out of the middle of the star  and another small rod is joined to that at a right angle
by means of this latter rod on one side and one of the points of the star on the other  the whole thing can stand upright as if on two legs
one is tempted to believe that the creature once had some sort of intelligible shape and is now only a broken down remnant
yet this does not seem to be the case  at least there is no sign of it  nowhere is there an unfinished or unbroken surface to suggest anything of the kind  the whole thing looks senseless enough  but in its own way perfectly finished
in any case  closer scrutiny is impossible  since odradek is extraordinarily nimble and can never be laid hold of
he lurks by turns in the garret  the stairway  the lobbies  the entrance hall
often for months on end he is not to be seen  then he has presumably moved into other houses  but he always comes faithfully back to our house again
many a time when you go out of the door and he happens just to be leaning directly beneath you against the banisters you feel inclined to speak to him
of course  you put no difficult questions to him  you treat him    he is so diminutive that you cannot help it    rather like a child
 well  what's your name   you ask him
 odradek   he says
 and where do you live    no fixed abode   he says and laughs  but it is only the kind of laughter that has no lungs behind it
it sounds rather like the rustling of fallen leaves
and that is usually the end of the conversation
even these answers are not always forthcoming  often he stays mute for a long time  as wooden as his appearance
i ask myself  to no purpose  what is likely to happen to him  can he possibly die  anything that dies has had some kind of aim in life  s6me kind of activity  which has worn out  but that does not apply to odradek
am i to suppose  then  that he will always be rolling down the stairs  with ends of thread trailing after him  right before the feet of my children  and my children's children  he does no harm to anyone that one can see  but the idea that he is likely to survive me i find almost painful

the truth about sancho panza without making any boast of it sancho panza succeeded in the course of years  by feeding him a great number of romances of chivalry and adventure in the evening and night hours  in so diverting from himself his demon  whom he later called don quixote  that this demon thereupon set out  uninhibited  on the maddest exploits  which  however  for the lack of a preordained object  which should have been sancho panza himself  harmed nobody a free man  sancho panza philosophically followed don quixote on his crusades  perhaps out of a sense of responsibility  and had of them a great and edifying entertainment to the end of his days
the silence of the sirens proof that inadequate  even childish measures may serve to rescue one from peril  to protect himself from the sirens ulysses stopped his ears with wax and had himself bound to the mast of his ship naturally any and every traveler before him could have done the same  except those whom the sirens allured even from a great distance  but it was known to all the world that such things were of no help whatever
the song of the sirens could pierce through everything  and the longing of those they seduced would have broken far stronger bonds than chains and masts
but ulysses did not think of that  although he had probably heard of it
he trusted absolutely to his handful of wax and his fathom of chain  and in innocent elation over his little stratagem sailed out to meet the sirens
now the sirens have a still more fatal weapon than their song  namely their silence
and though admittedly such a thing has never happened  still it is conceivable that someone might possibly have escaped from their singing  but from their silence certainly never
against the feeling of having triumphed over them by one's own strength  and the consequent exaltation that bears down everything before it  no earthly powers can resist
and when ulysses approached them the potent songstresses actually did not sing  whether because they thought that this enemy could be vanquished only by their silence  or because the look of bliss on the face of ulysses  who was thinking of nothing but his wax and his chains  made them forget their singing
but ulysses  if one may so express it  did not hear their silence  he thought they were singing and that he alone did not hear them
for a fleeting moment he saw their throats rising and falling  their breasts lifting  their eyes filled with tears  their lips halfparted  but believed that these were accompaniments to the airs which died unheard around him
soon  however  all this faded from his sight as he fixed his gaze on the distance  the sirens literally vanished before his resolution  and at the very moment when they were nearest to him he knew of them no longer
but they    lovelier than ever    stretched their necks and turned  let their awesome hair flutter free in the wind  and freely stretched their claws on the rocks they no longer had any desire to allure  all that they wanted was to hold as long as they could the radiance that fell from ulysses' great eyes
if the sirens had possessed consciousness they would have been annihilated at that moment
but they remained as they had been  all that had happened was that ulysses had escaped them
a codicil to the foregoing has also been handed down
ulysses  it is said  was so full of guile  was such a fox  that not even the goddess of fate could pierce his armor
perhaps he had really noticed  although here the human understanding is beyond its depths  that the sirens were silent  and held up to them and to the gods the aforementioned pretense merely as a sort of shield
prometheus there are four legends concerning prometheus  according to the first he was clamped to a rock in the caucasus for betraying the secrets of the gods to men  and the gods sent eagles to feed on his liver  which was perpetually renewed
according to the second prometheus  goaded by the pain of the tearing beaks  pressed himself deeper and deeper into the rock until he became one with it according to the third his treachery was forgotten in the course of thousands of years  forgotten by the gods  the eagles  forgotten by himself according to the fourth everyone grew weary of the meaningless affair
the gods grew weary  the eagles grew weary  the wound closed wearily
there remained the inexplicable mass of rock
the legend tried to explain the inexplicable
as it came out of a substratum of truth it had in turn to end in the inexplicable
the city coat of arms at first all the arrangements for building the tower of babel were characterized by fairly good order  indeed the order was perhaps too perfect  too much thought was given to guides  interpreters  accommodations for the workmen  and roads of communication  as if there were centuries before one to do the work in in fact  the general opinion at that time was that one simply could not build too slowly  a very little insistence on this would have sufficed to make one hesitate to lay the foundations at all
people argued in this way  the essential thing in the whole business is the idea of building a tower that will reach to heaven
in comparison with that idea everything else is secondary
the idea  once seized in its magnitude  can never vanish again  so long as there are men on the earth there will be also the irresistible desire to complete the building
that being so  however  one need have no anxiety about the future  on the contrary  human knowledge is increasing  the art of building has made progress and will make further progress  a piece of work which takes us a year may perhaps be done in half the time in another hundred years  and better done  too  more enduringly
so why exert oneself to the extreme limit of one's present powers  there would be some sense in doing that only if it were likely that the tower could be completed in one generation
but that is beyond all hope
it is far more likely that the next generation with their perfected knowledge will find the work of their predecessors bad  and tear down what has been built so as to begin anew
such thoughts paralyzed people's powers  and so they troubled less about the tower than the construction of a city for the workmen
every nationality wanted the finest quarter for itself  and this gave rise to disputes  which developed into bloody conflicts
these conflicts never came to an end  to the leaders they were a new proof that  in the absence of the necessary unity  the building of the tower must be done very slowly  or indeed preferably postponed until universal peace was declared
but the time was spent not only in conflict  the town was embellished in the intervals  and this unfortunately enough evoked fresh envy and fresh conflict
in this fashion the age of the first generation went past  but none of the succeeding ones showed any difference  except that technical skill increased and with it occasion for conflict
to this must be added that the second or third generation had already recognized the senselessness of building a heaven reaching tower  but by that time everybody was too deeply involved to leave the city
all the legends and songs that came to birth in that city are filled with longing for a prophesied day when the city would be destroyed by five successive blows from a gigantic fist
it is for that reason too that the city has a closed fist on its coat of arms poseidon poseidon sat at his desk  going over the accounts
the administration of all the waters gave him endless work
he could have had as many assistants as he wanted  and indeed he had quite a number  but since he took his job very seriously he insisted on going through all the accounts again himself  and so his assistants were of little help to him it cannot be said that he enjoyed the work  he carried it out simply because it was assigned to him  indeed he had frequently applied for what he called more cheerful work  but whenever various suggestions were put to him it turned out that nothing suited him so well as his present employment
needless to say  it was very difficult to find him another job
after all  he could not possibly be put in charge of one particular ocean
quite apart from the fact that in this case the work involved would not be less  only more petty  the great poseidon could hold only a superior position
and when he was offered a post unrelated to the waters  the very idea made him feel sick  his divine breath came short and his brazen chest began to heave
as a matter of fact  no one took his troubles very seriously  when a mighty man complains one must pretend to yield  however hopeless the case may seem
no one ever really considered relieving poseidon of his position  he had been destined to be god of the seas since time immemorial  and that was how it had to remain
what annoyed him most    and this was the chief cause of discontent with his job    was to learn of the rumors that were circulating about him  for instance  that he was constantly cruising through the waves with his trident
instead of which here he was sitting in the depths of the world's ocean endlessly going over the accounts  an occasional journey to jupiter being the only interruption of the monotony  a journey moreover from which he invariably returned in a furious temper
as a result he had hardly seen the oceans  save fleetingly during his hasty ascent to olympus  and had never really sailed upon them
he used to say that he was postponing this until the end of the world  for then there might come a quiet moment when  just before the end and having gone through the last account  he could still make a quick little tour
fellowship we are five friends  one day we came out of a house one after the other  first one came and placed himself beside the gate  then the second came  or rather he glided through the gate like a little ball of quicksilver  and placed himself near the first one  then came the third  then the fourth  then the fifth finally we all stood in a row
people began to notice us  they pointed at us and said  those five just came out of that house
since then we have been living together  it would be a peaceful life if it weren't for a sixth one continually trying to interfere
he doesn't do us any harm  but he annoys us  and that is harm enough  why does he intrude where he is not wanted  we don't know him and don't want him to join us
there was a time  of course  when the five of us did not know one another  either  and it could be said that we still don't know one another  but what is possible and can be tolerated by the five of us is not possible and cannot be tolerated with this sixth one
in any case  we are five and don't want to be six
and what is the point of this continual being together anyhow  it is also pointless for the five of us  but here we are together and will remain together  a new combination  however  we do not want  just because of our experiences
but how is one to make all this clear to the sixth one  long explanations would almost amount to accepting him in our circle  so we prefer not to explain and not to accept him
no matter how he pouts his lips we push him away with our elbows  but however much we push him away  back he comes
at night deeply lost in the night
just as one sometimes lowers one's head to reflect  thus to be utterly lost in the night
all around people are asleep
it's just play acting  an innocent self deception  that they sleep in houses  in safe beds  under a safe roof  stretched out or curled up on mattresses  in sheets  under blankets  in reality they have flocked together as they had once upon a time and again later in a deserted region  a camp in the open  a countless number of men  an army  a people  under a cold sky on cold earth  collapsed where once they had stood  forehead pressed on the arm  face to the ground  breathing quietly and you are watching  are one of the watchmen  you find the next one by brandishing a burning stick from the brushwood pile beside you
why are you watching  someone must watch  it is said
someone must be there
the problem of our laws our laws are not generally known  they are kept secret by the small group of nobles who rule us
we are convinced that these ancient laws are scrupulously administered  nevertheless it is an extremely painful thing to be ruled by laws that one does not know
i am not thinking of possible discrepancies that may arise in the interpretation of the laws  or of the disadvantages involved when only a few and not the whole people are allowed to have a say in their interpretation
these disadvantages are perhaps of no great importance
for the laws are very ancient  their interpretation has been the work of centuries  and has itself doubtless acquired the status of law  and though there is still a possible freedom of interpretation left  it has now become very restricted
moreover the nobles have obviously no cause to be influenced in their interpretation by personal interests inimical to us  for the laws were made to the advantage of the nobles from the very beginning  they themselves stand above the laws  and that seems to be why the laws were entrusted exclusively into their hands of course  there is wisdom in that    who doubts the wisdom of the ancient laws     but also hardship for us  probably that is unavoidable
the very existence of these laws  however  is at most a matter of presumption
there is a tradition that they exist and that they are a mystery confided to the nobility  but it is not and cannot be more than a mere tradition sanctioned by age  for the essence of a secret code is that it should remain a mystery
some of us among the people have attentively scrutinized the doings of the nobility since the earliest times and possess records made by our forefathers    records which we have conscientiously continued    and claim to recognize amid the countless number of facts certain main tendencies which permit of this or that historical formulation  but when in accordance with these scrupulously tested and logically ordered conclusions we seek to adjust ourselves somewhat for the present or the future  everything becomes uncertain  and our work seems only an intellectual game  for perhaps these laws that we are trying to unravel do not exist at all there is a small party who are actually of this opinion and who try to show that  if any law exists  it can only be this  the law is whatever the nobles do
this party see everywhere only the arbitrary acts of the nobility  and reject the popular tradition  which according to them possesses only certain trifling and incidental advantages that do not offset its heavy drawbacks  for it gives the people a false  deceptive  and overconfident security in confronting coming events
this cannot be gainsaid  but the overwhelming majority of our people account for it by the fact that the tradition is far from complete and must be more fully inquired into  that the material available  prodigious as it looks  is still too meager  and that several centuries will have to pass before it becomes really adequate
this view  so comfortless as far as the present is concerned  is lightened only by the belief that a time will eventually come when the tradition and our research into it will jointly reach their conclusion  and as it were gain a breathing space  when everything will have become clear  the law will belong to the people  and the nobility will vanish
this is not maintained in any spirit of hatred against the nobility  not at all  and by no one
we are more inclined to hate ourselves  because we have not yet shown ourselves worthy of being entrusted with the laws
and that is the real reason why the party who believe that there is no law have remained so few    although their doctrine is in certain ways so attractive  for it unequivocally recognizes the nobility and its right to go on existing
actually one can express the problem only in a sort of paradox  any party that would repudiate not only all belief in the laws  but the nobility as well  would have the whole people behind it  yet no such party can come into existence  for nobody would dare to repudiate the nobility
we live on this razor's edge
a writer once summed the matter up in this way  the sole visible and indubitable law that is imposed upon us is the nobility  and must we ourselves deprive ourselves of that one law  the conscription of troops the conscription of troops  often necessary on account of the never ending frontier wars  takes place in the following manner  the order goes out that on a certain day in a certain part of town all inhabitants    men  women  and children without exception    have to remain indoors
usually at about noon the young nobleman in charge of the conscription appears at the entrance of that part of town where a detachment of soldiers  both infantry and cavalry  has been waiting since dawn
he is a young man  slender  not tall  weak  carelessly dressed  with tired eyes  waves of restlessness continually passing through him like the shivers of a fever
without looking at anyone he makes a sign with a whip  his sole equipment  whereupon several soldiers join him and he enters the first house
a soldier  who knows personally all the inhabitants in this part of town  reads out the list of the inmates
as a rule they are all present  lined up in the room  their eyes fixed on the nobleman  as though they were soldiers already
it can happen  however  that here and there someone  it's invariably a man  is missing
in this case no one will dare to utter an excuse  let alone a lie  everyone is silent  all eyes are lowered  the pressure of the command which someone in this house has evaded is almost unbearable  but the silent presence of the nobleman keeps everyone nevertheless in his place
the nobleman makes a sign  it's not even a nod  it can be read only in his eyes  and two soldiers begin the search for the missing man
this is not difficult
he is never out of the house  never really intends to evade military service  it's only fear that has prevented him from turning up  yet it's not fear of the service itself that keeps him away  it's the general reluctance to show himself  for him the command is almost too great  so frighteningly great that he cannot appear of his own accord this is why he does not flee  he simply goes into hiding  and on learning that the nobleman is in the house he even leaves his hiding place and creeps to the door of the room where he is promptly caught by the soldiers in search of him
he is brought before the nobleman who seizes the whip with both hands    he is so weak he can't do it with one hand    and gives the man a thrashing
having inflicted no great pain  he drops the whip  half from exhaustion  half from disgust  whereupon the beaten man has to pick it up and hand it to him
only then may he join the line with the others  incidentally  it is almost certain that he will not be recruited
but it also happens  and this is more frequent  that a greater number of people appear than are listed
there  for instance  stands an unknown girl  staring at the nobleman  she is from out of town  from the provinces perhaps  the conscription has lured her here
there are many women who cannot resist the temptation of a conscription in another town  conscriptions at home meaning something quite different
and  strangely enough  it is not considered disgraceful for a woman to surrender to this temptation  on the contrary  in the opinion of many  this is something women have to go through  a debt which they pay to their sex
moreover  it invariably takes the same course
the girl or the woman learns that somewhere  perhaps very far away  at the home of relatives or friends  a conscription is going to take place  she asks her family for permission to undertake the journey  which is granted    it cannot very well be refused    she puts on her best clothes  is gayer than usual  at the same time calm and friendly  no matter what she may be like at other times  and yet behind all the calm and friendliness she is inaccessible  like an utter stranger who is on her way home and can think of nothing else
in the family where the conscription is going to take place she is received quite differently from an ordinary guest  everyone flatters her  she is invited to walk through all the rooms in the house  lean out of all the windows  and if she puts her hand on someone's head it means more than a father's blessing when the family is preparing for the conscription she is given the best place  which is near the door where she has the best chance of being seen by the nobleman and can best see him
she is honored in this way  however  only until the nobleman enters  thereafter she begins to fade
he looks at her as little as at the others  and even when his eye rests on someone  that person is not aware of being looked at
this is something she has not expected or rather she certainly has  for it cannot be otherwise  yet it wasn't the expectation of the opposite that had driven her here  it was just something that had now definitely come to an end
she feels shame to a degree which our women possibly feel at no other time  only now is she fully aware of having forced her way into a foreign conscription  and when the soldier has read out the list and her name is not on it and there comes a moment of silence  she flees stooped and trembling out of the door  receiving in addition a blow in the back from a soldier's fist
should the person not on the list be a man  his only desire is to be conscripted with the others although he does not belong to this house
but this too is utterly out of the question  an outsider of this kind has never been conscripted and nothing of the sort will ever happen
the test i am a servant  but there is no work for me
i am timid and don't push myself to the fore  indeed i don't even push myself into line with the others  but that is only one reason for my nonemployment  it's even possible that it has nothing to do with my nonemployment  in any case the main thing is that i am not called upon to serve  others have been called yet they have not tried harder than i  indeed perhaps they have not even felt the desire to be called  whereas i  at least sometimes  have felt it very strongly
so i lie on the pallet in the servants' hall  stare at the beams in the ceiling  fall asleep  wake up  and promptly fall asleep again occasionally i walk over to the tavern where they sell a sour beer  occasionally i have even poured away a glass in disgust  but at other times i drink it
i like sitting there because from behind the closed little window  without the possibility of being discovered  i can see across to the windows of our house
not that one sees very much there  to my knowledge only the windows of the corridors look out on the street  and moreover not even those of the corridors leading to my employers' apartments
but it is also possible that i am mistaken  someone  without my having asked him  once said so  and the general impression of this house front confirms this only rarely are the windows opened  and when this does occur it is done by a servant who may lean against the balustrade to look down for a while
it follows therefore that these are corridors where he cannot be taken by surprise
as a matter of fact i am not personally acquainted with these servants  those who are permanently employed upstairs sleep elsewhere  not in my room
once when i arrived at the tavern  a guest was sitting at my observation post
i did not dare look at him closely and was about to turn around in the door and leave
the guest  however  called me over  and it turned out that he too was a servant whom i had once seen somewhere before  but without having spoken to him
 why do you want to run away  sit down and have a drink  i'll pay   so i sat down
he asked me several things  but i couldn't answer  indeed i didn't even understand his questions
so i said   perhaps you are sorry now that you invited me  so i'd better go   and i was about to get up
but he stretched his hand out over the table and pressed me down  stay   he said   that was only a test
he who does not answer the questions has passed the test   the vulture a vulture was hacking at my feet
it had already torn my boots and stockings to shreds  now it was hacking at the feet themselves again and again it struck at them  then circled several times restlessly around me  then returned to continue its work
a gentleman passed by  looked on for a while  then asked me why i suffered the vulture
 i'm helpless   i said
 when it came and began to attack me  i of course tried to drive it away  even to strangle it  but these animals are very strong  it was about to spring at my face  but i preferred to sacrifice my feet
now they are almost torn to bits    fancy letting yourself be tortured like this   said the gentleman
 one shot and that's the end of the vulture    really   i said
 and would you do that    with pleasure   said the gentleman   i've only got to go home and get my gun
could you wait another halfhour    i'm not sure about that   said i  and stood for a moment rigid with pain
then i said   do try it in any case  please    very well   said the gentleman   i'll be as quick as i can   during this conversation the vulture had been calmly listening  letting its eye rove between me and the gentleman
now i realized that it had understood everything  it took wing  leaned far back to gain impetus  and then  like a javelin thrower  thrust its beak through my mouth  deep into me
falling back  i was relieved to feel him drowning irretrievably in my blood  which was filling every depth  flooding every shore
the helmsman  am i not the helmsman here   i called out  you   asked a tall  dark man and passed his hands over his eyes as though to banish a dream
i had been standing at the helm in the dark night  a feeble lantern burning over my head  and now this man had come and tried to push me aside
and as i would not yield  he put his foot on my chest and slowly crushed me while i still clung to the hub of the helm  wrenching it around in falling
but the man seized it  pulled it back in place  and pushed me away
i soon collected myself  however  ran to the hatchway which gave on to the mess quarters  and cried out   men  comrades  come here  quick  a stranger has driven me away from the helm   slowly they came up  climbing the companion ladder  tired  swaying  powerful figures  am i the helmsman   i asked they nodded  but they had eyes only for the stranger  stood around him in a semicircle  and when  in a commanding voice  he said   don't disturb me   they gathered together  nodded at me  and withdrew down the companion ladder
what kind of people are these  do they ever think  or do they only shuffle pointlessly over the earth  the top a certain philosopher used to hang about wherever children were at play
and whenever he saw a boy with a top  he would lie in wait
as soon as the top began to spin the philosopher went in pursuit and tried to catch it
he was not perturbed when the children noisily protested and tried to keep him away from their toy  so long as he could catch the top while it was still spinning  he was happy  but only for a moment  then he threw it to the ground and walked away
for he believed that the understanding of any detail  that of a spinning top  for instance  was sufficient for the understanding of all things
for this reason he did not busy himself with great problems  it seemed to him uneconomical once the smallest detail was understood  then everything was understood  which was why he busied himself only with the spinning top and whenever preparations were being made for the spinning of the top  he hoped that this time it would succeed  as soon as the top began to spin and he was running breathlessly after it  the hope would turn to certainty  but when he held the silly piece of wood in his hand  he felt nauseated
the screaming of the children  which hitherto he had not heard and which now suddenly pierced his ears  chased him away  and he tottered like a top under a clumsy whip a little fable  alas  said the mouse   the world is growing smaller every day
at the beginning it was so big that i was afraid  i kept running and running  and i was glad when at last i saw walls far away to the right and left  but these long walls have narrowed so quickly that i am in the last chamber already  and there in the corner stands the trap that i must run into    you only need to change your direction   said the cat  and ate it up
home coming i have returned  i have passed under the arch and am looking around
it's my father's old yard
the puddle in the middle
old  useless tools  jumbled together  block the way to the attic stairs
the cat lurks on the banister
a torn piece of cloth  once wound around a stick in a game  flutters in the breeze
i have arrived
who is going to receive me  who is waiting behind the kitchen door  smoke is rising from the chimney  coffee is being made for supper
do you feel you belong  do you feel at home  i don't know  i feel most uncertain
my father's house it is  but each object stands cold beside the next  as though preoccupied with its own affairs  which i have partly forgotten  partly never known
what use can i be to them  what do i mean to them  even though i am the son of my father  the old farmer  and i don't dare knock at the kitchen door  i only listen from a distance  i only listen from a distance  standing up  in such a way that i cannot be taken by surprise as an eavesdropper
and since i am listening from a distance  i hear nothing but a faint striking of the clock passing over from childhood days  but perhaps i only think i hear it
whatever else is going on in the kitchen is the secret of those sitting there  a secret they are keeping from me
the longer one hesitates before the door  the more estranged one becomes
what would happen if someone were to open the door now and ask me a question  would not i myself then behave like one who wants to keep his secret  first sorrow a trapeze artist    this art  practiced high in the vaulted domes of the great variety theaters  is admittedly one of the most difficult humanity can achieve    had so arranged his life that  as long as he kept working in the same building  he never came down from his trapeze by night or day  at first only from a desire to perfect his skill  but later because custom was too strong for him
all his needs  very modest needs at that  were supplied by relays of attendants who watched from below and sent up and hauled down again in specially constructed containers whatever he required
this way of living caused no particular inconvenience to the theatrical people  except that  when other turns were on the stage  his being still up aloft  which could not be dissembled  proved somewhat distracting  as also the fact that  although at such times he mostly kept very still  he drew a stray glance here and there from the public
yet the management overlooked this  because he was an extraordinary and unique artist
and of course they recognized that this mode of life was no mere prank  and that only in this way could he really keep himself in constant practice and his art at the pitch of its perfection besides  it was quite healthful up there  and when in the warmer seasons of the year the side windows all around the dome of the theater were thrown open and sun and fresh air came pouring irresistibly into the dusky vault  it was even beautiful
true  his social life was somewhat limited  only sometimes a fellow acrobat swarmed up the ladder to him  and then they both sat on the trapeze  leaning left and right against the supporting ropes  and chatted  or builders' workmen repairing the roof exchanged a few words with him through an open window  or the fireman  inspecting the emergency lighting in the top gallery  called over to him something that sounded respectful but could hardly be made out
otherwise nothing disturbed his seclusion  occasionally  perhaps  some theater hand straying through the empty theater of an afternoon gazed thoughtfully up into the great height of the roof  almost beyond eyeshot  where the trapeze artist  unaware that he was being observed  practiced his art or rested
the trapeze artist could have gone on living peacefully like that  had it not been for the inevitable journeys from place to place  which he found extremely trying
of course his manager saw to it that his sufferings were not prolonged one moment more than necessary  for town travel  racing automobiles were used  which whirled him  by night if possible or in the earliest hours of the morning  through the empty streets at breakneck speed  too slow all the same for the trapeze artist's impatience  for railway journeys  a whole compartment was reserved  in which the trapeze artist  as a possible though wretched alternative to his usual way of living  could pass the time up on the luggage rack  in the next town on their circuit  long before he arrived  the trapeze was already slung up in the theater and all the doors leading to the stage were flung wide open  all corridors kept free    yet the manager never knew a happy moment until the trapeze artist set his foot on the rope ladder and in a twinkling  at long last  hung aloft on his trapeze despite so many journeys having been successfully arranged by the manager  each new one embarrassed him again  for the journeys  apart from everything else  got on the nerves of the artist a great deal
once when they were again traveling together  the trapeze artist lying on the luggage rack dreaming  the manager leaning back in the opposite window seat reading a book  the trapeze artist addressed his companion in a low voice
the manager was immediately all attention
the trapeze artist  biting his lips  said that he must always in future have two trapezes for his performance instead of only one  two trapezes opposite each other
the manager at once agreed
but the trapeze artist  as if to show that the manager's consent counted for as little as his refusal  said that never again would he perform on only one trapeze  in no circumstances whatever the very idea that it might happen at all seemed to make him shudder
the manager  watchfully feeling his way  once more emphasized his entire agreement  two trapezes were better than one  besides it would be an advantage to have a second bar  more variety could be introduced into the performance
at that the trapeze artist suddenly burst into tears
deeply distressed  the manager sprang to his feet and asked what was the matter  then getting no answer climbed up on the seat and caressed him  cheek to cheek  so that his own face was bedabbled by the trapeze artist's tears
yet it took much questioning and soothing endearment until the trapeze artist sobbed   only the one bar in my hands    how can i go on living   that made it somewhat easier for the manager to comfort him  he promised to wire from the very next station for a second trapeze to be installed in the first town on their circuit  reproached himself for having let the artist work so long on only one trapeze  and thanked and praised him warmly for having at last brought the mistake to his notice and so he succeeded in reassuring the trapeze artist  little by little  and was able to go back to his corner
but he himself was far from reassured  with deep uneasiness he kept glancing secretly at the trapeze artist over the top of his book once such ideas began to torment him  would they ever quite leave him alone  would they not rather increase in urgency  would they not threaten his very existence  and indeed the manager believed he could see  during the apparently peaceful sleep which had succeeded the fit of tears  the first furrows of care engraving themselves upon the trapeze artist's smooth  childlike forehead the departure i ordered my horse to be brought from the stables
the servant did not understand my orders
so i went to the stables myself  saddled my horse  and mounted
in the distance i heard the sound of a trumpet  and i asked the servant what it meant
he knew nothing and had heard nothing
at the gate he stopped me and asked   where is the master going    i don't know   i said   just out of here  just out of here
out of here  nothing else  it's the only way i can reach my goal    so you know your goal   he asked
 yes   i replied   i've just told you
out of here    that's my goal   advocates i was not at all certain whether i had any advocates  i could not find out anything definite about it  every face was unfriendly  most people who came toward me and whom i kept meeting in the corridors looked like fat old women  they had huge blue and white striped aprons covering their entire bodies  kept stroking their stomachs and swaying awkwardly to and fro
i could not even find out whether we were in a law court
some facts spoke for it  others against
what reminded me of a law court more than all the details was a droning noise which could be heard incessantly in the distance  one could not tell from which direction it came  it filled every room to such an extent that one had to assume it came from everywhere  or  what seemed more likely  that just the place where one happened to be standing was the very place where the droning originated  but this was probably an illusion  for it came from a distance
these corridors  narrow and austerely vaulted  turning in gradual curves with high  sparsely decorated doors  seemed to have been created specially for profound silence  they were the corridors of a museum or a library
yet if it were not a law court  why was i searching for an advocate here  because i was searching for an advocate everywhere  he is needed everywhere  if anything less in court than elsewhere  for a court  one assumes  passes judgment according to the law
if one were to assume that this was being done unfairly or frivolously  then life would not be possible  one must have confidence that the court allows the majesty of the law its full scope  for this is its sole duty
within the law all is accusation  advocacy  and verdict  any interference by an individual here would be a crime
it is different  however  in the case of the verdict itself  this is based on inquiries being made here and there  from relatives and strangers  from friends and enemies  in the family and public life  in town and village    in short  everywhere
here it is most necessary to have advocates  advocates galore  the best possible advocates  one next to the other  a living wall  for advocates are by nature hard to set in motion  the plaintiffs  however  those sly foxes  those slinking weasels  those little mice  they slip through the tiniest gaps  scuttle through the legs of the advocates
so look out  that's why i am here  i'm collecting advocates
but i have not found any as yet  only those old women keep on coming and going  if i were not on my search it would put me to sleep
i'm not in the right place    alas  i cannot rid myself of the feeling that i'm not in the right place
i ought to be in a place where all kinds of people meet  from various parts of the country  from every class  every profession  of all ages  i ought to have an opportunity of choosing carefully out of a crowd those who are kind  those who are able  and those who have an eye for me
perhaps the most suitable place for this would be a huge fairground  instead of which i am hanging about in these corridors where only these old women are to be seen  and not even many of them  and always the same ones  and even those few will not let themselves be cornered  despite their slowness  they slip away from me  float about like rain clouds  and are completely absorbed by unknown activities why is it then that i run headlong into a house without reading the sign over the door  promptly find myself in these corridors  and settle here with such obstinacy that i cannot even remember ever having been in front of the house  ever having run up the stairs  but back i cannot go  this waste of time  this admission of having been on the wrong track would be unbearable for me
what  run downstairs in this brief  hurried life accompanied as it is by that impatient droning  impossible
the time allotted to you is so short that if you lose one second you have already lost your whole life  for it is no longer  it is always just as long as the time you lose
so if you have started out on a walk  continue it whatever happens  you can only gain  you run no risk  in the end you may fall over a precipice perhaps  but had you turned back after the first steps and run downstairs you would have fallen at once    and not perhaps  but for certain
so if you find nothing in the corridors open the doors  if you find nothing behind these doors there are more floors  and if you find nothing up there  don't worry  just leap up another flight of stairs
as long as you don't stop climbing  the stairs won't end  under your climbing feet they will go on growing upwards
the married couple business in general is so bad that sometimes  when my work in the office leaves me a little time  i myself pick up the case of samples and call on my customers personally
long since i had intended to visit sometime  among others  n   with whom once i had constant business relations  which  however  during the last year have almost completely lapsed for some reason unknown to me
besides  there need not always be real reasons for such disruptions  in the present unstable state of affairs often a mere nothing  a mood  will turn the scale  and in the same way a mere nothing  a word  can put things right again
to gain admittance to n   however  is a somewhat ticklish business  he is an old man  grown somewhat infirm too of late  and though he still insists on attending to business matters himself  he is hardly ever to be seen in his office  if you want to speak to him you have to go to his house  and one likes to put off a business call of that kind last evening after six i nevertheless set out for his house  it was really no time for paying calls  but my visit after all was a business  not a social  one  and might be regarded accordingly
i was in luck
n
was in  he had just come back with his wife from a walk  the servant told me  and was now in the bedroom of his son  who was unwell and confined to his bed
i was requested to go there  at first i hesitated  but then the desire to get my disagreeable visit over as quickly as possible turned the scale  and i allowed myself to be conducted as i was  in my overcoat and hat  with my case of samples  through a dark room into a faintly lit one  where a small company was gathered
my first glance fell  probably by instinct  on an agent only too well known to me  a trade rival of myself in some respects
so he had stolen a march on me  it seemed
he was sitting comfortably by the bed of the sick man  just as if he were a doctor  he sat there brazenly in his beautiful ample overcoat  which was unbuttoned  the sick man too probably had his own thoughts as he lay there with his cheeks faintly flushed with fever  now and then glancing at his visitor
he was no longer young either  n 's son  a man of about my own age with a short beard  somewhat unkempt on account of his illness
old n   a tall  broad shouldered man  but to my astonishment grown very thin because of some creeping malady  bent and infirm  was still wearing the fur coat in which he had entered  and mumbling something to his son
his wife  small and frail  but immensely vivacious  yet only when she spoke to him    us others she scarcely noticed    was occupied in helping him to take off his overcoat  which  considering the great difference in their height  was a matter of some difficulty  but at last was achieved
perhaps  indeed  the real difficulty was caused by n 's impatience  for with restless hands he kept on feeling for the easy chair  which his wife  after the overcoat was off  quickly pushed forward for him
she herself then took up the fur coat  beneath which she almost vanished  and carried it out
now at last  it seemed to me  my moment had come  or rather it had not come and probably would never come  yet if i was to attempt anything it must be done at once  for i felt that here the conditions for a business interview could only become increasingly unfavorable  and to plant myself down here for all time  as the agent apparently intended  was not my way  besides  i did not want to take the slightest notice of him
so i began without ceremony to state my business  although i saw that n
would have liked at that moment to have a chat with his son
unfortunately i have a habit when i have worked myself up    and that takes a very short time  and on this occasion took a shorter time than usual    of getting up and walking about while i am talking
though a very good arrangement in one's own office  in a strange house it may be somewhat burdensome
but i could not restrain myself  particularly as i was feeling the lack of my usual cigarette
well  every man has his bad habits  yet i can congratulate myself on mine when i think of the agent's
for what is to be said of his behavior  of the fact  for instance  that every now and then he would suddenly and quite unexpectedly clap his hat on his head  he had been holding it on his knee until then  slowly pushing it up and down there
true  he took it off again immediately  as if he had made a blunder  but he had had it on his head nevertheless for a second or two  and besides he repeated this performance again and again every few minutes
surely such conduct must be called unpardonable
it did not disturb me  however  i walked up and down  completely absorbed in my own proposals  and ignored him  but there are people whom that trick with the hat might have put off completely
however  when i am thoroughly worked up i disregard not only such annoyances as these  but everything
i see  it is true  all that is going on  but do not admit it  so to speak  to my consciousness until i am finished  or until some objection is raised
thus i noticed quite well  for instance  that n
was by no means in a receptive state  holding on to the arms of his chair  he twisted about uncomfortably  never even glanced up at me  but gazed blankly  as if searching for something  into vacancy  and his face was so impassive that one might have thought no syllable of what i was saying  indeed no awareness of my presence  had penetrated to him yes  his whole bearing  the bearing of a sick man  in itself inauspicious for me  i took in quite well  nevertheless i talked on as if i had still some prospect of putting everything right again by my talk  by the advantageous offers i made    i was myself alarmed by the concessions i granted  concessions that had not even been asked for
it gave me a certain satisfaction also to notice that the agent  as i verified by a fleeting glance  had at last left his hat in peace and folded his arms across his chest  my performance  which was partly  i must confess  intended for him  seemed to have given a severe blow to his designs and in the elation produced by this result i might perhaps have gone on talking for a long time still  if the son  whom until now i had regarded as a secondary factor in my plans  had not suddenly raised himself in his bed and pulled me up by shaking his fist obviously he wanted to say something  to point out something  but he had not strength enough
at first i thought that his mind was wandering  but when i involuntarily glanced at old n
i understood better
n
sat with wide open  glassy  bulging eyes  which seemed on the point of failing  he was trembling and his body was bent forward as if someone were holding him down or striking him on the shoulders  his lower lip  indeed the lower jaw itself with the exposed gums  hung down helplessly  his whole face seemed out of joint  he still breathed  though with difficulty  but then  as if released  he fell back against the back of his chair  closed his eyes  the mark of some great strain passed over his face and vanished  and all was over i sprang to him and seized his lifeless hand  which was so cold that it sent a chill through me  no pulse beat there now
so it was all over
still  he was a very old man
we would be fortunate if we all had such an easy death
but how much there was to be done  and what should one do first  i looked around for help  but the son had drawn the bedclothes over his head  and i could hear his wild sobbing  the agent  cold as a fish  sat immovably on his chair  two steps from n   and was obviously resolved to do nothing  to wait for what time would bring  so i  only i was left to do something  and the hardest thing that anyone could be asked to do  that was to tell the news to his wife in some bearable form  in a form that did not exist  in other words
and already i could hear her eager shuffling steps in the next room
still wearing her outdoor clothes    she had not found time to change    she brought in a nightshirt that she had warmed before the fire for her husband to put on
 he's fallen asleep   she said  smiling and shaking her head  when she found us sitting so still
and with the infinite trustfulness of the innocent she took up the same hand that i had held a moment before with such fear and repugnance  kissed it playfully  and    how could we three others have borne the sight     n
moved  yawned loudly  allowed his nightshirt to be put on  endured with a mixture of annoyance and irony his wife's tender reproaches for having overstrained himself by taking such a long walk  and strangely enough said in reply  to provide no doubt a different explanation for his having fallen asleep  something about feeling bored then  so as not to catch cold by going through the draughty passage into a different room  he lay down for the time being in his son's bed  his head was bedded down beside his son's feet on two cushions hastily brought by his wife
after all that had gone before i found nothing particularly odd in that
then he asked for the evening paper  opened it without paying any attention to his guests  but did not read it  only glancing through it here and there  and made several very unpleasant observations on our offers  observations which showed astonishing shrewdness  while he waved his free hand disdainfully  and by clicking his tongue indicated that our business methods had left a bad taste in his mouth
the agent could not refrain from making one or two untimely remarks  no doubt he felt in his insensitive way that some compensation was due to him after what had happened  but his way of
securing it was the worst he could have chosen
i said goodbye as soon as i could  i felt almost grateful to the agent  if he had not been there i would not have had the resolution to leave so soon
in the lobby i met frau n
again
at the sight of that pathetic figure i said impulsively that she reminded me a little of my mother
and as she remained silent i added   whatever people say  she could do wonders
things that we destroyed she could make whole again
i lost her when i was still a child   i had spoken with deliberate slowness and distinctness  for i assumed the old lady was hard of hearing
but she must have been quite deaf  for she asked without transition   and how does my husband look to you   from a few parting words i noticed  moreover  that she confused me with the agent  i like to think that otherwise she would have been more forthcoming
then i descended the stairs  the descent was more tiring than the ascent had been  and not even that had been easy
oh  how many business calls come to nothing  and yet one must keep going
