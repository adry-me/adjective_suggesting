when seeing a dying animal a man feels a sense of horror  substance similar to his own is perishing before his eyes
but when it is a beloved and intimate human being that is dying  besides this horror at the extinction of life there is a severance  a spiritual wound  which like a physical wound is sometimes fatal and sometimes heals  but always aches and shrinks at any external irritating touch
after prince andrew's death natasha and princess mary alike felt this
drooping in spirit and closing their eyes before the menacing cloud of death that overhung them  they dared not look life in the face
they carefully guarded their open wounds from any rough and painful contact
everything  a carriage passing rapidly in the street  a summons to dinner  the maid's inquiry what dress to prepare  or worse still any word of insincere or feeble sympathy  seemed an insult  painfully irritated the wound  interrupting that necessary quiet in which they both tried to listen to the stern and dreadful choir that still resounded in their imagination  and hindered their gazing into those mysterious limitless vistas that for an instant had opened out before them
only when alone together were they free from such outrage and pain
they spoke little even to one another  and when they did it was of very unimportant matters
both avoided any allusion to the future
to admit the possibility of a future seemed to them to insult his memory
still more carefully did they avoid anything relating to him who was dead
it seemed to them that what they had lived through and experienced could not be expressed in words  and that any reference to the details of his life infringed the majesty and sacredness of the mystery that had been accomplished before their eyes
continued abstention from speech  and constant avoidance of everything that might lead up to the subject this halting on all sides at the boundary of what they might not mention brought before their minds with still greater purity and clearness what they were both feeling
but pure and complete sorrow is as impossible as pure and complete joy
princess mary  in her position as absolute and independent arbiter of her own fate and guardian and instructor of her nephew  was the first to be called back to life from that realm of sorrow in which she had dwelt for the first fortnight
she received letters from her relations to which she had to reply  the room in which little nicholas had been put was damp and he began to cough  alpatych came to yaroslavl with reports on the state of their affairs and with advice and suggestions that they should return to moscow to the house on the vozdvizhenka street  which had remained uninjured and needed only slight repairs
life did not stand still and it was necessary to live
hard as it was for princess mary to emerge from the realm of secluded contemplation in which she had lived till then  and sorry and almost ashamed as she felt to leave natasha alone  yet the cares of life demanded her attention and she involuntarily yielded to them
she went through the accounts with alpatych  conferred with dessalles about her nephew  and gave orders and made preparations for the journey to moscow
natasha remained alone and  from the time princess mary began making preparations for departure  held aloof from her too
princess mary asked the countess to let natasha go with her to moscow  and both parents gladly accepted this offer  for they saw their daughter losing strength every day and thought that a change of scene and the advice of moscow doctors would be good for her
 i am not going anywhere   natasha replied when this was proposed to her
 do please just leave me alone   and she ran out of the room  with difficulty refraining from tears of vexation and irritation rather than of sorrow
after she felt herself deserted by princes mary and alone in her grief  natasha spent most of the time in her room by herself  sitting huddled up feet and all in the corner of the sofa  tearing and twisting something with her slender nervous fingers and gazing intently and fixedly at whatever her eyes chanced to fall on
this solitude exhausted and tormented her but she was in absolute need of it
as soon as anyone entered she got up quickly  changed her position and impatiently for the intruder to go
she felt all the time as if she might at any moment penetrate that on which  with a terrible questioning too great for her strength her spiritual gaze was fixed
one day toward the end of december natasha  pale and thin  dressed in a black woolen gown  her plaited hair negligently twisted into a knot  was crouched feet and all in the corner of her sofa  nervously crumpling and smoothing out the end of her sash while she looked at a corner of the door
she was gazing in the direction in which he had gone to the other side of life
and that other side of life  of which she had never before thought and which had formerly seemed to her so far away and improbable  was now nearer and more akin and more comprehensible than this side of life  where everything was either emptiness and desolation or suffering and indignity
she was gazing where she knew him to be  but she could not imagine him otherwise than as he had been here
she now saw him again as he had been at mytishchi  at troitsa  and at yaroslavl
she saw his face  heard his voice  repeated his words and her own  and sometimes devised other words they might have spoken
there he is lying back in an armchair in his velvet cloak  leaning his head on his thin pale hand
his chest is dreadfully hollow and his shoulders raised
his lips are firmly closed  his eyes glitter  and a wrinkle comes and goes on his pale forehead
one of his legs twitches just perceptibly  but rapidly
natasha knows that he is struggling with terrible pain
 what is that pain like  why does he have that pain  what does he feel  how does it hurt him   thought natasha
he noticed her watching him  raised his eyes  and began to speak seriously   one thing would be terrible   said he   to bind oneself forever to a suffering man
it would be continual torture   and he looked searchingly at her
natasha as usual answered before she had time to think what she would say
she said   this can't go on it won't
you will get well quite well   she now saw him from the commencement of that scene and relived what she had then felt
she recalled his long sad and severe look at those words and understood the meaning of the rebuke and despair in that protracted gaze
 i agreed   natasha now said to herself   that it would be dreadful if he always continued to suffer
i said it then only because it would have been dreadful for him  but he understood it differently
he thought it would be dreadful for me
he then still wished to live and feared death
and i said it so awkwardly and stupidly  i did not say what i meant
i thought quite differently
had i said what i thought  i should have said  even if he had to go on dying  to die continually before my eyes  i should have been happy compared with what i am now
now there is nothing  
nobody
did he know that  no  he did not and never will know it
and now it will never  never be possible to put it right   and now he again seemed to be saying the same words to her  only in her imagination natasha this time gave him a different answer
she stopped him and said   terrible for you  but not for me  you know that for me there is nothing in life but you  and to suffer with you is the greatest happiness for me   and he took her hand and pressed it as he had pressed it that terrible evening four days before his death
and in her imagination she said other tender and loving words which she might have said then but only spoke now   i love thee   
thee  i love  love     she said  convulsively pressing her hands and setting her teeth with a desperate effort  
she was overcome by sweet sorrow and tears were already rising in her eyes  then she suddenly asked herself to whom she was saying this
again everything was shrouded in hard  dry perplexity  and again with a strained frown she peered toward the world where he was
and now  now it seemed to her she was penetrating the mystery   
but at the instant when it seemed that the incomprehensible was revealing itself to her a loud rattle of the door handle struck painfully on her ears
dunyasha  her maid  entered the room quickly and abruptly with a frightened look on her face and showing no concern for her mistress
 come to your papa at once  please   said she with a strange  excited look
 a misfortune  
about peter ilynich  
a letter   she finished with a sob
besides a feeling of aloofness from everybody natasha was feeling a special estrangement from the members of her own family
all of them her father  mother  and sonya were so near to her  so familiar  so commonplace  that all their words and feelings seemed an insult to the world in which she had been living of late  and she felt not merely indifferent to them but regarded them with hostility
she heard dunyasha's words about peter ilynich and a misfortune  but did not grasp them
 what misfortune  what misfortune can happen to them  they just live their own old  quiet  and commonplace life   thought natasha
as she entered the ballroom her father was hurriedly coming out of her mother's room
his face was puckered up and wet with tears
he had evidently run out of that room to give vent to the sobs that were choking him
when he saw natasha he waved his arms despairingly and burst into convulsively painful sobs that distorted his soft round face  pe  
petya  
go  go  she  
is calling     and weeping like a child and quickly shuffling on his feeble legs to a chair  he almost fell into it  covering his face with his hands
suddenly an electric shock seemed to run through natasha's whole being
terrible anguish struck her heart  she felt a dreadful ache as if something was being torn inside her and she were dying
but the pain was immediately followed by a feeling of release from the oppressive constraint that had prevented her taking part in life
the sight of her father  the terribly wild cries of her mother that she heard through the door  made her immediately forget herself and her own grief
she ran to her father  but he feebly waved his arm  pointing to her mother's door
princess mary  pale and with quivering chin  came out from that room and taking natasha by the arm said something to her
natasha neither saw nor heard her
she went in with rapid steps  pausing at the door for an instant as if struggling with herself  and then ran to her mother
the countess was lying in an armchair in a strange and awkward position  stretching out and beating her head against the wall sonya and the maids were holding her arms  natasha  natasha      cried the countess
 it's not true  
it's not true  
he's lying  
natasha   she shrieked  pushing those around her away
 go away  all of you  it's not true  killed   
ha  ha  ha   
it's not true   natasha put one knee on the armchair  stooped over her mother  embraced her  and with unexpected strength raised her  turned her face toward herself  and clung to her
 mummy   
darling   
i am here  my dearest mummy   she kept on whispering  not pausing an instant
she did not let go of her mother but struggled tenderly with her  demanded a pillow and hot water  and unfastened and tore open her mother's dress
 my dearest darling  
mummy  my precious      she whispered incessantly  kissing her head  her hands  her face  and feeling her own irrepressible and streaming tears tickling her nose and cheeks
the countess pressed her daughter's hand  closed her eyes  and became quiet for a moment
suddenly she sat up with unaccustomed swiftness  glanced vacantly around her  and seeing natasha began to press her daughter's head with all her strength
then she turned toward her daughter's face which was wincing with pain and gazed long at it
 natasha  you love me   she said in a soft trustful whisper
 natasha  you would not deceive me  you'll tell me the whole truth   natasha looked at her with eyes full of tears and in her look there was nothing but love and an entreaty for forgiveness
 my darling mummy   she repeated  straining all the power of her love to find some way of taking on herself the excess of grief that crushed her mother
and again in a futile struggle with reality her mother  refusing to believe that she could live when her beloved boy was killed in the bloom of life  escaped from reality into a world of delirium
natasha did not remember how that day passed nor that night  nor the next day and night
she did not sleep and did not leave her mother
her persevering and patient love seemed completely to surround the countess every moment  not explaining or consoling  but recalling her to life
during the third night the countess kept very quiet for a few minutes  and natasha rested her head on the arm of her chair and closed her eyes  but opened them again on hearing the bedstead creak
the countess was sitting up in bed and speaking softly
 how glad i am you have come
you are tired
won't you have some tea   natasha went up to her
 you have improved in looks and grown more manly   continued the countess  taking her daughter's hand
 mamma  what are you saying      natasha  he is no more  no more   and embracing her daughter  the countess began to weep for the first time
princess mary postponed her departure
sonya and the count tried to replace natasha but could not
they saw that she alone was able to restrain her mother from unreasoning despair
for three weeks natasha remained constantly at her mother's side  sleeping on a lounge chair in her room  making her eat and drink  and talking to her incessantly because the mere sound of her tender  caressing tones soothed her mother
the mother's wounded spirit could not heal
petya's death had torn from her half her life
when the news of petya's death had come she had been a fresh and vigorous woman of fifty  but a month later she left her room a listless old woman taking no interest in life
but the same blow that almost killed the countess  this second blow  restored natasha to life
a spiritual wound produced by a rending of the spiritual body is like a physical wound and  strange as it may seem  just as a deep wound may heal and its edges join  physical and spiritual wounds alike can yet heal completely only as the result of a vital force from within
natasha's wound healed in that way
she thought her life was ended  but her love for her mother unexpectedly showed her that the essence of life love  was still active within her
love awoke and so did life
prince andrew's last days had bound princess mary and natasha together  this new sorrow brought them still closer to one another
princess mary put off her departure  and for three weeks looked after natasha as if she had been a sick child
the last weeks passed in her mother's bedroom had strained natasha's physical strength
one afternoon noticing natasha shivering with fever  princess mary took her to her own room and made her lie down on the bed
natasha lay down  but when princess mary had drawn the blinds and was going away she called her back
 i don't want to sleep  mary  sit by me a little    you are tired try to sleep    no  no
why did you bring me away  she will be asking for me    she is much better
she spoke so well today   said princess mary
natasha lay on the bed and in the semidarkness of the room scanned princess mary's face
 is she like him   thought natasha
 yes  like and yet not like
but she is quite original  strange  new  and unknown
and she loves me
what is in her heart  all that is good
but how  what is her mind like  what does she think about me  yes  she is splendid    mary   she said timidly  drawing princess mary's hand to herself   mary  you mustn't think me wicked
no  mary darling  how i love you  let us be quite  quite friends   and natasha  embracing her  began kissing her face and hands  making princess mary feel shy but happy by this demonstration of her feelings
from that day a tender and passionate friendship such as exists only between women was established between princess mary and natasha
they were continually kissing and saying tender things to one another and spent most of their time together
when one went out the other became restless and hastened to rejoin her
together they felt more in harmony with one another than either of them felt with herself when alone
a feeling stronger than friendship sprang up between them  an exclusive feeling of life being possible only in each other's presence
sometimes they were silent for hours  sometimes after they were already in bed they would begin talking and go on till morning
they spoke most of what was long past
princess mary spoke of her childhood  of her mother  her father  and her daydreams  and natasha  who with a passive lack of understanding had formerly turned away from that life of devotion  submission  and the poetry of christian self sacrifice  now feeling herself bound to princess mary by affection  learned to love her past too and to understand a side of life previously incomprehensible to her she did not think of applying submission and self abnegation to her own life  for she was accustomed to seek other joys  but she understood and loved in another those previously incomprehensible virtues
for princess mary  listening to natasha's tales of childhood and early youth  there also opened out a new and hitherto uncomprehended side of life  belief in life and its enjoyment
just as before  they never mentioned him so as not to lower  as they thought  their exalted feelings by words  but this silence about him had the effect of making them gradually begin to forget him without being conscious of it
natasha had grown thin and pale and physically so weak that they all talked about her health  and this pleased her
but sometimes she was suddenly overcome by fear not only of death but of sickness  weakness  and loss of good looks  and involuntarily she examined her bare arm carefully  surprised at its thinness  and in the morning noticed her drawn and  as it seemed to her  piteous face in her glass
it seemed to her that things must be so  and yet it was dreadfully sad
one day she went quickly upstairs and found herself out of breath
unconsciously she immediately invented a reason for going down  and then  testing her strength  ran upstairs again  observing the result
another time when she called dunyasha her voice trembled  so she called again though she could hear dunyasha coming called her in the deep chest tones in which she had been wont to sing  and listened attentively to herself
she did not know and would not have believed it  but beneath the layer of slime that covered her soul and seemed to her impenetrable  delicate young shoots of grass were already sprouting  which taking root would so cover with their living verdure the grief that weighed her down that it would soon no longer be seen or noticed
the wound had begun to heal from within
at the end of january princess mary left for moscow  and the count insisted on natasha's going with her to consult the doctors
after the encounter at vyazma  where kutuzov had been unable to hold back his troops in their anxiety to overwhelm and cut off the enemy and so on  the farther movement of the fleeing french  and of the russians who pursued them  continued as far as krasnoe without a battle
the flight was so rapid that the russian army pursuing the french could not keep up with them  cavalry and artillery horses broke down  and the information received of the movements of the french was never reliable
the men in the russian army were so worn out by this continuous marching at the rate of twenty seven miles a day that they could not go any faster
to realize the degree of exhaustion of the russian army it is only necessary to grasp clearly the meaning of the fact that  while not losing more than five thousand killed and wounded after tarutino and less than a hundred prisoners  the russian army which left that place a hundred thousand strong reached krasnoe with only fifty thousand
the rapidity of the russian pursuit was just as destructive to our army as the flight of the french was to theirs
the only difference was that the russian army moved voluntarily  with no such threat of destruction as hung over the french  and that the sick frenchmen were left behind in enemy hands while the sick russians left behind were among their own people
the chief cause of the wastage of napoleon's army was the rapidity of its movement  and a convincing proof of this is the corresponding decrease of the russian army
kutuzov as far as was in his power  instead of trying to check the movement of the french as was desired in petersburg and by the russian army generals  directed his whole activity here  as he had done at tarutino and vyazma  to hastening it on while easing the movement of our army
but besides this  since the exhaustion and enormous diminution of the army caused by the rapidity of the advance had become evident  another reason for slackening the pace and delaying presented itself to kutuzov
the aim of the russian army was to pursue the french
the road the french would take was unknown  and so the closer our troops trod on their heels the greater distance they had to cover
only by following at some distance could one cut across the zigzag path of the french
all the artful maneuvers suggested by our generals meant fresh movements of the army and a lengthening of its marches  whereas the only reasonable aim was to shorten those marches
to that end kutuzov's activity was directed during the whole campaign from moscow to vilna not casually or intermittently but so consistently that he never once deviated from it
kutuzov felt and knew not by reasoning or science but with the whole of his russian being what every russian soldier felt  that the french were beaten  that the enemy was flying and must be driven out  but at the same time he like the soldiers realized all the hardship of this march  the rapidity of which was unparalleled for such a time of the year
but to the generals  especially the foreign ones in the russian army  who wished to distinguish themselves  to astonish somebody  and for some reason to capture a king or a duke it seemed that now when any battle must be horrible and senseless was the very time to fight and conquer somebody kutuzov merely shrugged his shoulders when one after another they presented projects of maneuvers to be made with those soldiers ill shod  insufficiently clad  and half starved who within a month and without fighting a battle had dwindled to half their number  and who at the best if the flight continued would have to go a greater distance than they had already traversed  before they reached the frontier
this longing to distinguish themselves  to maneuver  to overthrow  and to cut off showed itself particularly whenever the russians stumbled on the french army so it was at krasnoe  where they expected to find one of the three french columns and stumbled instead on napoleon himself with sixteen thousand men despite all kutuzov's efforts to avoid that ruinous encounter and to preserve his troops  the massacre of the broken mob of french soldiers by worn out russians continued at krasnoe for three days
toll wrote a disposition   the first column will march to so and so   etc and as usual nothing happened in accord with the disposition
prince eugene of wurttemberg fired from a hill over the french crowds that were running past  and demanded reinforcements which did not arrive
the french  avoiding the russians  dispersed and hid themselves in the forest by night  making their way round as best they could  and continued their flight miloradovich  who said he did not want to know anything about the commissariat affairs of his detachment  and could never be found when he was wanted that chevalier sans peur et sans reproche * as he styled himself  who was fond of parleys with the french  sent envoys demanding their surrender  wasted time  and did not do what he was ordered to do * knight without fear and without reproach
 i give you that column  lads   he said  riding up to the troops and pointing out the french to the cavalry
and the cavalry  with spurs and sabers urging on horses that could scarcely move  trotted with much effort to the column presented to them that is to say  to a crowd of frenchmen stark with cold  frost bitten  and starving and the column that had been presented to them threw down its arms and surrendered as it had long been anxious to do at krasnoe they took twenty six thousand prisoners  several hundred cannon  and a stick called a  marshal's staff   and disputed as to who had distinguished himself and were pleased with their achievement though they much regretted not having taken napoleon  or at least a marshal or a hero of some sort  and reproached one another and especially kutuzov for having failed to do so these men  carried away by their passions  were but blind tools of the most melancholy law of necessity  but considered themselves heroes and imagined that they were accomplishing a most noble and honorable deed they blamed kutuzov and said that from the very beginning of the campaign he had prevented their vanquishing napoleon  that he thought of nothing but satisfying his passions and would not advance from the linen factories because he was comfortable there  that at krasnoe he checked the advance because on learning that napoleon was there he had quite lost his head  and that it was probable that he had an understanding with napoleon and had been bribed by him  and so on  and so on
not only did his contemporaries  carried away by their passions  talk in this way  but posterity and history have acclaimed napoleon as grand  while kutuzov is described by foreigners as a crafty  dissolute  weak old courtier  and by russians as something indefinite a sort of puppet useful only because he had a russian name
in 1812 and 1813 kutuzov was openly accused of blundering
the emperor was dissatisfied with him
and in a history recently written by order of the highest authorities it is said that kutuzov was a cunning court liar  frightened of the name of napoleon  and that by his blunders at krasnoe and the berezina he deprived the russian army of the glory of complete victory over the french
* * history of the year 1812
the character of kutuzov and reflections on the unsatisfactory results of the battles at krasnoe  by bogdanovich
such is the fate not of great men  grands hommes  whom the russian mind does not acknowledge  but of those rare and always solitary individuals who  discerning the will of providence  submit their personal will to it
the hatred and contempt of the crowd punish such men for discerning the higher laws
for russian historians  strange and terrible to say  napoleon that most insignificant tool of history who never anywhere  even in exile  showed human dignity napoleon is the object of adulation and enthusiasm  he is grand
but kutuzov the man who from the beginning to the end of his activity in 1812  never once swerving by word or deed from borodino to vilna  presented an example exceptional in history of self sacrifice and a present consciousness of the future importance of what was happening  kutuzov seems to them something indefinite and pitiful  and when speaking of him and of the year 1812 they always seem a little ashamed and yet it is difficult to imagine an historical character whose activity was so unswervingly directed to a single aim  and it would be difficult to imagine any aim more worthy or more consonant with the will of the whole people
still more difficult would it be to find an instance in history of the aim of an historical personage being so completely accomplished as that to which all kutuzov's efforts were directed in 1812
kutuzov never talked of  forty centuries looking down from the pyramids   of the sacrifices he offered for the fatherland  or of what he intended to accomplish or had accomplished  in general he said nothing about himself  adopted no pose  always appeared to be the simplest and most ordinary of men  and said the simplest and most ordinary things he wrote letters to his daughters and to madame de stael  read novels  liked the society of pretty women  jested with generals  officers  and soldiers  and never contradicted those who tried to prove anything to him
when count rostopchin at the yauza bridge galloped up to kutuzov with personal reproaches for having caused the destruction of moscow  and said   how was it you promised not to abandon moscow without a battle   kutuzov replied   and i shall not abandon moscow without a battle   though moscow was then already abandoned
when arakcheev  coming to him from the emperor  said that ermolov ought to be appointed chief of the artillery  kutuzov replied   yes  i was just saying so myself   though a moment before he had said quite the contrary
what did it matter to him who then alone amid a senseless crowd understood the whole tremendous significance of what was happening what did it matter to him whether rostopchin attributed the calamities of moscow to him or to himself  still less could it matter to him who was appointed chief of the artillery not merely in these cases but continually did that old man who by experience of life had reached the conviction that thoughts and the words serving as their expression are not what move people use quite meaningless words that happened to enter his head
but that man  so heedless of his words  did not once during the whole time of his activity utter one word inconsistent with the single aim toward which he moved throughout the whole war
obviously in spite of himself  in very diverse circumstances  he repeatedly expressed his real thoughts with the bitter conviction that he would not be understood beginning with the battle of borodino  from which time his disagreement with those about him began  he alone said that the battle of borodino was a victory  and repeated this both verbally and in his dispatches and reports up to the time of his death
he alone said that the loss of moscow is not the loss of russia
in reply to lauriston's proposal of peace  he said  there can be no peace  for such is the people's will
he alone during the retreat of the french said that all our maneuvers are useless  everything is being accomplished of itself better than we could desire  that the enemy must be offered  a golden bridge   that neither the tarutino  the vyazma  nor the krasnoe battles were necessary  that we must keep some force to reach the frontier with  and that he would not sacrifice a single russian for ten frenchmen
and this courtier  as he is described to us  who lies to arakcheev to please the emperor  he alone incurring thereby the emperor's displeasure said in vilna that to carry the war beyond the frontier is useless and harmful
nor do words alone prove that only he understood the meaning of the events
his actions without the smallest deviation were all directed to one and the same threefold end   1  to brace all his strength for conflict with the french   2  to defeat them  and  3  to drive them out of russia  minimizing as far as possible the sufferings of our people and of our army
this procrastinator kutuzov  whose motto was  patience and time   this enemy of decisive action  gave battle at borodino  investing the preparations for it with unparalleled solemnity
this kutuzov who before the battle of austerlitz began said that it would be lost  he alone  in contradiction to everyone else  declared till his death that borodino was a victory  despite the assurance of generals that the battle was lost and despite the fact that for an army to have to retire after winning a battle was unprecedented
he alone during the whole retreat insisted that battles  which were useless then  should not be fought  and that a new war should not be begun nor the frontiers of russia crossed
it is easy now to understand the significance of these events if only we abstain from attributing to the activity of the mass aims that existed only in the heads of a dozen individuals for the events and results now lie before us but how did that old man  alone  in opposition to the general opinion  so truly discern the importance of the people's view of the events that in all his activity he was never once untrue to it  the source of that extraordinary power of penetrating the meaning of the events then occuring lay in the national feeling which he possessed in full purity and strength
only the recognition of the fact that he possessed this feeling caused the people in so strange a manner  contrary to the tsar's wish  to select him an old man in disfavor to be their representative in the national war
and only that feeling placed him on that highest human pedestal from which he  the commander in chief  devoted all his powers not to slaying and destroying men but to saving and showing pity on them
that simple  modest  and therefore truly great  figure could not be cast in the false mold of a european hero the supposed ruler of men that history has invented
to a lackey no man can be great  for a lackey has his own conception of greatness
the fifth of november was the first day of what is called the battle of krasnoe
toward evening after much disputing and many mistakes made by generals who did not go to their proper places  and after adjutants had been sent about with counterorders when it had become plain that the enemy was everywhere in flight and that there could and would be no battle  kutuzov left krasnoe and went to dobroe whither his headquarters had that day been transferred
the day was clear and frosty
kutuzov rode to dobroe on his plump little white horse  followed by an enormous suite of discontented generals who whispered among themselves behind his back all along the road groups of french prisoners captured that day  there were seven thousand of them  were crowding to warm themselves at campfires near dobroe an immense crowd of tattered prisoners  buzzing with talk and wrapped and bandaged in anything they had been able to get hold of  were standing in the road beside a long row of unharnessed french guns
at the approach of the commander in chief the buzz of talk ceased and all eyes were fixed on kutuzov who  wearing a white cap with a red band and a padded overcoat that bulged on his round shoulders  moved slowly along the road on his white horse
one of the generals was reporting to him where the guns and prisoners had been captured
kutuzov seemed preoccupied and did not listen to what the general was saying
he screwed up his eyes with a dissatisfied look as he gazed attentively and fixedly at these prisoners  who presented a specially wretched appearance most of them were disfigured by frost bitten noses and cheeks  and nearly all had red  swollen and festering eyes
one group of the french stood close to the road  and two of them  one of whom had his face covered with sores  were tearing a piece of raw flesh with their hands
there was something horrible and bestial in the fleeting glance they threw at the riders and in the malevolent expression with which  after a glance at kutuzov  the soldier with the sores immediately turned away and went on with what he was doing
kutuzov looked long and intently at these two soldiers
he puckered his face  screwed up his eyes  and pensively swayed his head
at another spot he noticed a russian soldier laughingly patting a frenchman on the shoulder  saying something to him in a friendly manner  and kutuzov with the same expression on his face again swayed his head
 what were you saying   he asked the general  who continuing his report directed the commander in chief's attention to some standards captured from the french and standing in front of the preobrazhensk regiment
 ah  the standards   said kutuzov  evidently detaching himself with difficulty from the thoughts that preoccupied him he looked about him absently
thousands of eyes were looking at him from all sides awaiting a word from him
he stopped in front of the preobrazhensk regiment  sighed deeply  and closed his eyes
one of his suite beckoned to the soldiers carrying the standards to advance and surround the commander in chief with them
kutuzov was silent for a few seconds and then  submitting with evident reluctance to the duty imposed by his position  raised his head and began to speak
a throng of officers surrounded him
he looked attentively around at the circle of officers  recognizing several of them
 i thank you all   he said  addressing the soldiers and then again the officers
in the stillness around him his slowly uttered words were distinctly heard
 i thank you all for your hard and faithful service
the victory is complete and russia will not forget you  honor to you forever   he paused and looked around
 lower its head  lower it   he said to a soldier who had accidentally lowered the french eagle he was holding before the preobrazhensk standards
 lower  lower  that's it
hurrah lads   he added  addressing the men with a rapid movement of his chin
 hur r rah   roared thousands of voices
while the soldiers were shouting kutuzov leaned forward in his saddle and bowed his head  and his eye lit up with a mild and apparently ironic gleam
 you see  brothers     said he when the shouts had ceased  
and all at once his voice and the expression of his face changed
it was no longer the commanderin chief speaking but an ordinary old man who wanted to tell his comrades something very important there was a stir among the throng of officers and in the ranks of the soldiers  who moved that they might hear better what he was going to say
 you see  brothers  i know it's hard for you  but it can't be helped  bear up  it won't be for long now  we'll see our visitors off and then we'll rest
the tsar won't forget your service
it is hard for you  but still you are at home while they you see what they have come to   said he  pointing to the prisoners
 worse off than our poorest beggars
while they were strong we didn't spare ourselves  but now we may even pity them
they are human beings too
isn't it so  lads   he looked around  and in the direct  respectful  wondering gaze fixed upon him he read sympathy with what he had said
his face grew brighter and brighter with an old man's mild smile  which drew the corners of his lips and eyes into a cluster of wrinkles
he ceased speaking and bowed his head as if in perplexity
 but after all who asked them here  serves them right  the bloody bastards   he cried  suddenly lifting his head
and flourishing his whip he rode off at a gallop for the first time during the whole campaign  and left the broken ranks of the soldiers laughing joyfully and shouting  hurrah   kutuzov's words were hardly understood by the troops
no one could have repeated the field marshal's address  begun solemnly and then changing into an old man's simplehearted talk  but the hearty sincerity of that speech  the feeling of majestic triumph combined with pity for the foe and consciousness of the justice of our cause  exactly expressed by that old man's good natured expletives  was not merely understood but lay in the soul of every soldier and found expression in their joyous and long sustained shouts
afterwards when one of the generals addressed kutuzov asking whether he wished his caleche to be sent for  kutuzov in answering unexpectedly gave a sob  being evidently greatly moved
when the troops reached their night's halting place on the eighth of november  the last day of the krasnoe battles  it was already growing dusk
all day it had been calm and frosty with occasional lightly falling snow and toward evening it began to clear
through the falling snow a purple black and starry sky showed itself and the frost grew keener
an infantry regiment which had left tarutino three thousand strong but now numbered only nine hundred was one of the first to arrive that night at its halting place a village on the highroad
the quartermasters who met the regiment announced that all the huts were full of sick and dead frenchmen  cavalrymen  and members of the staff
there was only one hut available for the regimental commander
the commander rode up to his hut
the regiment passed through the village and stacked its arms in front of the last huts like some huge many limbed animal  the regiment began to prepare its lair and its food
one part of it dispersed and waded knee deep through the snow into a birch forest to the right of the village  and immediately the sound of axes and swords  the crashing of branches  and merry voices could be heard from there
another section amid the regimental wagons and horses which were standing in a group was busy getting out caldrons and rye biscuit  and feeding the horses
a third section scattered through the village arranging quarters for the staff officers  carrying out the french corpses that were in the huts  and dragging away boards  dry wood  and thatch from the roofs  for the campfires  or wattle fences to serve for shelter
some fifteen men with merry shouts were shaking down the high wattle wall of a shed  the roof of which had already been removed
 now then  all together shove   cried the voices  and the huge surface of the wall  sprinkled with snow and creaking with frost  was seen swaying in the gloom of the night
the lower stakes cracked more and more and at last the wall fell  and with it the men who had been pushing it
loud  coarse laughter and joyous shouts ensued
 now then  catch hold in twos  hand up the lever  that's it  
where are you shoving to    now  all together  but wait a moment  boys  
with a song   all stood silent  and a soft  pleasant velvety voice began to sing
at the end of the third verse as the last note died away  twenty voices roared out at once   oo oo oo oo  that's it
all together  heave away  boys      but despite their united efforts the wattle hardly moved  and in the silence that followed the heavy breathing of the men was audible
 here  you of the sixth company  devils that you are  lend a hand  
will you  you may want us one of these days   some twenty men of the sixth company who were on their way into the village joined the haulers  and the wattle wall  which was about thirty five feet long and seven feet high  moved forward along the village street  swaying  pressing upon and cutting the shoulders of the gasping men
 get along  
falling  what are you stopping for  there now     merry senseless words of abuse flowed freely
 what are you up to   suddenly came the authoritative voice of a sergeant major who came upon the men who were hauling their burden
 there are gentry here  the general himself is in that hut  and you foul mouthed devils  you brutes  i'll give it to you   shouted he  hitting the first man who came in his way a swinging blow on the back  can't you make less noise   the men became silent
the soldier who had been struck groaned and wiped his face  which had been scratched till it bled by his falling against the wattle
 there  how that devil hits out  he's made my face all bloody   said he in a frightened whisper when the sergeant major had passed on
 don't you like it   said a laughing voice  and moderating their tones the men moved forward
when they were out of the village they began talking again as loud as before  interlarding their talk with the same aimless expletives
in the hut which the men had passed  the chief officers had gathered and were in animated talk over their tea about the events of the day and the maneuvers suggested for tomorrow
it was proposed to make a flank march to the left  cut off the vice king  murat  and capture him
by the time the soldiers had dragged the wattle fence to its place the campfires were blazing on all sides ready for cooking  the wood crackled  the snow was melting  and black shadows of soldiers flitted to and fro all over the occupied space where the snow had been trodden down
axes and choppers were plied all around
everything was done without any orders being given
stores of wood were brought for the night  shelters were rigged up for the officers  caldrons were being boiled  and muskets and accouterments put in order
the wattle wall the men had brought was set up in a semicircle by the eighth company as a shelter from the north  propped up by musket rests  and a campfire was built before it
they beat the tattoo  called the roll  had supper  and settled down round the fires for the night some repairing their footgear  some smoking pipes  and some stripping themselves naked to steam the lice out of their shirts one would have thought that under the almost incredibly wretched conditions the russian soldiers were in at that time lacking warm boots and sheepskin coats  without a roof over their heads  in the snow with eighteen degrees of frost  and without even full rations  the commissariat did not always keep up with the troops  they would have presented a very sad and depressing spectacle on the contrary  the army had never under the best material conditions presented a more cheerful and animated aspect
this was because all who began to grow depressed or who lost strength were sifted out of the army day by day
all the physically or morally weak had long since been left behind and only the flower of the army physically and mentally remained
more men collected behind the wattle fence of the eighth company than anywhere else
two sergeants major were sitting with them and their campfire blazed brighter than others
for leave to sit by their wattle they demanded contributions of fuel
 eh  makeev  what has become of you  you son of a bitch  are you lost or have the wolves eaten you  fetch some more wood   shouted a red haired and red faced man  screwing up his eyes and blinking because of the smoke but not moving back from the fire  and you  jackdaw  go and fetch some wood   said he to another soldier this red haired man was neither a sergeant nor a corporal  but being robust he ordered about those weaker than himself the soldier they called  jackdaw   a thin little fellow with a sharp nose  rose obediently and was about to go but at that instant there came into the light of the fire the slender  handsome figure of a young soldier carrying a load of wood
 bring it here that's fine   they split up the wood  pressed it down on the fire  blew at it with their mouths  and fanned it with the skirts of their greatcoats  making the flames hiss and crackle
the men drew nearer and lit their pipes
the handsome young soldier who had brought the wood  setting his arms akimbo  began stamping his cold feet rapidly and deftly on the spot where he stood  mother  the dew is cold but clear   
it's well that i'm a musketeer     he sang  pretending to hiccough after each syllable
 look out  your soles will fly off   shouted the red haired man  noticing that the sole of the dancer's boot was hanging loose
 what a fellow you are for dancing   the dancer stopped  pulled off the loose piece of leather  and threw it on the fire
 right enough  friend   said he  and  having sat down  took out of his knapsack a scrap of blue french cloth  and wrapped it round his foot
 it's the steam that spoils them   he added  stretching out his feet toward the fire  they'll soon be issuing us new ones
they say that when we've finished hammering them  we're to receive double kits    and that son of a bitch petrov has lagged behind after all  it seems   said one sergeant major  i've had an eye on him this long while   said the other
 well  he's a poor sort of soldier      but in the third company they say nine men were missing yesterday    yes  it's all very well  but when a man's feet are frozen how can he walk    eh  don't talk nonsense   said a sergeant major
 do you want to be doing the same   said an old soldier  turning reproachfully to the man who had spoken of frozen feet
 well  you know   said the sharp nosed man they called jackdaw in a squeaky and unsteady voice  raising himself at the other side of the fire   a plump man gets thin  but for a thin one it's death take me  now  i've got no strength left   he added  with sudden resolution turning to the sergeant major
 tell them to send me to hospital  i'm aching all over  anyway i shan't be able to keep up    that'll do  that'll do   replied the sergeant major quietly
the soldier said no more and the talk went on
 what a lot of those frenchies were taken today  and the fact is that not one of them had what you might call real boots on   said a soldier  starting a new theme
 they were no more than make believes    the cossacks have taken their boots
they were clearing the hut for the colonel and carried them out
it was pitiful to see them  boys   put in the dancer
 as they turned them over one seemed still alive and  would you believe it  he jabbered something in their lingo    but they're a clean folk  lads   the first man went on   he was white as white as birchbark and some of them are such fine fellows  you might think they were nobles    well  what do you think  they make soldiers of all classes there    but they don't understand our talk at all   said the dancer with a puzzled smile
 i asked him whose subject he was  and he jabbered in his own way
a queer lot    but it's strange  friends   continued the man who had wondered at their whiteness   the peasants at mozhaysk were saying that when they began burying the dead where the battle was you know well  those dead had been lying there for nearly a month  and says the peasant  'they lie as white as paper  clean  and not as much smell as a puff of powder smoke '   was it from the cold   asked someone
 you're a clever fellow  from the cold indeed  why  it was hot
if it had been from the cold  ours would not have rotted either
'but ' he says  'go up to ours and they are all rotten and maggoty
so ' he says  'we tie our faces up with kerchiefs and turn our heads away as we drag them off  we can hardly do it
but theirs ' he says  'are white as paper and not so much smell as a whiff of gunpowder '  all were silent
 it must be from their food   said the sergeant major
 they used to gobble the same food as the gentry   no one contradicted him
 that peasant near mozhaysk where the battle was said the men were all called up from ten villages around and they carted for twenty days and still didn't finish carting the dead away
and as for the wolves  he says      that was a real battle   said an old soldier
 it's the only one worth remembering  but since that  
it's only been tormenting folk    and do you know  daddy  the day before yesterday we ran at them and  my word  they didn't let us get near before they just threw down their muskets and went on their knees
'pardon ' they say
that's only one case
they say platov took 'poleon himself twice but he didn't know the right charm
he catches him and catches him no good  he turns into a bird in his hands and flies away
and there's no way of killing him either    you're a first class liar  kiselev  when i come to look at you    liar  indeed  it's the real truth    if he fell into my hands  when i'd caught him i'd bury him in the ground with an aspen stake to fix him down
what a lot of men he's ruined    well  anyhow we're going to end it
he won't come here again   remarked the old soldier  yawning
the conversation flagged  and the soldiers began settling down to sleep
 look at the stars
it's wonderful how they shine  you would think the women had spread out their linen   said one of the men  gazing with admiration at the milky way
 that's a sign of a good harvest next year    we shall want some more wood    you warm your back and your belly gets frozen
that's queer    o lord    what are you pushing for  is the fire only for you  look how he's sprawling   in the silence that ensued  the snoring of those who had fallen asleep could be heard
others turned over and warmed themselves  now and again exchanging a few words from a campfire a hundred paces off came a sound of general  merry laughter
 hark at them roaring there in the fifth company   said one of the soldiers   and what a lot of them there are   one of the men got up and went over to the fifth company
 they're having such fun   said he  coming back
 two frenchies have turned up
one's quite frozen and the other's an awful swaggerer
he's singing songs       oh  i'll go across and have a look      and several of the men went over to the fifth company
the fifth company was bivouacking at the very edge of the forest
a huge campfire was blazing brightly in the midst of the snow  lighting up the branches of trees heavy with hoarfrost
about midnight they heard the sound of steps in the snow of the forest  and the crackling of dry branches
 a bear  lads   said one of the men
they all raised their heads to listen  and out of the forest into the bright firelight stepped two strangely clad human figures clinging to one another
these were two frenchmen who had been hiding in the forest
they came up to the fire  hoarsely uttering something in a language our soldiers did not understand
one was taller than the other  he wore an officer's hat and seemed quite exhausted
on approaching the fire he had been going to sit down  but fell
the other  a short sturdy soldier with a shawl tied round his head  was stronger
he raised his companion and said something  pointing to his mouth
the soldiers surrounded the frenchmen  spread a greatcoat on the ground for the sick man  and brought some buckwheat porridge and vodka for both of them
the exhausted french officer was ramballe and the man with his head wrapped in the shawl was morel  his orderly
when morel had drunk some vodka and finished his bowl of porridge he suddenly became unnaturally merry and chattered incessantly to the soldiers  who could not understand him
ramballe refused food and resting his head on his elbow lay silent beside the campfire  looking at the russian soldiers with red and vacant eyes
occasionally he emitted a long drawn groan and then again became silent
morel  pointing to his shoulders  tried to impress on the soldiers the fact that ramballe was an officer and ought to be warmed
a russian officer who had come up to the fire sent to ask his colonel whether he would not take a french officer into his hut to warm him  and when the messenger returned and said that the colonel wished the officer to be brought to him  ramballe was told to go
he rose and tried to walk  but staggered and would have fallen had not a soldier standing by held him up
 you won't do it again  eh   said one of the soldiers  winking and turning mockingly to ramballe
 oh  you fool  why talk rubbish  lout that you are a real peasant   came rebukes from all sides addressed to the jesting soldier
they surrounded ramballe  lifted him on the crossed arms of two soldiers  and carried him to the hut ramballe put his arms around their necks while they carried him and began wailing plaintively   oh  you fine fellows  my kind  kind friends  these are men  oh  my brave  kind friends   and he leaned his head against the shoulder of one of the men like a child meanwhile morel was sitting in the best place by the fire  surrounded by the soldiers
morel  a short sturdy frenchman with inflamed and streaming eyes  was wearing a woman's cloak and had a shawl tied woman fashion round his head over his cap
he was evidently tipsy  and was singing a french song in a hoarse broken voice  with an arm thrown round the nearest soldier
the soldiers simply held their sides as they watched him
 now then  now then  teach us how it goes  i'll soon pick it up
how is it   said the man a singer and a wag whom morel was embracing
 vive henri quatre  vive ce roi valiant   sang morel  winking
 ce diable a quatre     * *  long live henry the fourth  that valiant king  that rowdy devil    vivarika  vif seruvaru  sedyablyaka   repeated the soldier  flourishing his arm and really catching the tune
 bravo  ha  ha  ha   rose their rough  joyous laughter from all sides
morel  wrinkling up his face  laughed too
 well  go on  go on    qui eut le triple talent  de boire  de battre  et d'etre un vert galant   * * who had a triple talent for drinking  for fighting  and for being a gallant old boy  
 it goes smoothly  too
well  now  zaletaev    ke     zaletaev  brought out with effort   ke e e e   he drawled  laboriously pursing his lips   le trip ta la de bu de ba  e de tra va ga la  he sang
 fine  just like the frenchie  oh  ho ho  do you want some more to eat    give him some porridge  it takes a long time to get filled up after starving   they gave him some more porridge and morel with a laugh set to work on his third bowl
all the young soldiers smiled gaily as they watched him
the older men  who thought it undignified to amuse themselves with such nonsense  continued to lie at the opposite side of the fire  but one would occasionally raise himself on an elbow and glance at morel with a smile  they are men too   said one of them as he wrapped himself up in his coat  even wormwood grows on its own root    o lord  o lord  how starry it is  tremendous  that means a hard frost      they all grew silent
the stars  as if knowing that no one was looking at them  began to disport themselves in the dark sky  now flaring up  now vanishing  now trembling  they were busy whispering something gladsome and mysterious to one another the french army melted away at the uniform rate of a mathematical progression  and that crossing of the berezina about which so much has been written was only one intermediate stage in its destruction  and not at all the decisive episode of the campaign
if so much has been and still is written about the berezina  on the french side this is only because at the broken bridge across that river the calamities their army had been previously enduring were suddenly concentrated at one moment into a tragic spectacle that remained in every memory  and on the russian side merely because in petersburg far from the seat of war a plan  again one of pfuel's  had been devised to catch napoleon in a strategic trap at the berezina river
everyone assured himself that all would happen according to plan  and therefore insisted that it was just the crossing of the berezina that destroyed the french army in reality the results of the crossing were much less disastrous to the french in guns and men lost than krasnoe had been  as the figures show
the sole importance of the crossing of the berezina lies in the fact that it plainly and indubitably proved the fallacy of all the plans for cutting off the enemy's retreat and the soundness of the only possible line of action the one kutuzov and the general mass of the army demanded namely  simply to follow the enemy up
the french crowd fled at a continually increasing speed and all its energy was directed to reaching its goal
it fled like a wounded animal and it was impossible to block its path
this was shown not so much by the arrangements it made for crossing as by what took place at the bridges
when the bridges broke down  unarmed soldiers  people from moscow and women with children who were with the french transport  all carried on by vis inertiae pressed forward into boats and into the ice covered water and did not  surrender
that impulse was reasonable
the condition of fugitives and of pursuers was equally bad
as long as they remained with their own people each might hope for help from his fellows and the definite place he held among them
but those who surrendered  while remaining in the same pitiful plight  would be on a lower level to claim a share in the necessities of life
the french did not need to be informed of the fact that half the prisoners with whom the russians did not know what to do perished of cold and hunger despite their captors' desire to save them  they felt that it could not be otherwise
the most compassionate russian commanders  those favorable to the french and even the frenchmen in the russian service could do nothing for the prisoners
the french perished from the conditions to which the russian army was itself exposed
it was impossible to take bread and clothes from our hungry and indispensable soldiers to give to the french who  though not harmful  or hated  or guilty  were simply unnecessary
some russians even did that  but they were exceptions
certain destruction lay behind the french but in front there was hope
their ships had been burned  there was no salvation save in collective flight  and on that the whole strength of the french was concentrated
the farther they fled the more wretched became the plight of the remnant  especially after the berezina  on which  in consequence of the petersburg plan  special hopes had been placed by the russians  and the keener grew the passions of the russian commanders  who blamed one another and kutuzov most of all anticipation that the failure of the petersburg berezina plan would be attributed to kutuzov led to dissatisfaction  contempt  and ridicule  more and more strongly expressed
the ridicule and contempt were of course expressed in a respectful form  making it impossible for him to ask wherein he was to blame
they did not talk seriously to him  when reporting to him or asking for his sanction they appeared to be fulfilling a regrettable formality  but they winked behind his back and tried to mislead him at every turn
because they could not understand him all these people assumed that it was useless to talk to the old man  that he would never grasp the profundity of their plans  that he would answer with his phrases  which they thought were mere phrases  about a  golden bridge   about the impossibility of crossing the frontier with a crowd of tatterdemalions  and so forth
they had heard all that before
and all he said that it was necessary to await provisions  or that the men had no boots was so simple  while what they proposed was so complicated and clever  that it was evident that he was old and stupid and that they  though not in power  were commanders of genius
after the junction with the army of the brilliant admiral and petersburg hero wittgenstein  this mood and the gossip of the staff reached their maximum
kutuzov saw this and merely sighed and shrugged his shoulders
only once  after the affair of the berezina  did he get angry and write to bennigsen  who reported separately to the emperor  the following letter   on account of your spells of ill health  will your excellency please be so good as to set off for kaluga on receipt of this  and there await further commands and appointments from his imperial majesty   but after bennigsen's departure  the grand duke tsarevich constantine pavlovich joined the army
he had taken part in the beginning of the campaign but had subsequently been removed from the army by kutuzov
now having come to the army  he informed kutuzov of the emperor's displeasure at the poor success of our forces and the slowness of their advance
the emperor intended to join the army personally in a few days' time
the old man  experienced in court as well as in military affairs this same kutuzov who in august had been chosen commander in chief against the sovereign's wishes and who had removed the grand duke and heir apparent from the army who on his own authority and contrary to the emperor's will had decided on the abandonment of moscow  now realized at once that his day was over  that his part was played  and that the power he was supposed to hold was no longer his
and he understood this not merely from the attitude of the court
he saw on the one hand that the military business in which he had played his part was ended and felt that his mission was accomplished  and at the same time he began to be conscious of the physical weariness of his aged body and of the necessity of physical rest
on the twenty ninth of november kutuzov entered vilna his  dear vilna  as he called it
twice during his career kutuzov had been governor of vilna
in that wealthy town  which had not been injured  he found old friends and associations  besides the comforts of life of which he had so long been deprived
and he suddenly turned from the cares of army and state and  as far as the passions that seethed around him allowed  immersed himself in the quiet life to which he had formerly been accustomed  as if all that was taking place and all that had still to be done in the realm of history did not concern him at all chichagov  one of the most zealous  cutters off  and  breakers up   who had first wanted to effect a diversion in greece and then in warsaw but never wished to go where he was sent  chichagov  noted for the boldness with which he spoke to the emperor  and who considered kutuzov to be under an obligation to him because when he was sent to make peace with turkey in 1811 independently of kutuzov  and found that peace had already been concluded  he admitted to the emperor that the merit of securing that peace was really kutuzov's  this chichagov was the first to meet kutuzov at the castle where the latter was to stay
in undress naval uniform  with a dirk  and holding his cap under his arm  he handed kutuzov a garrison report and the keys of the town
the contemptuously respectful attitude of the younger men to the old man in his dotage was expressed in the highest degree by the behavior of chichagov  who knew of the accusations that were being directed against kutuzov
when speaking to chichagov  kutuzov incidentally mentioned that the vehicles packed with china that had been captured from him at borisov had been recovered and would be restored to him
 you mean to imply that i have nothing to eat out of   
on the contrary  i can supply you with everything even if you want to give dinner parties   warmly replied chichagov  who tried by every word he spoke to prove his own rectitude and therefore imagined kutuzov to be animated by the same desire
kutuzov  shrugging his shoulders  replied with his subtle penetrating smile   i meant merely to say what i said   contrary to the emperor's wish kutuzov detained the greater part of the army at vilna
those about him said that he became extraordinarily slack and physically feeble during his stay in that town
he attended to army affairs reluctantly  left everything to his generals  and while awaiting the emperor's arrival led a dissipated life
having left petersburg on the seventh of december with his suite count tolstoy  prince volkonski  arakcheev  and others the emperor reached vilna on the eleventh  and in his traveling sleigh drove straight to the castle
in spite of the severe frost some hundred generals and staff officers in full parade uniform stood in front of the castle  as well as a guard of honor of the semenov regiment
a courier who galloped to the castle in advance  in a troyka with three foamflecked horses  shouted  coming   and konovnitsyn rushed into the vestibule to inform kutuzov  who was waiting in the hall porter's little lodge
a minute later the old man's large stout figure in full dress uniform  his chest covered with orders and a scarf drawn round his stomach  waddled out into the porch
he put on his hat with its peaks to the sides and  holding his gloves in his hand and walking with an effort sideways down the steps to the level of the street  took in his hand the report he had prepared for the emperor
there was running to and fro and whispering  another troyka flew furiously up  and then all eyes were turned on an approaching sleigh in which the figures of the emperor and volkonski could already be descried
from the habit of fifty years all this had a physically agitating effect on the old general
he carefully and hastily felt himself all over  readjusted his hat  and pulling himself together drew himself up and  at the very moment when the emperor  having alighted from the sleigh  lifted his eyes to him  handed him the report and began speaking in his smooth  ingratiating voice the emperor with a rapid glance scanned kutuzov from head to foot  frowned for an instant  but immediately mastering himself went up to the old man  extended his arms and embraced him and this embrace too  owing to a longstanding impression related to his innermost feelings  had its usual effect on kutuzov and he gave a sob
the emperor greeted the officers and the semenov guard  and again pressing the old man's hand went with him into the castle
when alone with the field marshal the emperor expressed his dissatisfaction at the slowness of the pursuit and at the mistakes made at krasnoe and the berezina  and informed him of his intentions for a future campaign abroad
kutuzov made no rejoinder or remark
the same submissive  expressionless look with which he had listened to the emperor's commands on the field of austerlitz seven years before settled on his face now
when kutuzov came out of the study and with lowered head was crossing the ballroom with his heavy waddling gait  he was arrested by someone's voice saying   your serene highness   kutuzov raised his head and looked for a long while into the eyes of count tolstoy  who stood before him holding a silver salver on which lay a small object
kutuzov seemed not to understand what was expected of him
suddenly he seemed to remember  a scarcely perceptible smile flashed across his puffy face  and bowing low and respectfully he took the object that lay on the salver
it was the order of st
george of the first class
next day the field marshal gave a dinner and ball which the emperor honored by his presence
kutuzov had received the order of st
george of the first class and the emperor showed him the highest honors  but everyone knew of the imperial dissatisfaction with him
the proprieties were observed and the emperor was the first to set that example  but everybody understood that the old man was blameworthy and good for nothing
when kutuzov  conforming to a custom of catherine's day  ordered the standards that had been captured to be lowered at the emperor's feet on his entering the ballroom  the emperor made a wry face and muttered something in which some people caught the words   the old comedian   the emperor's displeasure with kutuzov was specially increased at vilna by the fact that kutuzov evidently could not or would not understand the importance of the coming campaign
when on the following morning the emperor said to the officers assembled about him   you have not only saved russia  you have saved europe   they all understood that the war was not ended
kutuzov alone would not see this and openly expressed his opinion that no fresh war could improve the position or add to the glory of russia  but could only spoil and lower the glorious position that russia had gained
he tried to prove to the emperor the impossibility of levying fresh troops  spoke of the hardships already endured by the people  of the possibility of failure and so forth
this being the field marshal's frame of mind he was naturally regarded as merely a hindrance and obstacle to the impending war
to avoid unpleasant encounters with the old man  the natural method was to do what had been done with him at austerlitz and with barclay at the beginning of the russian campaign to transfer the authority to the emperor himself  thus cutting the ground from under the commander in chief's feet without upsetting the old man by informing him of the change with this object his staff was gradually reconstructed and its real strength removed and transferred to the emperor
toll  konovnitsyn  and ermolov received fresh appointments
everyone spoke loudly of the field marshal's great weakness and failing health
his health had to be bad for his place to be taken away and given to another
and in fact his health was poor
so naturally  simply  and gradually just as he had come from turkey to the treasury in petersburg to recruit the militia  and then to the army when he was needed there now when his part was played out  kutuzov's place was taken by a new and necessary performer
the war of 1812  besides its national significance dear to every russian heart  was now to assume another  a european  significance
the movement of peoples from west to east was to be succeeded by a movement of peoples from east to west  and for this fresh war another leader was necessary  having qualities and views differing from kutuzov's and animated by different motives
alexander i was as necessary for the movement of the peoples from east to west and for the refixing of national frontiers as kutuzov had been for the salvation and glory of russia
kutuzov did not understand what europe  the balance of power  or napoleon meant
he could not understand it
for the representative of the russian people  after the enemy had been destroyed and russia had been liberated and raised to the summit of her glory  there was nothing left to do as a russian
nothing remained for the representative of the national war but to die  and kutuzov died
as generally happens  pierre did not feel the full effects of the physical privation and strain he had suffered as prisoner until after they were over
after his liberation he reached orel  and on the third day there  when preparing to go to kiev  he fell ill and was laid up for three months
he had what the doctors termed  bilious fever   but despite the fact that the doctors treated him  bled him  and gave him medicines to drink  he recovered
scarcely any impression was left on pierre's mind by all that happened to him from the time of his rescue till his illness
he remembered only the dull gray weather now rainy and now snowy  internal physical distress  and pains in his feet and side
he remembered a general impression of the misfortunes and sufferings of people and of being worried by the curiosity of officers and generals who questioned him  he also remembered his difficulty in procuring a conveyance and horses  and above all he remembered his incapacity to think and feel all that time
on the day of his rescue he had seen the body of petya rostov
that same day he had learned that prince andrew  after surviving the battle of borodino for more than a month had recently died in the rostovs' house at yaroslavl  and denisov who told him this news also mentioned helene's death  supposing that pierre had heard of it long before
all this at the time seemed merely strange to pierre  he felt he could not grasp its significance
just then he was only anxious to get away as quickly as possible from places where people were killing one another  to some peaceful refuge where he could recover himself  rest  and think over all the strange new facts he had learned  but on reaching orel he immediately fell ill when he came to himself after his illness he saw in attendance on him two of his servants  terenty and vaska  who had come from moscow  and also his cousin the eldest princess  who had been living on his estate at elets and hearing of his rescue and illness had come to look after him it was only gradually during his convalescence that pierre lost the impressions he had become accustomed to during the last few months and got used to the idea that no one would oblige him to go anywhere tomorrow  that no one would deprive him of his warm bed  and that he would be sure to get his dinner  tea  and supper
but for a long time in his dreams he still saw himself in the conditions of captivity in the same way little by little he came to understand the news he had been told after his rescue  about the death of prince andrew  the death of his wife  and the destruction of the french
a joyous feeling of freedom that complete inalienable freedom natural to man which he had first experienced at the first halt outside moscow filled pierre's soul during his convalescence
he was surprised to find that this inner freedom  which was independent of external conditions  now had as it were an additional setting of external liberty
he was alone in a strange town  without acquaintances
no one demanded anything of him or sent him anywhere
he had all he wanted  the thought of his wife which had been a continual torment to him was no longer there  since she was no more
 oh  how good  how splendid   said he to himself when a cleanly laid table was moved up to him with savory beef tea  or when he lay down for the night on a soft clean bed  or when he remembered that the french had gone and that his wife was no more  oh  how good  how splendid   and by old habit he asked himself the question   well  and what then  what am i going to do   and he immediately gave himself the answer   well  i shall live ah  how splendid   the very question that had formerly tormented him  the thing he had continually sought to find the aim of life no longer existed for him now
that search for the aim of life had not merely disappeared temporarily he felt that it no longer existed for him and could not present itself again
and this very absence of an aim gave him the complete  joyous sense of freedom which constituted his happiness at this time
he could not see an aim  for he now had faith not faith in any kind of rule  or words  or ideas  but faith in an ever living  ever manifest god
formerly he had sought him in aims he set himself that search for an aim had been simply a search for god  and suddenly in his captivity he had learned not by words or reasoning but by direct feeling what his nurse had told him long ago  that god is here and everywhere
in his captivity he had learned that in karataev god was greater  more infinite and unfathomable than in the architect of the universe recognized by the freemasons
he felt like a man who after straining his eyes to see into the far distance finds what he sought at his very feet
all his life he had looked over the heads of the men around him  when he should have merely looked in front of him without straining his eyes
in the past he had never been able to find that great inscrutable infinite something
he had only felt that it must exist somewhere and had looked for it
in everything near and comprehensible he had only what was limited  petty  commonplace  and senseless
he had equipped himself with a mental telescope and looked into remote space  where petty worldliness hiding itself in misty distance had seemed to him great and infinite merely because it was not clearly seen and such had european life  politics  freemasonry  philosophy  and philanthropy seemed to him
but even then  at moments of weakness as he had accounted them  his mind had penetrated to those distances and he had there seen the same pettiness  worldliness  and senselessness
now  however  he had learned to see the great  eternal  and infinite in everything  and therefore to see it and enjoy its contemplation  he naturally threw away the telescope through which he had till now gazed over men's heads  and gladly regarded the ever changing  eternally great  unfathomable  and infinite life around him
and the closer he looked the more tranquil and happy he became
that dreadful question   what for   which had formerly destroyed all his mental edifices  no longer existed for him
to that question   what for   a simple answer was now always ready in his soul   because there is a god  that god without whose will not one hair falls from a man's head   in external ways pierre had hardly changed at all
in appearance he was just what he used to be
as before he was absent minded and seemed occupied not with what was before his eyes but with something special of his own
the difference between his former and present self was that formerly when he did not grasp what lay before him or was said to him  he had puckered his forehead painfully as if vainly seeking to distinguish something at a distance
at present he still forgot what was said to him and still did not see what was before his eyes  but he now looked with a scarcely perceptible and seemingly ironic smile at what was before him and listened to what was said  though evidently seeing and hearing something quite different
formerly he had appeared to be a kindhearted but unhappy man  and so people had been inclined to avoid him
now a smile at the joy of life always played round his lips  and sympathy for others  shone in his eyes with a questioning look as to whether they were as contented as he was  and people felt pleased by his presence
previously he had talked a great deal  grew excited when he talked  and seldom listened  now he was seldom carried away in conversation and knew how to listen so that people readily told him their most intimate secrets
the princess  who had never liked pierre and had been particularly hostile to him since she had felt herself under obligations to him after the old count's death  now after staying a short time in orel where she had come intending to show pierre that in spite of his ingratitude she considered it her duty to nurse him felt to her surprise and vexation that she had become fond of him
pierre did not in any way seek her approval  he merely studied her with interest
formerly she had felt that he regarded her with indifference and irony  and so had shrunk into herself as she did with others and had shown him only the combative side of her nature  but now he seemed to be trying to understand the most intimate places of her heart  and  mistrustfully at first but afterwards gratefully  she let him see the hidden  kindly sides of her character
the most cunning man could not have crept into her confidence more successfully  evoking memories of the best times of her youth and showing sympathy with them
yet pierre's cunning consisted simply in finding pleasure in drawing out the human qualities of the embittered  hard  and  in her own way  proud princess
 yes  he is a very  very kind man when he is not under the influence of bad people but of people such as myself   thought she
his servants too terenty and vaska in their own way noticed the change that had taken place in pierre
they considered that he had become much  simpler   terenty  when he had helped him undress and wished him good night  often lingered with his master's boots in his hands and clothes over his arm  to see whether he would not start a talk
and pierre  noticing that terenty wanted a chat  generally kept him there
 well  tell me  
now  how did you get food   he would ask
and terenty would begin talking of the destruction of moscow  and of the old count  and would stand for a long time holding the clothes and talking  or sometimes listening to pierre's stories  and then would go out into the hall with a pleasant sense of intimacy with his master and affection for him
the doctor who attended pierre and visited him every day  though he considered it his duty as a doctor to pose as a man whose every moment was of value to suffering humanity  would sit for hours with pierre telling him his favorite anecdotes and his observations on the characters of his patients in general  and especially of the ladies
 it's a pleasure to talk to a man like that  he is not like our provincials   he would say
there were several prisoners from the french army in orel  and the doctor brought one of them  a young italian  to see pierre
this officer began visiting pierre  and the princess used to make fun of the tenderness the italian expressed for him
the italian seemed happy only when he could come to see pierre  talk with him  tell him about his past  his life at home  and his love  and pour out to him his indignation against the french and especially against napoleon
 if all russians are in the least like you  it is sacrilege to fight such a nation   he said to pierre
 you  who have suffered so from the french  do not even feel animosity toward them   pierre had evoked the passionate affection of the italian merely by evoking the best side of his nature and taking a pleasure in so doing
during the last days of pierre's stay in orel his old masonic acquaintance count willarski  who had introduced him to the lodge in 1807  came to see him
willarski was married to a russian heiress who had a large estate in orel province  and he occupied a temporary post in the commissariat department in that town
hearing that bezukhov was in orel  willarski  though they had never been intimate  came to him with the professions of friendship and intimacy that people who meet in a desert generally express for one another
willarski felt dull in orel and was pleased to meet a man of his own circle and  as he supposed  of similar interests
but to his surprise willarski soon noticed that pierre had lagged much behind the times  and had sunk  as he expressed it to himself  into apathy and egotism  you are letting yourself go  my dear fellow   he said
but for all that willarski found it pleasanter now than it had been formerly to be with pierre  and came to see him every day
to pierre as he looked at and listened to willarski  it seemed strange to think that he had been like that himself but a short time before willarski was a married man with a family  busy with his family affairs  his wife's affairs  and his official duties
he regarded all these occupations as hindrances to life  and considered that they were all contemptible because their aim was the welfare of himself and his family military  administrative  political  and masonic interests continually absorbed his attention
and pierre  without trying to change the other's views and without condemning him  but with the quiet  joyful  and amused smile now habitual to him  was interested in this strange though very familiar phenomenon
there was a new feature in pierre's relations with willarski  with the princess  with the doctor  and with all the people he now met  which gained for him the general good will
this was his acknowledgment of the impossibility of changing a man's convictions by words  and his recognition of the possibility of everyone thinking  feeling  and seeing things each from his own point of view
this legitimate peculiarity of each individual which used to excite and irritate pierre now became a basis of the sympathy he felt for  and the interest he took in  other people
the difference  and sometimes complete contradiction  between men's opinions and their lives  and between one man and another  pleased him and drew from him an amused and gentle smile
in practical matters pierre unexpectedly felt within himself a center of gravity he had previously lacked formerly all pecuniary questions  especially requests for money to which  as an extremely wealthy man  he was very exposed  produced in him a state of hopeless agitation and perplexity
 to give or not to give   he had asked himself  i have it and he needs it
but someone else needs it still more
who needs it most  and perhaps they are both impostors   in the old days he had been unable to find a way out of all these surmises and had given to all who asked as long as he had anything to give
formerly he had been in a similar state of perplexity with regard to every question concerning his property  when one person advised one thing and another something else
now to his surprise he found that he no longer felt either doubt or perplexity about these questions
there was now within him a judge who by some rule unknown to him decided what should or should not be done
he was as indifferent as heretofore to money matters  but now he felt certain of what ought and what ought not to be done
the first time he had recourse to his new judge was when a french prisoner  a colonel  came to him and  after talking a great deal about his exploits  concluded by making what amounted to a demand that pierre should give him four thousand francs to send to his wife and children
pierre refused without the least difficulty or effort  and was afterwards surprised how simple and easy had been what used to appear so insurmountably difficult
at the same time that he refused the colonel's demand he made up his mind that he must have recourse to artifice when leaving orel  to induce the italian officer to accept some money of which he was evidently in need
a further proof to pierre of his own more settled outlook on practical matters was furnished by his decision with regard to his wife's debts and to the rebuilding of his houses in and near moscow
his head steward came to him at orel and pierre reckoned up with him his diminished income
the burning of moscow had cost him  according to the head steward's calculation  about two million rubles
to console pierre for these losses the head steward gave him an estimate showing that despite these losses his income would not be diminished but would even be increased if he refused to pay his wife's debts which he was under no obligation to meet  and did not rebuild his moscow house and the country house on his moscow estate  which had cost him eighty thousand rubles a year and brought in nothing
 yes  of course that's true   said pierre with a cheerful smile
 i don't need all that at all
by being ruined i have become much richer   but in january savelich came from moscow and gave him an account of the state of things there  and spoke of the estimate an architect had made of the cost of rebuilding the town and country houses  speaking of this as of a settled matter
about the same time he received letters from prince vasili and other petersburg acquaintances speaking of his wife's debts
and pierre decided that the steward's proposals which had so pleased him were wrong and that he must go to petersburg and settle his wife's affairs and must rebuild in moscow
why this was necessary he did not know  but he knew for certain that it was necessary
his income would be reduced by three fourths  but he felt it must be done
willarski was going to moscow and they agreed to travel together
during the whole time of his convalescence in orel pierre had experienced a feeling of joy  freedom  and life  but when during his journey he found himself in the open world and saw hundreds of new faces  that feeling was intensified throughout his journey he felt like a schoolboy on holiday
everyone the stagecoach driver  the post house overseers  the peasants on the roads and in the villages had a new significance for him
the presence and remarks of willarski who continually deplored the ignorance and poverty of russia and its backwardness compared with europe only heightened pierre's pleasure
where willarski saw deadness pierre saw an extraordinary strength and vitality the strength which in that vast space amid the snows maintained the life of this original  peculiar  and unique people
he did not contradict willarski and even seemed to agree with him an apparent agreement being the simplest way to avoid discussions that could lead to nothing and he smiled joyfully as he listened to him
it would be difficult to explain why and whither ants whose heap has been destroyed are hurrying  some from the heap dragging bits of rubbish  larvae  and corpses  others back to the heap  or why they jostle  overtake one another  and fight  and it would be equally difficult to explain what caused the russians after the departure of the french to throng to the place that had formerly been moscow
but when we watch the ants round their ruined heap  the tenacity  energy  and immense number of the delving insects prove that despite the destruction of the heap  something indestructible  which though intangible is the real strength of the colony  still exists  and similarly  though in moscow in the month of october there was no government and no churches  shrines  riches  or houses it was still the moscow it had been in august
all was destroyed  except something intangible yet powerful and indestructible
the motives of those who thronged from all sides to moscow after it had been cleared of the enemy were most diverse and personal  and at first for the most part savage and brutal
one motive only they all had in common  a desire to get to the place that had been called moscow  to apply their activities there
within a week moscow already had fifteen thousand inhabitants  in a fortnight twenty five thousand  and so on
by the autumn of 1813 the number  ever increasing and increasing  exceeded what it had been in 1812
the first russians to enter moscow were the cossacks of wintzingerode's detachment  peasants from the adjacent villages  and residents who had fled from moscow and had been hiding in its vicinity
the russians who entered moscow  finding it plundered  plundered it in their turn
they continued what the french had begun
trains of peasant carts came to moscow to carry off to the villages what had been abandoned in the ruined houses and the streets
the cossacks carried off what they could to their camps  and the householders seized all they could find in other houses and moved it to their own  pretending that it was their property
but the first plunderers were followed by a second and a third contingent  and with increasing numbers plundering became more and more difficult and assumed more definite forms the french found moscow abandoned but with all the organizations of regular life  with diverse branches of commerce and craftsmanship  with luxury  and governmental and religious institutions
these forms were lifeless but still existed there were bazaars  shops  warehouses  market stalls  granaries for the most part still stocked with goods and there were factories and workshops  palaces and wealthy houses filled with luxuries  hospitals  prisons  government offices  churches  and cathedrals
the longer the french remained the more these forms of town life perished  until finally all was merged into one confused  lifeless scene of plunder the more the plundering by the french continued  the more both the wealth of moscow and the strength of its plunderers was destroyed
but plundering by the russians  with which the reoccupation of the city began  had an opposite effect  the longer it continued and the greater the number of people taking part in it the more rapidly was the wealth of the city and its regular life restored
besides the plunderers  very various people  some drawn by curiosity  some by official duties  some by self interest house owners  clergy  officials of all kinds  tradesmen  artisans  and peasants streamed into moscow as blood flows to the heart
within a week the peasants who came with empty carts to carry off plunder were stopped by the authorities and made to cart the corpses out of the town
other peasants  having heard of their comrades' discomfiture  came to town bringing rye  oats  and hay  and beat down one another's prices to below what they had been in former days gangs of carpenters hoping for high pay arrived in moscow every day  and on all sides logs were being hewn  new houses built  and old  charred ones repaired
tradesmen began trading in booths
cookshops and taverns were opened in partially burned houses
the clergy resumed the services in many churches that had not been burned
donors contributed church property that had been stolen
government clerks set up their baize covered tables and their pigeonholes of documents in small rooms the higher authorities and the police organized the distribution of goods left behind by the french
the owners of houses in which much property had been left  brought there from other houses  complained of the injustice of taking everything to the faceted palace in the kremlin  others insisted that as the french had gathered things from different houses into this or that house  it would be unfair to allow its owner to keep all that was found there
they abused the police and bribed them  made out estimates at ten times their value for government stores that had perished in the fire  and demanded relief
and count rostopchin wrote proclamations
at the end of january pierre went to moscow and stayed in an annex of his house which had not been burned
he called on count rostopchin and on some acquaintances who were back in moscow  and he intended to leave for petersburg two days later
everybody was celebrating the victory  everything was bubbling with life in the ruined but reviving city
everyone was pleased to see pierre  everyone wished to meet him  and everyone questioned him about what he had seen
pierre felt particularly well disposed toward them all  but was now instinctively on his guard for fear of binding himself in any way to all questions put to him whether important or quite trifling such as  where would he live  was he going to rebuild  when was he going to petersburg and would he mind taking a parcel for someone  he replied   yes  perhaps   or   i think so   and so on
he had heard that the rostovs were at kostroma but the thought of natasha seldom occurred to him
if it did it was only as a pleasant memory of the distant past
he felt himself not only free from social obligations but also from that feeling which  it seemed to him  he had aroused in himself on the third day after his arrival he heard from the drubetskoys that princess mary was in moscow
the death  sufferings  and last days of prince andrew had often occupied pierre's thoughts and now recurred to him with fresh vividness
having heard at dinner that princess mary was in moscow and living in her house which had not been burned in vozdvizhenka street  he drove that same evening to see her
on his way to the house pierre kept thinking of prince andrew  of their friendship  of his various meetings with him  and especially of the last one at borodino
 is it possible that he died in the bitter frame of mind he was then in  is it possible that the meaning of life was not disclosed to him before he died   thought pierre
he recalled karataev and his death and involuntarily began to compare these two men  so different  and yet so similar in that they had both lived and both died and in the love he felt for both of them
pierre drove up to the house of the old prince in a most serious mood
the house had escaped the fire  it showed signs of damage but its general aspect was unchanged
the old footman  who met pierre with a stern face as if wishing to make the visitor feel that the absence of the old prince had not disturbed the order of things in the house  informed him that the princess had gone to her own apartments  and that she received on sundays
 announce me
perhaps she will see me   said pierre
 yes  sir   said the man
 please step into the portrait gallery   a few minutes later the footman returned with dessalles  who brought word from the princess that she would be very glad to see pierre if he would excuse her want of ceremony and come upstairs to her apartment
in a rather low room lit by one candle sat the princess and with her another person dressed in black
pierre remembered that the princess always had lady companions  but who they were and what they were like he never knew or remembered
 this must be one of her companions   he thought  glancing at the lady in the black dress
the princess rose quickly to meet him and held out her hand
 yes   she said  looking at his altered face after he had kissed her hand   so this is how we meet again
he spoke of you even at the very last   she went on  turning her eyes from pierre to her companion with a shyness that surprised him for an instant
 i was so glad to hear of your safety
it was the first piece of good news we had received for a long time   again the princess glanced round at her companion with even more uneasiness in her manner and was about to add something  but pierre interrupted her
 just imagine i knew nothing about him   said he
 i thought he had been killed
all i know i heard at second hand from others
i only know that he fell in with the rostovs   
what a strange coincidence   pierre spoke rapidly and with animation
he glanced once at the companion's face  saw her attentive and kindly gaze fixed on him  and  as often happens when one is talking  felt somehow that this companion in the black dress was a good  kind  excellent creature who would not hinder his conversing freely with princess mary
but when he mentioned the rostovs  princess mary's face expressed still greater embarrassment
she again glanced rapidly from pierre's face to that of the lady in the black dress and said   do you really not recognize her   pierre looked again at the companion's pale  delicate face with its black eyes and peculiar mouth  and something near to him  long forgotten and more than sweet  looked at him from those attentive eyes
 but no  it can't be   he thought
 this stern  thin  pale face that looks so much older  it cannot be she
it merely reminds me of her   but at that moment princess mary said   natasha   and with difficulty  effort  and stress  like the opening of a door grown rusty on its hinges  a smile appeared on the face with the attentive eyes  and from that opening door came a breath of fragrance which suffused pierre with a happiness he had long forgotten and of which he had not even been thinking especially at that moment
it suffused him  seized him  and enveloped him completely
when she smiled doubt was no longer possible  it was natasha and he loved her
at that moment pierre involuntarily betrayed to her  to princess mary  and above all to himself  a secret of which he himself had been unaware he flushed joyfully yet with painful distress
he tried to hide his agitation
but the more he tried to hide it the more clearly clearer than any words could have done did he betray to himself  to her  and to princess mary that he loved her  no  it's only the unexpectedness of it   thought pierre
but as soon as he tried to continue the conversation he had begun with princess mary he again glanced at natasha  and a still deeper flush suffused his face and a stillstronger agitation of mingled joy and fear seized his soul
he became confused in his speech and stopped in the middle of what he was saying
pierre had failed to notice natasha because he did not at all expect to see her there  but he had failed to recognize her because the change in her since he last saw her was immense
she had grown thin and pale  but that was not what made her unrecognizable  she was unrecognizable at the moment he entered because on that face whose eyes had always shone with a suppressed smile of the joy of life  now when he first entered and glanced at her there was not the least shadow of a smile  only her eyes were kindly attentive and sadly interrogative
pierre's confusion was not reflected by any confusion on natasha's part  but only by the pleasure that just perceptibly lit up her whole face
 she has come to stay with me   said princess mary
 the count and countess will be here in a few days
the countess is in a dreadful state  but it was necessary for natasha herself to see a doctor
they insisted on her coming with me    yes  is there a family free from sorrow now   said pierre  addressing natasha
 you know it happened the very day we were rescued
i saw him
what a delightful boy he was   natasha looked at him  and by way of answer to his words her eyes widened and lit up
 what can one say or think of as a consolation   said pierre
 nothing  why had such a splendid boy  so full of life  to die    yes  in these days it would be hard to live without faith     remarked princess mary
 yes  yes  that is really true   pierre hastily interrupted her
 why is it true   natasha asked  looking attentively into pierre's eyes
 how can you ask why   said princess mary
 the thought alone of what awaits     natasha without waiting for princess mary to finish again looked inquiringly at pierre
 and because   pierre continued   only one who believes that there is a god ruling us can bear a loss such as hers and  
yours   natasha had already opened her mouth to speak but suddenly stopped
pierre hurriedly turned away from her and again addressed princess mary  asking about his friend's last days
pierre's confusion had now almost vanished  but at the same time he felt that his freedom had also completely gone
he felt that there was now a judge of his every word and action whose judgment mattered more to him than that of all the rest of the world
as he spoke now he was considering what impression his words would make on natasha
he did not purposely say things to please her  but whatever he was saying he regarded from her standpoint
princess mary reluctantly as is usual in such cases began telling of the condition in which she had found prince andrew
but pierre's face quivering with emotion  his questions and his eager restless expression  gradually compelled her to go into details which she feared to recall for her own sake
 yes  yes  and so      pierre kept saying as he leaned toward her with his whole body and eagerly listened to her story
 yes  yes  
so he grew tranquil and softened  with all his soul he had always sought one thing to be perfectly good so he could not be afraid of death
the faults he had if he had any were not of his making
so he did soften   
what a happy thing that he saw you again   he added  suddenly turning to natasha and looking at her with eyes full of tears
natasha's face twitched
she frowned and lowered her eyes for a moment
she hesitated for an instant whether to speak or not
 yes  that was happiness   she then said in her quiet voice with its deep chest notes
 for me it certainly was happiness   she paused
 and he  
he  
he said he was wishing for it at the very moment i entered the room      natasha's voice broke
she blushed  pressed her clasped hands on her knees  and then controlling herself with an evident effort lifted her head and began to speak rapidly
 we knew nothing of it when we started from moscow
i did not dare to ask about him
then suddenly sonya told me he was traveling with us
i had no idea and could not imagine what state he was in  all i wanted was to see him and be with him   she said  trembling  and breathing quickly
and not letting them interrupt her she went on to tell what she had never yet mentioned to anyone all she had lived through during those three weeks of their journey and life at yaroslavl
pierre listened to her with lips parted and eyes fixed upon her full of tears
as he listened he did not think of prince andrew  nor of death  nor of what she was telling
he listened to her and felt only pity for her  for what she was suffering now while she was speaking
princess mary  frowning in her effort to hold back her tears  sat beside natasha  and heard for the first time the story of those last days of her brother's and natasha's love
evidently natasha needed to tell that painful yet joyful tale
she spoke  mingling most trifling details with the intimate secrets of her soul  and it seemed as if she could never finish
several times she repeated the same thing twice
dessalles' voice was heard outside the door asking whether little nicholas might come in to say good night
 well  that's all everything   said natasha
she got up quickly just as nicholas entered  almost ran to the door which was hidden by curtains  struck her head against it  and rushed from the room with a moan either of pain or sorrow
pierre gazed at the door through which she had disappeared and did not understand why he suddenly felt all alone in the world
princess mary roused him from his abstraction by drawing his attention to her nephew who had entered the room
at that moment of emotional tenderness young nicholas' face  which resembled his father's  affected pierre so much that when he had kissed the boy he got up quickly  took out his handkerchief  and went to the window
he wished to take leave of princess mary  but she would not let him go
 no  natasha and i sometimes don't go to sleep till after two  so please don't go
i will order supper
go downstairs  we will come immediately   before pierre left the room princess mary told him   this is the first time she has talked of him like that   pierre was shown into the large  brightly lit dining room  a few minutes later he heard footsteps and princess mary entered with natasha
natasha was calm  though a severe and grave expression had again settled on her face
they all three of them now experienced that feeling of awkwardness which usually follows after a serious and heartfelt talk
it is impossible to go back to the same conversation  to talk of trifles is awkward  and yet the desire to speak is there and silence seems like affectation they went silently to table
the footmen drew back the chairs and pushed them up again
pierre unfolded his cold table napkin and  resolving to break the silence  looked at natasha and at princess mary
they had evidently both formed the same resolution  the eyes of both shone with satisfaction and a confession that besides sorrow life also has joy
 do you take vodka  count   asked princess mary  and those words suddenly banished the shadows of the past
 now tell us about yourself   said she
 one hears such improbable wonders about you    yes   replied pierre with the smile of mild irony now habitual to him
 they even tell me wonders i myself never dreamed of  mary abramovna invited me to her house and kept telling me what had happened  or ought to have happened  to me
stepan stepanych also instructed me how i ought to tell of my experiences
in general i have noticed that it is very easy to be an interesting man  i am an interesting man now   people invite me out and tell me all about myself   natasha smiled and was on the point of speaking
 we have been told   princess mary interrupted her   that you lost two millions in moscow
is that true    but i am three times as rich as before   returned pierre
though the position was now altered by his decision to pay his wife's debts and to rebuild his houses  pierre still maintained that he had become three times as rich as before
 what i have certainly gained is freedom   he began seriously  but did not continue  noticing that this theme was too egotistic
 and are you building    yes
savelich says i must    tell me  you did not know of the countess' death when you decided to remain in moscow   asked princess mary and immediately blushed  noticing that her question  following his mention of freedom  ascribed to his words a meaning he had perhaps not intended
 no   answered pierre  evidently not considering awkward the meaning princess mary had given to his words
 i heard of it in orel and you cannot imagine how it shocked me
we were not an exemplary couple   he added quickly  glancing at natasha and noticing on her face curiosity as to how he would speak of his wife   but her death shocked me terribly
when two people quarrel they are always both in fault  and one's own guilt suddenly becomes terribly serious when the other is no longer alive
and then such a death  
without friends and without consolation  i am very  very sorry for her   he concluded  and was pleased to notice a look of glad approval on natasha's face
 yes  and so you are once more an eligible bachelor   said princess mary
pierre suddenly flushed crimson and for a long time tried not to look at natasha when he ventured to glance her way again her face was cold  stern  and he fancied even contemptuous
 and did you really see and speak to napoleon  as we have been told   said princess mary
pierre laughed
 no  not once  everybody seems to imagine that being taken prisoner means being napoleon's guest not only did i never see him but i heard nothing about him i was in much lower company   supper was over  and pierre who at first declined to speak about his captivity was gradually led on to do so
 but it's true that you remained in moscow to kill napoleon   natasha asked with a slight smile
 i guessed it then when we met at the sukharev tower  do you remember   pierre admitted that it was true  and from that was gradually led by princess mary's questions and especially by natasha's into giving a detailed account of his adventures
at first he spoke with the amused and mild irony now customary with him toward everybody and especially toward himself  but when he came to describe the horrors and sufferings he had witnessed he was unconsciously carried away and began speaking with the suppressed emotion of a man reexperiencing in recollection strong impressions he has lived through princess mary with a gentle smile looked now at pierre and now at natasha
in the whole narrative she saw only pierre and his goodness
natasha  leaning on her elbow  the expression of her face constantly changing with the narrative  watched pierre with an attention that never wandered evidently herself experiencing all that he described
not only her look  but her exclamations and the brief questions she put  showed pierre that she understood just what he wished to convey
it was clear that she understood not only what he said but also what he wished to  but could not  express in words
the account pierre gave of the incident with the child and the woman for protecting whom he was arrested was this   it was an awful sight children abandoned  some in the flames  
one was snatched out before my eyes  
and there were women who had their things snatched off and their earrings torn out     he flushed and grew confused
 then a patrol arrived and all the men all those who were not looting  that is were arrested  and i among them    i am sure you're not telling us everything  i am sure you did something     said natasha and pausing added   something fine   pierre continued
when he spoke of the execution he wanted to pass over the horrible details  but natasha insisted that he should not omit anything
pierre began to tell about karataev  but paused
by this time he had risen from the table and was pacing the room  natasha following him with her eyes
then he added   no  you can't understand what i learned from that illiterate man that simple fellow    yes  yes  go on   said natasha
 where is he    they killed him almost before my eyes   and pierre  his voice trembling continually  went on to tell of the last days of their retreat  of karataev's illness and his death
he told of his adventures as he had never yet recalled them
he now  as it were  saw a new meaning in all he had gone through
now that he was telling it all to natasha he experienced that pleasure which a man has when women listen to him not clever women who when listening either try to remember what they hear to enrich their minds and when opportunity offers to retell it  or who wish to adopt it to some thought of their own and promptly contribute their own clever comments prepared in their little mental workshop but the pleasure given by real women gifted with a capacity to select and absorb the very best a man shows of himself natasha without knowing it was all attention  she did not lose a word  no single quiver in pierre's voice  no look  no twitch of a muscle in his face  nor a single gesture
she caught the unfinished word in its flight and took it straight into her open heart  divining the secret meaning of all pierre's mental travail
princess mary understood his story and sympathized with him  but she now saw something else that absorbed all her attention
she saw the possibility of love and happiness between natasha and pierre  and the first thought of this filled her heart with gladness
it was three o'clock in the morning
the footmen came in with sad and stern faces to change the candles  but no one noticed them
pierre finished his story
natasha continued to look at him intently with bright  attentive  and animated eyes  as if trying to understand something more which he had perhaps left untold
pierre in shamefaced and happy confusion glanced occasionally at her  and tried to think what to say next to introduce a fresh subject
princess mary was silent
it occurred to none of them that it was three o'clock and time to go to bed
 people speak of misfortunes and sufferings   remarked pierre   but if at this moment i were asked  'would you rather be what you were before you were taken prisoner  or go through all this again ' then for heaven's sake let me again have captivity and horseflesh  we imagine that when we are thrown out of our usual ruts all is lost  but it is only then that what is new and good begins
while there is life there is happiness
there is much  much before us
i say this to you   he added  turning to natasha
 yes  yes   she said  answering something quite different
 i too should wish nothing but to relive it all from the beginning   pierre looked intently at her
 yes  and nothing more   said natasha
 it's not true  not true   cried pierre
 i am not to blame for being alive and wishing to live nor you either   suddenly natasha bent her head  covered her face with her hands  and began to cry
 what is it  natasha   said princess mary
 nothing  nothing   she smiled at pierre through her tears
 good night  it is time for bed   pierre rose and took his leave
princess mary and natasha met as usual in the bedroom
they talked of what pierre had told them
princess mary did not express her opinion of pierre nor did natasha speak of him
 well  good night  mary   said natasha
 do you know  i am often afraid that by not speaking of him   she meant prince andrew   for fear of not doing justice to our feelings  we forget him   princess mary sighed deeply and thereby acknowledged the justice of natasha's remark  but she did not express agreement in words
 is it possible to forget   said she
 it did me so much good to tell all about it today
it was hard and painful  but good  very good   said natasha
 i am sure he really loved him
that is why i told him  
was it all right   she added  suddenly blushing
 to tell pierre  oh  yes
what a splendid man he is   said princess mary
 do you know  mary     natasha suddenly said with a mischievous smile such as princess mary had not seen on her face for a long time   he has somehow grown so clean  smooth  and fresh as if he had just come out of a russian bath  do you understand  out of a moral bath
isn't it true    yes   replied princess mary
 he has greatly improved    with a short coat and his hair cropped  just as if  well  just as if he had come straight from the bath  
papa used to      i understand why he   prince andrew   liked no one so much as him   said princess mary
 yes  and yet he is quite different
they say men are friends when they are quite different
that must be true
really he is quite unlike him in everything    yes  but he's wonderful    well  good night   said natasha
and the same mischievous smile lingered for a long time on her face as if it had been forgotten there
it was a long time before pierre could fall asleep that night
he paced up and down his room  now turning his thoughts on a difficult problem and frowning  now suddenly shrugging his shoulders and wincing  and now smiling happily
he was thinking of prince andrew  of natasha  and of their love  at one moment jealous of her past  then reproaching himself for that feeling it was already six in the morning and he still paced up and down the room
 well  what's to be done if it cannot be avoided  what's to be done  evidently it has to be so   said he to himself  and hastily undressing he got into bed  happy and agitated but free from hesitation or indecision  strange and impossible as such happiness seems  i must do everything that she and i may be man and wife   he told himself a few days previously pierre had decided to go to petersburg on the friday
when he awoke on the thursday  savelich came to ask him about packing for the journey
 what  to petersburg  what is petersburg  who is there in petersburg   he asked involuntarily  though only to himself  oh  yes  long ago before this happened i did for some reason mean to go to petersburg   he reflected
 why  but perhaps i shall go
what a good fellow he is and how attentive  and how he remembers everything   he thought  looking at savelich's old face   and what a pleasant smile he has    well  savelich  do you still not wish to accept your freedom   pierre asked him
 what's the good of freedom to me  your excellency  we lived under the late count the kingdom of heaven be his  and we have lived under you too  without ever being wronged    and your children    the children will live just the same
with such masters one can live    but what about my heirs   said pierre
 supposing i suddenly marry  
it might happen   he added with an involuntary smile
 if i may take the liberty  your excellency  it would be a good thing    how easy he thinks it   thought pierre
 he doesn't know how terrible it is and how dangerous
too soon or too late  
it is terrible    so what are your orders  are you starting tomorrow   asked savelich
 no  i'll put it off for a bit
i'll tell you later
you must forgive the trouble i have put you to   said pierre  and seeing savelich smile  he thought   but how strange it is that he should not know that now there is no petersburg for me  and that that must be settled first of all  but probably he knows it well enough and is only pretending
shall i have a talk with him and see what he thinks   pierre reflected
 no  another time   at breakfast pierre told the princess  his cousin  that he had been to see princess mary the day before and had there met  whom do you think  natasha rostova   the princess seemed to see nothing more extraordinary in that than if he had seen anna semenovna
 do you know her   asked pierre
 i have seen the princess   she replied
 i heard that they were arranging a match for her with young rostov
it would be a very good thing for the rostovs  they are said to be utterly ruined    no  i mean do you know natasha rostova    i heard about that affair of hers at the time
it was a great pity    no  she either doesn't understand or is pretending   thought pierre
 better not say anything to her either   the princess too had prepared provisions for pierre's journey
 how kind they all are   thought pierre
 what is surprising is that they should trouble about these things now when it can no longer be of interest to them
and all for me   on the same day the chief of police came to pierre  inviting him to send a representative to the faceted palace to recover things that were to be returned to their owners that day
 and this man too   thought pierre  looking into the face of the chief of police
 what a fine  good looking officer and how kind
fancy bothering about such trifles now  and they actually say he is not honest and takes bribes
what nonsense  besides  why shouldn't he take bribes  that's the way he was brought up  and everybody does it
but what a kind  pleasant face and how he smiles as he looks at me   pierre went to princess mary's to dinner
as he drove through the streets past the houses that had been burned down  he was surprised by the beauty of those ruins
the picturesqueness of the chimney stacks and tumble down walls of the burned out quarters of the town  stretching out and concealing one another  reminded him of the rhine and the colosseum the cabmen he met and their passengers  the carpenters cutting the timber for new houses with axes  the women hawkers  and the shopkeepers  all looked at him with cheerful beaming eyes that seemed to say   ah  there he is  let's see what will come of it   at the entrance to princess mary's house pierre felt doubtful whether he had really been there the night before and really seen natasha and talked to her
 perhaps i imagined it  perhaps i shall go in and find no one there   but he had hardly entered the room before he felt her presence with his whole being by the loss of his sense of freedom
she was in the same black dress with soft folds and her hair was done the same way as the day before  yet she was quite different
had she been like this when he entered the day before he could not for a moment have failed to recognize her
she was as he had known her almost as a child and later on as prince andrew's fiancee
a bright questioning light shone in her eyes  and on her face was a friendly and strangely roguish expression
pierre dined with them and would have spent the whole evening there  but princess mary was going to vespers and pierre left the house with her
next day he came early  dined  and stayed the whole evening
though princess mary and natasha were evidently glad to see their visitor and though all pierre's interest was now centered in that house  by the evening they had talked over everything and the conversation passed from one trivial topic to another and repeatedly broke off
he stayed so long that princess mary and natasha exchanged glances  evidently wondering when he would go
pierre noticed this but could not go
he felt uneasy and embarrassed  but sat on because he simply could not get up and take his leave
princess mary  foreseeing no end to this  rose first  and complaining of a headache began to say good night
 so you are going to petersburg tomorrow   she asked
 no  i am not going   pierre replied hastily  in a surprised tone and as though offended
 yes  
no  
to petersburg  tomorrow but i won't say good by yet
i will call round in case you have any commissions for me   said he  standing before princess mary and turning red  but not taking his departure
natasha gave him her hand and went out
princess mary on the other hand instead of going away sank into an armchair  and looked sternly and intently at him with her deep  radiant eyes
the weariness she had plainly shown before had now quite passed off
with a deep and long drawn sigh she seemed to be prepared for a lengthy talk
when natasha left the room pierre's confusion and awkwardness immediately vanished and were replaced by eager excitement
he quickly moved an armchair toward princess mary
 yes  i wanted to tell you   said he  answering her look as if she had spoken
 princess  help me  what am i to do  can i hope  princess  my dear friend  listen  i know it all
i know i am not worthy of her  i know it's impossible to speak of it now
but i want to be a brother to her
no  not that  i don't  i can't     he paused and rubbed his face and eyes with his hands
 well   he went on with an evident effort at self control and coherence
 i don't know when i began to love her  but i have loved her and her alone all my life  and i love her so that i cannot imagine life without her
i cannot propose to her at present  but the thought that perhaps she might someday be my wife and that i may be missing that possibility  
that possibility  
is terrible
tell me  can i hope  tell me what i am to do  dear princess   he added after a pause  and touched her hand as she did not reply
 i am thinking of what you have told me   answered princess mary
 this is what i will say
you are right that to speak to her of love at present     princess mary stopped
she was going to say that to speak of love was impossible  but she stopped because she had seen by the sudden change in natasha two days before that she would not only not be hurt if pierre spoke of his love  but that it was the very thing she wished for
 to speak to her now wouldn't do   said the princess all the same
 but what am i to do    leave it to me   said princess mary
 i know     pierre was looking into princess mary's eyes
 well   
well      he said
 i know that she loves  
will love you   princess mary corrected herself
before her words were out  pierre had sprung up and with a frightened expression seized princess mary's hand
 what makes you think so  you think i may hope  you think       yes  i think so   said princess mary with a smile
 write to her parents  and leave it to me
i will tell her when i can
i wish it to happen and my heart tells me it will    no  it cannot be  how happy i am  but it can't be   
how happy i am  no  it can't be   pierre kept saying as he kissed princess mary's hands
 go to petersburg  that will be best
and i will write to you   she said
 to petersburg  go there  very well  i'll go
but i may come again tomorrow   next day pierre came to say good by
natasha was less animated than she had been the day before  but that day as he looked at her pierre sometimes felt as if he was vanishing and that neither he nor she existed any longer  that nothing existed but happiness
 is it possible  no  it can't be   he told himself at every look  gesture  and word that filled his soul with joy when on saying good by he took her thin  slender hand  he could not help holding it a little longer in his own
 is it possible that this hand  that face  those eyes  all this treasure of feminine charm so strange to me now  is it possible that it will one day be mine forever  as familiar to me as i am to myself   
no  that's impossible       good bye  count   she said aloud
 i shall look forward very much to your return   she added in a whisper
and these simple words  her look  and the expression on her face which accompanied them  formed for two months the subject of inexhaustible memories  interpretations  and happy meditations for pierre
 'i shall look forward very much to your return    ' yes  yes  how did she say it  yes  'i shall look forward very much to your return ' oh  how happy i am  what is happening to me  how happy i am   said pierre to himself there was nothing in pierre's soul now at all like what had troubled it during his courtship of helene
he did not repeat to himself with a sickening feeling of shame the words he had spoken  or say   oh  why did i not say that   and   whatever made me say 'je vous aime'   on the contrary  he now repeated in imagination every word that he or natasha had spoken and pictured every detail of her face and smile  and did not wish to diminish or add anything  but only to repeat it again and again there was now not a shadow of doubt in his mind as to whether what he had undertaken was right or wrong
only one terrible doubt sometimes crossed his mind   wasn't it all a dream  isn't princess mary mistaken  am i not too conceited and self confident  i believe all this and suddenly princess mary will tell her  and she will be sure to smile and say  'how strange  he must be deluding himself doesn't he know that he is a man  just a man  while i     i am something altogether different and higher '  that was the only doubt often troubling pierre
he did not now make any plans
the happiness before him appeared so inconceivable that if only he could attain it  it would be the end of all things
everything ended with that
a joyful  unexpected frenzy  of which he had thought himself incapable  possessed him the whole meaning of life not for him alone but for the whole world seemed to him centered in his love and the possibility of being loved by her
at times everybody seemed to him to be occupied with one thing only his future happiness
sometimes it seemed to him that other people were all as pleased as he was himself and merely tried to hide that pleasure by pretending to be busy with other interests in every word and gesture he saw allusions to his happiness
he often surprised those he met by his significantly happy looks and smiles which seemed to express a secret understanding between him and them
and when he realized that people might not be aware of his happiness  he pitied them with his whole heart and felt a desire somehow to explain to them that all that occupied them was a mere frivolous trifle unworthy of attention
when it was suggested to him that he should enter the civil service  or when the war or any general political affairs were discussed on the assumption that everybody's welfare depended on this or that issue of events  he would listen with a mild and pitying smile and surprise people by his strange comments
but at this time he saw everybody both those who  as he imagined  understood the real meaning of life  that is  what he was feeling  and those unfortunates who evidently did not understand it in the bright light of the emotion that shone within himself  and at once without any effort saw in everyone he met everything that was good and worthy of being loved when dealing with the affairs and papers of his dead wife  her memory aroused in him no feeling but pity that she had not known the bliss he now knew
prince vasili  who having obtained a new post and some fresh decorations was particularly proud at this time  seemed to him a pathetic  kindly old man much to be pitied
often in afterlife pierre recalled this period of blissful insanity
all the views he formed of men and circumstances at this time remained true for him always he not only did not renounce them subsequently  but when he was in doubt or inwardly at variance  he referred to the views he had held at this time of his madness and they always proved correct
 i may have appeared strange and queer then   he thought   but i was not so mad as i seemed
on the contrary i was then wiser and had more insight than at any other time  and understood all that is worth understanding in life  because  
because i was happy   pierre's insanity consisted in not waiting  as he used to do  to discover personal attributes which he termed  good qualities  in people before loving them  his heart was now overflowing with love  and by loving people without cause he discovered indubitable causes for loving them
after pierre's departure that first evening  when natasha had said to princess mary with a gaily mocking smile   he looks just  yes  just as if he had come out of a russian bath in a short coat and with his hair cropped   something hidden and unknown to herself  but irrepressible  awoke in natasha's soul
everything  her face  walk  look  and voice  was suddenly altered
to her own surprise a power of life and hope of happiness rose to the surface and demanded satisfaction
from that evening she seemed to have forgotten all that had happened to her
she no longer complained of her position  did not say a word about the past  and no longer feared to make happy plans for the future
she spoke little of pierre  but when princess mary mentioned him a long extinguished light once more kindled in her eyes and her lips curved with a strange smile
the change that took place in natasha at first surprised princess mary  but when she understood its meaning it grieved her
 can she have loved my brother so little as to be able to forget him so soon   she thought when she reflected on the change
but when she was with natasha she was not vexed with her and did not reproach her
the reawakened power of life that had seized natasha was so evidently irrepressible and unexpected by her that in her presence princess mary felt that she had no right to reproach her even in her heart
natasha gave herself up so fully and frankly to this new feeling that she did not try to hide the fact that she was no longer sad  but bright and cheerful
when princess mary returned to her room after her nocturnal talk with pierre  natasha met her on the threshold
 he has spoken  yes  he has spoken   she repeated
and a joyful yet pathetic expression which seemed to beg forgiveness for her joy settled on natasha's face
 i wanted to listen at the door  but i knew you would tell me   understandable and touching as the look with which natasha gazed at her seemed to princess mary  and sorry as she was to see her agitation  these words pained her for a moment
she remembered her brother and his love
 but what's to be done  she can't help it   thought the princess
and with a sad and rather stern look she told natasha all that pierre had said
on hearing that he was going to petersburg natasha was astounded
 to petersburg   she repeated as if unable to understand
but noticing the grieved expression on princess mary's face she guessed the reason of that sadness and suddenly began to cry
 mary   said she   tell me what i should do  i am afraid of being bad
whatever you tell me  i will do
tell me       you love him    yes   whispered natasha
 then why are you crying  i am happy for your sake   said princess mary  who because of those tears quite forgave natasha's joy
 it won't be just yet someday
think what fun it will be when i am his wife and you marry nicholas    natasha  i have asked you not to speak of that
let us talk about you   they were silent awhile
 but why go to petersburg   natasha suddenly asked  and hastily replied to her own question
 but no  no  he must  
yes  mary  he must      first epilogue  1813 – 20 seven years had passed
the storm tossed sea of european history had subsided within its shores and seemed to have become calm
but the mysterious forces that move humanity  mysterious because the laws of their motion are unknown to us  continued to operate
though the surface of the sea of history seemed motionless  the movement of humanity went on as unceasingly as the flow of time
various groups of people formed and dissolved  the coming formation and dissolution of kingdoms and displacement of peoples was in course of preparation the sea of history was not driven spasmodically from shore to shore as previously
it was seething in its depths
historic figures were not borne by the waves from one shore to another as before
they now seemed to rotate on one spot
the historical figures at the head of armies  who formerly reflected the movement of the masses by ordering wars  campaigns  and battles  now reflected the restless movement by political and diplomatic combinations  laws  and treaties
the historians call this activity of the historical figures  the reaction   in dealing with this period they sternly condemn the historical personages who  in their opinion  caused what they describe as the reaction
all the wellknown people of that period  from alexander and napoleon to madame de stael  photius  schelling  fichte  chateaubriand  and the rest  pass before their stern judgment seat and are acquitted or condemned according to whether they conduced to progress or to reaction
according to their accounts a reaction took place at that time in russia also  and the chief culprit was alexander i  the same man who according to them was the chief cause of the liberal movement at the commencement of his reign  being the savior of russia
there is no one in russian literature now  from schoolboy essayist to learned historian  who does not throw his little stone at alexander for things he did wrong at this period of his reign
 he ought to have acted in this way and in that way
in this case he did well and in that case badly
he behaved admirably at the beginning of his reign and during 1812  but acted badly by giving a constitution to poland  forming the holy alliance  entrusting power to arakcheev  favoring golitsyn and mysticism  and afterwards shishkov and photius
he also acted badly by concerning himself with the active army and disbanding the semenov regiment   it would take a dozen pages to enumerate all the reproaches the historians address to him  based on their knowledge of what is good for humanity what do these reproaches mean  do not the very actions for which the historians praise alexander i  the liberal attempts at the beginning of his reign  his struggle with napoleon  the firmness he displayed in 1812 and the campaign of 1813  flow from the same sources  the circumstances of his birth  education  and life that made his personality what it was and from which the actions for which they blame him  the holy alliance  the restoration of poland  and the reaction of 1820 and later  also flowed  in what does the substance of those reproaches lie  it lies in the fact that an historic character like alexander i  standing on the highest possible pinnacle of human power with the blinding light of history focused upon him  a character exposed to those strongest of all influences  the intrigues  flattery  and self deception inseparable from power  a character who at every moment of his life felt a responsibility for all that was happening in europe  and not a fictitious but a live character who like every man had his personal habits  passions  and impulses toward goodness  beauty  and truth  that this character though not lacking in virtue  the historians do not accuse him of that  had not the same conception of the welfare of humanity fifty years ago as a present day professor who from his youth upwards has been from them but even if we assume that fifty years ago alexander i was mistaken in his view of what was good for the people  we must inevitably assume that the historian who judges alexander will also after the lapse of some time turn out to be mistaken in his view of what is good for humanity
this assumption is all the more natural and inevitable because  watching the movement of history  we see that every year and with each new writer  opinion as to what is good for mankind changes  so that what once seemed good  ten years later seems bad  and vice versa and what is more  we find at one and the same time quite contradictory views as to what is bad and what is good in history  some people regard giving a constitution to poland and forming the holy alliance as praiseworthy in alexander  while others regard it as blameworthy
the activity of alexander or of napoleon cannot be called useful or harmful  for it is impossible to say for what it was useful or harmful
if that activity displeases somebody  this is only because it does not agree with his limited understanding of what is good
whether the preservation of my father's house in moscow  or the glory of the russian arms  or the prosperity of the petersburg and other universities  or the freedom of poland or the greatness of russia  or the balance of power in europe  or a certain kind of european culture called  progress  appear to me to be good or bad  i must admit that besides these things the action of every historic character has other more general purposes inaccessible to me but let us assume that what is called science can harmonize all contradictions and possesses an unchanging standard of good and bad by which to try historic characters and events  let us say that alexander could have done everything differently  let us say that with guidance from those who blame him and who profess to know the ultimate aim of the movement of humanity  he might have arranged matters according to the program his present accusers would have given him of nationality  freedom  equality  and progress  these  i think  cover the ground 
let us assume that this program was possible and had then been formulated  and that alexander had acted on it
what would then have become of the activity of all those who opposed the tendency that then prevailed in the government an activity that in the opinion of the historians was good and beneficent  their activity would not have existed  there would have been no life  there would have been nothing
if we admit that human life can be ruled by reason  the possibility of life is destroyed
if we assume as the historians do that great men lead humanity to the attainment of certain ends the greatness of russia or of france  the balance of power in europe  the diffusion of the ideas of the revolution  general progress  or anything else then it is impossible to explain the facts of history without introducing the conceptions of chance and genius
if the aim of the european wars at the beginning of the nineteenth century had been the aggrandizement of russia  that aim might have been accomplished without all the preceding wars and without the invasion
if the aim was the aggrandizement of france  that might have been attained without the revolution and without the empire
if the aim was the dissemination of ideas  the printing press could have accomplished that much better than warfare
if the aim was the progress of civilization  it is easy to see that there are other ways of diffusing civilization more expedient than by the destruction of wealth and of human lives
why did it happen in this and not in some other way  because it happened so   chance created the situation  genius utilized it   says history
but what is chance  what is genius  the words chance and genius do not denote any really existing thing and therefore cannot be defined
those words only denote a certain stage of understanding of phenomena
i do not know why a certain event occurs  i think that i cannot know it  so i do not try to know it and i talk about chance
i see a force producing effects beyond the scope of ordinary human agencies  i do not understand why this occurs and i talk of genius
to a herd of rams  the ram the herdsman drives each evening into a special enclosure to feed and that becomes twice as fat as the others must seem to be a genius and it must appear an astonishing conjunction of genius with a whole series of extraordinary chances that this ram  who instead of getting into the general fold every evening goes into a special enclosure where there are oats  that this very ram  swelling with fat  is killed for meat
but the rams need only cease to suppose that all that happens to them happens solely for the attainment of their sheepish aims  they need only admit that what happens to them may also have purposes beyond their ken  and they will at once perceive a unity and coherence in what happened to the ram that was fattened even if they do not know for what purpose they are fattened  they will at least know that all that happened to the ram did not happen accidentally  and will no longer need the conceptions of chance or genius
only by renouncing our claim to discern a purpose immediately intelligible to us  and admitting the ultimate purpose to be beyond our ken  may we discern the sequence of experiences in the lives of historic characters and perceive the cause of the effect they produce  incommensurable with ordinary human capabilities   and then the words chance and genius become superfluous
we need only confess that we do not know the purpose of the european convulsions and that we know only the facts that is  the murders  first in france  then in italy  in africa  in prussia  in austria  in spain  and in russia  and that the movements from the west to the east and from the east to the west form the essence and purpose of these events  and not only shall we have no need to see exceptional ability and genius in napoleon and alexander  but we shall be unable to consider them to be anything but like other men  and we shall not be obliged to have recourse to chance for an explanation of those small events which made these people what they were  but it will be clear that all those small events were inevitable
by discarding a claim to knowledge of the ultimate purpose  we shall clearly perceive that just as one cannot imagine a blossom or seed for any single plant better suited to it than those it produces  so it is impossible to imagine any two people more completely adapted down to the smallest detail for the purpose they had to fulfill  than napoleon and alexander with all their antecedents
the fundamental and essential significance of the european events of the beginning of the nineteenth century lies in the movement of the mass of the european peoples from west to east and afterwards from east to west
the commencement of that movement was the movement from west to east
for the peoples of the west to be able to make their warlike movement to moscow it was necessary   1  that they should form themselves into a military group of a size able to endure a collision with the warlike military group of the east   2  that they should abandon all established traditions and customs  and  3  that during their military movement they should have at their head a man who could justify to himself and to them the deceptions  robberies  and murders which would have to be committed during that movement and beginning with the french revolution the old inadequately large group was destroyed  as well as the old habits and traditions  and step by step a group was formed of larger dimensions with new customs and traditions  and a man was produced who would stand at the head of the coming movement and bear the responsibility for all that had to be done a man without convictions  without habits  without traditions  without a name  and not even a frenchman  emerges by what seem the strangest chances  from among all the seething french parties  and without joining any one of them is borne forward to a prominent position
the ignorance of his colleagues  the weakness and insignificance of his opponents  the frankness of his falsehoods  and the dazzling and self confident limitations of this man raise him to the head of the army
the brilliant qualities of the soldiers of the army sent to italy  his opponents' reluctance to fight  and his own childish audacity and self confidence secure him military fame
innumerable so called chances accompany him everywhere
the disfavor into which he falls with the rulers of france turns to his advantage
his attempts to avoid his predestined path are unsuccessful  he is not received into the russian service  and the appointment he seeks in turkey comes to nothing
during the war in italy he is several times on the verge of destruction and each time is saved in an unexpected manner
owing to various diplomatic considerations the russian armies just those which might have destroyed his prestige do not appear upon the scene till he is no longer there
on his return from italy he finds the government in paris in a process of dissolution in which all those who are in it are inevitably wiped out and destroyed
and by chance an escape from this dangerous position presents itself in the form of an aimless and senseless expedition to africa
again socalled chance accompanies him
impregnable malta surrenders without a shot  his most reckless schemes are crowned with success
the enemy's fleet  which subsequently did not let a single boat pass  allows his entire army to elude it
in africa a whole series of outrages are committed against the almost unarmed inhabitants
and the men who commit these crimes  especially their leader  assure themselves that this is admirable  this is glory it resembles caesar and alexander the great and is therefore good this ideal of glory and grandeur which consists not merely in considering nothing wrong that one does but in priding oneself on every crime one commits  ascribing to it an incomprehensible supernatural significance that ideal  destined to guide this man and his associates  had scope for its development in africa
whatever he does succeeds
the plague does not touch him
the cruelty of murdering prisoners is not imputed to him as a fault
his childishly rash  uncalled for  and ignoble departure from africa  leaving his comrades in distress  is set down to his credit  and again the enemy's fleet twice lets him slip past when  intoxicated by the crimes he has committed so successfully  he reaches paris  the dissolution of the republican government  which a year earlier might have ruined him  has reached its extreme limit  and his presence there now as a newcomer free from party entanglements can only serve to exalt him and though he himself has no plan  he is quite ready for his new role he had no plan  he was afraid of everything  but the parties snatched at him and demanded his participation
he alone with his ideal of glory and grandeur developed in italy and egypt  his insane self adulation  his boldness in crime and frankness in lying he alone could justify what had to be done
he is needed for the place that awaits him  and so almost apart from his will and despite his indecision  his lack of a plan  and all his mistakes  he is drawn into a conspiracy that aims at seizing power and the conspiracy is crowned with success he is pushed into a meeting of the legislature
in alarm he wishes to flee  considering himself lost he pretends to fall into a swoon and says senseless things that should have ruined him
but the once proud and shrewd rulers of france  feeling that their part is played out  are even more bewildered than he  and do not say the words they should have said to destroy him and retain their power
chance  millions of chances  give him power  and all men as if by agreement co operate to confirm that power
chance forms the characters of the rulers of france  who submit to him  chance forms the character of paul i of russia who recognizes his government  chance contrives a plot against him which not only fails to harm him but confirms his power chance puts the duc d'enghien in his hands and unexpectedly causes him to kill him thereby convincing the mob more forcibly than in any other way that he had the right  since he had the might
chance contrives that though he directs all his efforts to prepare an expedition against england  which would inevitably have ruined him  he never carries out that intention  but unexpectedly falls upon mack and the austrians  who surrender without a battle
chance and genius give him the victory at austerlitz  and by chance all men  not only the french but all europe except england which does not take part in the events about to happen despite their former horror and detestation of his crimes  now recognize his authority  the title he has given himself  and his ideal of grandeur and glory  which seems excellent and reasonable to them all as if measuring themselves and preparing for the coming movement  the western forces push toward the east several times in 1805  1806  1807  and 1809  gaining strength and growing in 1811 the group of people that had formed in france unites into one group with the peoples of central europe
the strength of the justification of the man who stands at the head of the movement grows with the increased size of the group
during the ten year preparatory period this man had formed relations with all the crowned heads of europe
the discredited rulers of the world can oppose no reasonable ideal to the insensate napoleonic ideal of glory and grandeur
one after another they hasten to display their insignificance before him
the king of prussia sends his wife to seek the great man's mercy  the emperor of austria considers it a favor that this man receives a daughter of the caesars into his bed  the pope  the guardian of all that the nations hold sacred  utilizes religion for the aggrandizement of the great man
it is not napoleon who prepares himself for the accomplishment of his role  so much as all those round him who prepare him to take on himself the whole responsibility for what is happening and has to happen there is no step  no crime or petty fraud he commits  which in the mouths of those around him is not at once represented as a great deed
the most suitable fete the germans can devise for him is a celebration of jena and auerstadt
not only is he great  but so are his ancestors  his brothers  his stepsons  and his brothers in law
everything is done to deprive him of the remains of his reason and to prepare him for his terrible part
and when he is ready so too are the forces
the invasion pushes eastward and reaches its final goal moscow
that city is taken  the russian army suffers heavier losses than the opposing armies had suffered in the former war from austerlitz to wagram
but suddenly instead of those chances and that genius which hitherto had so consistently led him by an uninterrupted series of successes to the predestined goal  an innumerable sequence of inverse chances occur from the cold in his head at borodino to the sparks which set moscow on fire  and the frosts and instead of genius  stupidity and immeasurable baseness become evident
the invaders flee  turn back  flee again  and all the chances are now not for napoleon but always against him
a countermovement is then accomplished from east to west with a remarkable resemblance to the preceding movement from west to east
attempted drives from east to west similar to the contrary movements of 1805  1807  and 1809  precede the great westward movement  there is the same coalescence into a group of enormous dimensions  the same adhesion of the people of central europe to the movement  the same hesitation midway  and the same increasing rapidity as the goal is approached
paris  the ultimate goal  is reached
the napoleonic government and army are destroyed
napoleon himself is no longer of any account  all his actions are evidently pitiful and mean  but again an inexplicable chance occurs the allies detest napoleon whom they regard as the cause of their sufferings
deprived of power and authority  his crimes and his craft exposed  he should have appeared to them what he appeared ten years previously and one year later  an outlawed brigand
but by some strange chance no one perceives this
his part is not yet ended
the man who ten years before and a year later was considered an outlawed brigand is sent to an island two days' sail from france  which for some reason is presented to him as his dominion  and guards are given to him and millions of money are paid him
the flood of nations begins to subside into its normal channels
the waves of the great movement abate  and on the calm surface eddies are formed in which float the diplomatists  who imagine that they have caused the floods to abate
but the smooth sea again suddenly becomes disturbed
the diplomatists think that their disagreements are the cause of this fresh pressure of natural forces  they anticipate war between their sovereigns  the position seems to them insoluble but the wave they feel to be rising does not come from the quarter they expect
it rises again from the same point as before paris
the last backwash of the movement from the west occurs  a backwash which serves to solve the apparently insuperable diplomatic difficulties and ends the military movement of that period of history
the man who had devastated france returns to france alone  without any conspiracy and without soldiers
any guard might arrest him  but by strange chance no one does so and all rapturously greet the man they cursed the day before and will curse again a month later
this man is still needed to justify the final collective act
that act is performed
the last role is played
the actor is bidden to disrobe and wash off his powder and paint  he will not be wanted any more
and some years pass during which he plays a pitiful comedy to himself in solitude on his island  justifying his actions by intrigues and lies when the justification is no longer needed  and displaying to the whole world what it was that people had mistaken for strength as long as an unseen hand directed his actions the manager having brought the drama to a close and stripped the actor shows him to us
 see what you believed in  this is he  do you now see that it was not he but i who moved you   but dazed by the force of the movement  it was long before people understood this
still greater coherence and inevitability is seen in the life of alexander i  the man who stood at the head of the countermovement from east to west
what was needed for him who  overshadowing others  stood at the head of that movement from east to west  what was needed was a sense of justice and a sympathy with european affairs  but a remote sympathy not dulled by petty interests  a moral superiority over those sovereigns of the day who co operated with him  a mild and attractive personality  and a personal grievance against napoleon
and all this was found in alexander i  all this had been prepared by innumerable so called chances in his life  his education  his early liberalism  the advisers who surrounded him  and by austerlitz  and tilsit  and erfurt
during the national war he was inactive because he was not needed
but as soon as the necessity for a general european war presented itself he appeared in his place at the given moment and  uniting the nations of europe  led them to the goal
the goal is reached
after the final war of 1815 alexander possesses all possible power
how does he use it  alexander i the pacifier of europe  the man who from his early years had striven only for his people's welfare  the originator of the liberal innovations in his fatherland now that he seemed to possess the utmost power and therefore to have the possibility of bringing about the welfare of his peoples at the time when napoleon in exile was drawing up childish and mendacious plans of how he would have made mankind happy had he retained power  alexander i  having fulfilled his mission and feeling the hand of god upon him  suddenly recognizes the insignificance of that supposed power  turns away from it  and gives it into the hands of contemptible men whom he despises  saying only   not unto us  not unto us  but unto thy name   
i too am a man like the rest of you
let me live like a man and think of my soul and of god   as the sun and each atom of ether is a sphere complete in itself  and yet at the same time only a part of a whole too immense for man to comprehend  so each individual has within himself his own aims and yet has them to serve a general purpose incomprehensible to man a bee settling on a flower has stung a child
and the child is afraid of bees and declares that bees exist to sting people
a poet admires the bee sucking from the chalice of a flower and says it exists to suck the fragrance of flowers
a beekeeper  seeing the bee collect pollen from flowers and carry it to the hive  says that it exists to gather honey
another beekeeper who has studied the life of the hive more closely says that the bee gathers pollen dust to feed the young bees and rear a queen  and that it exists to perpetuate its race
a botanist notices that the bee flying with the pollen of a male flower to a pistil fertilizes the latter  and sees in this the purpose of the bee's existence
another  observing the migration of plants  notices that the bee helps in this work  and may say that in this lies the purpose of the bee
but the ultimate purpose of the bee is not exhausted by the first  the second  or any of the processes the human mind can discern
the higher the human intellect rises in the discovery of these purposes  the more obvious it becomes  that the ultimate purpose is beyond our comprehension
all that is accessible to man is the relation of the life of the bee to other manifestations of life
and so it is with the purpose of historic characters and nations
natasha's wedding to bezukhov  which took place in 1813  was the last happy event in the family of the old rostovs
count ilya rostov died that same year and  as always happens  after the father's death the family group broke up
the events of the previous year  the burning of moscow and the flight from it  the death of prince andrew  natasha's despair  petya's death  and the old countess' grief fell blow after blow on the old count's head
he seemed to be unable to understand the meaning of all these events  and bowed his old head in a spiritual sense as if expecting and inviting further blows which would finish him
he seemed now frightened and distraught and now unnaturally animated and enterprising
the arrangements for natasha's marriage occupied him for a while
he ordered dinners and suppers and obviously tried to appear cheerful  but his cheerfulness was not infectious as it used to be  on the contrary it evoked the compassion of those who knew and liked him
when pierre and his wife had left  he grew very quiet and began to complain of depression
a few days later he fell ill and took to his bed
he realized from the first that he would not get up again  despite the doctor's encouragement
the countess passed a fortnight in an armchair by his pillow without undressing
every time she gave him his medicine he sobbed and silently kissed her hand
on his last day  sobbing  he asked her and his absent son to forgive him for having dissipated their property that being the chief fault of which he was conscious
after receiving communion and unction he quietly died  and next day a throng of acquaintances who came to pay their last respects to the deceased filled the house rented by the rostovs
all these acquaintances  who had so often dined and danced at his house and had so often laughed at him  now said  with a common feeling of self reproach and emotion  as if justifying themselves   well  whatever he may have been he was a most worthy man you don't meet such men nowadays   
and which of us has not weaknesses of his own   it was just when the count's affairs had become so involved that it was impossible to say what would happen if he lived another year that he unexpectedly died
nicholas was with the russian army in paris when the news of his father's death reached him
he at once resigned his commission  and without waiting for it to be accepted took leave of absence and went to moscow
the state of the count's affairs became quite obvious a month after his death  surprising everyone by the immense total of small debts the existence of which no one had suspected
the debts amounted to double the value of the property
friends and relations advised nicholas to decline the inheritance
but he regarded such a refusal as a slur on his father's memory  which he held sacred  and therefore would not hear of refusing and accepted the inheritance together with the obligation to pay the debts
the creditors who had so long been silent  restrained by a vague but powerful influence exerted on them while he lived by the count's careless good nature  all proceeded to enforce their claims at once as always happens in such cases rivalry sprang up as to which should get paid first  and those who like mitenka held promissory notes given them as presents now became the most exacting of the creditors
nicholas was allowed no respite and no peace  and those who had seemed to pity the old man the cause of their losses  if they were losses   now remorselessly pursued the young heir who had voluntarily undertaken the debts and was obviously not guilty of contracting them
not one of the plans nicholas tried succeeded  the estate was sold by auction for half its value  and half the debts still remained unpaid
nicholas accepted thirty thousand rubles offered him by his brother in law bezukhov to pay off debts he regarded as genuinely due for value received
and to avoid being imprisoned for the remainder  as the creditors threatened  he re entered the government service
he could not rejoin the army where he would have been made colonel at the next vacancy  for his mother now clung to him as her one hold on life  and so despite his reluctance to remain in moscow among people who had known him before  and despite his abhorrence of the civil service  he accepted a post in moscow in that service  doffed the uniform of which he was so fond  and moved with his mother and sonya to a small house on the sivtsev vrazhek
natasha and pierre were living in petersburg at the time and had no clear idea of nicholas' circumstances having borrowed money from his brother in law  nicholas tried to hide his wretched condition from him his position was the more difficult because with his salary of twelve hundred rubles he had not only to keep himself  his mother  and sonya  but had to shield his mother from knowledge of their poverty the countess could not conceive of life without the luxurious conditions she had been used to from childhood and  unable to realize how hard it was for her son  kept demanding now a carriage  which they did not keep  to send for a friend  now some expensive article of food for herself  or wine for her son  or money to buy a present as a surprise for natasha or sonya  or for nicholas himself sonya kept house  attended on her aunt  read to her  put up with her whims and secret ill will  and helped nicholas to conceal their poverty from the old countess nicholas felt himself irredeemably indebted to sonya for all she was doing for his mother and greatly admired her patience and devotion  but tried to keep aloof from her he seemed in his heart to reproach her for being too perfect  and because there was nothing to reproach her with
she had all that people are valued for  but little that could have made him love her
he felt that the more he valued her the less he loved her
he had taken her at her word when she wrote giving him his freedom and now behaved as if all that had passed between them had been long forgotten and could never in any case be renewed
nicholas' position became worse and worse
the idea of putting something aside out of his salary proved a dream
not only did he not save anything  but to comply with his mother's demands he even incurred some small debts
he could see no way out of this situation
the idea of marrying some rich woman  which was suggested to him by his female relations  was repugnant to him
the other way out his mother's death never entered his head
he wished for nothing and hoped for nothing  and deep in his heart experienced a gloomy and stern satisfaction in an uncomplaining endurance of his position
he tried to avoid his old acquaintances with their commiseration and offensive offers of assistance  he avoided all distraction and recreation  and even at home did nothing but play cards with his mother  pace silently up and down the room  and smoke one pipe after another
he seemed carefully to cherish within himself the gloomy mood which alone enabled him to endure his position at the beginning of winter princess mary came to moscow
from reports current in town she learned how the rostovs were situated  and how  the son has sacrificed himself for his mother   as people were saying  i never expected anything else of him   said princess mary to herself  feeling a joyous sense of her love for him
remembering her friendly relations with all the rostovs which had made her almost a member of the family  she thought it her duty to go to see them
but remembering her relations with nicholas in voronezh she was shy about doing so
making a great effort she did however go to call on them a few weeks after her arrival in moscow
nicholas was the first to meet her  as the countess' room could only be reached through his
but instead of being greeted with pleasure as she had expected  at his first glance at her his face assumed a cold  stiff  proud expression she had not seen on it before
he inquired about her health  led the way to his mother  and having sat there for five minutes left the room
when the princess came out of the countess' room nicholas met her again  and with marked solemnity and stiffness accompanied her to the anteroom
to her remarks about his mother's health he made no reply
 what's that to you  leave me in peace   his looks seemed to say
 why does she come prowling here  what does she want  i can't bear these ladies and all these civilities   said he aloud in sonya's presence  evidently unable to repress his vexation  after the princess' carriage had disappeared
 oh  nicholas  how can you talk like that   cried sonya  hardly able to conceal her delight
 she is so kind and mamma is so fond of her   nicholas did not reply and tried to avoid speaking of the princess any more
but after her visit the old countess spoke of her several times a day
she sang her praises  insisted that her son must call on her  expressed a wish to see her often  but yet always became ill humored when she began to talk about her
nicholas tried to keep silence when his mother spoke of the princess  but his silence irritated her
 she is a very admirable and excellent young woman   said she   and you must go and call on her
you would at least be seeing somebody  and i think it must be dull for you only seeing us    but i don't in the least want to  mamma    you used to want to  and now you don't
really i don't understand you  my dear
one day you are dull  and the next you refuse to see anyone    but i never said i was dull    why  you said yourself you don't want even to see her
she is a very admirable young woman and you always liked her  but now suddenly you have got some notion or other in your head
you hide everything from me    not at all  mamma    if i were asking you to do something disagreeable now but i only ask you to return a call
one would think mere politeness required it   
well  i have asked you  and now i won't interfere any more since you have secrets from your mother    well  then  i'll go if you wish it    it doesn't matter to me
i only wish it for your sake   nicholas sighed  bit his mustache  and laid out the cards for a patience  trying to divert his mother's attention to another topic
the same conversation was repeated next day and the day after  and the day after that
after her visit to the rostovs and her unexpectedly chilly reception by nicholas  princess mary confessed to herself that she had been right in not wishing to be the first to call
 i expected nothing else   she told herself  calling her pride to her aid
 i have nothing to do with him and i only wanted to see the old lady  who was always kind to me and to whom i am under many obligations   but she could not pacify herself with these reflections  a feeling akin to remorse troubled her when she thought of her visit
though she had firmly resolved not to call on the rostovs again and to forget the whole matter  she felt herself all the time in an awkward position
and when she asked herself what distressed her  she had to admit that it was her relation to rostov
his cold  polite manner did not express his feeling for her  she knew that  but it concealed something  and until she could discover what that something was  she felt that she could not be at ease
one day in midwinter when sitting in the schoolroom attending to her nephew's lessons  she was informed that rostov had called
with a firm resolution not to betray herself and not show her agitation  she sent for mademoiselle bourienne and went with her to the drawing room
her first glance at nicholas' face told her that he had only come to fulfill the demands of politeness  and she firmly resolved to maintain the tone in which he addressed her
they spoke of the countess' health  of their mutual friends  of the latest war news  and when the ten minutes required by propriety had elapsed after which a visitor may rise  nicholas got up to say good by
with mademoiselle bourienne's help the princess had maintained the conversation very well  but at the very last moment  just when he rose  she was so tired of talking of what did not interest her  and her mind was so full of the question why she alone was granted so little happiness in life  that in a fit of absent mindedness she sat still  her luminous eyes gazing fixedly before her  not noticing that he had risen
nicholas glanced at her and  wishing to appear not to notice her abstraction  made some remark to mademoiselle bourienne and then again looked at the princess
she still sat motionless with a look of suffering on her gentle face
he suddenly felt sorry for her and was vaguely conscious that he might be the cause of the sadness her face expressed
he wished to help her and say something pleasant  but could think of nothing to say
 good bye  princess   said he
she started  flushed  and sighed deeply
 oh  i beg your pardon   she said as if waking up
 are you going already  count  well then  good by  oh  but the cushion for the countess    wait a moment  i'll fetch it   said mademoiselle bourienne  and she left the room they both sat silent  with an occasional glance at one another
 yes  princess   said nicholas at last with a sad smile   it doesn't seem long ago since we first met at bogucharovo  but how much water has flowed since then  in what distress we all seemed to be then  yet i would give much to bring back that time  
but there's no bringing it back   princess mary gazed intently into his eyes with her own luminous ones as he said this
she seemed to be trying to fathom the hidden meaning of his words which would explain his feeling for her
 yes  yes   said she   but you have no reason to regret the past  count
as i understand your present life  i think you will always recall it with satisfaction  because the self sacrifice that fills it now      i cannot accept your praise   he interrupted her hurriedly
 on the contrary i continually reproach myself   
but this is not at all an interesting or cheerful subject   his face again resumed its former stiff and cold expression
but the princess had caught a glimpse of the man she had known and loved  and it was to him that she now spoke
 i thought you would allow me to tell you this   she said
 i had come so near to you  
and to all your family that i thought you would not consider my sympathy misplaced  but i was mistaken   and suddenly her voice trembled
 i don't know why   she continued  recovering herself   but you used to be different  and      there are a thousand reasons why   laying special emphasis on the why
 thank you  princess   he added softly
 sometimes it is hard    so that's why  that's why   a voice whispered in princess mary's soul
 no  it was not only that gay  kind  and frank look  not only that handsome exterior  that i loved in him
i divined his noble  resolute  self sacrificing spirit too   she said to herself
 yes  he is poor now and i am rich   
yes  that's the only reason   
yes  were it not for that     and remembering his former tenderness  and looking now at his kind  sorrowful face  she suddenly understood the cause of his coldness
 but why  count  why   she almost cried  unconsciously moving closer to him
 why  tell me
you must tell me   he was silent
 i don't understand your why  count   she continued   but it's hard for me  
i confess it
for some reason you wish to deprive me of our former friendship
and that hurts me   there were tears in her eyes and in her voice
 i have had so little happiness in life that every loss is hard for me to bear   
excuse me  good by   and suddenly she began to cry and was hurrying from the room
 princess  for god's sake   he exclaimed  trying to stop her
 princess   she turned round
for a few seconds they gazed silently into one another's eyes and what had seemed impossible and remote suddenly became possible  inevitable  and very near
in the winter of 1813 nicholas married princess mary and moved to bald hills with his wife  his mother  and sonya
within four years he had paid off all his remaining debts without selling any of his wife's property  and having received a small inheritance on the death of a cousin he paid his debt to pierre as well
in another three years  by 1820  he had so managed his affairs that he was able to buy a small estate adjoining bald hills and was negotiating to buy back otradnoe that being his pet dream
having started farming from necessity  he soon grew so devoted to it that it became his favorite and almost his sole occupation
nicholas was a plain farmer  he did not like innovations  especially the english ones then coming into vogue
he laughed at theoretical treatises on estate management  disliked factories  the raising of expensive products  and the buying of expensive seed corn  and did not make a hobby of any particular part of the work on his estate
he always had before his mind's eye the estate as a whole and not any particular part of it
the chief thing in his eyes was not the nitrogen in the soil  nor the oxygen in the air  nor manures  nor special plows  but that most important agent by which nitrogen  oxygen  manure  and plow were made effective the peasant laborer
when nicholas first began farming and began to understand its different branches  it was the serf who especially attracted his attention
the peasant seemed to him not merely a tool  but also a judge of farming and an end in himself at first he watched the serfs  trying to understand their aims and what they considered good and bad  and only pretended to direct them and give orders while in reality learning from them their methods  their manner of speech  and their judgment of what was good and bad only when he had understood the peasants' tastes and aspirations  had learned to talk their language  to grasp the hidden meaning of their words  and felt akin to them did he begin boldly to manage his serfs  that is  to perform toward them the duties demanded of him
and nicholas' management produced very brilliant results
guided by some gift of insight  on taking up the management of the estates he at once unerringly appointed as bailiff  village elder  and delegate  the very men the serfs would themselves have chosen had they had the right to choose  and these posts never changed hands before analyzing the properties of manure  before entering into the debit and credit  as he ironically called it   he found out how many cattle the peasants had and increased the number by all possible means
he kept the peasant families together in the largest groups possible  not allowing the family groups to divide into separate households
he was hard alike on the lazy  the depraved  and the weak  and tried to get them expelled from the commune
he was as careful of the sowing and reaping of the peasants' hay and corn as of his own  and few landowners had their crops sown and harvested so early and so well  or got so good a return  as did nicholas
he disliked having anything to do with the domestic serfs the  drones  as he called them and everyone said he spoiled them by his laxity
when a decision had to be taken regarding a domestic serf  especially if one had to be punished  he always felt undecided and consulted everybody in the house  but when it was possible to have a domestic serf conscripted instead of a land worker he did so without the least hesitation
he never felt any hesitation in dealing with the peasants
he knew that his every decision would be approved by them all with very few exceptions
he did not allow himself either to be hard on or punish a man  or to make things easy for or reward anyone  merely because he felt inclined to do so he could not have said by what standard he judged what he should or should not do  but the standard was quite firm and definite in his own mind
often  speaking with vexation of some failure or irregularity  he would say   what can one do with our russian peasants   and imagined that he could not bear them
yet he loved  our russian peasants  and their way of life with his whole soul  and for that very reason had understood and assimilated the one way and manner of farming which produced good results
countess mary was jealous of this passion of her husband's and regretted that she could not share it  but she could not understand the joys and vexations he derived from that world  to her so remote and alien
she could not understand why he was so particularly animated and happy when  after getting up at daybreak and spending the whole morning in the fields or on the threshing floor  he returned from the sowing or mowing or reaping to have tea with her
she did not understand why he spoke with such admiration and delight of the farming of the thrifty and well to do peasant matthew ermishin  who with his family had carted corn all night  or of the fact that his  nicholas'  sheaves were already stacked before anyone else had his harvest in
she did not understand why he stepped out from the window to the veranda and smiled under his mustache and winked so joyfully  when warm steady rain began to fall on the dry and thirsty shoots of the young oats  or why when the wind carried away a threatening cloud during the hay harvest he would return from the barn  flushed  sunburned  and perspiring  with a smell of wormwood and gentian in his hair and  gleefully rubbing his hands  would say   well  one more day and my grain and the peasants' will all be under cover   still less did she understand why he  kindhearted and always ready to anticipate her wishes  should become almost desperate when she brought him a petition from some peasant men or women who had appealed to her to be excused some work  why he  that kind nicholas  should obstinately refuse her  angrily asking her not to interfere in what was not her business
she felt he had a world apart  which he loved passionately and which had laws she had not fathomed
sometimes when  trying to understand him  she spoke of the good work he was doing for his serfs  he would be vexed and reply   not in the least  it never entered my head and i wouldn't do that for their good  that's all poetry and old wives' talk all that doing good to one's neighbor  what i want is that our children should not have to go begging
i must put our affairs in order while i am alive  that's all
and to do that  order and strictness are essential   
that's all about it   said he  clenching his vigorous fist
 and fairness  of course   he added   for if the peasant is naked and hungry and has only one miserable horse  he can do no good either for himself or for me   and all nicholas did was fruitful probably just because he refused to allow himself to think that he was doing good to others for virtue's sake his means increased rapidly  serfs from neighboring estates came to beg him to buy them  and long after his death the memory of his administration was devoutly preserved among the serfs
 he was a master  
the peasants' affairs first and then his own
of course he was not to be trifled with either in a word  he was a real master   one matter connected with his management sometimes worried nicholas  and that was his quick temper together with his old hussar habit of making free use of his fists
at first he saw nothing reprehensible in this  but in the second year of his marriage his view of that form of punishment suddenly changed
once in summer he had sent for the village elder from bogucharovo  a man who had succeeded to the post when dron died and who was accused of dishonesty and various irregularities
nicholas went out into the porch to question him  and immediately after the elder had given a few replies the sound of cries and blows were heard
on returning to lunch nicholas went up to his wife  who sat with her head bent low over her embroidery frame  and as usual began to tell her what he had been doing that morning
among other things he spoke of the bogucharovo elder
countess mary turned red and then pale  but continued to sit with head bowed and lips compressed and gave her husband no reply
 such an insolent scoundrel   he cried  growing hot again at the mere recollection of him
 if he had told me he was drunk and did not see  
but what is the matter with you  mary   he suddenly asked
countess mary raised her head and tried to speak  but hastily looked down again and her lips puckered
 why  whatever is the matter  my dearest   the looks of the plain countess mary always improved when she was in tears
she never cried from pain or vexation  but always from sorrow or pity  and when she wept her radiant eyes acquired an irresistible charm
the moment nicholas took her hand she could no longer restrain herself and began to cry
 nicholas  i saw it  
he was to blame  but why do you  
nicholas   and she covered her face with her hands
nicholas said nothing
he flushed crimson  left her side  and paced up and down the room he understood what she was weeping about  but could not in his heart at once agree with her that what he had regarded from childhood as quite an everyday event was wrong
 is it just sentimentality  old wives' tales  or is she right   he asked himself before he had solved that point he glanced again at her face filled with love and pain  and he suddenly realized that she was right and that he had long been sinning against himself  mary   he said softly  going up to her   it will never happen again  i give you my word
never   he repeated in a trembling voice like a boy asking for forgiveness
the tears flowed faster still from the countess' eyes
she took his hand and kissed it
 nicholas  when did you break your cameo   she asked to change the subject  looking at his finger on which he wore a ring with a cameo of laocoon's head
 today it was the same affair
oh  mary  don't remind me of it   and again he flushed
 i give you my word of honor it shan't occur again  and let this always be a reminder to me   and he pointed to the broken ring
after that  when in discussions with his village elders or stewards the blood rushed to his face and his fists began to clench  nicholas would turn the broken ring on his finger and would drop his eyes before the man who was making him angry
but he did forget himself once or twice within a twelvemonth  and then he would go and confess to his wife  and would again promise that this should really be the very last time  mary  you must despise me   he would say
 i deserve it    you should go  go away at once  if you don't feel strong enough to control yourself   she would reply sadly  trying to comfort her husband
among the gentry of the province nicholas was respected but not liked
he did not concern himself with the interests of his own class  and consequently some thought him proud and others thought him stupid the whole summer  from spring sowing to harvest  he was busy with the work on his farm
in autumn he gave himself up to hunting with the same business like seriousness  leaving home for a month  or even two  with his hunt in winter he visited historical  and on these he spent a certain sum every year
he was collecting  he bought
he would sit in his study with a grave air  reading a task he first imposed upon himself as a duty  but which afterwards became a habit affording him a special kind of pleasure and a consciousness of being occupied with serious matters in winter  except for business excursions  he spent most of his time at home making himself one with his family and entering into all the details of his children's relations with their mother the harmony between him and his wife grew closer and closer and he daily discovered fresh spiritual treasures in her
from the time of his marriage sonya had lived in his house
before that  nicholas had told his wife all that had passed between himself and sonya  blaming himself and commending her he had asked princess mary to be gentle and kind to his cousin
she thoroughly realized the wrong he had done sonya  felt herself to blame toward her  and imagined that her wealth had influenced nicholas' choice
she could not find fault with sonya in any way and tried to be fond of her  but often felt ill will toward her which she could not overcome
once she had a talk with her friend natasha about sonya and about her own injustice toward her
 you know   said natasha   you have read the gospels a great deal there is a passage in them that just fits sonya    what   asked countess mary  surprised
 'to him that hath shall be given  and from him that hath not shall be taken away ' you remember  she is one that hath not  why  i don't know
perhaps she lacks egotism  i don't know  but from her is taken away  and everything has been taken away
sometimes i am dreadfully sorry for her
formerly i very much wanted nicholas to marry her  but i always had a sort of presentiment that it would not come off
she is a sterile flower  you know like some strawberry blossoms sometimes i am sorry for her  and sometimes i think she doesn't feel it as you or i would   though countess mary told natasha that those words in the gospel must be understood differently  yet looking at sonya she agreed with natasha's explanation
it really seemed that sonya did not feel her position trying  and had grown quite reconciled to her lot as a sterile flower
she seemed to be fond not so much of individuals as of the family as a whole
like a cat  she had attached herself not to the people but to the home
she waited on the old countess  petted and spoiled the children  was always ready to render the small services for which she had a gift  and all this was unconsciously accepted from her with insufficient gratitude
the country seat at bald hills had been rebuilt  though not on the same scale as under the old prince
the buildings  begun under straitened circumstances  were more than simple the immense house on the old stone foundations was of wood  plastered only inside
it had bare deal floors and was furnished with very simple hard sofas  armchairs  tables  and chairs made by their own serf carpenters out of their own birchwood
the house was spacious and had rooms for the house serfs and apartments for visitors whole families of the rostovs' and bolkonskis' relations sometimes came to bald hills with sixteen horses and dozens of servants and stayed for months
besides that  four times a year  on the name days and birthdays of the hosts  as many as a hundred visitors would gather there for a day or two
the rest of the year life pursued its unbroken routine with its ordinary occupations  and its breakfasts  lunches  dinners  and suppers  provided out of the produce of the estate
it was the eve of st
nicholas  the fifth of december  1820
natasha had been staying at her brother's with her husband and children since early autumn
pierre had gone to petersburg on business of his own for three weeks as he said  but had remained there nearly seven weeks and was expected back every minute
besides the bezukhov family  nicholas' old friend the retired general vasili dmitrich denisov was staying with the rostovs this fifth of december
on the sixth  which was his name day when the house would be full of visitors  nicholas knew he would have to exchange his tartar tunic for a tail coat  and put on narrow boots with pointed toes  and drive to the new church he had built  and then receive visitors who would come to congratulate him  offer them refreshments  and talk about the elections of the nobility  but he considered himself entitled to spend the eve of that day in his usual way he examined the bailiff's accounts of the village in ryazan which belonged to his wife's nephew  wrote two business letters  and walked over to the granaries  cattle yards and stables before dinner
having taken precautions against the general drunkenness to be expected on the morrow because it was a great saint's day  he returned to dinner  and without having time for a private talk with his wife sat down at the long table laid for twenty persons  at which the whole household had assembled
at that table were his mother  his mother's old lady companion belova  his wife  their three children with their governess and tutor  his wife's nephew with his tutor  sonya  denisov  natasha  her three children  their governess  and old michael ivanovich  the late prince's architect  who was living on in retirement at bald hills
countess mary sat at the other end of the table
when her husband took his place she concluded  from the rapid manner in which after taking up his table napkin he pushed back the tumbler and wineglass standing before him  that he was out of humor  as was sometimes the case when he came in to dinner straight from the farm especially before the soup
countess mary well knew that mood of his  and when she herself was in a good frame of mind quietly waited till he had had his soup and then began to talk to him and make him admit that there was no cause for his ill humor
but today she quite forgot that and was hurt that he should be angry with her without any reason  and she felt unhappy
she asked him where he had been
he replied
she again inquired whether everything was going well on the farm
her unnatural tone made him wince unpleasantly and he replied hastily
 then i'm not mistaken   thought countess mary
 why is he cross with me   she concluded from his tone that he was vexed with her and wished to end the conversation
she knew her remarks sounded unnatural  but could not refrain from asking some more questions
thanks to denisov the conversation at table soon became general and lively  and she did not talk to her husband
when they left the table and went as usual to thank the old countess  countess mary held out her hand and kissed her husband  and asked him why he was angry with her
 you always have such strange fancies  i didn't even think of being angry   he replied
but the word always seemed to her to imply   yes  i am angry but i won't tell you why   nicholas and his wife lived together so happily that even sonya and the old countess  who felt jealous and would have liked them to disagree  could find nothing to reproach them with  but even they had their moments of antagonism
occasionally  and it was always just after they had been happiest together  they suddenly had a feeling of estrangement and hostility  which occurred most frequently during countess mary's pregnancies  and this was such a time
 well  messieurs et mesdames   said nicholas loudly and with apparent cheerfulness  it seemed to countess mary that he did it on purpose to vex her    i have been on my feet since six this morning
tomorrow i shall have to suffer  so today i'll go and rest   and without a word to his wife he went to the little sitting room and lay down on the sofa
 that's always the way   thought countess mary
 he talks to everyone except me
i see  
i see that i am repulsive to him  especially when i am in this condition   she looked down at her expanded figure and in the glass at her pale  sallow  emaciated face in which her eyes now looked larger than ever
and everything annoyed her denisov's shouting and laughter  natasha's talk  and especially a quick glance sonya gave her
sonya was always the first excuse countess mary found for feeling irritated
having sat awhile with her visitors without understanding anything of what they were saying  she softly left the room and went to the nursery
the children were playing at  going to moscow  in a carriage made of chairs and invited her to go with them
she sat down and played with them a little  but the thought of her husband and his unreasonable crossness worried her
she got up and  walking on tiptoe with difficulty  went to the small sitting room
 perhaps he is not asleep  i'll have an explanation with him   she said to herself
little andrew  her eldest boy  imitating his mother  followed her on tiptoe
she did not notice him
 mary  dear  i think he is asleep he was so tired   said sonya  meeting her in the large sitting room  it seemed to countess mary that she crossed her path everywhere 
 andrew may wake him   countess mary looked round  saw little andrew following her  felt that sonya was right  and for that very reason flushed and with evident difficulty refrained from saying something harsh
she made no reply  but to avoid obeying sonya beckoned to andrew to follow her quietly and went to the door
sonya went away by another door
from the room in which nicholas was sleeping came the sound of his even breathing  every slightest tone of which was familiar to his wife
as she listened to it she saw before her his smooth handsome forehead  his mustache  and his whole face  as she had so often seen it in the stillness of the night when he slept
nicholas suddenly moved and cleared his throat
and at that moment little andrew shouted from outside the door   papa  mamma's standing here   countess mary turned pale with fright and made signs to the boy
he grew silent  and quiet ensued for a moment  terrible to countess mary
she knew how nicholas disliked being waked
then through the door she heard nicholas clearing his throat again and stirring  and his voice said crossly   i can't get a moment's peace   
mary  is that you  why did you bring him here    i only came in to look and did not notice  
forgive me     nicholas coughed and said no more
countess mary moved away from the door and took the boy back to the nursery
five minutes later little black eyed three year old natasha  her father's pet  having learned from her brother that papa was asleep and mamma was in the sitting room  ran to her father unobserved by her mother
the dark eyed little girl boldly opened the creaking door  went up to the sofa with energetic steps of her sturdy little legs  and having examined the position of her father  who was asleep with his back to her  rose on tiptoe and kissed the hand which lay under his head
nicholas turned with a tender smile on his face
 natasha  natasha   came countess mary's frightened whisper from the door
 papa wants to sleep    no  mamma  he doesn't want to sleep   said little natasha with conviction
 he's laughing   nicholas lowered his legs  rose  and took his daughter in his arms  come in  mary   he said to his wife
she went in and sat down by her husband
 i did not notice him following me   she said timidly
 i just looked in   holding his little girl with one arm  nicholas glanced at his wife and  seeing her guilty expression  put his other arm around her and kissed her hair
 may i kiss mamma   he asked natasha
natasha smiled bashfully
 again   she commanded  pointing with a peremptory gesture to the spot where nicholas had placed the kiss
 i don't know why you think i am cross   said nicholas  replying to the question he knew was in his wife's mind
 you have no idea how unhappy  how lonely  i feel when you are like that
it always seems to me      mary  don't talk nonsense you ought to be ashamed of yourself   he said gaily
 it seems to be that you can't love me  that i am so plain   always  
and now  
in this cond      oh  how absurd you are  it is not beauty that endears  it's love that makes us see beauty
it is only malvinas and women of that kind who are loved for their beauty
but do i love my wife  i don't love her  but  
i don't know how to put it
without you  or when something comes between us like this  i seem lost and can't do anything
now do i love my finger  i don't love it  but just try to cut it off    i'm not like that myself  but i understand
so you're not angry with me    awfully angry   he said  smiling and getting up
and smoothing his hair he began to pace the room
 do you know  mary  what i've been thinking   he began  immediately thinking aloud in his wife's presence now that they had made it up
he did not ask if she was ready to listen to him
he did not care
a thought had occurred to him and so it belonged to her also
and he told her of his intention to persuade pierre to stay with them till spring
countess mary listened till he had finished  made some remark  and in her turn began thinking aloud
her thoughts were about the children
 you can see the woman in her already   she said in french  pointing to little natasha
 you reproach us women with being illogical
here is our logic
i say  'papa wants to sleep ' but she says  'no  he's laughing ' and she was right   said countess mary with a happy smile
 yes  yes   and nicholas  taking his little daughter in his strong hand  lifted her high  placed her on his shoulder  held her by the legs  and paced the room with her
there was an expression of carefree happiness on the faces of both father and daughter
 but you know you may be unfair
you are too fond of this one   his wife whispered in french
 yes  but what am i to do   
i try not to show     at that moment they heard the sound of the door pulley and footsteps in the hall and anteroom  as if someone had arrived
 somebody has come    i am sure it is pierre
i will go and see   said countess mary and left the room
in her absence nicholas allowed himself to give his little daughter a gallop round the room out of breath  he took the laughing child quickly from his shoulder and pressed her to his heart
his capers reminded him of dancing  and looking at the child's round happy little face he thought of what she would be like when he was an old man  taking her into society and dancing the mazurka with her as his old father had danced daniel cooper with his daughter
 it is he  it is he  nicholas   said countess mary  re entering the room a few minutes later
 now our natasha has come to life
you should have seen her ecstasy  and how he caught it for having stayed away so long
well  come along now  quick  quick  it's time you two were parted   she added  looking smilingly at the little girl who clung to her father
nicholas went out holding the child by the hand
countess mary remained in the sitting room
 i should never  never have believed that one could be so happy   she whispered to herself
a smile lit up her face but at the same time she sighed  and her deep eyes expressed a quiet sadness as though she felt  through her happiness  that there is another sort of happiness unattainable in this life and of which she involuntarily thought at that instant
natasha had married in the early spring of 1813  and in 1820 already had three daughters besides a son for whom she had longed and whom she was now nursing
she had grown stouter and broader  so that it was difficult to recognize in this robust  motherly woman the slim  lively natasha of former days
her features were more defined and had a calm  soft  and serene expression
in her face there was none of the ever glowing animation that had formerly burned there and constituted its charm
now her face and body were often all that one saw  and her soul was not visible at all
all that struck the eye was a strong  handsome  and fertile woman
the old fire very rarely kindled in her face now
that happened only when  as was the case that day  her husband returned home  or a sick child was convalescent  or when she and countess mary spoke of prince andrew  she never mentioned him to her husband  who she imagined was jealous of prince andrew's memory   or on the rare occasions when something happened to induce her to sing  a practice she had quite abandoned since her marriage
at the rare moments when the old fire did kindle in her handsome  fully developed body she was even more attractive than in former days
since their marriage natasha and her husband had lived in moscow  in petersburg  on their estate near moscow  or with her mother  that is to say  in nicholas' house
the young countess bezukhova was not often seen in society  and those who met her there were not pleased with her and found her neither attractive nor amiable
not that natasha liked solitude she did not know whether she liked it or not  she even thought that she did not but with her pregnancies  her confinements  the nursing of her children  and sharing every moment of her husband's life  she had demands on her time which could be satisfied only by renouncing society
all who had known natasha before her marriage wondered at the change in her as at something extraordinary
only the old countess with her maternal instinct had realized that all natasha's outbursts had been due to her need of children and a husband as she herself had once exclaimed at otradnoe not so much in fun as in earnest and her mother was now surprised at the surprise expressed by those who had never understood natasha  and she kept saying that she had always known that natasha would make an exemplary wife and mother
 only she lets her love of her husband and children overflow all bounds   said the countess   so that it even becomes absurd   natasha did not follow the golden rule advocated by clever folk  especially by the french  which says that a girl should not let herself go when she marries  should not neglect her accomplishments  should be even more careful of her appearance than when she was unmarried  and should fascinate her husband as much as she did before he became her husband
natasha on the contrary had at once abandoned all her witchery  of which her singing had been an unusually powerful part
she gave it up just because it was so powerfully seductive
she took no pains with her manners or with delicacy of speech  or with her toilet  or to show herself to her husband in her most becoming attitudes  or to avoid inconveniencing him by being too exacting
she acted in contradiction to all those rules
she felt that the allurements instinct had formerly taught her to use would now be merely ridiculous in the eyes of her husband  to whom she had from the first moment given herself up entirely that is  with her whole soul  leaving no corner of it hidden from him
she felt that her unity with her husband was not maintained by the poetic feelings that had attracted him to her  but by something else indefinite but firm as the bond between her own body and soul
to fluff out her curls  put on fashionable dresses  and sing romantic songs to fascinate her husband would have seemed as strange as to adorn herself to attract herself
to adorn herself for others might perhaps have been agreeable  she did not know but she had no time at all for it
the chief reason for devoting no time either to singing  to dress  or to choosing her words was that she really had no time to spare for these things
we know that man has the faculty of becoming completely absorbed in a subject however trivial it may be  and that there is no subject so trivial that it will not grow to infinite proportions if one's entire attention is devoted to it
the subject which wholly engrossed natasha's attention was her family  that is  her husband whom she had to keep so that he should belong entirely to her and to the home  and the children whom she had to bear  bring into the world  nurse  and bring up
and the deeper she penetrated  not with her mind only but with her whole soul  her whole being  into the subject that absorbed her  the larger did that subject grow and the weaker and more inadequate did her powers appear  so that she concentrated them wholly on that one thing and yet was unable to accomplish all that she considered necessary
there were then as now conversations and discussions about women's rights  the relations of husband and wife and their freedom and rights  though these themes were not yet termed questions as they are now  but these topics were not merely uninteresting to natasha  she positively did not understand them
these questions  then as now  existed only for those who see nothing in marriage but the pleasure married people get from one another  that is  only the beginnings of marriage and not its whole significance  which lies in the family
discussions and questions of that kind  which are like the question of how to get the greatest gratification from one's dinner  did not then and do not now exist for those for whom the purpose of a dinner is the nourishment it affords  and the purpose of marriage is the family
if the purpose of dinner is to nourish the body  a man who eats two dinners at once may perhaps get more enjoyment but will not attain his purpose  for his stomach will not digest the two dinners
if the purpose of marriage is the family  the person who wishes to have many wives or husbands may perhaps obtain much pleasure  but in that case will not have a family
if the purpose of food is nourishment and the purpose of marriage is the family  the whole question resolves itself into not eating more than one can digest  and not having more wives or husbands than are needed for the family  that is  one wife or one husband
natasha needed a husband
a husband was given her and he gave her a family
and she not only saw no need of any other or better husband  but as all the powers of her soul were intent on serving that husband and family  she could not imagine and saw no interest in imagining how it would be if things were different
natasha did not care for society in general  but prized the more the society of her relatives countess mary  and her brother  her mother  and sonya
she valued the company of those to whom she could come striding disheveled from the nursery in her dressing gown  and with joyful face show a yellow instead of a green stain on baby's napkin  and from whom she could hear reassuring words to the effect that baby was much better
to such an extent had natasha let herself go that the way she dressed and did her hair  her ill chosen words  and her jealousy she was jealous of sonya  of the governess  and of every woman  pretty or plain were habitual subjects of jest to those about her
the general opinion was that pierre was under his wife's thumb  which was really true
from the very first days of their married life natasha had announced her demands
pierre was greatly surprised by his wife's view  to him a perfectly novel one  that every moment of his life belonged to her and to the family
his wife's demands astonished him  but they also flattered him  and he submitted to them
pierre's subjection consisted in the fact that he not only dared not flirt with  but dared not even speak smilingly to  any other woman  did not dare dine at the club as a pastime  did not dare spend money on a whim  and did not dare absent himself for any length of time  except on business in which his wife included his intellectual pursuits  which she did not in the least understand but to which she attributed great importance to make up for this  at home pierre had the right to regulate his life and that of the whole family exactly as he chose
at home natasha placed herself in the position of a slave to her husband  and the whole household went on tiptoe when he was occupied that is  was reading or writing in his study
pierre had but to show a partiality for anything to get just what he liked done always
he had only to express a wish and natasha would jump up and run to fulfill it
the entire household was governed according to pierre's supposed orders  that is  by his wishes which natasha tried to guess
their way of life and place of residence  their acquaintances and ties  natasha's occupations  the children's upbringing  were all selected not merely with regard to pierre's expressed wishes  but to what natasha from the thoughts he expressed in conversation supposed his wishes to be
and she deduced the essentials of his wishes quite correctly  and having once arrived at them clung to them tenaciously
when pierre himself wanted to change his mind she would fight him with his own weapons thus in a time of trouble ever memorable to him after the birth of their first child who was delicate  when they had to change the wet nurse three times and natasha fell ill from despair  pierre one day told her of rousseau's view  with which he quite agreed  that to have a wet nurse is unnatural and harmful
when her next baby was born  despite the opposition of her mother  the doctors  and even of her husband himself who were all vigorously opposed to her nursing her baby herself  a thing then unheard of and considered injurious she insisted on having her own way  and after that nursed all her babies herself it very often happened that in a moment of irritation husband and wife would have a dispute  but long afterwards pierre to his surprise and delight would find in his wife's ideas and actions the very thought against which she had argued  but divested of everything superfluous that in the excitement of the dispute he had added when expressing his opinion
after seven years of marriage pierre had the joyous and firm consciousness that he was not a bad man  and he felt this because he saw himself reflected in his wife he felt the good and bad within himself inextricably mingled and overlapping but only what was really good in him was reflected in his wife  all that was not quite good was rejected
and this was not the result of logical reasoning but was a direct and mysterious reflection
two months previously when pierre was already staying with the rostovs he had received a letter from prince theodore  asking him to come to petersburg to confer on some important questions that were being discussed there by a society of which pierre was one of the principal founders
on reading that letter  she always read her husband's letters  natasha herself suggested that he should go to petersburg  though she would feel his absence very acutely
she attributed immense importance to all her husband's intellectual and abstract interests though she did not understand them  and she always dreaded being a hindrance to him in such matters
to pierre's timid look of inquiry after reading the letter she replied by asking him to go  but to fix a definite date for his return
he was given four weeks' leave of absence
ever since that leave of absence had expired  more than a fortnight before  natasha had been in a constant state of alarm  depression  and irritability
denisov  now a general on the retired list and much dissatisfied with the present state of affairs  had arrived during that fortnight
he looked at natasha with sorrow and surprise as at a bad likeness of a person once dear
a dull  dejected look  random replies  and talk about the nursery was all he saw and heard from his former enchantress
natasha was sad and irritable all that time  especially when her mother  her brother  sonya  or countess mary in their efforts to console her tried to excuse pierre and suggested reasons for his delay in returning
 it's all nonsense  all rubbish those discussions which lead to nothing and all those idiotic societies   natasha declared of the very affairs in the immense importance of which she firmly believed
and she would go to the nursery to nurse petya  her only boy
no one else could tell her anything so comforting or so reasonable as this little threemonth old creature when he lay at her breast and she was conscious of the movement of his lips and the snuffling of his little nose
that creature said   you are angry  you are jealous  you would like to pay him out  you are afraid  but here am i  and i am he     and that was unanswerable
it was more than true
during that fortnight of anxiety natasha resorted to the baby for comfort so often  and fussed over him so much  that she overfed him and he fell ill
she was terrified by his illness  and yet that was just what she needed
while attending to him she bore the anxiety about her husband more easily
she was nursing her boy when the sound of pierre's sleigh was heard at the front door  and the old nurse knowing how to please her mistress entered the room inaudibly but hurriedly and with a beaming face
 has he come   natasha asked quickly in a whisper  afraid to move lest she should rouse the dozing baby
 he's come  ma'am   whispered the nurse
the blood rushed to natasha's face and her feet involuntarily moved  but she could not jump up and run out
the baby again opened his eyes and looked at her
 you're here   he seemed to be saying  and again lazily smacked his lips
cautiously withdrawing her breast  natasha rocked him a little  handed him to the nurse  and went with rapid steps toward the door
but at the door she stopped as if her conscience reproached her for having in her joy left the child too soon  and she glanced round
the nurse with raised elbows was lifting the infant over the rail of his cot
 go  ma'am  don't worry  go   she whispered  smiling  with the kind of familiarity that grows up between a nurse and her mistress
natasha ran with light footsteps to the anteroom
denisov  who had come out of the study into the dancing room with his pipe  now for the first time recognized the old natasha
a flood of brilliant  joyful light poured from her transfigured face
 he's come   she exclaimed as she ran past  and denisov felt that he too was delighted that pierre  whom he did not much care for  had returned
on reaching the vestibule natasha saw a tall figure in a fur coat unwinding his scarf
 it's he  it's really he  he has come   she said to herself  and rushing at him embraced him  pressed his head to her breast  and then pushed him back and gazed at his ruddy  happy face  covered with hoarfrost
 yes  it is he  happy and contented     then all at once she remembered the tortures of suspense she had experienced for the last fortnight  and the joy that had lit up her face vanished  she frowned and overwhelmed pierre with a torrent of reproaches and angry words
 yes  it's all very well for you
you are pleased  you've had a good time   
but what about me  you might at least have shown consideration for the children
i am nursing and my milk was spoiled   
petya was at death's door
but you were enjoying yourself
yes  enjoying     pierre knew he was not to blame  for he could not have come sooner  he knew this outburst was unseemly and would blow over in a minute or two  above all he knew that he himself was bright and happy he wanted to smile but dared not even think of doing so
he made a piteous  frightened face and bent down
 i could not  on my honor
but how is petya    all right now
come along  i wonder you're not ashamed  if only you could see what i was like without you  how i suffered    you are well    come  come   she said  not letting go of his arm
and they went to their rooms when nicholas and his wife came to look for pierre he was in the nursery holding his baby son  who was again awake  on his huge right palm and dandling him
a blissful bright smile was fixed on the baby's broad face with its toothless open mouth
the storm was long since over and there was bright  joyous sunshine on natasha's face as she gazed tenderly at her husband and child
 and have you talked everything well over with prince theodore   she asked
 yes  capitally    you see  he holds it up    she meant the baby's head    but how he did frighten me  
you've seen the princess  is it true she's in love with that      yes  just fancy     at that moment nicholas and countess mary came in
pierre with the baby on his hand stooped  kissed them  and replied to their inquiries
but in spite of much that was interesting and had to be discussed  the baby with the little cap on its unsteady head evidently absorbed all his attention
 how sweet   said countess mary  looking at and playing with the baby
 now  nicholas   she added  turning to her husband   i can't understand how it is you don't see the charm of these delicious marvels    i don't and can't   replied nicholas  looking coldly at the baby
 a lump of flesh
come along  pierre    and yet he's such an affectionate father   said countess mary  vindicating her husband   but only after they are a year old or so      now  pierre nurses them splendidly   said natasha
 he says his hand is just made for a baby's seat
just look    only not for this     pierre suddenly exclaimed with a laugh  and shifting the baby he gave him to the nurse
as in every large household  there were at bald hills several perfectly distinct worlds which merged into one harmonious whole  though each retained its own peculiarities and made concessions to the others
every event  joyful or sad  that took place in that house was important to all these worlds  but each had its own special reasons to rejoice or grieve over that occurrence independently of the others
for instance  pierre's return was a joyful and important event and they all felt it to be so
the servants the most reliable judges of their masters because they judge not by their conversation or expressions of feeling but by their acts and way of life  were glad of pierre's return because they knew that when he was there count nicholas would cease going every day to attend to the estate  and would be in better spirits and temper  and also because they would all receive handsome presents for the holidays
the children and their governesses were glad of pierre's return because no one else drew them into the social life of the household as he did
he alone could play on the clavichord that ecossaise  his only piece  to which  as he said  all possible dances could be danced  and they felt sure he had brought presents for them all
young nicholas  now a slim lad of fifteen  delicate and intelligent  with curly light brown hair and beautiful eyes  was delighted because uncle pierre as he called him was the object of his rapturous and passionate affection
no one had instilled into him this love for pierre whom he saw only occasionally
countess mary who had brought him up had done her utmost to make him love her husband as she loved him  and little nicholas did love his uncle  but loved him with just a shade of contempt
pierre  however  he adored
he did not want to be an hussar or a knight of st
george like his uncle nicholas  he wanted to be learned  wise  and kind like pierre
in pierre's presence his face always shone with pleasure and he flushed and was breathless when pierre spoke to him
he did not miss a single word he uttered  and would afterwards  with dessalles or by himself  recall and reconsider the meaning of everything pierre had said pierre's past life and his unhappiness prior to 1812  of which young nicholas had formed a vague poetic picture from some words he had overheard   his adventures in moscow  his captivity  platon karataev  of whom he had heard from pierre   his love for natasha  of whom the lad was also particularly fond   and especially pierre's friendship with the father whom nicholas could not remember all this made pierre in his eyes a hero and a saint
from broken remarks about natasha and his father  from the emotion with which pierre spoke of that dead father  and from the careful  reverent tenderness with which natasha spoke of him  the boy  who was only just beginning to guess what love is  derived the notion that his father had loved natasha and when dying had left her to his friend
but the father whom the boy did not remember appeared to him a divinity who could not be pictured  and of whom he never thought without a swelling heart and tears of sadness and rapture
so the boy also was happy that pierre had arrived
the guests welcomed pierre because he always helped to enliven and unite any company he was in
the grown up members of the family  not to mention his wife  were pleased to have back a friend whose presence made life run more smoothly and peacefully
the old ladies were pleased with the presents he brought them  and especially that natasha would now be herself again
pierre felt the different outlooks of these various worlds and made haste to satisfy all their expectations
though the most absent minded and forgetful of men  pierre  with the aid of a list his wife drew up  had now bought everything  not forgetting his mother  and brother in law's commissions  nor the dress material for a present to belova  nor toys for his wife's nephews
in the early days of his marriage it had seemed strange to him that his wife should expect him not to forget to procure all the things he undertook to buy  and he had been taken aback by her serious annoyance when on his first trip he forgot everything
but in time he grew used to this demand
knowing that natasha asked nothing for herself  and gave him commissions for others only when he himself had offered to undertake them  he now found an unexpected and childlike pleasure in this purchase of presents for everyone in the house  and never forgot anything if he now incurred natasha's censure it was only for buying too many and too expensive things
to her other defects  as most people thought them  but which to pierre were qualities  of untidiness and neglect of herself  she now added stinginess
from the time that pierre began life as a family man on a footing entailing heavy expenditure  he had noticed to his surprise that he spent only half as much as before  and that his affairs which had been in disorder of late  chiefly because of his first wife's debts had begun to improve
life was cheaper because it was circumscribed  that most expensive luxury  the kind of life that can be changed at any moment  was no longer his nor did he wish for it he felt that his way of life had now been settled once for all till death and that to change it was not in his power  and so that way of life proved economical
with a merry  smiling face pierre was sorting his purchases
 what do you think of this   said he  unrolling a piece of stuff like a shopman
natasha  who was sitting opposite to him with her eldest daughter on her lap  turned her sparkling eyes swiftly from her husband to the things he showed her
 that's for belova  excellent   she felt the quality of the material
 it was a ruble an arshin  i suppose   pierre told her the price
 too dear   natasha remarked
 how pleased the children will be and mamma too  only you need not have bought me this   she added  unable to suppress a smile as she gazed admiringly at a gold comb set with pearls  of a kind then just coming into fashion
 adele tempted me  she kept on telling me to buy it   returned pierre
 when am i to wear it   and natasha stuck it in her coil of hair
 when i take little masha into society  perhaps they will be fashionable again by then
well  let's go now   and collecting the presents they went first to the nursery and then to the old countess' rooms the countess was sitting with her companion belova  playing grand patience as usual  when pierre and natasha came into the drawing room with parcels under their arms the countess was now over sixty  was quite gray  and wore a cap with a frill that surrounded her face
her face had shriveled  her upper lip had sunk in  and her eyes were dim
after the deaths of her son and husband in such rapid succession  she felt herself a being accidentally forgotten in this world and left without aim or object for her existence
she ate  drank  slept  or kept awake  but did not live
life gave her no new impressions
she wanted nothing from life but tranquillity  and that tranquillity only death could give her
but until death came she had to go on living  that is  to use her vital forces
a peculiarity one sees in very young children and very old people was particularly evident in her
her life had no external aims only a need to exercise her various functions and inclinations was apparent she had to eat  sleep  think  speak  weep  work  give vent to her anger  and so on  merely because she had a stomach  a brain  muscles  nerves  and a liver
she did these things not under any external impulse as people in the full vigor of life do  when behind the purpose for which they strive that of exercising their functions remains unnoticed
she talked only because she physically needed to exercise her tongue and lungs
she cried as a child does  because her nose had to be cleared  and so on
what for people in their full vigor is an aim was for her evidently merely a pretext
thus in the morning especially if she had eaten anything rich the day before  she felt a need of being angry and would choose as the handiest pretext belova's deafness
she would begin to say something to her in a low tone from the other end of the room
 it seems a little warmer today  my dear   she would murmur and when belova replied   oh yes  they've come   she would mutter angrily   o lord  how stupid and deaf she is   another pretext would be her snuff  which would seem too dry or too damp or not rubbed fine enough
after these fits of irritability her face would grow yellow  and her maids knew by infallible symptoms when belova would again be deaf  the snuff damp  and the countess' face yellow just as she needed to work off her spleen so she had sometimes to exercise her still existing faculty of thinking and the pretext for that was a game of patience
when she needed to cry  the deceased count would be the pretext
when she wanted to be agitated  nicholas and his health would be the pretext  and when she felt a need to speak spitefully  the pretext would be countess mary
when her vocal organs needed exercise  which was usually toward seven o'clock when she had had an after dinner rest in a darkened room  the pretext would be the retelling of the same stories over and over again to the same audience
the old lady's condition was understood by the whole household though no one ever spoke of it  and they all made every possible effort to satisfy her needs
only by a rare glance exchanged with a sad smile between nicholas  pierre  natasha  and countess mary was the common understanding of her condition expressed
but those glances expressed something more  they said that she had played her part in life  that what they now saw was not her whole self  that we must all become like her  and that they were glad to yield to her  to restrain themselves for this once precious being formerly as full of life as themselves  but now so much to be pitied  memento mori   said these glances
only the really heartless  the stupid ones of that household  and the little children failed to understand this and avoided her
when pierre and his wife entered the drawing room the countess was in one of her customary states in which she needed the mental exertion of playing patience  and so though by force of habit she greeted him with the words she always used when pierre or her son returned after an absence   high time  my dear  high time  we were all weary of waiting for you
well  thank god   and received her presents with another customary remark   it's not the gift that's precious  my dear  but that you give it to me  an old woman     yet it was evident that she was not pleased by pierre's arrival at that moment when it diverted her attention from the unfinished game
she finished her game of patience and only then examined the presents
they consisted of a box for cards  of splendid workmanship  a bright blue sevres tea cup with shepherdesses depicted on it and with a lid  and a gold snuffbox with the count's portrait on the lid which pierre had had done by a miniaturist in petersburg
the countess had long wished for such a box  but as she did not want to cry just then she glanced indifferently at the portrait and gave her attention chiefly to the box for cards
 thank you  my dear  you have cheered me up   said she as she always did
 but best of all you have brought yourself back for i never saw anything like it  you ought to give your wife a scolding  what are we to do with her  she is like a mad woman when you are away
doesn't see anything  doesn't remember anything   she went on  repeating her usual phrases
 look  anna timofeevna   she added to her companion   see what a box for cards my son has brought us   belova admired the presents and was delighted with her dress material
though pierre  natasha  nicholas  countess mary  and denisov had much to talk about that they could not discuss before the old countess not that anything was hidden from her  but because she had dropped so far behindhand in many things that had they begun to converse in her presence they would have had to answer inopportune questions and to repeat what they had already told her many times  that so and so was dead and so and so was married  which she would again be unable to remember yet they sat at tea round the samovar in the drawing room from habit  and pierre answered the countess' questions as to whether prince vasili had aged and whether countess mary alexeevna had sent greetings and still thought of them  and other matters that interested no one and to which she herself was indifferent
conversation of this kind  interesting to no one yet unavoidable  continued all through teatime
all the grown up members of the family were assembled near the round tea table at which sonya presided beside the samovar
the children with their tutors and governesses had had tea and their voices were audible from the next room
at tea all sat in their accustomed places  nicholas beside the stove at a small table where his tea was handed to him  milka  the old gray borzoi bitch  daughter of the first milka   with a quite gray face and large black eyes that seemed more prominent than ever  lay on the armchair beside him  denisov  whose curly hair  mustache  and whiskers had turned half gray  sat beside countess mary with his general's tunic unbuttoned  pierre sat between his wife and the old countess
he spoke of what he knew might interest the old lady and that she could understand
he told her of external social events and of the people who had formed the circle of her contemporaries and had once been a real  living  and distinct group  but who were now for the most part scattered about the world and like herself were garnering the last ears of the harvests they had sown in earlier years
but to the old countess those contemporaries of hers seemed to be the only serious and real society
natasha saw by pierre's animation that his visit had been interesting and that he had much to tell them but dare not say it before the old countess
denisov  not being a member of the family  did not understand pierre's caution and being  as a malcontent  much interested in what was occurring in petersburg  kept urging pierre to tell them about what had happened in the semenovsk regiment  then about arakcheev  and then about the bible society
once or twice pierre was carried away and began to speak of these things  but nicholas and natasha always brought him back to the health of prince ivan and countess mary alexeevna
 well  and all this idiocy gossner and tatawinova   denisov asked
 is that weally still going on    going on   pierre exclaimed
 why more than ever  the bible society is the whole government now    what is that  mon cher ami   asked the countess  who had finished her tea and evidently needed a pretext for being angry after her meal
 what are you saying about the government  i don't understand    well  you know  maman   nicholas interposed  knowing how to translate things into his mother's language   prince alexander golitsyn has founded a society and in consequence has great influence  they say    arakcheev and golitsyn   incautiously remarked pierre   are now the whole government  and what a government  they see treason everywhere and are afraid of everything    well  and how is prince alexander to blame  he is a most estimable man
i used to meet him at mary antonovna's   said the countess in an offended tone  and still more offended that they all remained silent  she went on   nowadays everyone finds fault
a gospel society  well  and what harm is there in that   and she rose  everybody else got up too  and with a severe expression sailed back to her table in the sitting room
the melancholy silence that followed was broken by the sounds of the children's voices and laughter from the next room
evidently some jolly excitement was going on there
 finished  finished   little natasha's gleeful yell rose above them all
pierre exchanged glances with countess mary and nicholas  natasha he never lost sight of  and smiled happily
 that's delightful music   said he
 it means that anna makarovna has finished her stocking   said countess mary
 oh  i'll go and see   said pierre  jumping up
 you know   he added  stopping at the door   why i'm especially fond of that music  it is always the first thing that tells me all is well
when i was driving here today  the nearer i got to the house the more anxious i grew
as i entered the anteroom i heard andrusha's peals of laughter and that meant that all was well    i know  i know that feeling   said nicholas
 but i mustn't go there those stockings are to be a surprise for me   pierre went to the children  and the shouting and laughter grew still louder
 come  anna makarovna   pierre's voice was heard saying   come here into the middle of the room and at the word of command  'one  two ' and when i say 'three'  
you stand here  and you in my arms well now  one  two      said pierre  and a silence followed   three   and a rapturously breathless cry of children's voices filled the room  two  two   they shouted
this meant two stockings  which by a secret process known only to herself anna makarovna used to knit at the same time on the same needles  and which  when they were ready  she always triumphantly drew  one out of the other  in the children's presence
soon after this the children came in to say good night
they kissed everyone  the tutors and governesses made their bows  and they went out
only young nicholas and his tutor remained
dessalles whispered to the boy to come downstairs
 no  monsieur dessalles  i will ask my aunt to let me stay   replied nicholas bolkonski also in a whisper
 ma tante  please let me stay   said he  going up to his aunt
his face expressed entreaty  agitation  and ecstasy
countess mary glanced at him and turned to pierre
 when you are here he can't tear himself away   she said  i will bring him to you directly  monsieur dessalles
good night   said pierre  giving his hand to the swiss tutor  and he turned to young nicholas with a smile
 you and i haven't seen anything of one another yet  
how like he is growing  mary   he added  addressing countess mary
 like my father   asked the boy  flushing crimson and looking up at pierre with bright  ecstatic eyes pierre nodded  and went on with what he had been saying when the children had interrupted
countess mary sat down doing woolwork  natasha did not take her eyes off her husband
nicholas and denisov rose  asked for their pipes  smoked  went to fetch more tea from sonya who sat weary but resolute at the samovar and questioned pierre the curly headed  delicate boy sat with shining eyes unnoticed in a corner  starting every now and then and muttering something to himself  and evidently experiencing a new and powerful emotion as he turned his curly head  with his thin neck exposed by his turn down collar  toward the place where pierre sat the conversation turned on the contemporary gossip about those in power  in which most people see the chief interest of home politics
denisov  dissatisfied with the government on account of his own disappointments in the service  heard with pleasure of the things done in petersburg which seemed to him stupid  and made forcible and sharp comments on what pierre told them
 one used to have to be a german now one must dance with tatawinova and madame kwudener  and wead ecka'tshausen and the bwethwen
oh  they should let that fine fellow bonaparte loose he'd knock all this nonsense out of them  fancy giving the command of the semenov wegiment to a fellow like that schwa'tz   he cried
nicholas  though free from denisov's readiness to find fault with everything  also thought that discussion of the government was a very serious and weighty matter  and the fact that a had been appointed minister of this and b governor general of that  and that the emperor had said so and so and this minister so and so  seemed to him very important
and so he thought it necessary to take an interest in these things and to question pierre
the questions put by these two kept the conversation from changing its ordinary character of gossip about the higher government circles
but natasha  knowing all her husband's ways and ideas  saw that he had long been wishing but had been unable to divert the conversation to another channel and express his own deeply felt idea for the sake of which he had gone to petersburg to consult with his new friend prince theodore  and she helped him by asking how his affairs with prince theodore had gone
 what was it about   asked nicholas
 always the same thing   said pierre  looking round at his listeners
 everybody sees that things are going so badly that they cannot be allowed to go on so and that it is the duty of all decent men to counteract it as far as they can    what can decent men do   nicholas inquired  frowning slightly
 what can be done    why  this      come into my study   said nicholas
natasha  who had long expected to be fetched to nurse her baby  now heard the nurse calling her and went to the nursery countess mary followed her
the men went into the study and little nicholas bolkonski followed them unnoticed by his uncle and sat down at the writing table in a shady corner by the window
 well  what would you do   asked denisov
 always some fantastic schemes   said nicholas
 why this   began pierre  not sitting down but pacing the room  sometimes stopping short  gesticulating  and lisping   the position in petersburg is this  the emperor does not look into anything
he has abandoned himself altogether to this mysticism   pierre could not tolerate mysticism in anyone now   he seeks only for peace  and only these people sans foi ni loi * can give it him  people who recklessly hack at and strangle everything magnitski  arakcheev  and tutti quanti   
you will agree that if you did not look after your estates yourself but only wanted a quiet life  the harsher your steward was the more readily your object might be attained   he said to nicholas
* without faith or law
 well  what does that lead up to   said nicholas
 well  everything is going to ruin  robbery in the law courts  in the army nothing but flogging  drilling  and military settlements  the people are tortured  enlightenment is suppressed
all that is young and honest is crushed  everyone sees that this cannot go on
everything is strained to such a degree that it will certainly break   said pierre  as those who examine the actions of any government have always said since governments began 
 i told them just one thing in petersburg    told whom    well  you know whom   said pierre  with a meaning glance from under his brows
 prince theodore and all those
to encourage culture and philanthropy is all very well of course
the aim is excellent but in the present circumstances something else is needed   at that moment nicholas noticed the presence of his nephew his face darkened and he went up to the boy
 why are you here    why  let him be   said pierre  taking nicholas by the arm and continuing
 that is not enough  i told them
something else is needed
when you stand expecting the overstrained string to snap at any moment  when everyone is expecting the inevitable catastrophe  as many as possible must join hands as closely as they can to withstand the general calamity
everything that is young and strong is being enticed away and depraved
one is lured by women  another by honors  a third by ambition or money  and they go over to that camp
no independent men  such as you or i  are left
what i say is widen the scope of our society  let the mot d'ordre be not virtue alone but independence and action as well   nicholas  who had left his nephew  irritably pushed up an armchair  sat down in it  and listened to pierre  coughing discontentedly and frowning more and more
 but action with what aim   he cried
 and what position will you adopt toward the government    why  the position of assistants
the society need not be secret if the government allows it
not merely is it not hostile to government  but it is a society of true conservatives a society of gentlemen in the full meaning of that word
it is only to prevent some pugachev or other from killing my children and yours  and arakcheev from sending me off to some military settlement
we join hands only for the public welfare and the general safety    yes  but it's a secret society and therefore a hostile and harmful one which can only cause harm    why  did the tugendbund which saved europe   they did not then venture to suggest that russia had saved europe   do any harm  the tugendbund is an alliance of virtue  it is love  mutual help  
it is what christ preached on the cross   natasha  who had come in during the conversation  looked joyfully at her husband
it was not what he was saying that pleased her that did not even interest her  for it seemed to her that was all extremely simple and that she had known it a long time  it seemed so to her because she knew that it sprang from pierre's whole soul   but it was his animated and enthusiastic appearance that made her glad
the boy with the thin neck stretching out from the turn down collar whom everyone had forgotten gazed at pierre with even greater and more rapturous joy every word of pierre's burned into his heart  and with a nervous movement of his fingers he unconsciously broke the sealing wax and quill pens his hands came upon on his uncle's table
 it is not at all what you suppose  but that is what the german tugendbund was  and what i am proposing    no  my fwiend  the tugendbund is all vewy well for the sausage eaters  but i don't understand it and can't even pwonounce it   interposed denisov in a loud and resolute voice
 i agwee that evewything here is wotten and howwible  but the tugendbund i don't understand
if we're not satisfied  let us have a bunt of our own
that's all wight
je suis vot'e homme   * *  i'm your man   pierre smiled  natasha began to laugh  but nicholas knitted his brows still more and began proving to pierre that there was no prospect of any great change and that all the danger he spoke of existed only in his imagination
pierre maintained the contrary  and as his mental faculties were greater and more resourceful  nicholas felt himself cornered this made him still angrier  for he was fully convinced  not by reasoning but by something within him stronger than reason  of the justice of his opinion
 i will tell you this   he said  rising and trying with nervously twitching fingers to prop up his pipe in a corner  but finally abandoning the attempt
 i can't prove it to you
you say that everything here is rotten and that an overthrow is coming  i don't see it
but you also say that our oath of allegiance is a conditional matter  and to that i reply  'you are my best friend  as you know  but if you formed a secret society and began working against the government be it what it may i know it is my duty to obey the government
and if arakcheev ordered me to lead a squadron against you and cut you down  i should not hesitate an instant  but should do it ' and you may argue about that as you like   an awkward silence followed these words
natasha was the first to speak  defending her husband and attacking her brother
her defense was weak and inapt but she attained her object
the conversation was resumed  and no longer in the unpleasantly hostile tone of nicholas' last remark
when they all got up to go in to supper  little nicholas bolkonski went up to pierre  pale and with shining  radiant eyes
 uncle pierre  you  
no  
if papa were alive  
would he agree with you   he asked
and pierre suddenly realized what a special  independent  complex  and powerful process of thought and feeling must have been going on in this boy during that conversation  and remembering all he had said he regretted that the lad should have heard him
he had  however  to give him an answer
 yes  i think so   he said reluctantly  and left the study
the lad looked down and seemed now for the first time to notice what he had done to the things on the table
he flushed and went up to nicholas
 uncle  forgive me  i did that  
unintentionally   he said  pointing to the broken sealing wax and pens
nicholas started angrily
 all right  all right   he said  throwing the bits under the table
and evidently suppressing his vexation with difficulty  he turned away from the boy
 you ought not to have been here at all   he said
the conversation at supper was not about politics or societies  but turned on the subject nicholas liked best recollections of 1812
denisov started these and pierre was particularly agreeable and amusing about them
the family separated on the most friendly terms after supper nicholas  having undressed in his study and given instructions to the steward who had been waiting for him  went to the bedroom in his dressing gown  where he found his wife still at her table  writing
 what are you writing  mary   nicholas asked
countess mary blushed
she was afraid that what she was writing would not be understood or approved by her husband
she had wanted to conceal what she was writing from him  but at the same time was glad he had surprised her at it and that she would now have to tell him
her firm  bold writing
it was in french
december 4
today when andrusha  her eldest boy  woke up he did not wish to dress and mademoiselle louise sent for me
he was naughty and obstinate
i tried threats  but he only grew angrier
then i took the matter in hand  i left him alone and began with nurse's help to get the other children up  telling him that i did not love him
for a long time he was silent  as if astonished  then he jumped out of bed  ran to me in his shirt  and sobbed so that i could not calm him for a long time
it was plain that what troubled him most was that he had grieved me
afterwards in the evening when i gave him his ticket  he again began crying piteously and kissing me
one can do anything with him by tenderness
 what is a 'ticket'   nicholas inquired
 i have begun giving the elder ones marks every evening  showing how they have behaved   nicholas looked into the radiant eyes that were gazing at him  and continued to turn over the pages and read
in the diary was set down everything in the children's lives that seemed noteworthy to their mother as showing their characters or suggesting general reflections on educational methods
they were for the most part quite insignificant trifles  but did not seem so to the mother or to the father either  now that he read this diary about his children for the first time
under the date  5  was entered  mitya was naughty at table
papa said he was to have no pudding
he had none  but looked so unhappily and greedily at the others while they were eating  i think that punishment by depriving children of sweets only develops their greediness
must tell nicholas this
him questioningly  would he approve or disapprove of her diary  there could be no doubt not only of his approval but also of his admiration for his wife
perhaps it need not be done so pedantically  thought nicholas  or even done at all  but this untiring  continual spiritual effort of which the sole aim was the children's moral welfare delighted him
had nicholas been able to analyze his feelings he would have found that his steady  tender  and proud love of his wife rested on his feeling of wonder at her spirituality and at the lofty moral world  almost beyond his reach  in which she had her being
he was proud of her intelligence and goodness  recognized his own insignificance beside her in the spiritual world  and rejoiced all the more that she with such a soul not only belonged to him but was part of himself  i quite  quite approve  my dearest   said he with a significant look  and after a short pause he added   and i behaved badly today
you weren't in the study
we began disputing pierre and i and i lost my temper
but he is impossible  such a child  i don't know what would become of him if natasha didn't keep him in hand   
have you any idea why he went to petersburg  they have formed      yes  i know   said countess mary
 natasha told me    well  then  you know   nicholas went on  growing hot at the mere recollection of their discussion   he wanted to convince me that it is every honest man's duty to go against the government  and that the oath of allegiance and duty  
i am sorry you weren't there
they all fell on me denisov and natasha  
natasha is absurd
how she rules over him  and yet there need only be a discussion and she has no words of her own but only repeats his sayings     added nicholas  yielding to that irresistible inclination which tempts us to judge those nearest and dearest to us
he forgot that what he was saying about natasha could have been applied word for word to himself in relation to his wife  yes  i have noticed that   said countess mary
 when i told him that duty and the oath were above everything  he started proving goodness knows what  a pity you were not there what would you have said    as i see it you were quite right  and i told natasha so
pierre says everybody is suffering  tortured  and being corrupted  and that it is our duty to help our neighbor
of course he is right there   said countess mary   but he forgets that we have other duties nearer to us  duties indicated to us by god himself  and that though we might expose ourselves to risks we must not risk our children    yes  that's it  that's just what i said to him   put in nicholas  who fancied he really had said it  but they insisted on their own view  love of one's neighbor and christianity and all this in the presence of young nicholas  who had gone into my study and broke all my things    ah  nicholas  do you know i am often troubled about little nicholas   said countess mary
 he is such an exceptional boy
i am afraid i neglect him in favor of my own  we all have children and relations while he has no one
he is constantly alone with his thoughts    well  i don't think you need reproach yourself on his account
all that the fondest mother could do for her son you have done and are doing for him  and of course i am glad of it
he is a fine lad  a fine lad  this evening he listened to pierre in a sort of trance  and fancy as we were going in to supper i looked and he had broken everything on my table to bits  and he told me of it himself at once  i never knew him to tell an untruth a fine lad  a fine lad   repeated nicholas  who at heart was not fond of nicholas bolkonski but was always anxious to recognize that he was a fine lad
 still  i am not the same as his own mother   said countess mary
 i feel i am not the same and it troubles me
a wonderful boy  but i am dreadfully afraid for him
it would be good for him to have companions    well it won't be for long
next summer i'll take him to petersburg   said nicholas
 yes  pierre always was a dreamer and always will be   he continued  returning to the talk in the study which had evidently disturbed him
 well  what business is it of mine what goes on there whether arakcheev is bad  and all that  what business was it of mine when i married and was so deep in debt that i was threatened with prison  and had a mother who could not see or understand it  and then there are you and the children and our affairs
is it for my own pleasure that i am at the farm or in the office from morning to night  no  but i know i must work to comfort my mother  to repay you  and not to leave the children such beggars as i was   countess mary wanted to tell him that man does not live by bread alone and that he attached too much importance to these matters
but she knew she must not say this and that it would be useless to do so
she only took his hand and kissed it
he took this as a sign of approval and a confirmation of his thoughts  and after a few minutes' reflection continued to think aloud
 you know  mary  today elias mitrofanych   this was his overseer   came back from the tambov estate and told me they are already offering eighty thousand rubles for the forest   and with an eager face nicholas began to speak of the possibility of repurchasing otradnoe before long  and added   another ten years of life and i shall leave the children  
in an excellent position   countess mary listened to her husband and understood all that he told her
she knew that when he thought aloud in this way he would sometimes ask her what he had been saying  and be vexed if he noticed that she had been thinking about something else
but she had to force herself to attend  for what he was saying did not interest her at all
she looked at him and did not think  but felt  about something different
she felt a submissive tender love for this man who would never understand all that she understood  and this seemed to make her love for him still stronger and added a touch of passionate tenderness
besides this feeling which absorbed her altogether and hindered her from following the details of her husband's plans  thoughts that had no connection with what he was saying flitted through her mind
she thought of her nephew
her husband's account of the boy's agitation while pierre was speaking struck her forcibly  and various traits of his gentle  sensitive character recurred to her mind  and while thinking of her nephew she thought also of her own children
she did not compare them with him  but compared her feeling for them with her feeling for him  and felt with regret that there was something lacking in her feeling for young nicholas
sometimes it seemed to her that this difference arose from the difference in their ages  but she felt herself to blame toward him and promised in her heart to do better and to accomplish the impossible in this life to love her husband  her children  little nicholas  and all her neighbors  as christ loved mankind
countess mary's soul always strove toward the infinite  the eternal  and the absolute  and could therefore never be at peace
a stern expression of the lofty  secret suffering of a soul burdened by the body appeared on her face
nicholas gazed at her
 o god  what will become of us if she dies  as i always fear when her face is like that   thought he  and placing himself before the icon he began to say his evening prayers natasha and pierre  left alone  also began to talk as only a husband and wife can talk  that is  with extraordinary clearness and rapidity  understanding and expressing each other's thoughts in ways contrary to all rules of logic  without premises  deductions  or conclusions  and in a quite peculiar way
natasha was so used to this kind of talk with her husband that for her it was the surest sign of something being wrong between them if pierre followed a line of logical reasoning
when he began proving anything  or talking argumentatively and calmly and she  led on by his example  began to do the same  she knew that they were on the verge of a quarrel
from the moment they were alone and natasha came up to him with wideopen happy eyes  and quickly seizing his head pressed it to her bosom  saying   now you are all mine  mine  you won't escape   from that moment this conversation began  contrary to all the laws of logic and contrary to them because quite different subjects were talked about at one and the same time
this simultaneous discussion of many topics did not prevent a clear understanding but on the contrary was the surest sign that they fully understood one another
just as in a dream when all is uncertain  unreasoning  and contradictory  except the feeling that guides the dream  so in this intercourse contrary to all laws of reason  the words themselves were not consecutive and clear but only the feeling that prompted them natasha spoke to pierre about her brother's life and doings  of how she had suffered and lacked life during his own absence  and of how she was fonder than ever of mary  and how mary was in every way better than herself
in saying this natasha was sincere in acknowledging mary's superiority  but at the same time by saying it she made a demand on pierre that he should  all the same  prefer her to mary and to all other women  and that now  especially after having seen many women in petersburg  he should tell her so afresh
pierre  answering natasha's words  told her how intolerable it had been for him to meet ladies at dinners and balls in petersburg
 i have quite lost the knack of talking to ladies   he said
 it was simply dull
besides  i was very busy   natasha looked intently at him and went on   mary is so splendid   she said
 how she understands children  it is as if she saw straight into their souls
yesterday  for instance  mitya was naughty      how like his father he is   pierre interjected
natasha knew why he mentioned mitya's likeness to nicholas  the recollection of his dispute with his brother in law was unpleasant and he wanted to know what natasha thought of it
 nicholas has the weakness of never agreeing with anything not generally accepted
but i understand that you value what opens up a fresh line   said she  repeating words pierre had once uttered
 no  the chief point is that to nicholas ideas and discussions are an amusement almost a pastime   said pierre
 for instance  he is collecting a had already bought sismondi and rousseau and montesquieu   he added with a smile
 you know how much i     he began to soften down what he had said  but natasha interrupted him to show that this was unnecessary
 so you say ideas are an amusement to him       yes  and for me nothing else is serious
all the time in petersburg i saw everyone as in a dream
when i am taken up by a thought  all else is mere amusement    ah  i'm so sorry i wasn't there when you met the children   said natasha
 which was most delighted  lisa  i'm sure    yes   pierre replied  and went on with what was in his mind
 nicholas says we ought not to think
but i can't help it
besides  when i was in petersburg i felt  i can say this to you  that the whole affair would go to pieces without me  everyone was pulling his own way
but i succeeded in uniting them all  and then my idea is so clear and simple
you see  i don't say that we ought to oppose this and that
we may be mistaken
what i say is  'join hands  you who love the right  and let there be but one banner that of active virtue ' prince sergey is a fine fellow and clever   natasha would have had no doubt as to the greatness of pierre's idea  but one thing disconcerted her
 can a man so important and necessary to society be also my husband  how did this happen   she wished to express this doubt to him
 now who could decide whether he is really cleverer than all the others   she asked herself  and passed in review all those whom pierre most respected
judging by what he had said there was no one he had respected so highly as platon karataev
 do you know what i am thinking about   she asked
 about platon karataev
would he have approved of you now  do you think   pierre was not at all surprised at this question
he understood his wife's line of thought
 platon karataev   he repeated  and pondered  evidently sincerely trying to imagine karataev's opinion on the subject
 he would not have understood  
yet perhaps he would    i love you awfully   natasha suddenly said
 awfully  awfully    no  he would not have approved   said pierre  after reflection
 what he would have approved of is our family life
he was always so anxious to find seemliness  happiness  and peace in everything  and i should have been proud to let him see us
there now you talk of my absence  but you wouldn't believe what a special feeling i have for you after a separation       yes  i should think     natasha began
 no  it's not that
i never leave off loving you
and one couldn't love more  but this is something special   
yes  of course   he did not finish because their eyes meeting said the rest
 what nonsense it is   natasha suddenly exclaimed   about honeymoons  and that the greatest happiness is at first  on the contrary  now is the best of all
if only you did not go away  do you remember how we quarreled  and it was always my fault
always mine
and what we quarreled about i don't even remember    always about the same thing   said pierre with a smile
 jealo      don't say it  i can't bear it   natasha cried  and her eyes glittered coldly and vindictively
 did you see her   she added  after a pause
 no  and if i had i shouldn't have recognized her   they were silent for a while
 oh  do you know  while you were talking in the study i was looking at you   natasha began  evidently anxious to disperse the cloud that had come over them
 you are as like him as two peas like the boy    she meant her little son    oh  it's time to go to him   
the milk's come   
but i'm sorry to leave you   they were silent for a few seconds
then suddenly turning to one another at the same time they both began to speak
pierre began with self satisfaction and enthusiasm  natasha with a quiet  happy smile
having interrupted one another they both stopped to let the other continue
 no
what did you say  go on  go on    no  you go on  i was talking nonsense   said natasha
pierre finished what he had begun
it was the sequel to his complacent reflections on his success in petersburg
at that moment it seemed to him that he was chosen to give a new direction to the whole of russian society and to the whole world
 i only wished to say that ideas that have great results are always simple ones
my whole idea is that if vicious people are united and constitute a power  then honest folk must do the same
now that's simple enough    yes    and what were you going to say    i  only nonsense    but all the same    oh nothing  only a trifle   said natasha  smilingly still more brightly
 i only wanted to tell you about petya  today nurse was coming to take him from me  and he laughed  shut his eyes  and clung to me
i'm sure he thought he was hiding
awfully sweet  there  now he's crying
well  good by   and she left the room
meanwhile downstairs in young nicholas bolkonski's bedroom a little lamp was burning as usual
 the boy was afraid of the dark and they could not cure him of it   dessalles slept propped up on four pillows and his roman nose emitted sounds of rhythmic snoring
little nicholas  who had just waked up in a cold perspiration  sat up in bed and gazed before him with wide open eyes
he had awaked from a terrible dream
he had dreamed that he and uncle pierre  wearing helmets such as were depicted in his plutarch  were leading a huge army
the army was made up of white slanting lines that filled the air like the cobwebs that float about in autumn and which dessalles called les fils de la vierge
in front was glory  which was similar to those threads but rather thicker
he and pierre were borne along lightly and joyously  nearer and nearer to their goal
suddenly the threads that moved them began to slacken and become entangled and it grew difficult to move
and uncle nicholas stood before them in a stern and threatening attitude
 have you done this   he said  pointing to some broken sealing wax and pens
 i loved you  but i have orders from arakcheev and will kill the first of you who moves forward   little nicholas turned to look at pierre but pierre was no longer there
in his place was his father prince andrew and his father had neither shape nor form  but he existed  and when little nicholas perceived him he grew faint with love  he felt himself powerless  limp  and formless his father caressed and pitied him
but uncle nicholas came nearer and nearer to them
terror seized young nicholas and he awoke
 my father   he thought
 though there were two good portraits of prince andrew in the house  nicholas never imagined him in human form    my father has been with me and caressed me
he approved of me and of uncle pierre
whatever he may tell me  i will do it
mucius scaevola burned his hand
why should not the same sort of thing happen to me  i know they want me to learn
and i will learn
but someday i shall have finished learning  and then i will do something
i only pray god that something may happen to me such as happened to plutarch's men  and i will act as they did
i will do better
everyone shall know me  love me  and be delighted with me   and suddenly his bosom heaved with sobs and he began to cry
 are you ill   he heard dessalles' voice asking
 no   answered nicholas  and lay back on his pillow
 he is good and kind and i am fond of him   he thought of dessalles
 but uncle pierre  oh  what a wonderful man he is  and my father  oh  father  father  yes  i will do something with which even he would be satisfied      second epilogue history is the life of nations and of humanity
to seize and put into words  to describe directly the life of humanity or even of a single nation  appears impossible
the ancient historians all employed one and the same method to describe and seize the apparently elusive the life of a people
they described the activity of individuals who ruled the people  and regarded the activity of those men as representing the activity of the whole nation
the question  how did individuals make nations act as they wished and by what was the will of these individuals themselves guided  the ancients met by recognizing a divinity which subjected the nations to the will of a chosen man  and guided the will of that chosen man so as to accomplish ends that were predestined for the ancients these questions were solved by a belief in the direct participation of the deity in human affairs
modern history  in theory  rejects both these principles
it would seem that having rejected the belief of the ancients in man's subjection to the deity and in a predetermined aim toward which nations are led  modern history should study not the manifestations of power but the causes that produce it
but modern history has not done this
having in theory rejected the view held by the ancients  it still follows them in practice
instead of men endowed with divine authority and directly guided by the will of god  modern history has given us either heroes endowed with extraordinary  superhuman capacities  or simply men of very various kinds  from monarchs to journalists  who lead the masses
instead of the former divinely appointed aims of the jewish  greek  or roman nations  which ancient historians regarded as representing the progress of humanity  modern history has postulated its own aims the welfare of the french  german  or english people  or  in its highest abstraction  the welfare and civilization of humanity in general  by which is usually meant that of the peoples occupying a small northwesterly portion of a large continent modern history has rejected the beliefs of the ancients without replacing them by a new conception  and the logic of the situation has obliged the historians  after they had apparently rejected the divine authority of the kings and the  fate  of the ancients  to reach the same conclusion by another road  that is  to recognize  1  nations guided by individual men  and  2  the existence of a known aim to which these nations and humanity at large are tending
at the basis of the works of all the modern historians from gibbon to buckle  despite their seeming disagreements and the apparent novelty of their outlooks  lie those two old  unavoidable assumptions
in the first place the historian describes the activity of individuals who in his opinion have directed humanity  one historian considers only monarchs  generals  and ministers as being such men  while another includes also orators  learned men  reformers  philosophers  and poets 
secondly  it is assumed that the goal toward which humanity is being led is known to the historians  to one of them this goal is the greatness of the roman  spanish  or french realm  to another it is liberty  equality  and a certain kind of civilization of a small corner of the world called europe
in 1789 a ferment arises in paris  it grows  spreads  and is expressed by a movement of peoples from west to east
several times it moves eastward and collides with a countermovement from the east westward
in 1812 it reaches its extreme limit  moscow  and then  with remarkable symmetry  a countermovement occurs from east to west  attracting to it  as the first movement had done  the nations of middle europe
the counter movement reaches the starting point of the first movement in the west paris and subsides
during that twenty year period an immense number of fields were left untilled  houses were burned  trade changed its direction  millions of men migrated  were impoverished  or were enriched  and millions of christian men professing the law of love of their fellows slew one another
what does all this mean  why did it happen  what made those people burn houses and slay their fellow men  what were the causes of these events  what force made men act so  these are the instinctive  plain  and most legitimate questions humanity asks itself when it encounters the monuments and tradition of that period
for a reply to these questions the common sense of mankind turns to the science of history  whose aim is to enable nations and humanity to know themselves if history had retained the conception of the ancients it would have said that god  to reward or punish his people  gave napoleon power and directed his will to the fulfillment of the divine ends  and that reply would have been clear and complete
one might believe or disbelieve in the divine significance of napoleon  but for anyone believing in it there would have been nothing unintelligible in the history of that period  nor would there have been any contradictions
but modern history cannot give that reply
science does not admit the conception of the ancients as to the direct participation of the deity in human affairs  and therefore history ought to give other answers
modern history replying to these questions says  you want to know what this movement means  what caused it  and what force produced these events  then listen   louis xiv was a very proud and self confident man  he had such and such mistresses and such and such ministers and he ruled france badly
his descendants were weak men and they too ruled france badly
and they had such and such favorites and such and such mistresses
moreover  certain men a couple of dozen men in paris who began to talk about all men being free and equal
this caused people all over france to begin to slash at and drown one another
they killed the king and many other people
at that time there was in france a man of genius napoleon
he conquered everybody everywhere  that is  he killed many people because he was a great genius
and for some reason he went to kill africans  and killed them so well and was so cunning and wise that when he returned to france he ordered everybody to obey him  and they all obeyed him
having become an emperor he again went out to kill people in italy  austria  and prussia
and there too he killed a great many
in russia there was an emperor  alexander  who decided to restore order in europe and therefore fought against napoleon
in 1807 he suddenly made friends with him  but in 1811 they again quarreled and again began killing many people
napoleon led six hundred thousand men into russia and captured moscow  then he suddenly ran away from moscow  and the emperor alexander  helped by the advice of stein and others  united europe to arm against the disturber of its peace
all napoleon's allies suddenly became his enemies and their forces advanced against the fresh forces he raised
the allies defeated napoleon  entered paris  forced napoleon to abdicate  and sent him to the island of elba  not depriving him of the title of emperor and showing him every respect  though five years before and one year later they all regarded him as an outlaw and a brigand
then louis xviii  who till then had been the laughingstock both of the french and the allies  began to reign
and napoleon  shedding tears before his old guards  renounced the throne and went into exile
then the skillful statesmen and diplomatists  especially talleyrand  who managed to sit down in a particular chair before anyone else and thereby extended the frontiers of france  talked in vienna and by these conversations made the nations happy or unhappy
suddenly the diplomatists and monarchs nearly quarreled and were on the point of again ordering their armies to kill one another  but just then napoleon arrived in france with a battalion  and the french  who had been hating him  immediately all submitted to him
but the allied monarchs were angry at this and went to fight the french once more
and they defeated the genius napoleon and  suddenly recognizing him as a brigand  sent him to the island of st
helena
and the exile  separated from the beloved france so dear to his heart  died a lingering death on that rock and bequeathed his great deeds to posterity
but in europe a reaction occurred and the sovereigns once again all began to oppress their subjects   it would be a mistake to think that this is ironic a caricature of the historical accounts
on the contrary it is a very mild expression of the contradictory replies  not meeting the questions  which all the historians give  from the compilers of memoirs and the histories of separate states to the writers of general histories and the new histories of the culture of that period
the strangeness and absurdity of these replies arise from the fact that modern history  like a deaf man  answers questions no one has asked
if the purpose of history be to give a description of the movement of humanity and of the peoples  the first question in the absence of a reply to which all the rest will be incomprehensible is  what is the power that moves peoples  to this  modern history laboriously replies either that napoleon was a great genius  or that louis xiv was very proud  or that certain writers wrote certain all that may be so and mankind is ready to agree with it  but it is not what was asked
all that would be interesting if we recognized a divine power based on itself and always consistently directing its nations through napoleons  louises  and writers  but we do not acknowledge such a power  and therefore before speaking about napoleons  louis es  and authors  we ought to be shown the connection existing between these men and the movement of the nations
if instead of a divine power some other force has appeared  it should be explained in what this new force consists  for the whole interest of history lies precisely in that force
history seems to assume that this force is self evident and known to everyone but in spite of every desire to regard it as known  anyone reading many historical works cannot help doubting whether this new force  so variously understood by the historians themselves  is really quite well known to everybody what force moves the nations  biographical historians and historians of separate nations understand this force as a power inherent in heroes and rulers
in their narration events occur solely by the will of a napoleon  and alexander  or in general of the persons they describe
the answers given by this kind of historian to the question of what force causes events to happen are satisfactory only as long as there is but one historian to each event
as soon as historians of different nationalities and tendencies begin to describe the same event  the replies they give immediately lose all meaning  for this force is understood by them all not only differently but often in quite contradictory ways
one historian says that an event was produced by napoleon's power  another that it was produced by alexander's  a third that it was due to the power of some other person
besides this  historians of that kind contradict each other even in their statement as to the force on which the authority of some particular person was based
thiers  a bonapartist  says that napoleon's power was based on his virtue and genius
lanfrey  a republican  says it was based on his trickery and deception of the people
so the historians of this class  by mutually destroying one another's positions  destroy the understanding of the force which produces events  and furnish no reply to history's essential question
writers of universal history who deal with all the nations seem to recognize how erroneous is the specialist historians' view of the force which produces events
they do not recognize it as a power inherent in heroes and rulers  but as the resultant of a multiplicity of variously directed forces
in describing a war or the subjugation of a people  a general historian looks for the cause of the event not in the power of one man  but in the interaction of many persons connected with the event
according to this view the power of historical personages  represented as the product of many forces  can no longer  it would seem  be regarded as a force that itself produces events
yet in most cases universal historians still employ the conception of power as a force that itself produces events  and treat it as their cause
in their exposition  an historic character is first the product of his time  and his power only the resultant of various forces  and then his power is itself a force producing events
gervinus  schlosser  and others  for instance  at one time prove napoleon to be a product of the revolution  of the ideas of 1789 and so forth  and at another plainly say that the campaign of 1812 and other things they do not like were simply the product of napoleon's misdirected will  and that the very ideas of 1789 were arrested in their development by napoleon's caprice
the ideas of the revolution and the general temper of the age produced napoleon's power
but napoleon's power suppressed the ideas of the revolution and the general temper of the age
this curious contradiction is not accidental
not only does it occur at every step  but the universal historians' accounts are all made up of a chain of such contradictions
this contradiction occurs because after entering the field of analysis the universal historians stop halfway
to find component forces equal to the composite or resultant force  the sum of the components must equal the resultant
this condition is never observed by the universal historians  and so to explain the resultant forces they are obliged to admit  in addition to the insufficient components  another unexplained force affecting the resultant action
specialist historians describing the campaign of 1813 or the restoration of the bourbons plainly assert that these events were produced by the will of alexander
but the universal historian gervinus  refuting this opinion of the specialist historian  tries to prove that the campaign of 1813 and the restoration of the bourbons were due to other things beside alexander's will  such as the activity of stein  metternich  madame de stael  talleyrand  fichte  chateaubriand  and others
the historian evidently decomposes alexander's power into the components  talleyrand  chateaubriand  and the rest but the sum of the components  that is  the interactions of chateaubriand  talleyrand  madame de stael  and the others  evidently does not equal the resultant  namely the phenomenon of millions of frenchmen submitting to the bourbons
that chateaubriand  madame de stael  and others spoke certain words to one another only affected their mutual relations but does not account for the submission of millions
and therefore to explain how from these relations of theirs the submission of millions of people resulted that is  how component forces equal to one a gave a resultant equal to a thousand times a  the historian is again obliged to fall back on power the force he had denied and to recognize it as the resultant of the forces  that is  he has to admit an unexplained force acting on the resultant
and that is just what the universal historians do  and consequently they not only contradict the specialist historians but contradict themselves peasants having no clear idea of the cause of rain  say  according to whether they want rain or fine weather   the wind has blown the clouds away   or   the wind has brought up the clouds   and in the same way the universal historians sometimes  when it pleases them and fits in with their theory  say that power is the result of events  and sometimes  when they want to prove something else  say that power produces events
a third class of historians the so called historians of culture following the path laid down by the universal historians who sometimes accept writers and ladies as forces producing events again take that force to be something quite different
they see it in what is called culture in mental activity
the historians of culture are quite consistent in regard to their progenitors  the writers of universal histories  for if historical events may be explained by the fact that certain persons treated one another in such and such ways  why not explain them by the fact that such and such people wrote such and such phenomenon  these historians select the indication of intellectual activity and say that this indication is the cause
but despite their endeavors to prove that the cause of events lies in intellectual activity  only by a great stretch can one admit that there is any connection between intellectual activity and the movement of peoples  and in no case can one admit that intellectual activity controls people's actions  for that view is not confirmed by such facts as the very cruel murders of the french revolution resulting from the doctrine of the equality of man  or the very cruel wars and executions resulting from the preaching of love but even admitting as correct all the cunningly devised arguments with which these histories are filled admitting that nations are governed by some undefined force called an idea history's essential question still remains unanswered  and to the former power of monarchs and to the influence of advisers and other people introduced by the universal historians  another  newer force the idea is added  the connection of which with the masses needs explanation
it is possible to understand that napoleon had power and so events occurred  with some effort one may even conceive that napoleon contrat social  had the effect of making frenchmen begin to drown one another cannot be understood without an explanation of the causal nexus of this new force with the event
undoubtedly some relation exists between all who live contemporaneously  and so it is possible to find some connection between the intellectual activity of men and their historical movements  just as such a connection may be found between the movements of humanity and commerce  handicraft  gardening  or anything else you please
but why intellectual activity is considered by the historians of culture to be the cause or expression of the whole historical movement is hard to understand
only the following considerations can have led the historians to such a conclusion   1  that history is written by learned men  and so it is natural and agreeable for them to think that the activity of their class supplies the basis of the movement of all humanity  just as a similar belief is natural and agreeable to traders  agriculturists  and soldiers  if they do not express it  that is merely because traders and soldiers do not write history   and  2  that spiritual activity  enlightenment  civilization  culture  ideas  are all indistinct  indefinite conceptions under whose banner it is very easy to use words having a still less definite meaning  and which can therefore be readily introduced into any theory
but not to speak of the intrinsic quality of histories of this kind  which may possibly even be of use to someone for something  the histories of culture  to which all general histories tend more and more to approximate  are significant from the fact that after seriously and minutely examining various religious  philosophic  and political doctrines as causes of events  as soon as they have to describe an actual historic event such as the campaign of 1812 for instance  they involuntarily describe it as resulting from an exercise of power and say plainly that that was the result of napoleon's will
speaking so  the historians of culture involuntarily contradict themselves  and show that the new force they have devised does not account for what happens in history  and that history can only be explained by introducing a power which they apparently do not recognize a locomotive is moving
someone asks   what moves it   a peasant says the devil moves it
another man says the locomotive moves because its wheels go round
a third asserts that the cause of its movement lies in the smoke which the wind carries away
the peasant is irrefutable
he has devised a complete explanation
to refute him someone would have to prove to him that there is no devil  or another peasant would have to explain to him that it is not the devil but a german  who moves the locomotive
only then  as a result of the contradiction  will they see that they are both wrong
but the man who says that the movement of the wheels is the cause refutes himself  for having once begun to analyze he ought to go on and explain further why the wheels go round  and till he has reached the ultimate cause of the movement of the locomotive in the pressure of steam in the boiler  he has no right to stop in his search for the cause the man who explains the movement of the locomotive by the smoke that is carried back has noticed that the wheels do not supply an explanation and has taken the first sign that occurs to him and in his turn has offered that as an explanation
the only conception that can explain the movement of the locomotive is that of a force commensurate with the movement observed
the only conception that can explain the movement of the peoples is that of some force commensurate with the whole movement of the peoples
yet to supply this conception various historians take forces of different kinds  all of which are incommensurate with the movement observed
some see it as a force directly inherent in heroes  as the peasant sees the devil in the locomotive  others as a force resulting from several other forces  like the movement of the wheels  others again as an intellectual influence  like the smoke that is blown away
so long as histories are written of separate individuals  whether caesars  alexanders  luthers  or voltaires  and not the histories of all  absolutely all those who take part in an event  it is quite impossible to describe the movement of humanity without the conception of a force compelling men to direct their activity toward a certain end
and the only such conception known to historians is that of power
this conception is the one handle by means of which the material of history  as at present expounded  can be dealt with  and anyone who breaks that handle off  as buckle did  without finding some other method of treating historical material  merely deprives himself of the one possible way of dealing with it the necessity of the conception of power as an explanation of historical events is best demonstrated by the universal historians and historians of culture themselves  for they professedly reject that conception but inevitably have recourse to it at every step in dealing with humanity's inquiry  the science of history up to now is like money in circulation paper money and coin
the biographies and special national histories are like paper money
they can be used and can circulate and fulfill their purpose without harm to anyone and even advantageously  as long as no one asks what is the security behind them
you need only forget to ask how the will of heroes produces events  and such histories as thiers' will be interesting and instructive and may perhaps even possess a tinge of poetry
but just as doubts of the real value of paper money arise either because  being easy to make  too much of it gets made or because people try to exchange it for gold  so also doubts concerning the real value of such histories arise either because too many of them are written or because in his simplicity of heart someone inquires  by what force did napoleon do this  that is  wants to exchange the current paper money for the real gold of actual comprehension
the writers of universal histories and of the history of culture are like people who  recognizing the defects of paper money  decide to substitute for it money made of metal that has not the specific gravity of gold
it may indeed make jingling coin  but will do no more than that
paper money may deceive the ignorant  but nobody is deceived by tokens of base metal that have no value but merely jingle
as gold is gold only if it is serviceable not merely for exchange but also for use  so universal historians will be valuable only when they can reply to history's essential question  what is power  the universal historians give contradictory replies to that question  while the historians of culture evade it and answer something quite different
and as counters of imitation gold can be used only among a group of people who agree to accept them as gold  or among those who do not know the nature of gold  so universal historians and historians of culture  not answering humanity's essential question  serve as currency for some purposes of their own  only in universities and among the mass of readers who have a taste for what they call  serious reading   having abandoned the conception of the ancients as to the divine subjection of the will of a nation to some chosen man and the subjection of that man's will to the deity  history cannot without contradictions take a single step till it has chosen one of two things  either a return to the former belief in the direct intervention of the deity in human affairs or a definite explanation of the meaning of the force producing historical events and termed  power   a return to the first is impossible  the belief has been destroyed  and so it is essential to explain what is meant by power
napoleon ordered an army to be raised and go to war
we are so accustomed to that idea and have become so used to it that the question  why did six hundred thousand men go to fight when napoleon uttered certain words  seems to us senseless he had the power and so what he ordered was done
this reply is quite satisfactory if we believe that the power was given him by god
but as soon as we do not admit that  it becomes essential to determine what is this power of one man over others
it cannot be the direct physical power of a strong man over a weak one a domination based on the application or threat of physical force  like the power of hercules  nor can it be based on the effect of moral force  as in their simplicity some historians think who say that the leading figures in history are heroes  that is  men gifted with a special strength of soul and mind called genius
this power cannot be based on the predominance of moral strength  for  not to mention heroes such as napoleon about whose moral qualities opinions differ widely  history shows us that neither a louis xi nor a metternich  who ruled over millions of people  had any particular moral qualities  but on the contrary were generally morally weaker than any of the millions they ruled over
if the source of power lies neither in the physical nor in the moral qualities of him who possesses it  it must evidently be looked for elsewhere in the relation to the people of the man who wields the power
and that is how power is understood by the science of jurisprudence  that exchange bank of history which offers to exchange history's understanding of power for true gold
power is the collective will of the people transferred  by expressed or tacit consent  to their chosen rulers
in the domain of jurisprudence  which consists of discussions of how a state and power might be arranged were it possible for all that to be arranged  it is all very clear  but when applied to history that definition of power needs explanation
the science of jurisprudence regards the state and power as the ancients regarded fire namely  as something existing absolutely
but for history  the state and power are merely phenomena  just as for modern physics fire is not an element but a phenomenon
from this fundamental difference between the view held by history and that held by jurisprudence  it follows that jurisprudence can tell minutely how in its opinion power should be constituted and what power existing immutably outside time is  but to history's questions about the meaning of the mutations of power in time it can answer nothing
if power be the collective will of the people transferred to their ruler  was pugachev a representative of the will of the people  if not  then why was napoleon i  why was napoleon iii a criminal when he was taken prisoner at boulogne  and why  later on  were those criminals whom he arrested  do palace revolutions in which sometimes only two or three people take part  transfer the will of the people to a new ruler  in international relations  is the will of the people also transferred to their conqueror  was the will of the confederation of the rhine transferred to napoleon in 1806  was the will of the russian people transferred to napoleon in 1809  when our army in alliance with the french went to fight the austrians  to these questions three answers are possible  either to assume  1  that the will of the people is always unconditionally transferred to the ruler or rulers they have chosen  and that therefore every emergence of a new power  every struggle against the power once appointed  should be absolutely regarded as an infringement of the real power  or  2  that the will of the people is transferred to the rulers conditionally  under definite and known conditions  and to show that all limitations  conflicts  and even destructions of power result from a nonobservance by the rulers of the conditions under which their power was entrusted to them  or  3  that the will of the people is delegated to the rulers conditionally  but that the conditions are unknown and indefinite  and that the appearance of several authorities  their struggles and their falls  result solely from the greater or lesser fulfillment by the rulers of these unknown conditions on which the will of the people is transferred from some people to others
and these are the three ways in which the historians do explain the relation of the people to their rulers
some historians those biographical and specialist historians already referred to in their simplicity failing to understand the question of the meaning of power  seem to consider that the collective will of the people is unconditionally transferred to historical persons  and therefore when describing some single state they assume that particular power to be the one absolute and real power  and that any other force opposing this is not a power but a violation of power mere violence
their theory  suitable for primitive and peaceful periods of history  has the inconvenience in application to complex and stormy periods in the life of nations during which various powers arise simultaneously and struggle with one another that a legitimist historian will prove that the national convention  the directory  and bonaparte were mere infringers of the true power  while a republican and a bonapartist will prove  the one that the convention and the other that the empire was the real power  and that all the others were violations of power
evidently the explanations furnished by these historians being mutually contradictory can only satisfy young children
recognizing the falsity of this view of history  another set of historians say that power rests on a conditional delegation of the will of the people to their rulers  and that historical leaders have power only conditionally on carrying out the program that the will of the people has by tacit agreement prescribed to them
but what this program consists in these historians do not say  or if they do they continually contradict one another
each historian  according to his view of what constitutes a nation's progress  looks for these conditions in the greatness  wealth  freedom  or enlightenment of citizens of france or some other country
but not to mention the historians' contradictions as to the nature of this program or even admitting that some one general program of these conditions exists the facts of history almost always contradict that theory
if the conditions under which power is entrusted consist in the wealth  freedom  and enlightenment of the people  how is it that louis xiv and ivan the terrible end their reigns tranquilly  while louis xvi and charles i are executed by their people  to this question historians reply that louis xiv's activity  contrary to the program  reacted on louis xvi
but why did it not react on louis xiv or on louis xv why should it react just on louis xvi  and what is the time limit for such reactions  to these questions there are and can be no answers
equally little does this view explain why for several centuries the collective will is not withdrawn from certain rulers and their heirs  and then suddenly during a period of fifty years is transferred to the convention  to the directory  to napoleon  to alexander  to louis xviii  to napoleon again  to charles x  to louis philippe  to a republican government  and to napoleon iii
when explaining these rapid transfers of the people's will from one individual to another  especially in view of international relations  conquests  and alliances  the historians are obliged to admit that some of these transfers are not normal delegations of the people's will but are accidents dependent on cunning  on mistakes  on craft  or on the weakness of a diplomatist  a ruler  or a party leader
so that the greater part of the events of history civil wars  revolutions  and conquests are presented by these historians not as the results of free transferences of the people's will  but as results of the ill directed will of one or more individuals  that is  once again  as usurpations of power
and so these historians also see and admit historical events which are exceptions to the theory
these historians resemble a botanist who  having noticed that some plants grow from seeds producing two cotyledons  should insist that all that grows does so by sprouting into two leaves  and that the palm  the mushroom  and even the oak  which blossom into full growth and no longer resemble two leaves  are deviations from the theory
historians of the third class assume that the will of the people is transferred to historic personages conditionally  but that the conditions are unknown to us
they say that historical personages have power only because they fulfill the will of the people which has been delegated to them
but in that case  if the force that moves nations lies not in the historic leaders but in the nations themselves  what significance have those leaders  the leaders  these historians tell us  express the will of the people  the activity of the leaders represents the activity of the people but in that case the question arises whether all the activity of the leaders serves as an expression of the people's will or only some part of it
if the whole activity of the leaders serves as the expression of the people's will  as some historians suppose  then all the details of the court scandals contained in the biographies of a napoleon or a catherine serve to express the life of the nation  which is evident nonsense  but if it is only some particular side of the activity of an historical leader which serves to express the people's life  as other so called  philosophical  historians believe  then to determine which side of the activity of a leader expresses the nation's life  we have first of all to know in what the nation's life consists
met by this difficulty historians of that class devise some most obscure  impalpable  and general abstraction which can cover all conceivable occurrences  and declare this abstraction to be the aim of humanity's movement
the most usual generalizations adopted by almost all the historians are  freedom  equality  enlightenment  progress  civilization  and culture
postulating some generalization as the goal of the movement of humanity  the historians study the men of whom the greatest number of monuments have remained  kings  ministers  generals  authors  reformers  popes  and journalists  to the extent to which in their opinion these persons have promoted or hindered that abstraction
but as it is in no way proved that the aim of humanity does consist in freedom  equality  enlightenment  or civilization  and as the connection of the people with the rulers and enlighteners of humanity is only based on the arbitrary assumption that the collective will of the people is always transferred to the men whom we have noticed  it happens that the activity of the millions who migrate  burn houses  abandon agriculture  and destroy one another never is expressed in the account of the activity of some dozen people who did not burn houses  practice agriculture  or slay their fellow creatures
history proves this at every turn
is the ferment of the peoples of the west at the end of the eighteenth century and their drive eastward explained by the activity of louis xiv  xv  and xvi  their mistresses and ministers  and by the lives of napoleon  rousseau  diderot  beaumarchais  and others  is the movement of the russian people eastward to kazan and siberia expressed by details of the morbid character of ivan the terrible and by his correspondence with kurbski  is the movement of the peoples at the time of the crusades explained by the life and activity of the godfreys and the louis es and their ladies  for us that movement of the peoples from west to east  without leaders  with a crowd of vagrants  and with peter the hermit  remains incomprehensible
and yet more incomprehensible is the cessation of that movement when a rational and sacred aim for the crusade the deliverance of jerusalem had been clearly defined by historic leaders
popes  kings  and knights incited the peoples to free the holy land  but the people did not go  for the unknown cause which had previously impelled them to go no longer existed
the history of the godfreys and the minnesingers can evidently not cover the life of the peoples
and the history of the godfreys and the minnesingers has remained the history of godfreys and minnesingers  but the history of the life of the peoples and their impulses has remained unknown
still less does the history of authors and reformers explain to us the life of the peoples
the history of culture explains to us the impulses and conditions of life and thought of a writer or a reformer
we learn that luther had a hot temper and said such and such things  we learn that rousseau was suspicious and wrote peoples massacred one another  nor why during the french revolution they guillotined one another
if we unite both these kinds of history  as is done by the newest historians  we shall have the history of monarchs and writers  but not the history of the life of the peoples
the life of the nations is not contained in the lives of a few men  for the connection between those men and the nations has not been found
the theory that this connection is based on the transference of the collective will of a people to certain historical personages is an hypothesis unconfirmed by the experience of history
the theory of the transference of the collective will of the people to historic persons may perhaps explain much in the domain of jurisprudence and be essential for its purposes  but in its application to history  as soon as revolutions  conquests  or civil wars occur that is  as soon as history begins  that theory explains nothing
the theory seems irrefutable just because the act of transference of the people's will cannot be verified  for it never occurred whatever happens and whoever may stand at the head of affairs  the theory can always say that such and such a person took the lead because the collective will was transferred to him
the replies this theory gives to historical questions are like the replies of a man who  watching the movements of a herd of cattle and paying no attention to the varying quality of the pasturage in different parts of the field  or to the driving of the herdsman  should attribute the direction the herd takes to what animal happens to be at its head
 the herd goes in that direction because the animal in front leads it and the collective will of all the other animals is vested in that leader   this is what historians of the first class say those who assume the unconditional transference of the people's will
 if the animals leading the herd change  this happens because the collective will of all the animals is transferred from one leader to another  according to whether the animal is or is not leading them in the direction selected by the whole herd   such is the reply historians who assume that the collective will of the people is delegated to rulers under conditions which they regard as known
 with this method of observation it often happens that the observer  influenced by the direction he himself prefers  regards those as leaders who  owing to the people's change of direction  are no longer in front  but on one side  or even in the rear    if the animals in front are continually changing and the direction of the whole herd is constantly altered  this is because in order to follow a given direction the animals transfer their will to the animals that have attracted our attention  and to study the movements of the herd we must watch the movements of all the prominent animals moving on all sides of the herd   so say the third class of historians who regard all historical persons  from monarchs to journalists  as the expression of their age the theory of the transference of the will of the people to historic persons is merely a paraphrase a restatement of the question in other words
what causes historical events  power
what is power  power is the collective will of the people transferred to one person
under what condition is the will of the people delegated to one person  on condition that that person expresses the will of the whole people
that is  power is power  in other words  power is a word the meaning of which we do not understand
if the realm of human knowledge were confined to abstract reasoning  then having subjected to criticism the explanation of  power  that juridical science gives us  humanity would conclude that power is merely a word and has no real existence
but to understand phenomena man has  besides abstract reasoning  experience by which he verifies his reflections
and experience tells us that power is not merely a word but an actually existing phenomenon
not to speak of the fact that no description of the collective activity of men can do without the conception of power  the existence of power is proved both by history and by observing contemporary events
whenever an event occurs a man appears or men appear  by whose will the event seems to have taken place napoleon iii issues a decree and the french go to mexico
the king of prussia and bismarck issue decrees and an army enters bohemia
napoleon i issues a decree and an army enters russia
alexander i gives a command and the french submit to the bourbons
experience shows us that whatever event occurs it is always related to the will of one or of several men who have decreed it
the historians  in accord with the old habit of acknowledging divine intervention in human affairs  want to see the cause of events in the expression of the will of someone endowed with power  but that supposition is not confirmed either by reason or by experience
on the one side reflection shows that the expression of a man's will his words are only part of the general activity expressed in an event  as for instance in a war or a revolution  and so without assuming an incomprehensible  supernatural force a miracle one cannot admit that words can be the immediate cause of the movements of millions of men
on the other hand  even if we admitted that words could be the cause of events  history shows that the expression of the will of historical personages does not in most cases produce any effect  that is to say  their commands are often not executed  and sometimes the very opposite of what they order occurs
without admitting divine intervention in the affairs of humanity we cannot regard  power  as the cause of events
power  from the standpoint of experience  is merely the relation that exists between the expression of someone's will and the execution of that will by others
to explain the conditions of that relationship we must first establish a conception of the expression of will  referring it to man and not to the deity
if the deity issues a command  expresses his will  as ancient history tells us  the expression of that will is independent of time and is not caused by anything  for the divinity is not controlled by an event
but speaking of commands that are the expression of the will of men acting in time and in relation to one another  to explain the connection of commands with events we must restore   1  the condition of all that takes place  the continuity of movement in time both of the events and of the person who commands  and  2  the inevitability of the connection between the person commanding and those who execute his command
only the expression of the will of the deity  not dependent on time  can relate to a whole series of events occurring over a period of years or centuries  and only the deity  independent of everything  can by his sole will determine the direction of humanity's movement  but man acts in time and himself takes part in what occurs reinstating the first condition omitted  that of time  we see that no command can be executed without some preceding order having been given rendering the execution of the last command possible
no command ever appears spontaneously  or itself covers a whole series of occurrences  but each command follows from another  and never refers to a whole series of events but always to one moment only of an event
when  for instance  we say that napoleon ordered armies to go to war  we combine in one simultaneous expression a whole series of consecutive commands dependent one on another
napoleon could not have commanded an invasion of russia and never did so
today he ordered such and such papers to be written to vienna  to berlin  and to petersburg  tomorrow such and such decrees and orders to the army  the fleet  the commissariat  and so on and so on millions of commands  which formed a whole series corresponding to a series of events which brought the french armies into russia
if throughout his reign napoleon gave commands concerning an invasion of england and expended on no other undertaking so much time and effort  and yet during his whole reign never once attempted to execute that design but undertook an expedition into russia  with which country he considered it desirable to be in alliance  a conviction he repeatedly expressed  this came about because his commands did not correspond to the course of events in the first case  but did so correspond in the latter
for an order to be certainly executed  it is necessary that a man should order what can be executed
but to know what can and what cannot be executed is impossible  not only in the case of napoleon's invasion of russia in which millions participated  but even in the simplest event  for in either case millions of obstacles may arise to prevent its execution
every order executed is always one of an immense number unexecuted
all the impossible orders inconsistent with the course of events remain unexecuted
only the possible ones get linked up with a consecutive series of commands corresponding to a series of events  and are executed
our false conception that an event is caused by a command which precedes it is due to the fact that when the event has taken place and out of thousands of others those few commands which were consistent with that event have been executed  we forget about the others that were not executed because they could not be
apart from that  the chief source of our error in this matter is due to the fact that in the historical accounts a whole series of innumerable  diverse  and petty events  such for instance as all those which led the french armies to russia  is generalized into one event in accord with the result produced by that series of events  and corresponding with this generalization the whole series of commands is also generalized into a single expression of will
we say that napoleon wished to invade russia and invaded it
in reality in all napoleon's activity we never find anything resembling an expression of that wish  but find a series of orders  or expressions of his will  very variously and indefinitely directed
amid a long series of unexecuted orders of napoleon's one series  for the campaign of 1812  was carried out not because those orders differed in any way from the other  unexecuted orders but because they coincided with the course of events that led the french army into russia  just as in stencil work this or that figure comes out not because the color was laid on from this side or in that way  but because it was laid on from all sides over the figure cut in the stencil
so that examining the relation in time of the commands to the events  we find that a command can never be the cause of the event  but that a certain definite dependence exists between the two
to understand in what this dependence consists it is necessary to reinstate another omitted condition of every command proceeding not from the deity but from a man  which is  that the man who gives the command himself takes part in the event this relation of the commander to those he commands is just what is called power
this relation consists in the following  for common action people always unite in certain combinations  in which regardless of the difference of the aims set for the common action  the relation between those taking part in it is always the same men uniting in these combinations always assume such relations toward one another that the larger number take a more direct share  and the smaller number a less direct share  in the collective action for which they have combined
of all the combinations in which men unite for collective action one of the most striking and definite examples is an army
every army is composed of lower grades of the service the rank and file of whom there are always the greatest number  of the next higher military rank  corporals and noncommissioned officers of whom there are fewer  and of stillhigher officers of whom there are still fewer  and so on to the highest military command which is concentrated in one person
a military organization may be quite correctly compared to a cone  of which the base with the largest diameter consists of the rank and file  the next higher and smaller section of the cone consists of the next higher grades of the army  and so on to the apex  the point of which will represent the commander inchief
the soldiers  of whom there are the most  form the lower section of the cone and its base
the soldier himself does the stabbing  hacking  burning  and pillaging  and always receives orders for these actions from men above him  he himself never gives an order the noncommissioned officers  of whom there are fewer  perform the action itself less frequently than the soldiers  but they already give commands
an officer still less often acts directly himself  but commands still more frequently a general does nothing but command the troops  indicates the objective  and hardly ever uses a weapon himself the commander in chief never takes direct part in the action itself  but only gives general orders concerning the movement of the mass of the troops
a similar relation of people to one another is seen in every combination of men for common activity in agriculture  trade  and every administration
and so without particularly analyzing all the contiguous sections of a cone and of the ranks of an army  or the ranks and positions in any administrative or public business whatever from the lowest to the highest  we see a law by which men  to take associated action  combine in such relations that the more directly they participate in performing the action the less they can command and the more numerous they are  while the less their direct participation in the action itself  the more they command and the fewer of them there are  rising in this way from the lowest ranks to the man at the top  who takes the least direct share in the action and directs his activity chiefly to commanding
this relation of the men who command to those they command is what constitutes the essence of the conception called power
having restored the condition of time under which all events occur  we find that a command is executed only when it is related to a corresponding series of events
restoring the essential condition of relation between those who command and those who execute  we find that by the very nature of the case those who command take the smallest part in the action itself and that their activity is exclusively directed to commanding
when an event is taking place people express their opinions and wishes about it  and as the event results from the collective activity of many people  some one of the opinions or wishes expressed is sure to be fulfilled if but approximately
when one of the opinions expressed is fulfilled  that opinion gets connected with the event as a command preceding it
men are hauling a log
each of them expresses his opinion as to how and where to haul it
they haul the log away  and it happens that this is done as one of them said
he ordered it
there we have command and power in their primary form
the man who worked most with his hands could not think so much about what he was doing  or reflect on or command what would result from the common activity  while the man who commanded more would evidently work less with his hands on account of his greater verbal activity
when some larger concourse of men direct their activity to a common aim there is a yet sharper division of those who  because their activity is given to directing and commanding  take less part in the direct work
when a man works alone he always has a certain set of reflections which as it seems to him directed his past activity  justify his present activity  and guide him in planning his future actions just the same is done by a concourse of people  allowing those who do not take a direct part in the activity to devise considerations  justifications  and surmises concerning their collective activity
for reasons known or unknown to us the french began to drown and kill one another
and corresponding to the event its justification appears in people's belief that this was necessary for the welfare of france  for liberty  and for equality
people ceased to kill one another  and this event was accompanied by its justification in the necessity for a centralization of power  resistance to europe  and so on
men went from the west to the east killing their fellow men  and the event was accompanied by phrases about the glory of france  the baseness of england  and so on
history shows us that these justifications of the events have no common sense and are all contradictory  as in the case of killing a man as the result of recognizing his rights  and the killing of millions in russia for the humiliation of england
but these justifications have a very necessary significance in their own day
these justifications release those who produce the events from moral responsibility
these temporary aims are like the broom fixed in front of a locomotive to clear the snow from the rails in front  they clear men's moral responsibilities from their path without such justification there would be no reply to the simplest question that presents itself when examining each historical event
how is it that millions of men commit collective crimes make war  commit murder  and so on  with the present complex forms of political and social life in europe can any event that is not prescribed  decreed  or ordered by monarchs  ministers  parliaments  or newspapers be imagined  is there any collective action which cannot find its justification in political unity  in patriotism  in the balance of power  or in civilization  so that every event that occurs inevitably coincides with some expressed wish and  receiving a justification  presents itself as the result of the will of one man or of several men in whatever direction a ship moves  the flow of the waves it cuts will always be noticeable ahead of it
to those on board the ship the movement of those waves will be the only perceptible motion
only by watching closely moment by moment the movement of that flow and comparing it with the movement of the ship do we convince ourselves that every bit of it is occasioned by the forward movement of the ship  and that we were led into error by the fact that we ourselves were imperceptibly moving
we see the same if we watch moment by moment the movement of historical characters  that is  re establish the inevitable condition of all that occurs the continuity of movement in time  and do not lose sight of the essential connection of historical persons with the masses
when the ship moves in one direction there is one and the same wave ahead of it  when it turns frequently the wave ahead of it also turns frequently
but wherever it may turn there always will be the wave anticipating its movement
whatever happens it always appears that just that event was foreseen and decreed
wherever the ship may go  the rush of water which neither directs nor increases its movement foams ahead of it  and at a distance seems to us not merely to move of itself but to govern the ship's movement also examining only those expressions of the will of historical persons which  as commands  were related to events  historians have assumed that the events depended on those commands
but examining the events themselves and the connection in which the historical persons stood to the people  we have found that they and their orders were dependent on events the incontestable proof of this deduction is that  however many commands were issued  the event does not take place unless there are other causes for it  but as soon as an event occurs be it what it may then out of all the continually expressed wishes of different people some will always be found which by their meaning and their time of utterance are related as commands to the events
arriving at this conclusion we can reply directly and positively to these two essential questions of history   1  what is power   2  what force produces the movement of the nations   1  power is the relation of a given person to other individuals  in which the more this person expresses opinions  predictions  and justifications of the collective action that is performed  the less is his participation in that action
 2  the movement of nations is caused not by power  nor by intellectual activity  nor even by a combination of the two as historians have supposed  but by the activity of all the people who participate in the events  and who always combine in such a way that those taking the largest direct share in the event take on themselves the least responsibility and vice versa morally the wielder of power appears to cause the event  physically it is those who submit to the power
but as the moral activity is inconceivable without the physical  the cause of the event is neither in the one nor in the other but in the union of the two
or in other words  the conception of a cause is inapplicable to the phenomena we are examining
in the last analysis we reach the circle of infinity that final limit to which in every domain of thought man's reason arrives if it is not playing with the subject
electricity produces heat  heat produces electricity
atoms attract each other and atoms repel one another speaking of the interaction of heat and electricity and of atoms  we cannot say why this occurs  and we say that it is so because it is inconceivable otherwise  because it must be so and that it is a law the same applies to historical events
why war and revolution occur we do not know
we only know that to produce the one or the other action  people combine in a certain formation in which they all take part  and we say that this is so because it is unthinkable otherwise  or in other words that it is a law
if history dealt only with external phenomena  the establishment of this simple and obvious law would suffice and we should have finished our argument
but the law of history relates to man
a particle of matter cannot tell us that it does not feel the law of attraction or repulsion and that that law is untrue  but man  who is the subject of history  says plainly  i am free and am therefore not subject to the law
the presence of the problem of man's free will  though unexpressed  is felt at every step of history
all seriously thinking historians have involuntarily encountered this question
all the contradictions and obscurities of history and the false path historical science has followed are due solely to the lack of a solution of that question
if the will of every man were free  that is  if each man could act as he pleased  all history would be a series of disconnected incidents
if in a thousand years even one man in a million could act freely  that is  as he chose  it is evident that one single free act of that man's in violation of the laws governing human action would destroy the possibility of the existence of any laws for the whole of humanity
if there be a single law governing the actions of men  free will cannot exist  for then man's will is subject to that law
in this contradiction lies the problem of free will  which from most ancient times has occupied the best human minds and from most ancient times has been presented in its whole tremendous significance
the problem is that regarding man as a subject of observation from whatever point of view theological  historical  ethical  or philosophic we find a general law of necessity to which he  like all that exists  is subject
but regarding him from within ourselves as what we are conscious of  we feel ourselves to be free
this consciousness is a source of self cognition quite apart from and independent of reason
through his reason man observes himself  but only through consciousness does he know himself apart from consciousness of self no observation or application of reason is conceivable
to understand  observe  and draw conclusions  man must first of all be conscious of himself as living a man is only conscious of himself as a living being by the fact that he wills  that is  is conscious of his volition but his will  which forms the essence of his life man recognizes  and can but recognize  as free if  observing himself  man sees that his will is always directed by one and the same law  whether he observes the necessity of taking food  using his brain  or anything else  he cannot recognize this never varying direction of his will otherwise than as a limitation of it were it not free it could not be limited
a man's will seems to him to be limited just because he is not conscious of it except as free you say  i am not free
but i have lifted my hand and let it fall
everyone understands that this illogical reply is an irrefutable demonstration of freedom
that reply is the expression of a consciousness that is not subject to reason
if the consciousness of freedom were not a separate and independent source of self consciousness it would be subject to reasoning and to experience  but in fact such subjection does not exist and is inconceivable
a series of experiments and arguments proves to every man that he  as an object of observation  is subject to certain laws  and man submits to them and never resists the laws of gravity or impermeability once he has become acquainted with them
but the same series of experiments and arguments proves to him that the complete freedom of which he is conscious in himself is impossible  and that his every action depends on his organization  his character  and the motives acting upon him  yet man never submits to the deductions of these experiments and arguments having learned from experiment and argument that a stone falls downwards  a man indubitably believes this and always expects the law that he has learned to be fulfilled
but learning just as certainly that his will is subject to laws  he does not and cannot believe this
however often experiment and reasoning may show a man that under the same conditions and with the same character he will do the same thing as before  yet when under the same conditions and with the same character he approaches for the thousandth time the action that always ends in the same way  he feels as certainly convinced as before the experiment that he can act as he pleases
every man  savage or sage  however incontestably reason and experiment may prove to him that it is impossible to imagine two different courses of action in precisely the same conditions  feels that without this irrational conception  which constitutes the essence of freedom  he cannot imagine life
he feels that however impossible it may be  it is so  for without this conception of freedom not only would he be unable to understand life  but he would be unable to live for a single moment
he could not live  because all man's efforts  all his impulses to life  are only efforts to increase freedom
wealth and poverty  fame and obscurity  power and subordination  strength and weakness  health and disease  culture and ignorance  work and leisure  repletion and hunger  virtue and vice  are only greater or lesser degrees of freedom
a man having no freedom cannot be conceived of except as deprived of life
if the conception of freedom appears to reason to be a senseless contradiction like the possibility of performing two actions at one and the same instant of time  or of an effect without a cause  that only proves that consciousness is not subject to reason
this unshakable  irrefutable consciousness of freedom  uncontrolled by experiment or argument  recognized by all thinkers and felt by everyone without exception  this consciousness without which no conception of man is possible constitutes the other side of the question
man is the creation of an all powerful  all good  and all seeing god
what is sin  the conception of which arises from the consciousness of man's freedom  that is a question for theology
the actions of men are subject to general immutable laws expressed in statistics
what is man's responsibility to society  the conception of which results from the conception of freedom  that is a question for jurisprudence
man's actions proceed from his innate character and the motives acting upon him
what is conscience and the perception of right and wrong in actions that follows from the consciousness of freedom  that is a question for ethics
man in connection with the general life of humanity appears subject to laws which determine that life
but the same man apart from that connection appears to be free
how should the past life of nations and of humanity be regarded as the result of the free  or as the result of the constrained  activity of man  that is a question for history
only in our self confident day of the popularization of knowledge thanks to that most powerful engine of ignorance  the diffusion of printed matter has the question of the freedom of will been put on a level on which the question itself cannot exist
in our time the majority of so called advanced people that is  the crowd of ignoramuses have taken the work of the naturalists who deal with one side of the question for a solution of the whole problem
they say and write and print that the soul and freedom do not exist  for the life of man is expressed by muscular movements and muscular movements are conditioned by the activity of the nerves  the soul and free will do not exist because at an unknown period of time we sprang from the apes
they say this  not at all suspecting that thousands of years ago that same law of necessity which with such ardor they are now trying to prove by physiology and comparative zoology was not merely acknowledged by all the religions and all the thinkers  but has never been denied
they do not see that the role of the natural sciences in this matter is merely to serve as an instrument for the illumination of one side of it
for the fact that  from the point of view of observation  reason and the will are merely secretions of the brain  and that man following the general law may have developed from lower animals at some unknown period of time  only explains from a fresh side the truth admitted thousands of years ago by all the religious and philosophic theories  that from the point of view of reason man is subject to the law of necessity  but it does not advance by a hair's breadth the solution of the question  which has another  opposite  side  based on the consciousness of freedom
if men descended from the apes at an unknown period of time  that is as comprehensible as that they were made from a handful of earth at a certain period of time  in the first case the unknown quantity is the time  in the second case it is the origin   and the question of how man's consciousness of freedom is to be reconciled with the law of necessity to which he is subject cannot be solved by comparative physiology and zoology  for in a frog  a rabbit  or an ape  we can observe only the muscular nervous activity  but in man we observe consciousness as well as the muscular and nervous activity
the naturalists and their followers  thinking they can solve this question  are like plasterers set to plaster one side of the walls of a church who  availing themselves of the absence of the chief superintendent of the work  should in an access of zeal plaster over the windows  icons  woodwork  and still unbuttressed walls  and should be delighted that from their point of view as plasterers  everything is now so smooth and regular for the solution of the question of free will or inevitability  history has this advantage over other branches of knowledge in which the question is dealt with  that for history this question does not refer to the essence of man's free will but its manifestation in the past and under certain conditions
in regard to this question  history stands to the other sciences as experimental science stands to abstract science
the subject for history is not man's will itself but our presentation of it
and so for history  the insoluble mystery presented by the incompatibility of free will and inevitability does not exist as it does for theology  ethics  and philosophy
history surveys a presentation of man's life in which the union of these two contradictions has already taken place
in actual life each historic event  each human action  is very clearly and definitely understood without any sense of contradiction  although each event presents itself as partly free and partly compulsory
to solve the question of how freedom and necessity are combined and what constitutes the essence of these two conceptions  the philosophy of history can and should follow a path contrary to that taken by other sciences
instead of first defining the conceptions of freedom and inevitability in themselves  and then ranging the phenomena of life under those definitions  history should deduce a definition of the conception of freedom and inevitability themselves from the immense quantity of phenomena of which it is cognizant and that always appear dependent on these two elements whatever presentation of the activity of many men or of an individual we may consider  we always regard it as the result partly of man's free will and partly of the law of inevitability
whether we speak of the migration of the peoples and the incursions of the barbarians  or of the decrees of napoleon iii  or of someone's action an hour ago in choosing one direction out of several for his walk  we are unconscious of any contradiction
the degree of freedom and inevitability governing the actions of these people is clearly defined for us
our conception of the degree of freedom often varies according to differences in the point of view from which we regard the event  but every human action appears to us as a certain combination of freedom and inevitability
in every action we examine we see a certain measure of freedom and a certain measure of inevitability
and always the more freedom we see in any action the less inevitability do we perceive  and the more inevitability the less freedom
the proportion of freedom to inevitability decreases and increases according to the point of view from which the action is regarded  but their relation is always one of inverse proportion
a sinking man who clutches at another and drowns him  or a hungry mother exhausted by feeding her baby  who steals some food  or a man trained to discipline who on duty at the word of command kills a defenseless man  seem less guilty  that is  less free and more subject to the law of necessity  to one who knows the circumstances in which these people were placed  and more free to one who does not know that the man was himself drowning  that the mother was hungry  that the soldier was in the ranks  and so on similarly a man who committed a murder twenty years ago and has since lived peaceably and harmlessly in society seems less guilty and his action more due to the law of inevitability  to someone who considers his action after twenty years have elapsed than to one who examined it the day after it was committed and in the same way every action of an insane  intoxicated  or highly excited man appears less free and more inevitable to one who knows the mental condition of him who committed the action  and seems more free and less inevitable to one who does not know it in all these cases the conception of freedom is increased or diminished and the conception of compulsion is correspondingly decreased or increased  according to the point of view from which the action is regarded
so that the greater the conception of necessity the smaller the conception of freedom and vice versa
religion  the common sense of mankind  the science of jurisprudence  and history itself understand alike this relation between necessity and freedom
all cases without exception in which our conception of freedom and necessity is increased and diminished depend on three considerations   1  the relation to the external world of the man who commits the deeds
 2  his relation to time
 3  his relation to the causes leading to the action
the first consideration is the clearness of our perception of the man's relation to the external world and the greater or lesser clearness of our understanding of the definite position occupied by the man in relation to everything coexisting with him
this is what makes it evident that a drowning man is less free and more subject to necessity than one standing on dry ground  and that makes the actions of a man closely connected with others in a thickly populated district  or of one bound by family  official  or business duties  seem certainly less free and more subject to necessity than those of a man living in solitude and seclusion
if we consider a man alone  apart from his relation to everything around him  each action of his seems to us free but if we see his relation to anything around him  if we see his connection with anything whatever with a man with the air he breathes or the light that falls on the things about him we see that each of these circumstances has an influence on him and controls at least some side of his activity and the more we perceive of these influences the more our conception of his freedom diminishes and the more our conception of the necessity that weighs on him increases
the second consideration is the more or less evident time relation of the man to the world and the clearness of our perception of the place the man's action occupies in time
that is the ground which makes the fall of the first man  resulting in the production of the human race  appear evidently less free than a man's entry into marriage today
it is the reason why the life and activity of people who lived centuries ago and are connected with me in time cannot seem to me as free as the life of a contemporary  the consequences of which are still unknown to me
the degree of our conception of freedom or inevitability depends in this respect on the greater or lesser lapse of time between the performance of the action and our judgment of it
if i examine an act i performed a moment ago in approximately the same circumstances as those i am in now  my action appears to me undoubtedly free but if i examine an act performed a month ago  then being in different circumstances  i cannot help recognizing that if that act had not been committed much that resulted from it good  agreeable  and even essential  would not have taken place if i reflect on an action still more remote  ten years ago or more  then the consequences of my action are still plainer to me and i find it hard to imagine what would have happened had that action not been performed
the farther i go back in memory  or what is the same thing the farther i go forward in my judgment  the more doubtful becomes my belief in the freedom of my action
in history we find a very similar progress of conviction concerning the part played by free will in the general affairs of humanity
a contemporary event seems to us to be indubitably the doing of all the known participants  but with a more remote event we already see its inevitable results which prevent our considering anything else possible and the farther we go back in examining events the less arbitrary do they appear
the austro prussian war appears to us undoubtedly the result of the crafty conduct of bismarck  and so on
the napoleonic wars still seem to us  though already questionably  to be the outcome of their heroes' will
but in the crusades we already see an event occupying its definite place in history and without which we cannot imagine the modern history of europe  though to the chroniclers of the crusades that event appeared as merely due to the will of certain people
in regard to the migration of the peoples it does not enter anyone's head today to suppose that the renovation of the european world depended on attila's caprice
the farther back in history the object of our observation lies  the more doubtful does the free will of those concerned in the event become and the more manifest the law of inevitability
the third consideration is the degree to which we apprehend that endless chain of causation inevitably demanded by reason  in which each phenomenon comprehended  and therefore man's every action  must have its definite place as a result of what has gone before and as a cause of what will follow
the better we are acquainted with the physiological  psychological  and historical laws deduced by observation and by which man is controlled  and the more correctly we perceive the physiological  psychological  and historical causes of the action  and the simpler the action we are observing and the less complex the character and mind of the man in question  the more subject to inevitability and the less free do our actions and those of others appear
when we do not at all understand the cause of an action  whether a crime  a good action  or even one that is simply nonmoral  we ascribe a greater amount of freedom to it
in the case of a crime we most urgently demand the punishment for such an act  in the case of a virtuous act we rate its merit most highly
in an indifferent case we recognize in it more individuality  originality  and independence
but if even one of the innumerable causes of the act is known to us we recognize a certain element of necessity and are less insistent on punishment for the crime  or the acknowledgment of the merit of the virtuous act  or the freedom of the apparently original action
that a criminal was reared among male factors mitigates his fault in our eyes
the selfsacrifice of a father or mother  or self sacrifice with the possibility of a reward  is more comprehensible than gratuitous self sacrifice  and therefore seems less deserving of sympathy and less the result of free will the founder of a sect or party  or an inventor  impresses us less when we know how or by what the way was prepared for his activity
if we have a large range of examples  if our observation is constantly directed to seeking the correlation of cause and effect in people's actions  their actions appear to us more under compulsion and less free the more correctly we connect the effects with the causes
if we examined simple actions and had a vast number of such actions under observation  our conception of their inevitability would be still greater
the dishonest conduct of the son of a dishonest father  the misconduct of a woman who had fallen into bad company  a drunkard's relapse into drunkenness  and so on are actions that seem to us less free the better we understand their cause
if the man whose actions we are considering is on a very low stage of mental development  like a child  a madman  or a simpleton then  knowing the causes of the act and the simplicity of the character and intelligence in question  we see so large an element of necessity and so little free will that as soon as we know the cause prompting the action we can foretell the result
on these three considerations alone is based the conception of irresponsibility for crimes and the extenuating circumstances admitted by all legislative codes the responsibility appears greater or less according to our greater or lesser knowledge of the circumstances in which the man was placed whose action is being judged  and according to the greater or lesser interval of time between the commission of the action and its investigation  and according to the greater or lesser understanding of the causes that led to the action thus our conception of free will and inevitability gradually diminishes or increases according to the greater or lesser connection with the external world  the greater or lesser remoteness of time  and the greater or lesser dependence on the causes in relation to which we contemplate a man's life
so that if we examine the case of a man whose connection with the external world is well known  where the time between the action and its examination is great  and where the causes of the action are most accessible  we get the conception of a maximum of inevitability and a minimum of free will
if we examine a man little dependent on external conditions  whose action was performed very recently  and the causes of whose action are beyond our ken  we get the conception of a minimum of inevitability and a maximum of freedom
in neither case however we may change our point of view  however plain we may make to ourselves the connection between the man and the external world  however inaccessible it may be to us  however long or short the period of time  however intelligible or incomprehensible the causes of the action may be can we ever conceive either complete freedom or complete necessity
 1  to whatever degree we may imagine a man to be exempt from the influence of the external world  we never get a conception of freedom in space
every human action is inevitably conditioned by what surrounds him and by his own body
i lift my arm and let it fall
my action seems to me free  but asking myself whether i could raise my arm in every direction  i see that i raised it in the direction in which there was least obstruction to that action either from things around me or from the construction of my own body i chose one out of all the possible directions because in it there were fewest obstacles
for my action to be free it was necessary that it should encounter no obstacles
to conceive of a man being free we must imagine him outside space  which is evidently impossible
 2  however much we approximate the time of judgment to the time of the deed  we never get a conception of freedom in time
for if i examine an action committed a second ago i must still recognize it as not being free  for it is irrevocably linked to the moment at which it was committed
can i lift my arm  i lift it  but ask myself  could i have abstained from lifting my arm at the moment that has already passed  to convince myself of this i do not lift it the next moment
but i am not now abstaining from doing so at the first moment when i asked the question
time has gone by which i could not detain  the arm i then lifted is no longer the same as the arm i now refrain from lifting  nor is the air in which i lifted it the same that now surrounds me
the moment in which the first movement was made is irrevocable  and at that moment i could make only one movement  and whatever movement i made would be the only one
that i did not lift my arm a moment later does not prove that i could have abstained from lifting it then
and since i could make only one movement at that single moment of time  it could not have been any other
to imagine it as free  it is necessary to imagine it in the present  on the boundary between the past and the future that is  outside time  which is impossible
 3  however much the difficulty of understanding the causes may be increased  we never reach a conception of complete freedom  that is  an absence of cause
however inaccessible to us may be the cause of the expression of will in any action  our own or another's  the first demand of reason is the assumption of and search for a cause  for without a cause no phenomenon is conceivable
i raise my arm to perform an action independently of any cause  but my wish to perform an action without a cause is the cause of my action
but even if imagining a man quite exempt from all influences  examining only his momentary action in the present  unevoked by any cause we were to admit so infinitely small a remainder of inevitability as equaled zero  we should even then not have arrived at the conception of complete freedom in man  for a being uninfluenced by the external world  standing outside of time and independent of cause  is no longer a man
in the same way we can never imagine the action of a man quite devoid of freedom and entirely subject to the law of inevitability
 1  however we may increase our knowledge of the conditions of space in which man is situated  that knowledge can never be complete  for the number of those conditions is as infinite as the infinity of space
and therefore so long as not all the conditions influencing men are defined  there is no complete inevitability but a certain measure of freedom remains
 2  however we may prolong the period of time between the action we are examining and the judgment upon it  that period will be finite  while time is infinite  and so in this respect too there can never be absolute inevitability
 3  however accessible may be the chain of causation of any action  we shall never know the whole chain since it is endless  and so again we never reach absolute inevitability
but besides this  even if  admitting the remaining minimum of freedom to equal zero  we assumed in some given case as for instance in that of a dying man  an unborn babe  or an idiot complete absence of freedom  by so doing we should destroy the very conception of man in the case we are examining  for as soon as there is no freedom there is also no man
and so the conception of the action of a man subject solely to the law of inevitability without any element of freedom is just as impossible as the conception of a man's completely free action
and so to imagine the action of a man entirely subject to the law of inevitability without any freedom  we must assume the knowledge of an infinite number of space relations  an infinitely long period of time  and an infinite series of causes
to imagine a man perfectly free and not subject to the law of inevitability  we must imagine him all alone  beyond space  beyond time  and free from dependence on cause
in the first case  if inevitability were possible without freedom we should have reached a definition of inevitability by the laws of inevitability itself  that is  a mere form without content
in the second case  if freedom were possible without inevitability we should have arrived at unconditioned freedom beyond space  time  and cause  which by the fact of its being unconditioned and unlimited would be nothing  or mere content without form
we should in fact have reached those two fundamentals of which man's whole outlook on the universe is constructed the incomprehensible essence of life  and the laws defining that essence
reason says   1  space with all the forms of matter that give it visibility is infinite  and cannot be imagined otherwise  2  time is infinite motion without a moment of rest and is unthinkable otherwise
 3  the connection between cause and effect has no beginning and can have no end
consciousness says   1  i alone am  and all that exists is but me  consequently i include space
 2  i measure flowing time by the fixed moment of the present in which alone i am conscious of myself as living  consequently i am outside time
 3  i am beyond cause  for i feel myself to be the cause of every manifestation of my life
reason gives expression to the laws of inevitability
consciousness gives expression to the essence of freedom
freedom not limited by anything is the essence of life  in man's consciousness
inevitability without content is man's reason in its three forms freedom is the thing examined
inevitability is what examines
freedom is the content
inevitability is the form
only by separating the two sources of cognition  related to one another as form to content  do we get the mutually exclusive and separately incomprehensible conceptions of freedom and inevitability
only by uniting them do we get a clear conception of man's life
apart from these two concepts which in their union mutually define one another as form and content  no conception of life is possible
all that we know of the life of man is merely a certain relation of free will to inevitability  that is  of consciousness to the laws of reason
all that we know of the external world of nature is only a certain relation of the forces of nature to inevitability  or of the essence of life to the laws of reason
the great natural forces lie outside us and we are not conscious of them  we call those forces gravitation  inertia  electricity  animal force  and so on  but we are conscious of the force of life in man and we call that freedom
but just as the force of gravitation  incomprehensible in itself but felt by every man  is understood by us only to the extent to which we know the laws of inevitability to which it is subject  from the first knowledge that all bodies have weight  up to newton's law   so too the force of free will  incomprehensible in itself but of which everyone is conscious  is intelligible to us only in as far as we know the laws of inevitability to which it is subject  from the fact that every man dies  up to the knowledge of the most complex economic and historic laws 
all knowledge is merely a bringing of this essence of life under the laws of reason
man's free will differs from every other force in that man is directly conscious of it  but in the eyes of reason it in no way differs from any other force
the forces of gravitation  electricity  or chemical affinity are only distinguished from one another in that they are differently defined by reason
just so the force of man's free will is distinguished by reason from the other forces of nature only by the definition reason gives it
freedom  apart from necessity  that is  apart from the laws of reason that define it  differs in no way from gravitation  or heat  or the force that makes things grow  for reason  it is only a momentary undefinable sensation of life
and as the undefinable essence of the force moving the heavenly bodies  the undefinable essence of the forces of heat and electricity  or of chemical affinity  or of the vital force  forms the content of astronomy  physics  chemistry  botany  zoology  and so on  just in the same way does the force of free will form the content of history but just as the subject of every science is the manifestation of this unknown essence of life while that essence itself can only be the subject of metaphysics  even the manifestation of the force of free will in human beings in space  in time  and in dependence on cause forms the subject of history  while free will itself is the subject of metaphysics in the experimental sciences what we know we call the laws of inevitability  what is unknown to us we call vital force
vital force is only an expression for the unknown remainder over and above what we know of the essence of life
so also in history what is known to us we call laws of inevitability  what is unknown we call free will
free will is for history only an expression for the unknown remainder of what we know about the laws of human life
history examines the manifestations of man's free will in connection with the external world in time and in dependence on cause  that is  it defines this freedom by the laws of reason  and so history is a science only in so far as this free will is defined by those laws
the recognition of man's free will as something capable of influencing historical events  that is  as not subject to laws  is the same for history as the recognition of a free force moving the heavenly bodies would be for astronomy
that assumption would destroy the possibility of the existence of laws  that is  of any science whatever
if there is even a single body moving freely  then the laws of kepler and newton are negatived and no conception of the movement of the heavenly bodies any longer exists
if any single action is due to free will  then not a single historical law can exist  nor any conception of historical events
for history  lines exist of the movement of human wills  one end of which is hidden in the unknown but at the other end of which a consciousness of man's will in the present moves in space  time  and dependence on cause
the more this field of motion spreads out before our eyes  the more evident are the laws of that movement
to discover and define those laws is the problem of history
from the standpoint from which the science of history now regards its subject on the path it now follows  seeking the causes of events in man's freewill  a scientific enunciation of those laws is impossible  for however man's free will may be restricted  as soon as we recognize it as a force not subject to law  the existence of law becomes impossible
only by reducing this element of free will to the infinitesimal  that is  by regarding it as an infinitely small quantity  can we convince ourselves of the absolute inaccessibility of the causes  and then instead of seeking causes  history will take the discovery of laws as its problem
the search for these laws has long been begun and the new methods of thought which history must adopt are being worked out simultaneously with the self destruction toward which ever dissecting and dissecting the causes of phenomena the old method of history is moving
all human sciences have traveled along that path
arriving at infinitesimals  mathematics  the most exact of sciences  abandons the process of analysis and enters on the new process of the integration of unknown  infinitely small  quantities
abandoning the conception of cause  mathematics seeks law  that is  the property common to all unknown  infinitely small  elements
in another form but along the same path of reflection the other sciences have proceeded
when newton enunciated the law of gravity he did not say that the sun or the earth had a property of attraction  he said that all bodies from the largest to the smallest have the property of attracting one another  that is  leaving aside the question of the cause of the movement of the bodies  he expressed the property common to all bodies from the infinitely large to the infinitely small
the same is done by the natural sciences  leaving aside the question of cause  they seek for laws
history stands on the same path
and if history has for its object the study of the movement of the nations and of humanity and not the narration of episodes in the lives of individuals  it too  setting aside the conception of cause  should seek the laws common to all the inseparably interconnected infinitesimal elements of free will
from the time the law of copernicus was discovered and proved  the mere recognition of the fact that it was not the sun but the earth that moves sufficed to destroy the whole cosmography of the ancients
by disproving that law it might have been possible to retain the old conception of the movements of the bodies  but without disproving it  it would seem impossible to continue studying the ptolemaic worlds
but even after the discovery of the law of copernicus the ptolemaic worlds were still studied for a long time
from the time the first person said and proved that the number of births or of crimes is subject to mathematical laws  and that this or that mode of government is determined by certain geographical and economic conditions  and that certain relations of population to soil produce migrations of peoples  the foundations on which history had been built were destroyed in their essence
by refuting these new laws the former view of history might have been retained  but without refuting them it would seem impossible to continue studying historic events as the results of man's free will
for if a certain mode of government was established or certain migrations of peoples took place in consequence of such and such geographic  ethnographic  or economic conditions  then the free will of those individuals who appear to us to have established that mode of government or occasioned the migrations can no longer be regarded as the cause
and yet the former history continues to be studied side by side with the laws of statistics  geography  political economy  comparative philology  and geology  which directly contradict its assumptions
the struggle between the old views and the new was long and stubbornly fought out in physical philosophy
theology stood on guard for the old views and accused the new of violating revelation
but when truth conquered  theology established itself just as firmly on the new foundation
just as prolonged and stubborn is the struggle now proceeding between the old and the new conception of history  and theology in the same way stands on guard for the old view  and accuses the new view of subverting revelation
in the one case as in the other  on both sides the struggle provokes passion and stifles truth
on the one hand there is fear and regret for the loss of the whole edifice constructed through the ages  on the other is the passion for destruction
to the men who fought against the rising truths of physical philosophy  it seemed that if they admitted that truth it would destroy faith in god  in the creation of the firmament  and in the miracle of joshua the son of nun
to the defenders of the laws of copernicus and newton  to voltaire for example  it seemed that the laws of astronomy destroyed religion  and he utilized the law of gravitation as a weapon against religion
just so it now seems as if we have only to admit the law of inevitability  to destroy the conception of the soul  of good and evil  and all the institutions of state and church that have been built up on those conceptions so too  like voltaire in his time  uninvited defenders of the law of inevitability today use that law as a weapon against religion  though the law of inevitability in history  like the law of copernicus in astronomy  far from destroying  even strengthens the foundation on which the institutions of state and church are erected
as in the question of astronomy then  so in the question of history now  the whole difference of opinion is based on the recognition or nonrecognition of something absolute  serving as the measure of visible phenomena
in astronomy it was the immovability of the earth  in history it is the independence of personality free will
as with astronomy the difficulty of recognizing the motion of the earth lay in abandoning the immediate sensation of the earth's fixity and of the motion of the planets  so in history the difficulty of recognizing the subjection of personality to the laws of space  time  and cause lies in renouncing the direct feeling of the independence of one's own personality
but as in astronomy the new view said   it is true that we do not feel the movement of the earth  but by admitting its immobility we arrive at absurdity  while by admitting its motion  which we do not feel  we arrive at laws   so also in history the new view says   it is true that we are not conscious of our dependence  but by admitting our free will we arrive at absurdity  while by admitting our dependence on the external world  on time  and on cause  we arrive at laws   in the first case it was necessary to renounce the consciousness of an unreal immobility in space and to recognize a motion we did not feel  in the present case it is similarly necessary to renounce a freedom that does not exist  and to recognize a dependence of which we are not conscious
