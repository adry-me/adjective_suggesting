absolute continuity of motion is not comprehensible to the human mind
laws of motion of any kind become comprehensible to man only when he examines arbitrarily selected elements of that motion  but at the same time  a large proportion of human error comes from the arbitrary division of continuous motion into discontinuous elements
there is a well known  so called sophism of the ancients consisting in this  that achilles could never catch up with a tortoise he was following  in spite of the fact that he traveled ten times as fast as the tortoise
by the time achilles has covered the distance that separated him from the tortoise  the tortoise has covered one tenth of that distance ahead of him  when achilles has covered that tenth  the tortoise has covered another one hundredth  and so on forever
this problem seemed to the ancients insoluble
the absurd answer  that achilles could never overtake the tortoise  resulted from this  that motion was arbitrarily divided into discontinuous elements  whereas the motion both of achilles and of the tortoise was continuous
by adopting smaller and smaller elements of motion we only approach a solution of the problem  but never reach it
only when we have admitted the conception of the infinitely small  and the resulting geometrical progression with a common ratio of one tenth  and have found the sum of this progression to infinity  do we reach a solution of the problem
a modern branch of mathematics having achieved the art of dealing with the infinitely small can now yield solutions in other more complex problems of motion which used to appear insoluble this modern branch of mathematics  unknown to the ancients  when dealing with problems of motion admits the conception of the infinitely small  and so conforms to the chief condition of motion  absolute continuity  and thereby corrects the inevitable error which the human mind cannot avoid when it deals with separate elements of motion instead of examining continuous motion in seeking the laws of historical movement just the same thing happens
the movement of humanity  arising as it does from innumerable arbitrary human wills  is continuous
to understand the laws of this continuous movement is the aim of history
but to arrive at these laws  resulting from the sum of all those human wills  man's mind postulates arbitrary and disconnected units
the first method of history is to take an arbitrarily selected series of continuous events and examine it apart from others  though there is and can be no beginning to any event  for one event always flows uninterruptedly from another
the second method is to consider the actions of some one man a king or a commander as equivalent to the sum of many individual wills  whereas the sum of individual wills is never expressed by the activity of a single historic personage
historical science in its endeavor to draw nearer to truth continually takes smaller and smaller units for examination
but however small the units it takes  we feel that to take any unit disconnected from others  or to assume a beginning of any phenomenon  or to say that the will of many men is expressed by the actions of any one historic personage  is in itself false
it needs no critical exertion to reduce utterly to dust any deductions drawn from history
it is merely necessary to select some larger or smaller unit as the subject of observation as criticism has every right to do  seeing that whatever unit history observes must always be arbitrarily selected
only by taking infinitesimally small units for observation  the differential of history  that is  the individual tendencies of men  and attaining to the art of integrating them  that is  finding the sum of these infinitesimals  can we hope to arrive at the laws of history
the first fifteen years of the nineteenth century in europe present an extraordinary movement of millions of people
men leave their customary pursuits  hasten from one side of europe to the other  plunder and slaughter one another  triumph and are plunged in despair  and for some years the whole course of life is altered and presents an intensive movement which first increases and then slackens
what was the cause of this movement  by what laws was it governed  asks the mind of man
the historians  replying to this question  lay before us the sayings and doings of a few dozen men in a building in the city of paris  calling these sayings and doings  the revolution   then they give a detailed biography of napoleon and of certain people favorable or hostile to him  tell of the influence some of these people had on others  and say  that is why this movement took place and those are its laws
but the mind of man not only refuses to believe this explanation  but plainly says that this method of explanation is fallacious  because in it a weaker phenomenon is taken as the cause of a stronger
the sum of human wills produced the revolution and napoleon  and only the sum of those wills first tolerated and then destroyed them
 but every time there have been conquests there have been conquerors  every time there has been a revolution in any state there have been great men   says history
and  indeed  human reason replies  every time conquerors appear there have been wars  but this does not prove that the conquerors caused the wars and that it is possible to find the laws of a war in the personal activity of a single man
whenever i look at my watch and its hands point to ten  i hear the bells of the neighboring church  but because the bells begin to ring when the hands of the clock reach ten  i have no right to assume that the movement of the bells is caused by the position of the hands of the watch
whenever i see the movement of a locomotive i hear the whistle and see the valves opening and wheels turning  but i have no right to conclude that the whistling and the turning of wheels are the cause of the movement of the engine
the peasants say that a cold wind blows in late spring because the oaks are budding  and really every spring cold winds do blow when the oak is budding
but though i do not know what causes the cold winds to blow when the oak buds unfold  i cannot agree with the peasants that the unfolding of the oak buds is the cause of the cold wind  for the force of the wind is beyond the influence of the buds
i see only a coincidence of occurrences such as happens with all the phenomena of life  and i see that however much and however carefully i observe the hands of the watch  and the valves and wheels of the engine  and the oak  i shall not discover the cause of the bells ringing  the engine moving  or of the winds of spring
to that i must entirely change my point of view and study the laws of the movement of steam  of the bells  and of the wind
history must do the same
and attempts in this direction have already been made
to study the laws of history we must completely change the subject of our observation  must leave aside kings  ministers  and generals  and study the common  infinitesimally small elements by which the masses are moved
no one can say in how far it is possible for man to advance in this way toward an understanding of the laws of history  but it is evident that only along that path does the possibility of discovering the laws of history lie  and that as yet not a millionth part as much mental effort has been applied in this direction by historians as has been devoted to describing the actions of various kings  commanders  and ministers and propounding the historians' own reflections concerning these actions
the forces of a dozen european nations burst into russia
the russian army and people avoided a collision till smolensk was reached  and again from smolensk to borodino
the french army pushed on to moscow  its goal  its impetus ever increasing as it neared its aim  just as the velocity of a falling body increases as it approaches the earth
behind it were seven hundred miles of hunger stricken  hostile country  ahead were a few dozen miles separating it from its goal
every soldier in napoleon's army felt this and the invasion moved on by its own momentum
the more the russian army retreated the more fiercely a spirit of hatred of the enemy flared up  and while it retreated the army increased and consolidated
at borodino a collision took place
neither army was broken up  but the russian army retreated immediately after the collision as inevitably as a ball recoils after colliding with another having a greater momentum  and with equal inevitability the ball of invasion that had advanced with such momentum rolled on for some distance  though the collision had deprived it of all its force
the russians retreated eighty miles to beyond moscow and the french reached moscow and there came to a standstill
for five weeks after that there was not a single battle
the french did not move
as a bleeding  mortally wounded animal licks its wounds  they remained inert in moscow for five weeks  and then suddenly  with no fresh reason  fled back  they made a dash for the kaluga road  and  after a victory for at malo yaroslavets the field of conflict again remained theirs  without undertaking a single serious battle  they fled still more rapidly back to smolensk  beyond smolensk  beyond the berezina  beyond vilna  and farther still
on the evening of the twenty sixth of august  kutuzov and the whole russian army were convinced that the battle of borodino was a victory
kutuzov reported so to the emperor
he gave orders to prepare for a fresh conflict to finish the enemy and did this not to deceive anyone  but because he knew that the enemy was beaten  as everyone who had taken part in the battle knew it
but all that evening and next day reports came in one after another of unheardof losses  of the loss of half the army  and a fresh battle proved physically impossible
it was impossible to give battle before information had been collected  the wounded gathered in  the supplies of ammunition replenished  the slain reckoned up  new officers appointed to replace those who had been killed  and before the men had had food and sleep
and meanwhile  the very next morning after the battle  the french army advanced of itself upon the russians  carried forward by the force of its own momentum now seemingly increased in inverse proportion to the square of the distance from its aim
kutuzov's wish was to attack next day  and the whole army desired to do so
but to make an attack the wish to do so is not sufficient  there must also be a possibility of doing it  and that possibility did not exist
it was impossible not to retreat a day's march  and then in the same way it was impossible not to retreat another and a third day's march  and at last  on the first of september when the army drew near moscow despite the strength of the feeling that had arisen in all ranks the force of circumstances compelled it to retire beyond moscow and the troops retired one more  last  day's march  and abandoned moscow to the enemy
for people accustomed to think that plans of campaign and battles are made by generals as any one of us sitting over a map in his study may imagine how he would have arranged things in this or that battle the questions present themselves  why did kutuzov during the retreat not do this or that  why did he not take up a position before reaching fili  why did he not retire at once by the kaluga road  abandoning moscow  and so on people accustomed to think in that way forget  or do not know  the inevitable conditions which always limit the activities of any commander in chief
the activity of a commander in chief does not at all resemble the activity we imagine to ourselves when we sit at ease in our studies examining some campaign on the map  with a certain number of troops on this and that side in a certain known locality  and begin our plans from some given moment
a commander in chief is never dealing with the beginning of any event the position from which we always contemplate it
the commander in chief is always in the midst of a series of shifting events and so he never can at any moment consider the whole import of an event that is occurring
moment by moment the event is imperceptibly shaping itself  and at every moment of this continuous  uninterrupted shaping of events the commander in chief is in the midst of a most complex play of intrigues  worries  contingencies  authorities  projects  counsels  threats  and deceptions and is continually obliged to reply to innumerable questions addressed to him  which constantly conflict with one another
learned military authorities quite seriously tell us that kutuzov should have moved his army to the kaluga road long before reaching fili  and that somebody actually submitted such a proposal to him
but a commander in chief  especially at a difficult moment  has always before him not one proposal but dozens simultaneously
and all these proposals  based on strategics and tactics  contradict each other
a commander in chief's business  it would seem  is simply to choose one of these projects
but even that he cannot do
events and time do not wait
for instance  on the twenty eighth it is suggested to him to cross to the kaluga road  but just then an adjutant gallops up from miloradovich asking whether he is to engage the french or retire
an order must be given him at once  that instant
and the order to retreat carries us past the turn to the kaluga road
and after the adjutant comes the commissary general asking where the stores are to be taken  and the chief of the hospitals asks where the wounded are to go  and a courier from petersburg brings a letter from the sovereign which does not admit of the possibility of abandoning moscow  and the commanderin chief's rival  the man who is undermining him  and there are always not merely one but several such   presents a new project diametrically opposed to that of turning to the kaluga road  and the commander in chief himself needs sleep and refreshment to maintain his energy and a respectable general who has been overlooked in the distribution of rewards comes to complain  and the inhabitants of the district pray to be defended  and an officer sent to inspect the locality comes in and gives a report quite contrary to what was said by the officer previously sent  and a spy  a prisoner  and a general who has been on reconnaissance  all describe the position of the enemy's army differently people accustomed to misunderstand or to forget these inevitable conditions of a commander in chief's actions describe to us  for instance  the position of the army at fili and assume that the commander in chief could  on the first of september  quite freely decide whether to abandon moscow or defend it  whereas  with the russian army less than four miles from moscow  no such question existed
when had that question been settled  at drissa and at smolensk and most palpably of all on the twenty fourth of august at shevardino and on the twenty sixth at borodino  and each day and hour and minute of the retreat from borodino to fili
when ermolov  having been sent by kutuzov to inspect the position  told the field marshal that it was impossible to fight there before moscow and that they must retreat  kutuzov looked at him in silence
 give me your hand   said he and  turning it over so as to feel the pulse  added   you are not well  my dear fellow
think what you are saying   kutuzov could not yet admit the possibility of retreating beyond moscow without a battle
on the poklonny hill  four miles from the dorogomilov gate of moscow  kutuzov got out of his carriage and sat down on a bench by the roadside
a great crowd of generals gathered round him  and count rostopchin  who had come out from moscow  joined them
this brilliant company separated into several groups who all discussed the advantages and disadvantages of the position  the state of the army  the plans suggested  the situation of moscow  and military questions generally
though they had not been summoned for the purpose  and though it was not so called  they all felt that this was really a council of war
the conversations all dealt with public questions
if anyone gave or asked for personal news  it was done in a whisper and they immediately reverted to general matters
no jokes  or laughter  or smiles even  were seen among all these men
they evidently all made an effort to hold themselves at the height the situation demanded and all these groups  while talking among themselves  tried to keep near the commander in chief  whose bench formed the center of the gathering  and to speak so that he might overhear them the commander in chief listened to what was being said and sometimes asked them to repeat their remarks  but did not himself take part in the conversations or express any opinion after hearing what was being said by one or other of these groups he generally turned away with an air of disappointment  as though they were not speaking of anything he wished to hear
some discussed the position that had been chosen  criticizing not the position itself so much as the mental capacity of those who had chosen it
others argued that a mistake had been made earlier and that a battle should have been fought two days before
others again spoke of the battle of salamanca  which was described by crosart  a newly arrived frenchman in a spanish uniform
 this frenchman and one of the german princes serving with the russian army were discussing the siege of saragossa and considering the possibility of defending moscow in a similar manner   count rostopchin was telling a fourth group that he was prepared to die with the city train bands under the walls of the capital  but that he still could not help regretting having been left in ignorance of what was happening  and that had he known it sooner things would have been different   
a fifth group  displaying the profundity of their strategic perceptions  discussed the direction the troops would now have to take
a sixth group was talking absolute nonsense
kutuzov's expression grew more and more preoccupied and gloomy
from all this talk he saw only one thing  that to defend moscow was a physical impossibility in the full meaning of those words  that is to say  so utterly impossible that if any senseless commander were to give orders to fight  confusion would result but the battle would still not take place
it would not take place because the commanders not merely all recognized the position to be impossible  but in their conversations were only discussing what would happen after its inevitable abandonment
how could the commanders lead their troops to a field of battle they considered impossible to hold  the lower grade officers and even the soldiers  who too reason  also considered the position impossible and therefore could not go to fight  fully convinced as they were of defeat
if bennigsen insisted on the position being defended and others still discussed it  the question was no longer important in itself but only as a pretext for disputes and intrigue
this kutuzov knew well
bennigsen  who had chosen the position  warmly displayed his russian patriotism  kutuzov could not listen to this without wincing  by insisting that moscow must be defended
his aim was as clear as daylight to kutuzov  if the defense failed  to throw the blame on kutuzov who had brought the army as far as the sparrow hills without giving battle  if it succeeded  to claim the success as his own  or if battle were not given  to clear himself of the crime of abandoning moscow but this intrigue did not now occupy the old man's mind
one terrible question absorbed him and to that question he heard no reply from anyone
the question for him now was   have i really allowed napoleon to reach moscow  and when did i do so  when was it decided  can it have been yesterday when i ordered platov to retreat  or was it the evening before  when i had a nap and told bennigsen to issue orders  or was it earlier still   
when  when was this terrible affair decided  moscow must be abandoned
the army must retreat and the order to do so must be given   to give that terrible order seemed to him equivalent to resigning the command of the army
and not only did he love power to which he was accustomed  the honours awarded to prince prozorovski  under whom he had served in turkey  galled him   but he was convinced that he was destined to save russia and that that was why  against the emperor's wish and by the will of the people  he had been chosen commander in chief
he was convinced that he alone could maintain command of the army in these difficult circumstances  and that in all the world he alone could encounter the invincible napoleon without fear  and he was horrified at the thought of the order he had to issue but something had to be decided  and these conversations around him which were assuming too free a character must be stopped
he called the most important generals to him
 my head  be it good or bad  must depend on itself   said he  rising from the bench  and he rode to fili where his carriages were waiting
the council of war began to assemble at two in the afternoon in the better and roomier part of andrew savostyanov's hut
the men  women  and children of the large peasant family crowded into the back room across the passage
only malasha  andrew's six year old granddaughter whom his serene highness had petted and to whom he had given a lump of sugar while drinking his tea  remained on the top of the brick oven in the larger room
malasha looked down from the oven with shy delight at the faces  uniforms  and decorations of the generals  who one after another came into the room and sat down on the broad benches in the corner under the icons  granddad  himself  as malasha in her own mind called kutuzov  sat apart in a dark corner behind the oven he sat  sunk deep in a folding armchair  and continually cleared his throat and pulled at the collar of his coat which  though it was unbuttoned  still seemed to pinch his neck
those who entered went up one by one to the field marshal  he pressed the hands of some and nodded to others
his adjutant kaysarov was about to draw back the curtain of the window facing kutuzov  but the latter moved his hand angrily and kaysarov understood that his serene highness did not wish his face to be seen
round the peasant's deal table  on which lay maps  plans  pencils  and papers  so many people gathered that the orderlies brought in another bench and put it beside the table
ermolov  kaysarov  and toll  who had just arrived  sat down on this bench
in the foremost place  immediately under the icons  sat barclay de tolly  his high forehead merging into his bald crown
he had a st
george's cross round his neck and looked pale and ill
he had been feverish for two days and was now shivering and in pain
beside him sat uvarov  who with rapid gesticulations was giving him some information  speaking in low tones as they all did
chubby little dokhturov was listening attentively with eyebrows raised and arms folded on his stomach on the other side sat count ostermann tolstoy  seemingly absorbed in his own thoughts
his broad head with its bold features and glittering eyes was resting on his hand
raevski  twitching forward the black hair on his temples as was his habit  glanced now at kutuzov and now at the door with a look of impatience
konovnitsyn's firm  handsome  and kindly face was lit up by a tender  sly smile
his glance met malasha's  and the expression of his eyes caused the little girl to smile
they were all waiting for bennigsen  who on the pretext of inspecting the position was finishing his savory dinner
they waited for him from four till six o'clock and did not begin their deliberations all that time but talked in low tones of other matters
only when bennigsen had entered the hut did kutuzov leave his corner and draw toward the table  but not near enough for the candles that had been placed there to light up his face
bennigsen opened the council with the question   are we to abandon russia's ancient and sacred capital without a struggle  or are we to defend it   a prolonged and general silence followed
there was a frown on every face and only kutuzov's angry grunts and occasional cough broke the silence
all eyes were gazing at him
malasha too looked at  granddad   she was nearest to him and saw how his face puckered  he seemed about to cry  but this did not last long
 russia's ancient and sacred capital   he suddenly said  repeating bennigsen's words in an angry voice and thereby drawing attention to the false note in them
 allow me to tell you  your excellency  that that question has no meaning for a russian    he lurched his heavy body forward    such a question cannot be put  it is senseless  the question i have asked these gentlemen to meet to discuss is a military one
the question is that of saving russia
is it better to give up moscow without a battle  or by accepting battle to risk losing the army as well as moscow  that is the question on which i want your opinion   and he sank back in his chair
the discussion began
bennigsen did not yet consider his game lost
admitting the view of barclay and others that a defensive battle at fili was impossible  but imbued with russian patriotism and the love of moscow  he proposed to move troops from the right to the left flank during the night and attack the french right flank the following day
opinions were divided  and arguments were advanced for and against that project
ermolov  dokhturov  and raevski agreed with bennigsen
whether feeling it necessary to make a sacrifice before abandoning the capital or guided by other  personal considerations  these generals seemed not to understand that this council could not alter the inevitable course of events and that moscow was in effect already abandoned
the other generals  however  understood it and  leaving aside the question of moscow  spoke of the direction the army should take in its retreat
malasha  who kept her eyes fixed on what was going on before her  understood the meaning of the council differently
it seemed to her that it was only a personal struggle between  granddad  and  long coat  as she termed bennigsen
she saw that they grew spiteful when they spoke to one another  and in her heart she sided with  granddad   in the midst of the conversation she noticed  granddad  give bennigsen a quick  subtle glance  and then to her joys she saw that  granddad  said something to  long coat  which settled him
bennigsen suddenly reddened and paced angrily up and down the room
what so affected him was kutuzov's calm and quiet comment on the advantage or disadvantage of bennigsen's proposal to move troops by night from the right to the left flank to attack the french right wing
 gentlemen   said kutuzov   i cannot approve of the count's plan
moving troops in close proximity to an enemy is always dangerous  and military history supports that view
for instance     kutuzov seemed to reflect  searching for an example  then with a clear  naive look at bennigsen he added   oh yes  take the battle of friedland  which i think the count well remembers  and which was  
not fully successful  only because our troops were rearranged too near the enemy     there followed a momentary pause  which seemed very long to them all
the discussion recommenced  but pauses frequently occurred and they all felt that there was no more to be said
during one of these pauses kutuzov heaved a deep sigh as if preparing to speak
they all looked at him
 well  gentlemen  i see that it is i who will have to pay for the broken crockery   said he  and rising slowly he moved to the table
 gentlemen  i have heard your views
some of you will not agree with me
but i   he paused   by the authority entrusted to me by my sovereign and country  order a retreat   after that the generals began to disperse with the solemnity and circumspect silence of people who are leaving  after a funeral some of the generals  in low tones and in a strain very different from the way they had spoken during the council  communicated something to their commander in chief
malasha  who had long been expected for supper  climbed carefully backwards down from the oven  her bare little feet catching at its projections  and slipping between the legs of the generals she darted out of the room
when he had dismissed the generals kutuzov sat a long time with his elbows on the table  thinking always of the same terrible question   when  when did the abandonment of moscow become inevitable  when was that done which settled the matter  and who was to blame for it    i did not expect this   said he to his adjutant schneider when the latter came in late that night
 i did not expect this  i did not think this would happen    you should take some rest  your serene highness   replied schneider
 but no  they shall eat horseflesh yet  like the turks   exclaimed kutuzov without replying  striking the table with his podgy fist
 they shall too  if only     at that very time  in circumstances even more important than retreating without a battle  namely the evacuation and burning of moscow  rostopchin  who is usually represented as being the instigator of that event  acted in an altogether different manner from kutuzov after the battle of borodino the abandonment and burning of moscow was as inevitable as the retreat of the army beyond moscow without fighting
every russian might have predicted it  not by reasoning but by the feeling implanted in each of us and in our fathers
the same thing that took place in moscow had happened in all the towns and villages on russian soil beginning with smolensk  without the participation of count rostopchin and his broadsheets
the people awaited the enemy unconcernedly  did not riot or become excited or tear anyone to pieces  but faced its fate  feeling within it the strength to find what it should do at that most difficult moment
and as soon as the enemy drew near the wealthy classes went away abandoning their property  while the poorer remained and burned and destroyed what was left
the consciousness that this would be so and would always be so was and is present in the heart of every russian
and a consciousness of this  and a foreboding that moscow would be taken  was present in russian moscow society in 1812
those who had quitted moscow already in july and at the beginning of august showed that they expected this
those who went away  taking what they could and abandoning their houses and half their belongings  did so from the latent patriotism which expresses itself not by phrases or by giving one's children to save the fatherland and similar unnatural exploits  but unobtrusively  simply  organically  and therefore in the way that always produces the most powerful results
 it is disgraceful to run away from danger  only cowards are running away from moscow   they were told
in his broadsheets rostopchin impressed on them that to leave moscow was shameful
they were ashamed to be called cowards  ashamed to leave  but still they left  knowing it had to be done
why did they go  it is impossible to suppose that rostopchin had scared them by his accounts of horrors napoleon had committed in conquered countries
the first people to go away were the rich educated people who knew quite well that vienna and berlin had remained intact and that during napoleon's occupation the inhabitants had spent their time pleasantly in the company of the charming frenchmen whom the russians  and especially the russian ladies  then liked so much
they went away because for russians there could be no question as to whether things would go well or ill under french rule in moscow
it was out of the question to be under french rule  it would be the worst thing that could happen
they went away even before the battle of borodino and still more rapidly after it  despite rostopchin's calls to defend moscow or the announcement of his intention to take the wonder working icon of the iberian mother of god and go to fight  or of the balloons that were to destroy the french  and despite all the nonsense rostopchin wrote in his broadsheets
they knew that it was for the army to fight  and that if it could not succeed it would not do to take young ladies and house serfs to the three hills quarter of moscow to fight napoleon  and that they must go away  sorry as they were to abandon their property to destruction
they went away without thinking of the tremendous significance of that immense and wealthy city being given over to destruction  for a great city with wooden buildings was certain when abandoned by its inhabitants to be burned
they went away each on his own account  and yet it was only in consequence of their going away that the momentous event was accomplished that will always remain the greatest glory of the russian people
the lady who  afraid of being stopped by count rostopchin's orders  had already in june moved with her negroes and her women jesters from moscow to her saratov estate  with a vague consciousness that she was not bonaparte's servant  was really  simply  and truly carrying out the great work which saved russia
but count rostopchin  who now taunted those who left moscow and now had the government offices removed  now distributed quite useless weapons to the drunken rabble  now had processions displaying the icons  and now forbade father augustin to remove icons or the relics of saints  now seized all the private carts in moscow and on one hundred and thirty six of them removed the balloon that was being constructed by leppich  now hinted that he would burn moscow and related how he had set fire to his own house  now wrote a proclamation to the french solemnly upbraiding them for having destroyed his orphanage  now claimed the glory of having hinted that he would burn moscow and now repudiated the deed  now ordered the people to catch all spies and bring them to him  and now reproached them for doing so  now expelled all the french residents from moscow  and now allowed madame aubert chalme  the center of the whole french colony in moscow  to remain  but ordered the venerable old postmaster klyucharev to be arrested and exiled for no particular offense  now assembled the people at the three hills to fight the french and now  to get rid of them  handed over to them a man to be killed and himself drove away by a back gate  now declared that he would not survive the fall of moscow  and now wrote french verses in albums concerning his share in the affair this man did not understand the meaning of what was happening but merely wanted to do something himself that would astonish people  to perform some patriotically heroic feat  and like a child he made sport of the momentous  and unavoidable event the abandonment and burning of moscow and tried with his puny hand now to speed and now to stay the enormous  popular tide that bore him along with it helene  having returned with the court from vilna to petersburg  found herself in a difficult position
in petersburg she had enjoyed the special protection of a grandee who occupied one of the highest posts in the empire
in vilna she had formed an intimacy with a young foreign prince
when she returned to petersburg both the magnate and the prince were there  and both claimed their rights
helene was faced by a new problem how to preserve her intimacy with both without offending either
what would have seemed difficult or even impossible to another woman did not cause the least embarrassment to countess bezukhova  who evidently deserved her reputation of being a very clever woman
had she attempted concealment  or tried to extricate herself from her awkward position by cunning  she would have spoiled her case by acknowledging herself guilty
but helene  like a really great man who can do whatever he pleases  at once assumed her own position to be correct  as she sincerely believed it to be  and that everyone else was to blame
the first time the young foreigner allowed himself to reproach her  she lifted her beautiful head and  half turning to him  said firmly   that's just like a man  selfish and cruel  i expected nothing else a woman sacrifices herself for you  she suffers  and this is her reward  what right have you  monseigneur  to demand an account of my attachments and friendships  he is a man who has been more than a father to me   the prince was about to say something  but helene interrupted him
 well  yes   said she   it may be that he has other sentiments for me than those of a father  but that is not a reason for me to shut my door on him
i am not a man  that i should repay kindness with ingratitude  know  monseigneur  that in all that relates to my intimate feelings i render account only to god and to my conscience   she concluded  laying her hand on her beautiful  fully expanded bosom and looking up to heaven
 but for heaven's sake listen to me    marry me  and i will be your slave    but that's impossible    you won't deign to demean yourself by marrying me  you     said helene  beginning to cry
the prince tried to comfort her  but helene  as if quite distraught  said through her tears that there was nothing to prevent her marrying  that there were precedents  there were up to that time very few  but she mentioned napoleon and some other exalted personages   that she had never been her husband's wife  and that she had been sacrificed
 but the law  religion     said the prince  already yielding
 the law  religion  
what have they been invented for if they can't arrange that   said helene
the prince was surprised that so simple an idea had not occurred to him  and he applied for advice to the holy brethren of the society of jesus  with whom he was on intimate terms a few days later at one of those enchanting fetes which helene gave at her country house on the stone island  the charming monsieur de jobert  a man no longer young  with snow white hair and brilliant black eyes  a jesuit a robe courte * was presented to her  and in the garden by the light of the illuminations and to the sound of music talked to her for a long time of the love of god  of christ  of the sacred heart  and of the consolations the one true catholic religion affords in this world and the next
helene was touched  and more than once tears rose to her eyes and to those of monsieur de jobert and their voices trembled
a dance  for which her partner came to seek her  put an end to her discourse with her future directeur de conscience  but the next evening monsieur de jobert came to see helene when she was alone  and after that often came again
* lay member of the society of jesus
one day he took the countess to a roman catholic church  where she knelt down before the altar to which she was led
the enchanting  middle aged frenchman laid his hands on her head and  as she herself afterward described it  she felt something like a fresh breeze wafted into her soul
it was explained to her that this was la grace
after that a long frocked abbe was brought to her
she confessed to him  and he absolved her from her sins
next day she received a box containing the sacred host  which was left at her house for her to partake of
a few days later helene learned with pleasure that she had now been admitted to the true catholic church and that in a few days the pope himself would hear of her and would send her a certain document all that was done around her and to her at this time  all the attention devoted to her by so many clever men and expressed in such pleasant  refined ways  and the state of dove like purity she was now in  she wore only white dresses and white ribbons all that time  gave her pleasure  but her pleasure did not cause her for a moment to forget her aim
and as it always happens in contests of cunning that a stupid person gets the better of cleverer ones  helene  having realized that the main object of all these words and all this trouble was  after converting her to catholicism  to obtain money from her for jesuit institutions  as to which she received indications  before parting with her money insisted that the various operations necessary to free her from her husband should be performed
in her view the aim of every religion was merely to preserve certain proprieties while affording satisfaction to human desires
and with this aim  in one of her talks with her father confessor  she insisted on an answer to the question  in how far was she bound by her marriage  they were sitting in the twilight by a window in the drawing room
the scent of flowers came in at the window
helene was wearing a white dress  transparent over her shoulders and bosom
the abbe  a well fed man with a plump  clean shaven chin  a pleasant firm mouth  and white hands meekly folded on his knees  sat close to helene and  with a subtle smile on his lips and a peaceful look of delight at her beauty  occasionally glanced at her face as he explained his opinion on the subject
helene with an uneasy smile looked at his curly hair and his plump  clean shaven  blackish cheeks and every moment expected the conversation to take a fresh turn
but the abbe  though he evidently enjoyed the beauty of his companion  was absorbed in his mastery of the matter
the course of the father confessor's arguments ran as follows   ignorant of the import of what you were undertaking  you made a vow of conjugal fidelity to a man who on his part  by entering the married state without faith in the religious significance of marriage  committed an act of sacrilege
that marriage lacked the dual significance it should have had
yet in spite of this your vow was binding
you swerved from it
what did you commit by so acting  a venial  or a mortal  sin  a venial sin  for you acted without evil intention
if now you married again with the object of bearing children  your sin might be forgiven
but the question is again a twofold one  firstly     but suddenly helene  who was getting bored  said with one of her bewitching smiles   but i think that having espoused the true religion i cannot be bound by what a false religion laid upon me   the director of her conscience was astounded at having the case presented to him thus with the simplicity of columbus' egg
he was delighted at the unexpected rapidity of his pupil's progress  but could not abandon the edifice of argument he had laboriously constructed
 let us understand one another  countess   said he with a smile  and began refuting his spiritual daughter's arguments
helene understood that the question was very simple and easy from the ecclesiastical point of view  and that her directors were making difficulties only because they were apprehensive as to how the matter would be regarded by the secular authorities
so she decided that it was necessary to prepare the opinion of society
she provoked the jealousy of the elderly magnate and told him what she had told her other suitor  that is  she put the matter so that the only way for him to obtain a right over her was to marry her
the elderly magnate was at first as much taken aback by this suggestion of marriage with a woman whose husband was alive  as the younger man had been  but helene's imperturbable conviction that it was as simple and natural as marrying a maiden had its effect on him too
had helene herself shown the least sign of hesitation  shame  or secrecy  her cause would certainly have been lost  but not only did she show no signs of secrecy or shame  on the contrary  with good natured naivete she told her intimate friends  and these were all petersburg  that both the prince and the magnate had proposed to her and that she loved both and was afraid of grieving either
a rumor immediately spread in petersburg  not that helene wanted to be divorced from her husband  had such a report spread many would have opposed so illegal an intention  but simply that the unfortunate and interesting helene was in doubt which of the two men she should marry
the question was no longer whether this was possible  but only which was the better match and how the matter would be regarded at court
there were  it is true  some rigid individuals unable to rise to the height of such a question  who saw in the project a desecration of the sacrament of marriage  but there were not many such and they remained silent  while the majority were interested in helene's good fortune and in the question which match would be the more advantageous
whether it was right or wrong to remarry while one had a husband living they did not discuss  for that question had evidently been settled by people  wiser than you or me   as they said  and to doubt the correctness of that decision would be to risk exposing one's stupidity and incapacity to live in society
only marya dmitrievna akhrosimova  who had come to petersburg that summer to see one of her sons  allowed herself plainly to express an opinion contrary to the general one
meeting helene at a ball she stopped her in the middle of the room and  amid general silence  said in her gruff voice   so wives of living men have started marrying again  perhaps you think you have invented a novelty  you have been forestalled  my dear  it was thought of long ago
it is done in all the brothels   and with these words marya dmitrievna  turning up her wide sleeves with her usual threatening gesture and glancing sternly round  moved across the room
though people were afraid of marya dmitrievna she was regarded in petersburg as a buffoon  and so of what she had said they only noticed  and repeated in a whisper  the one coarse word she had used  supposing the whole sting of her remark to lie in that word
prince vasili  who of late very often forgot what he had said and repeated one and the same thing a hundred times  remarked to his daughter whenever he chanced to see her   helene  i have a word to say to you   and he would lead her aside  drawing her hand downward
 i have heard of certain projects concerning  
you know
well my dear child  you know how your father's heart rejoices to know that you  
you have suffered so much   
but  my dear child  consult only your own heart
that is all i have to say   and concealing his unvarying emotion he would press his cheek against his daughter's and move away
bilibin  who had not lost his reputation of an exceedingly clever man  and who was one of the disinterested friends so brilliant a woman as helene always has  men friends who can never change into lovers once gave her his view of the matter at a small and intimate gathering
 listen  bilibin   said helene  she always called friends of that sort by their surnames   and she touched his coat sleeve with her white  beringed fingers
 tell me  as you would a sister  what i ought to do
which of the two   bilibin wrinkled up the skin over his eyebrows and pondered  with a smile on his lips
 you are not taking me unawares  you know   said he
 as a true friend  i have thought and thought again about your affair
you see  if you marry the prince  he meant the younger man and he crooked one finger   you forever lose the chance of marrying the other  and you will displease the court besides
 you know there is some kind of connection   but if you marry the old count you will make his last days happy  and as widow of the grand  
the prince would no longer be making a mesalliance by marrying you   and bilibin smoothed out his forehead
 that's a true friend   said helene beaming  and again touching bilibin's sleeve
 but i love them  you know  and don't want to distress either of them
i would give my life for the happiness of them both   bilibin shrugged his shoulders  as much as to say that not even he could help in that difficulty
 une maitresse femme  * that's what is called putting things squarely
she would like to be married to all three at the same time   thought he
* a masterly woman
 but tell me  how will your husband look at the matter   bilibin asked  his reputation being so well established that he did not fear to ask so naive a question
 will he agree    oh  he loves me so   said helene  who for some reason imagined that pierre too loved her
 he will do anything for me   bilibin puckered his skin in preparation for something witty
 even divorce you   said he
helene laughed
among those who ventured to doubt the justifiability of the proposed marriage was helene's mother  princess kuragina
she was continually tormented by jealousy of her daughter  and now that jealousy concerned a subject near to her own heart  she could not reconcile herself to the idea
she consulted a russian priest as to the possibility of divorce and remarriage during a husband's lifetime  and the priest told her that it was impossible  and to her delight showed her a text in the gospel which  as it seemed to him  plainly forbids remarriage while the husband is alive
armed with these arguments  which appeared to her unanswerable  she drove to her daughter's early one morning so as to find her alone
having listened to her mother's objections  helene smiled blandly and ironically
 but it says plainly  'whosoever shall marry her that is divorced   '  said the old princess
 ah  maman  ne dites pas de betises
vous ne comprenez rien
dans ma position j'ai des devoirs   * said helene changing from russian  in which language she always felt that her case did not sound quite clear  into french which suited it better
*  oh  mamma  don't talk nonsense  you don't understand anything
in my position i have obligations    but  my dear       oh  mamma  how is it you don't understand that the holy father  who has the right to grant dispensations     just then the lady companion who lived with helene came in to announce that his highness was in the ballroom and wished to see her
 non  dites lui que je ne veux pas le voir  que je suis furieuse contre lui  parce qu'il m'a manque parole   * *  no  tell him i don't wish to see him  i am furious with him for not keeping his word to me    comtesse  a tout peche misericorde   * said a fair haired young man with a long face and nose  as he entered the room
*  countess  there is mercy for every sin   the old princess rose respectfully and curtsied
the young man who had entered took no notice of her
the princess nodded to her daughter and sidled out of the room
 yes  she is right   thought the old princess  all her convictions dissipated by the appearance of his highness
 she is right  but how is it that we in our irrecoverable youth did not know it  yet it is so simple   she thought as she got into her carriage
by the beginning of august helene's affairs were clearly defined and she wrote a letter to her husband who  as she imagined  loved her very much  informing him of her intention to marry n n
and of her having embraced the one true faith  and asking him to carry out all the formalities necessary for a divorce  which would be explained to him by the bearer of the letter
and so i pray god to have you  my friend  in his holy and powerful keeping  your friend helene
this letter was brought to pierre's house when he was on the field of borodino
toward the end of the battle of borodino  pierre  having run down from raevski's battery a second time  made his way through a gully to knyazkovo with a crowd of soldiers  reached the dressing station  and seeing blood and hearing cries and groans hurried on  still entangled in the crowds of soldiers
the one thing he now desired with his whole soul was to get away quickly from the terrible sensations amid which he had lived that day and return to ordinary conditions of life and sleep quietly in a room in his own bed
he felt that only in the ordinary conditions of life would he be able to understand himself and all he had seen and felt but such ordinary conditions of life were nowhere to be found
though shells and bullets did not whistle over the road along which he was going  still on all sides there was what there had been on the field of battle
there were still the same suffering  exhausted  and sometimes strangely indifferent faces  the same blood  the same soldiers' overcoats  the same sounds of firing which  though distant now  still aroused terror  and besides this there were the foul air and the dust
having gone a couple of miles along the mozhaysk road  pierre sat down by the roadside
dusk had fallen  and the roar of guns died away
pierre lay leaning on his elbow for a long time  gazing at the shadows that moved past him in the darkness
he was continually imagining that a cannon ball was flying toward him with a terrific whizz  and then he shuddered and sat up
he had no idea how long he had been there
in the middle of the night three soldiers  having brought some firewood  settled down near him and began lighting a fire
the soldiers  who threw sidelong glances at pierre  got the fire to burn and placed an iron pot on it into which they broke some dried bread and put a little dripping
the pleasant odor of greasy viands mingled with the smell of smoke
pierre sat up and sighed
the three soldiers were eating and talking among themselves  taking no notice of him  and who may you be   one of them suddenly asked pierre  evidently meaning what pierre himself had in mind  namely   if you want to eat we'll give you some food  only let us know whether you are an honest man    i  i     said pierre  feeling it necessary to minimize his social position as much as possible so as to be nearer to the soldiers and better understood by them  by rights i am a militia officer  but my men are not here
i came to the battle and have lost them    there now   said one of the soldiers
another shook his head
 would you like a little mash   the first soldier asked  and handed pierre a wooden spoon after licking it clean
pierre sat down by the fire and began eating the mash  as they called the food in the cauldron  and he thought it more delicious than any food he had ever tasted
as he sat bending greedily over it  helping himself to large spoonfuls and chewing one after another  his face was lit up by the fire and the soldiers looked at him in silence  where have you to go to  tell us   said one of them
 to mozhaysk    you're a gentleman  aren't you    yes    and what's your name    peter kirilych    well then  peter kirilych  come along with us  we'll take you there   in the total darkness the soldiers walked with pierre to mozhaysk
by the time they got near mozhaysk and began ascending the steep hill into the town  the cocks were already crowing
pierre went on with the soldiers  quite forgetting that his inn was at the bottom of the hill and that he had already passed it
he would not soon have remembered this  such was his state of forgetfulness  had he not halfway up the hill stumbled upon his groom  who had been to look for him in the town and was returning to the inn
the groom recognized pierre in the darkness by his white hat
 your excellency   he said
 why  we were beginning to despair  how is it you are on foot  and where are you going  please    oh  yes   said pierre
the soldiers stopped
 so you've found your folk   said one of them
 well  good by  peter kirilych  isn't it    good bye  peter kirilych   pierre heard the other voices repeat
 good bye   he said and turned with his groom toward the inn
 i ought to give them something   he thought  and felt in his pocket
 no  better not   said another  inner voice
there was not a room to be had at the inn  they were all occupied
pierre went out into the yard and  covering himself up head and all  lay down in his carriage scarcely had pierre laid his head on the pillow before he felt himself falling asleep  but suddenly  almost with the distinctness of reality  he heard the boom  boom  boom of firing  the thud of projectiles  groans and cries  and smelled blood and powder  and a feeling of horror and dread of death seized him filled with fright he opened his eyes and lifted his head from under his cloak
all was tranquil in the yard
only someone's orderly passed through the gateway  splashing through the mud  and talked to the innkeeper
above pierre's head some pigeons  disturbed by the movement he had made in sitting up  fluttered under the dark roof of the penthouse
the whole courtyard was permeated by a strong peaceful smell of stable yards  delightful to pierre at that moment
he could see the clear starry sky between the dark roofs of two penthouses
 thank god  there is no more of that   he thought  covering up his head again
 oh  what a terrible thing is fear  and how shamefully i yielded to it  but they  
they were steady and calm all the time  to the end     thought he
they  in pierre's mind  were the soldiers  those who had been at the battery  those who had given him food  and those who had prayed before the icon
they  those strange men he had not previously known  stood out clearly and sharply from everyone else
 to be a soldier  just a soldier   thought pierre as he fell asleep   to enter communal life completely  to be imbued by what makes them what they are
but how cast off all the superfluous  devilish burden of my outer man  there was a time when i could have done it
i could have run away from my father  as i wanted to
or i might have been sent to serve as a soldier after the duel with dolokhov   and the memory of the dinner at the english club when he had challenged dolokhov flashed through pierre's mind  and then he remembered his benefactor at torzhok
and now a picture of a solemn meeting of the lodge presented itself to his mind
it was taking place at the english club and someone near and dear to him sat at the end of the table
 yes  that is he  it is my benefactor
but he died   thought pierre
 yes  he died  and i did not know he was alive
how sorry i am that he died  and how glad i am that he is alive again   on one side of the table sat anatole  dolokhov  nesvitski  denisov  and others like them  in his dream the category to which these men belonged was as clearly defined in his mind as the category of those he termed they   and he heard those people  anatole and dolokhov  shouting and singing loudly  yet through their shouting the voice of his benefactor was heard speaking all the time and the sound of his words was as weighty and uninterrupted as the booming on the battlefield  but pleasant and comforting
pierre did not understand what his benefactor was saying  but he knew  the categories of thoughts were also quite distinct in his dream  that he was talking of goodness and the possibility of being what they were
and they with their simple  kind  firm faces surrounded his benefactor on all sides
but though they were kindly they did not look at pierre and did not know him
wishing to speak and to attract their attention  he got up  but at that moment his legs grew cold and bare
he felt ashamed  and with one arm covered his legs from which his cloak had in fact slipped
for a moment as he was rearranging his cloak pierre opened his eyes and saw the same penthouse roofs  posts  and yard  but now they were all bluish  lit up  and glittering with frost or dew
 it is dawn   thought pierre
 but that's not what i want
i want to hear and understand my benefactor's words   again he covered himself up with his cloak  but now neither the lodge nor his benefactor was there there were only thoughts clearly expressed in words  thoughts that someone was uttering or that he himself was formulating afterwards when he recalled those thoughts pierre was convinced that someone outside himself had spoken them  though the impressions of that day had evoked them he had never  it seemed to him  been able to think and express his thoughts like that when awake
 to endure war is the most difficult subordination of man's freedom to the law of god   the voice had said
 simplicity is submission to the will of god  you cannot escape from him
and they are simple
they do not talk  but act
the spoken word is silver but the unspoken is golden
man can be master of nothing while he fears death  but he who does not fear it possesses all
if there were no suffering  man would not know his limitations  would not know himself the hardest thing  pierre went on thinking  or hearing  in his dream  is to be able in your soul to unite the meaning of all
to unite all   he asked himself  no  not to unite
thoughts cannot be united  but to harness all these thoughts together is what we need  yes  one must harness them  must harness them   he repeated to himself with inward rapture  feeling that these words and they alone expressed what he wanted to say and solved the question that tormented him  yes  one must harness  it is time to harness    time to harness  time to harness  your excellency  your excellency   some voice was repeating
 we must harness  it is time to harness      it was the voice of the groom  trying to wake him
the sun shone straight into pierre's face
he glanced at the dirty innyard in the middle of which soldiers were watering their lean horses at the pump while carts were passing out of the gate
pierre turned away with repugnance  and closing his eyes quickly fell back on the carriage seat
 no  i don't want that  i don't want to see and understand that
i want to understand what was revealing itself to me in my dream
one second more and i should have understood it all  but what am i to do  harness  but how can i harness everything   and pierre felt with horror that the meaning of all he had seen and thought in the dream had been destroyed
the groom  the coachman  and the innkeeper told pierre that an officer had come with news that the french were already near mozhaysk and that our men were leaving it
pierre got up and  having told them to harness and overtake him  went on foot through the town
the troops were moving on  leaving about ten thousand wounded behind them
there were wounded in the yards  at the windows of the houses  and the streets were crowded with them
in the streets  around carts that were to take some of the wounded away  shouts  curses  and blows could be heard
pierre offered the use of his carriage  which had overtaken him  to a wounded general he knew  and drove with him to moscow
on the way pierre was told of the death of his brother in law anatole and of that of prince andrew
on the thirteenth of august pierre reached moscow
close to the gates of the city he was met by count rostopchin's adjutant
 we have been looking for you everywhere   said the adjutant
 the count wants to see you particularly
he asks you to come to him at once on a very important matter   without going home  pierre took a cab and drove to see the moscow commander in chief
count rostopchin had only that morning returned to town from his summer villa at sokolniki
the anteroom and reception room of his house were full of officials who had been summoned or had come for orders
vasilchikov and platov had already seen the count and explained to him that it was impossible to defend moscow and that it would have to be surrendered
though this news was being concealed from the inhabitants  the officials the heads of the various government departments knew that moscow would soon be in the enemy's hands  just as count rostopchin himself knew it  and to escape personal responsibility they had all come to the governor to ask how they were to deal with their various departments as pierre was entering the reception room a courier from the army came out of rostopchin's private room
in answer to questions with which he was greeted  the courier made a despairing gesture with his hand and passed through the room
while waiting in the reception room pierre with weary eyes watched the various officials  old and young  military and civilian  who were there
they all seemed dissatisfied and uneasy
pierre went up to a group of men  one of whom he knew
after greeting pierre they continued their conversation
 if they're sent out and brought back again later on it will do no harm  but as things are now one can't answer for anything    but you see what he writes     said another  pointing to a printed sheet he held in his hand
 that's another matter
that's necessary for the people   said the first
 what is it   asked pierre
 oh  it's a fresh broadsheet   pierre took it and began reading
his serene highness has passed through mozhaysk in order to join up with the troops moving toward him and has taken up a strong position where the enemy will not soon attack him
forty eight guns with ammunition have been sent him from here  and his serene highness says he will defend moscow to the last drop of blood and is even ready to fight in the streets
do not be upset  brothers  that the law courts are closed  things have to be put in order  and we will deal with villains in our own way  when the time comes i shall want both town and peasant lads and will raise the cry a day or two beforehand  but they are not wanted yet so i hold my peace
an ax will be useful  a hunting spear not bad  but a three pronged fork will be best of all  a frenchman is no heavier than a sheaf of rye
tomorrow after dinner i shall take the iberian icon of the mother of god to the wounded in the catherine hospital where we will have some water blessed
that will help them to get well quicker
i  too  am well now  one of my eyes was sore but now i am on the lookout with both
 but military men have told me that it is impossible to fight in the town   said pierre   and that the position      well  of course  that's what we were saying   replied the first speaker
 and what does he mean by 'one of my eyes was sore but now i am on the lookout with both'   asked pierre
 the count had a sty   replied the adjutant smiling   and was very much upset when i told him people had come to ask what was the matter with him
by the by  count   he added suddenly  addressing pierre with a smile   we heard that you have family troubles and that the countess  your wife      i have heard nothing   pierre replied unconcernedly
 but what have you heard    oh  well  you know people often invent things
i only say what i heard    but what did you hear    well  they say   continued the adjutant with the same smile   that the countess  your wife  is preparing to go abroad
i expect it's nonsense       possibly   remarked pierre  looking about him absent mindedly
 and who is that   he asked  indicating a short old man in a clean blue peasant overcoat  with a big snow white beard and eyebrows and a ruddy face
 he  that's a tradesman  that is to say  he's the restaurant keeper  vereshchagin
perhaps you have heard of that affair with the proclamation    oh  so that is vereshchagin   said pierre  looking at the firm  calm face of the old man and seeking any indication of his being a traitor
 that's not he himself  that's the father of the fellow who wrote the proclamation   said the adjutant  the young man is in prison and i expect it will go hard with him   an old gentleman wearing a star and another official  a german wearing a cross round his neck  approached the speaker
 it's a complicated story  you know   said the adjutant
 that proclamation appeared about two months ago
the count was informed of it
he gave orders to investigate the matter
gabriel ivanovich here made the inquiries
the proclamation had passed through exactly sixty three hands
he asked one  'from whom did you get it ' 'from so and so ' he went to the next one
'from whom did you get it ' and so on till he reached vereshchagin  a half educated tradesman  you know  'a pet of a trader '  said the adjutant smiling
 they asked him  'who gave it you ' and the point is that we knew whom he had it from
he could only have had it from the postmaster
but evidently they had come to some understanding
he replied  'from no one  i made it up myself ' they threatened and questioned him  but he stuck to that  'i made it up myself ' and so it was reported to the count  who sent for the man
'from whom did you get the proclamation ' 'i wrote it myself ' well  you know the count   said the adjutant cheerfully  with a smile of pride   he flared up dreadfully and just think of the fellow's audacity  lying  and obstinacy    and the count wanted him to say it was from klyucharev  i understand   said pierre
 not at all   rejoined the adjutant in dismay
 klyucharev had his own sins to answer for without that and that is why he has been banished
but the point is that the count was much annoyed
'how could you have written it yourself ' said he  and he took up the hamburg gazette that was lying on the table
'here it is  you did not write it yourself but translated it  and translated it abominably  because you don't even know french  you fool ' and what do you think  'no ' said he  'i have not read any papers  i made it up myself ' 'if that's so  you're a traitor and i'll have you tried  and you'll be hanged  say from whom you had it ' 'i have seen no papers  i made it up myself ' and that was the end of it
the count had the father fetched  but the fellow stuck to it he was sent for trial and condemned to hard labor  i believe
now the father has come to intercede for him
but he's a good for nothing lad  you know that sort of tradesman's son  a dandy and lady killer
he attended some lectures somewhere and imagines that the devil is no match for him
that's the sort of fellow he is
his father keeps a cookshop here by the stone bridge  and you know there was a large icon of god almighty painted with a scepter in one hand and an orb in the other
well  he took that icon home with him for a few days and what did he do  he found some scoundrel of a painter     in the middle of this fresh tale pierre was summoned to the commander in chief
when he entered the private room count rostopchin  puckering his face  was rubbing his forehead and eyes with his hand
a short man was saying something  but when pierre entered he stopped speaking and went out
 ah  how do you do  great warrior   said rostopchin as soon as the short man had left the room
 we have heard of your prowess
but that's not the point
between ourselves  mon cher  do you belong to the masons   he went on severely  as though there were something wrong about it which he nevertheless intended to pardon
pierre remained silent
 i am well informed  my friend  but i am aware that there are masons and i hope that you are not one of those who on pretense of saving mankind wish to ruin russia    yes  i am a mason   pierre replied
 there  you see  mon cher  i expect you know that messrs
speranski and magnitski have been deported to their proper place
mr klyucharev has been treated in the same way  and so have others who on the plea of building up the temple of solomon have tried to destroy the temple of their fatherland
you can understand that there are reasons for this and that i could not have exiled the postmaster had he not been a harmful person
it has now come to my knowledge that you lent him your carriage for his removal from town  and that you have even accepted papers from him for safe custody
i like you and don't wish you any harm and as you are only half my age i advise you  as a father would  to cease all communication with men of that stamp and to leave here as soon as possible    but what did klyucharev do wrong  count   asked pierre
 that is for me to know  but not for you to ask   shouted rostopchin
 if he is accused of circulating napoleon's proclamation it is not proved that he did so   said pierre without looking at rostopchin   and vereshchagin      there we are   rostopchin shouted at pierre louder than before  frowning suddenly
 vereshchagin is a renegade and a traitor who will be punished as he deserves   said he with the vindictive heat with which people speak when recalling an insult
 but i did not summon you to discuss my actions  but to give you advice or an order if you prefer it
i beg you to leave the town and break off all communication with such men as klyucharev
and i will knock the nonsense out of anybody  but probably realizing that he was shouting at bezukhov who so far was not guilty of anything  he added  taking pierre's hand in a friendly manner   we are on the eve of a public disaster and i haven't time to be polite to everybody who has business with me
my head is sometimes in a whirl
well  mon cher  what are you doing personally    why  nothing   answered pierre without raising his eyes or changing the thoughtful expression of his face
the count frowned
 a word of friendly advice  mon cher
be off as soon as you can  that's all i have to tell you
happy he who has ears to hear
good bye  my dear fellow
oh  by the by   he shouted through the doorway after pierre   is it true that the countess has fallen into the clutches of the holy fathers of the society of jesus   pierre did not answer and left rostopchin's room more sullen and angry than he had ever before shown himself when he reached home it was already getting dark
some eight people had come to see him that evening  the secretary of a committee  the colonel of his battalion  his steward  his major domo  and various petitioners
they all had business with pierre and wanted decisions from him
pierre did not understand and was not interested in any of these questions and only answered them in order to get rid of these people
when left alone at last he opened and read his wife's letter
 they  the soldiers at the battery  prince andrew killed  
that old man  
simplicity is submission to god
suffering is necessary  
the meaning of all  
one must harness  
my wife is getting married  
one must forget and understand     and going to his bed he threw himself on it without undressing and immediately fell asleep when he awoke next morning the major domo came to inform him that a special messenger  a police officer  had come from count rostopchin to know whether count bezukhov had left or was leaving the town
a dozen persons who had business with pierre were awaiting him in the drawing room
pierre dressed hurriedly and  instead of going to see them  went to the back porch and out through the gate
from that time till the end of the destruction of moscow no one of bezukhov's household  despite all the search they made  saw pierre again or knew where he was
the rostovs remained in moscow till the first of september  that is  till the eve of the enemy's entry into the city
after petya had joined obolenski's regiment of cossacks and left for belaya tserkov where that regiment was forming  the countess was seized with terror
the thought that both her sons were at the war  had both gone from under her wing  that today or tomorrow either or both of them might be killed like the three sons of one of her acquaintances  struck her that summer for the first time with cruel clearness
she tried to get nicholas back and wished to go herself to join petya  or to get him an appointment somewhere in petersburg  but neither of these proved possible
petya could not return unless his regiment did so or unless he was transferred to another regiment on active service
nicholas was somewhere with the army and had not sent a word since his last letter  in which he had given a detailed account of his meeting with princess mary
the countess did not sleep at night  or when she did fall asleep dreamed that she saw her sons lying dead
after many consultations and conversations  the count at last devised means to tranquillize her
he got petya transferred from obolenski's regiment to bezukhov's  which was in training near moscow
though petya would remain in the service  this transfer would give the countess the consolation of seeing at least one of her sons under her wing  and she hoped to arrange matters for her petya so as not to let him go again  but always get him appointed to places where he could not possibly take part in a battle
as long as nicholas alone was in danger the countess imagined that she loved her first born more than all her other children and even reproached herself for it  but when her youngest  the scapegrace who had been bad at lessons  was always breaking things in the house and making himself a nuisance to everybody  that snub nosed petya with his merry black eyes and fresh rosy cheeks where soft down was just beginning to show when he was thrown amid those big  dreadful  cruel men who were fighting somewhere about something and apparently finding pleasure in it then his mother thought she loved him more  much more  than all her other children the nearer the time came for petya to return  the more uneasy grew the countess
she began to think she would never live to see such happiness
the presence of sonya  of her beloved natasha  or even of her husband irritated her
 what do i want with them  i want no one but petya   she thought
at the end of august the rostovs received another letter from nicholas
he wrote from the province of voronezh where he had been sent to procure remounts  but that letter did not set the countess at ease
knowing that one son was out of danger she became the more anxious about petya
though by the twentieth of august nearly all the rostovs' acquaintances had left moscow  and though everybody tried to persuade the countess to get away as quickly as possible  she would not hear of leaving before her treasure  her adored petya  returned
on the twenty eighth of august he arrived
the passionate tenderness with which his mother received him did not please the sixteen year old officer
though she concealed from him her intention of keeping him under her wing  petya guessed her designs  and instinctively fearing that he might give way to emotion when with her might  become womanish  as he termed it to himself he treated her coldly  avoided her  and during his stay in moscow attached himself exclusively to natasha for whom he had always had a particularly brotherly tenderness  almost lover like owing to the count's customary carelessness nothing was ready for their departure by the twenty eighth of august and the carts that were to come from their ryazan and moscow estates to remove their household belongings did not arrive till the thirtieth
from the twenty eighth till the thirty first all moscow was in a bustle and commotion
every day thousands of men wounded at borodino were brought in by the dorogomilov gate and taken to various parts of moscow  and thousands of carts conveyed the inhabitants and their possessions out by the other gates
in spite of rostopchin's broadsheets  or because of them or independently of them  the strangest and most contradictory rumors were current in the town
some said that no one was to be allowed to leave the city  others on the contrary said that all the icons had been taken out of the churches and everybody was to be ordered to leave
some said there had been another battle after borodino at which the french had been routed  while others on the contrary reported that the russian army had been destroyed
some talked about the moscow militia which  preceded by the clergy  would go to the three hills  others whispered that augustin had been forbidden to leave  that traitors had been seized  that the peasants were rioting and robbing people on their way from moscow  and so on
but all this was only talk  in reality  though the council of fili  at which it was decided to abandon moscow  had not yet been held  both those who went away and those who remained behind felt  though they did not show it  that moscow would certainly be abandoned  and that they ought to get away as quickly as possible and save their belongings
it was felt that everything would suddenly break up and change  but up to the first of september nothing had done so
as a criminal who is being led to execution knows that he must die immediately  but yet looks about him and straightens the cap that is awry on his head  so moscow involuntarily continued its wonted life  though it knew that the time of its destruction was near when the conditions of life to which its people were accustomed to submit would be completely upset
during the three days preceding the occupation of moscow the whole rostov family was absorbed in various activities
the head of the family  count ilya rostov  continually drove about the city collecting the current rumors from all sides and gave superficial and hasty orders at home about the preparations for their departure
the countess watched the things being packed  was dissatisfied with everything  was constantly in pursuit of petya who was always running away from her  and was jealous of natasha with whom he spent all his time
sonya alone directed the practical side of matters by getting things packed
but of late sonya had been particularly sad and silent
nicholas' letter in which he mentioned princess mary had elicited  in her presence  joyous comments from the countess  who saw an intervention of providence in this meeting of the princess and nicholas
 i was never pleased at bolkonski's engagement to natasha   said the countess   but i always wanted nicholas to marry the princess  and had a presentiment that it would happen
what a good thing it would be   sonya felt that this was true  that the only possibility of retrieving the rostovs' affairs was by nicholas marrying a rich woman  and that the princess was a good match
it was very bitter for her
but despite her grief  or perhaps just because of it  she took on herself all the difficult work of directing the storing and packing of their things and was busy for whole days
the count and countess turned to her when they had any orders to give
petya and natasha on the contrary  far from helping their parents  were generally a nuisance and a hindrance to everyone
almost all day long the house resounded with their running feet  their cries  and their spontaneous laughter
they laughed and were gay not because there was any reason to laugh  but because gaiety and mirth were in their hearts and so everything that happened was a cause for gaiety and laughter to them
petya was in high spirits because having left home a boy he had returned  as everybody told him  a fine young man  because he was at home  because he had left belaya tserkov where there was no hope of soon taking part in a battle and had come to moscow where there was to be fighting in a few days  and chiefly because natasha  whose lead he always followed  was in high spirits
natasha was gay because she had been sad too long and now nothing reminded her of the cause of her sadness  and because she was feeling well
she was also happy because she had someone to adore her  the adoration of others was a lubricant the wheels of her machine needed to make them run freely and petya adored her
above all  they were gay because there was a war near moscow  there would be fighting at the town gates  arms were being given out  everybody was escaping going away somewhere  and in general something extraordinary was happening  and that is always exciting  especially to the young on saturday  the thirty first of august  everything in the rostovs' house seemed topsy turvy
all the doors were open  all the furniture was being carried out or moved about  and the mirrors and pictures had been taken down
there were trunks in the rooms  and hay  wrapping paper  and ropes were scattered about the peasants and house serfs carrying out the things were treading heavily on the parquet floors
the yard was crowded with peasant carts  some loaded high and already corded up  others still empty
the voices and footsteps of the many servants and of the peasants who had come with the carts resounded as they shouted to one another in the yard and in the house
the count had been out since morning
the countess had a headache brought on by all the noise and turmoil and was lying down in the new sitting room with a vinegar compress on her head
petya was not at home  he had gone to visit a friend with whom he meant to obtain a transfer from the militia to the active army
sonya was in the ballroom looking after the packing of the glass and china
natasha was sitting on the floor of her dismantled room with dresses  ribbons  and scarves strewn all about her  gazing fixedly at the floor and holding in her hands the old ball dress  already out of fashion  which she had worn at her first petersburg ball
natasha was ashamed of doing nothing when everyone else was so busy  and several times that morning had tried to set to work  but her heart was not in it  and she could not and did not know how to do anything except with all her heart and all her might
for a while she had stood beside sonya while the china was being packed and tried to help  but soon gave it up and went to her room to pack her own things
at first she found it amusing to give away dresses and ribbons to the maids  but when that was done and what was left had still to be packed  she found it dull
 dunyasha  you pack  you will  won't you  dear   and when dunyasha willingly promised to do it all for her  natasha sat down on the floor  took her old ball dress  and fell into a reverie quite unrelated to what ought to have occupied her thoughts now
she was roused from her reverie by the talk of the maids in the next room  which was theirs  and by the sound of their hurried footsteps going to the back porch
natasha got up and looked out of the window
an enormously long row of carts full of wounded men had stopped in the street
the housekeeper  the old nurse  the cooks  coachmen  maids  footmen  postilions  and scullions stood at the gate  staring at the wounded
natasha  throwing a clean pocket handkerchief over her hair and holding an end of it in each hand  went out into the street
the former housekeeper  old mavra kuzminichna  had stepped out of the crowd by the gate  gone up to a cart with a hood constructed of bast mats  and was speaking to a pale young officer who lay inside
natasha moved a few steps forward and stopped shyly  still holding her handkerchief  and listened to what the housekeeper was saying
 then you have nobody in moscow   she was saying
 you would be more comfortable somewhere in a house  
in ours  for instance  
the family are leaving    i don't know if it would be allowed   replied the officer in a weak voice
 here is our commanding officer  
ask him   and he pointed to a stout major who was walking back along the street past the row of carts
natasha glanced with frightened eyes at the face of the wounded officer and at once went to meet the major
 may the wounded men stay in our house   she asked
the major raised his hand to his cap with a smile
 which one do you want  ma'am'selle   said he  screwing up his eyes and smiling
natasha quietly repeated her question  and her face and whole manner were so serious  though she was still holding the ends of her handkerchief  that the major ceased smiling and after some reflection as if considering in how far the thing was possible replied in the affirmative
 oh yes  why not  they may   he said
with a slight inclination of her head  natasha stepped back quickly to mavra kuzminichna  who stood talking compassionately to the officer
 they may
he says they may   whispered natasha
the cart in which the officer lay was turned into the rostovs' yard  and dozens of carts with wounded men began at the invitation of the townsfolk to turn into the yards and to draw up at the entrances of the houses in povarskaya street
natasha was evidently pleased to be dealing with new people outside the ordinary routine of her life
she and mavra kuzminichna tried to get as many of the wounded as possible into their yard
 your papa must be told  though   said mavra kuzminichna
 never mind  never mind  what does it matter  for one day we can move into the drawing room
they can have all our half of the house    there now  young lady  you do take things into your head  even if we put them into the wing  the men's room  or the nurse's room  we must ask permission    well  i'll ask   natasha ran into the house and went on tiptoe through the half open door into the sitting room  where there was a smell of vinegar and hoffman's drops
 are you asleep  mamma    oh  what sleep    said the countess  waking up just as she was dropping into a doze
 mamma darling   said natasha  kneeling by her mother and bringing her face close to her mother's   i am sorry  forgive me  i'll never do it again  i woke you up  mavra kuzminichna has sent me  they have brought some wounded here  officers
will you let them come  they have nowhere to go
i knew you'd let them come   she said quickly all in one breath
 what officers  whom have they brought  i don't understand anything about it   said the countess
natasha laughed  and the countess too smiled slightly
 i knew you'd give permission  
so i'll tell them   and  having kissed her mother  natasha got up and went to the door
in the hall she met her father  who had returned with bad news
 we've stayed too long   said the count with involuntary vexation
 the club is closed and the police are leaving    papa  is it all right i've invited some of the wounded into the house   said natasha
 of course it is   he answered absently
 that's not the point
i beg you not to indulge in trifles now  but to help to pack  and tomorrow we must go  go  go       and the count gave a similar order to the major domo and the servants
at dinner petya having returned home told them the news he had heard
he said the people had been getting arms in the kremlin  and that though rostopchin's broadsheet had said that he would sound a call two or three days in advance  the order had certainly already been given for everyone to go armed to the three hills tomorrow  and that there would be a big battle there the countess looked with timid horror at her son's eager  excited face as he said this
she realized that if she said a word about his not going to the battle  she knew he enjoyed the thought of the impending engagement  he would say something about men  honor  and the fatherland something senseless  masculine  and obstinate which there would be no contradicting  and her plans would be spoiled  and so  hoping to arrange to leave before then and take petya with her as their protector and defender  she did not answer him  but after dinner called the count aside and implored him with tears to take her away quickly  that very night if possible
with a woman's involuntary loving cunning she  who till then had not shown any alarm  said that she would die of fright if they did not leave that very night
without any pretense she was now afraid of everything
madame schoss  who had been out to visit her daughter  increased the countess' fears still more by telling what she had seen at a spirit dealer's in myasnitski street
when returning by that street she had been unable to pass because of a drunken crowd rioting in front of the shop
she had taken a cab and driven home by a side street and the cabman had told her that the people were breaking open the barrels at the drink store  having received orders to do so
after dinner the whole rostov household set to work with enthusiastic haste packing their belongings and preparing for their departure
the old count  suddenly setting to work  kept passing from the yard to the house and back again  shouting confused instructions to the hurrying people  and flurrying them still more
petya directed things in the yard
sonya  owing to the count's contradictory orders  lost her head and did not know what to do
the servants ran noisily about the house and yard  shouting and disputing
natasha  with the ardor characteristic of all she did suddenly set to work too
at first her intervention in the business of packing was received skeptically
everybody expected some prank from her and did not wish to obey her  but she resolutely and passionately demanded obedience  grew angry and nearly cried because they did not heed her  and at last succeeded in making them believe her
her first exploit  which cost her immense effort and established her authority  was the packing of the carpets
the count had valuable gobelin tapestries and persian carpets in the house
when natasha set to work two cases were standing open in the ballroom  one almost full up with crockery  the other with carpets
there was also much china standing on the tables  and still more was being brought in from the storeroom
a third case was needed and servants had gone to fetch it  sonya  wait a bit we'll pack everything into these   said natasha
 you can't  miss  we have tried to   said the butler's assistant
 no  wait a minute  please   and natasha began rapidly taking out of the case dishes and plates wrapped in paper
 the dishes must go in here among the carpets   said she
 why  it's a mercy if we can get the carpets alone into three cases   said the butler's assistant
 oh  wait  please   and natasha began rapidly and deftly sorting out the things
 these aren't needed   said she  putting aside some plates of kiev ware
 these yes  these must go among the carpets   she said  referring to the saxony china dishes
 don't  natasha  leave it alone  we'll get it all packed   urged sonya reproachfully
 what a young lady she is   remarked the major domo
but natasha would not give in
she turned everything out and began quickly repacking  deciding that the inferior russian carpets and unnecessary crockery should not be taken at all
when everything had been taken out of the cases  they recommenced packing  and it turned out that when the cheaper things not worth taking had nearly all been rejected  the valuable ones really did all go into the two cases
only the lid of the case containing the carpets would not shut down
a few more things might have been taken out  but natasha insisted on having her own way
she packed  repacked  pressed  made the butler's assistant and petya whom she had drawn into the business of packing press on the lid  and made desperate efforts herself
 that's enough  natasha   said sonya
 i see you were right  but just take out the top one    i won't   cried natasha  with one hand holding back the hair that hung over her perspiring face  while with the other she pressed down the carpets
 now press  petya  press  vasilich  press hard   she cried
the carpets yielded and the lid closed  natasha  clapping her hands  screamed with delight and tears fell from her eyes
but this only lasted a moment
she at once set to work afresh and they now trusted her completely
the count was not angry even when they told him that natasha had countermanded an order of his  and the servants now came to her to ask whether a cart was sufficiently loaded  and whether it might be corded up
thanks to natasha's directions the work now went on expeditiously  unnecessary things were left  and the most valuable packed as compactly as possible
but hard as they all worked till quite late that night  they could not get everything packed
the countess had fallen asleep and the count  having put off their departure till next morning  went to bed
sonya and natasha slept in the sitting room without undressing
that night another wounded man was driven down the povarskaya  and mavra kuzminichna  who was standing at the gate  had him brought into the rostovs' yard
mavra kuzminichna concluded that he was a very important man
he was being conveyed in a caleche with a raised hood  and was quite covered by an apron
on the box beside the driver sat a venerable old attendant
a doctor and two soldiers followed the carriage in a cart
 please come in here
the masters are going away and the whole house will be empty   said the old woman to the old attendant
 well  perhaps   said he with a sigh
 we don't expect to get him home alive  we have a house of our own in moscow  but it's a long way from here  and there's nobody living in it    do us the honor to come in  there's plenty of everything in the master's house
come in   said mavra kuzminichna
 is he very ill   she asked
the attendant made a hopeless gesture
 we don't expect to get him home  we must ask the doctor   and the old servant got down from the box and went up to the cart
 all right   said the doctor
the old servant returned to the caleche  looked into it  shook his head disconsolately  told the driver to turn into the yard  and stopped beside mavra kuzminichna
 o  lord jesus christ   she murmured
she invited them to take the wounded man into the house
 the masters won't object     she said
but they had to avoid carrying the man upstairs  and so they took him into the wing and put him in the room that had been madame schoss'
this wounded man was prince andrew bolkonski
moscow's last day had come
it was a clear bright autumn day  a sunday
the church bells everywhere were ringing for service  just as usual on sundays
nobody seemed yet to realize what awaited the city
only two things indicated the social condition of moscow the rabble  that is the poor people  and the price of commodities
an enormous crowd of factory hands  house serfs  and peasants  with whom some officials  seminarists  and gentry were mingled  had gone early that morning to the three hills
having waited there for rostopchin who did not turn up  they became convinced that moscow would be surrendered  and then dispersed all about the town to the public houses and cookshops
prices too that day indicated the state of affairs
the price of weapons  of gold  of carts and horses  kept rising  but the value of paper money and city articles kept falling  so that by midday there were instances of carters removing valuable goods  such as cloth  and receiving in payment a half of what they carted  while peasant horses were fetching five hundred rubles each  and furniture  mirrors  and bronzes were being given away for nothing in the rostovs' staid old fashioned house the dissolution of former conditions of life was but little noticeable
as to the serfs the only indication was that three out of their huge retinue disappeared during the night  but nothing was stolen  and as to the value of their possessions  the thirty peasant carts that had come in from their estates and which many people envied proved to be extremely valuable and they were offered enormous sums of money for them not only were huge sums offered for the horses and carts  but on the previous evening and early in the morning of the first of september  orderlies and servants sent by wounded officers came to the rostovs' and wounded men dragged themselves there from the rostovs' and from neighboring houses where they were accommodated  entreating the servants to try to get them a lift out of moscow the major domo to whom these entreaties were addressed  though he was sorry for the wounded  resolutely refused  saying that he dare not even mention the matter to the count
pity these wounded men as one might  it was evident that if they were given one cart there would be no reason to refuse another  or all the carts and one's own carriages as well
thirty carts could not save all the wounded and in the general catastrophe one could not disregard oneself and one's own family
so thought the major domo on his master's behalf
on waking up that morning count ilya rostov left his bedroom softly  so as not to wake the countess who had fallen asleep only toward morning  and came out to the porch in his lilac silk dressing gown
in the yard stood the carts ready corded
the carriages were at the front porch
the major domo stood at the porch talking to an elderly orderly and to a pale young officer with a bandaged arm
on seeing the count the major domo made a significant and stern gesture to them both to go away
 well  vasilich  is everything ready   asked the count  and stroking his bald head he looked good naturedly at the officer and the orderly and nodded to them
 he liked to see new faces    we can harness at once  your excellency    well  that's right
as soon as the countess wakes we'll be off  god willing  what is it  gentlemen   he added  turning to the officer
 are you staying in my house   the officer came nearer and suddenly his face flushed crimson  count  be so good as to allow me  
for god's sake  to get into some corner of one of your carts  i have nothing here with me   
i shall be all right on a loaded cart     before the officer had finished speaking the orderly made the same request on behalf of his master
 oh  yes  yes  yes   said the count hastily
 i shall be very pleased  very pleased
vasilich  you'll see to it
just unload one or two carts
well  what of it  
do what's necessary     said the count  muttering some indefinite order
but at the same moment an expression of warm gratitude on the officer's face had already sealed the order
the count looked around him
in the yard  at the gates  at the window of the wings  wounded officers and their orderlies were to be seen
they were all looking at the count and moving toward the porch
 please step into the gallery  your excellency   said the major domo
 what are your orders about the pictures   the count went into the house with him  repeating his order not to refuse the wounded who asked for a lift
 well  never mind  some of the things can be unloaded   he added in a soft  confidential voice  as though afraid of being overheard
at nine o'clock the countess woke up  and matrena timofeevna  who had been her lady's maid before her marriage and now performed a sort of chief gendarme's duty for her  came to say that madame schoss was much offended and the young ladies' summer dresses could not be left behind
on inquiry  the countess learned that madame schoss was offended because her trunk had been taken down from its cart  and all the loads were being uncorded and the luggage taken out of the carts to make room for wounded men whom the count in the simplicity of his heart had ordered that they should take with them
the countess sent for her husband
 what is this  my dear  i hear that the luggage is being unloaded    you know  love  i wanted to tell you  
countess dear  
an officer came to me to ask for a few carts for the wounded
after all  ours are things that can be bought but think what being left behind means to them   
really now  in our own yard we asked them in ourselves and there are officers among them   
you know  i think  my dear  
let them be taken  
where's the hurry   the count spoke timidly  as he always did when talking of money matters
the countess was accustomed to this tone as a precursor of news of something detrimental to the children's interests  such as the building of a new gallery or conservatory  the inauguration of a private theater or an orchestra
she was accustomed always to oppose anything announced in that timid tone and considered it her duty to do so
she assumed her dolefully submissive manner and said to her husband   listen to me  count  you have managed matters so that we are getting nothing for the house  and now you wish to throw away all our all the children's property  you said yourself that we have a hundred thousand rubles' worth of things in the house
i don't consent  my dear  i don't  do as you please  it's the government's business to look after the wounded  they know that
look at the lopukhins opposite  they cleared out everything two days ago
that's what other people do
it's only we who are such fools
if you have no pity on me  have some for the children   flourishing his arms in despair the count left the room without replying  papa  what are you doing that for   asked natasha  who had followed him into her mother's room
 nothing  what business is it of yours   muttered the count angrily
 but i heard   said natasha
 why does mamma object    what business is it of yours   cried the count
natasha stepped up to the window and pondered
 papa  here's berg coming to see us   said she  looking out of the window
berg  the rostovs' son in law  was already a colonel wearing the orders of vladimir and anna  and he still filled the quiet and agreeable post of assistant to the head of the staff of the assistant commander of the first division of the second army
on the first of september he had come to moscow from the army
he had nothing to do in moscow  but he had noticed that everyone in the army was asking for leave to visit moscow and had something to do there
so he considered it necessary to ask for leave of absence for family and domestic reasons
berg drove up to his father in law's house in his spruce little trap with a pair of sleek roans  exactly like those of a certain prince
he looked attentively at the carts in the yard and while going up to the porch took out a clean pocket handkerchief and tied a knot in it
from the anteroom berg ran with smooth though impatient steps into the drawing room  where he embraced the count  kissed the hands of natasha and sonya  and hastened to inquire after  mamma's  health
 health  at a time like this   said the count
 come  tell us the news  is the army retreating or will there be another battle    god almighty alone can decide the fate of our fatherland  papa   said berg
 the army is burning with a spirit of heroism and the leaders  so to say  have now assembled in council
no one knows what is coming
but in general i can tell you  papa  that such a heroic spirit  the truly antique valor of the russian army  which they which it   he corrected himself   has shown or displayed in the battle of the twenty sixth there are no words worthy to do it justice  i tell you  papa   he smote himself on the breast as a general he had heard speaking had done  but berg did it a trifle late for he should have struck his breast at the words  russian army     i tell you frankly that we  the commanders  far from having to urge the men on or anything of that kind  could hardly restrain those   those  
yes  those exploits of antique valor   he went on rapidly
 general barclay de tolly risked his life everywhere at the head of the troops  i can assure you
our corps was stationed on a hillside
you can imagine   and berg related all that he remembered of the various tales he had heard those days
natasha watched him with an intent gaze that confused him  as if she were trying to find in his face the answer to some question
 altogether such heroism as was displayed by the russian warriors cannot be imagined or adequately praised   said berg  glancing round at natasha  and as if anxious to conciliate her  replying to her intent look with a smile
 'russia is not in moscow  she lives in the hearts of her sons ' isn't it so  papa   said he
just then the countess came in from the sitting room with a weary and dissatisfied expression
berg hurriedly jumped up  kissed her hand  asked about her health  and  swaying his head from side to side to express sympathy  remained standing beside her
 yes  mamma  i tell you sincerely that these are hard and sad times for every russian
but why are you so anxious  you have still time to get away       i can't think what the servants are about   said the countess  turning to her husband
 i have just been told that nothing is ready yet
somebody after all must see to things
one misses mitenka at such times
there won't be any end to it   the count was about to say something  but evidently restrained himself he got up from his chair and went to the door
at that moment berg drew out his handkerchief as if to blow his nose and  seeing the knot in it  pondered  shaking his head sadly and significantly
 and i have a great favor to ask of you  papa   said he
 hm     said the count  and stopped
 i was driving past yusupov's house just now   said berg with a laugh   when the steward  a man i know  ran out and asked me whether i wouldn't buy something
i went in out of curiosity  you know  and there is a small chiffonier and a dressing table
you know how dear vera wanted a chiffonier like that and how we had a dispute about it    at the mention of the chiffonier and dressing table berg involuntarily changed his tone to one of pleasure at his admirable domestic arrangements    and it's such a beauty  it pulls out and has a secret english drawer  you know  and dear vera has long wanted one
i wish to give her a surprise  you see
i saw so many of those peasant carts in your yard
please let me have one  i will pay the man well  and     the count frowned and coughed
 ask the countess  i don't give orders    if it's inconvenient  please don't   said berg
 only i so wanted it  for dear vera's sake    oh  go to the devil  all of you  to the devil  the devil  the devil     cried the old count
 my head's in a whirl   and he left the room
the countess began to cry
 yes  mamma  yes  these are very hard times   said berg
natasha left the room with her father and  as if finding it difficult to reach some decision  first followed him and then ran downstairs
petya was in the porch  engaged in giving out weapons to the servants who were to leave moscow
the loaded carts were still standing in the yard
two of them had been uncorded and a wounded officer was climbing into one of them helped by an orderly
 do you know what it's about   petya asked natasha
she understood that he meant what were their parents quarreling about
she did not answer
 it's because papa wanted to give up all the carts to the wounded   said petya
 vasilich told me
i consider      i consider   natasha suddenly almost shouted  turning her angry face to petya   i consider it so horrid  so abominable  so  
i don't know what
are we despicable germans   her throat quivered with convulsive sobs and  afraid of weakening and letting the force of her anger run to waste  she turned and rushed headlong up the stairs
berg was sitting beside the countess consoling her with the respectful attention of a relative
the count  pipe in hand  was pacing up and down the room  when natasha  her face distorted by anger  burst in like a tempest and approached her mother with rapid steps
 it's horrid  it's abominable   she screamed
 you can't possibly have ordered it   berg and the countess looked at her  perplexed and frightened
the count stood still at the window and listened
 mamma  it's impossible  see what is going on in the yard   she cried
 they will be left       what's the matter with you  who are 'they'  what do you want    why  the wounded  it's impossible  mamma
it's monstrous   
no  mamma darling  it's not the thing
please forgive me  darling   
mamma  what does it matter what we take away  only look what is going on in the yard  
mamma   
it's impossible   the count stood by the window and listened without turning round
suddenly he sniffed and put his face closer to the window
the countess glanced at her daughter  saw her face full of shame for her mother  saw her agitation  and understood why her husband did not turn to look at her now  and she glanced round quite disconcerted
 oh  do as you like  am i hindering anyone   she said  not surrendering at once
 mamma  darling  forgive me   but the countess pushed her daughter away and went up to her husband
 my dear  you order what is right   
you know i don't understand about it   said she  dropping her eyes shamefacedly
 the eggs  
the eggs are teaching the hen   muttered the count through tears of joy  and he embraced his wife who was glad to hide her look of shame on his breast
 papa  mamma  may i see to it  may i      asked natasha
 we will still take all the most necessary things   the count nodded affirmatively  and natasha  at the rapid pace at which she used to run when playing at tag  ran through the ballroom to the anteroom and downstairs into the yard
the servants gathered round natasha  but could not believe the strange order she brought them until the count himself  in his wife's name  confirmed the order to give up all the carts to the wounded and take the trunks to the storerooms when they understood that order the servants set to work at this new task with pleasure and zeal
it no longer seemed strange to them but on the contrary it seemed the only thing that could be done  just as a quarter of an hour before it had not seemed strange to anyone that the wounded should be left behind and the goods carted away but that had seemed the only thing to do
the whole household  as if to atone for not having done it sooner  set eagerly to work at the new task of placing the wounded in the carts
the wounded dragged themselves out of their rooms and stood with pale but happy faces round the carts the news that carts were to be had spread to the neighboring houses  from which wounded men began to come into the rostovs' yard
many of the wounded asked them not to unload the carts but only to let them sit on the top of the things
but the work of unloading  once started  could not be arrested
it seemed not to matter whether all or only half the things were left behind
cases full of china  bronzes  pictures  and mirrors that had been so carefully packed the night before now lay about the yard  and still they went on searching for and finding possibilities of unloading this or that and letting the wounded have another and yet another cart
 we can take four more men   said the steward
 they can have my trap  or else what is to become of them    let them have my wardrobe cart   said the countess
 dunyasha can go with me in the carriage   they unloaded the wardrobe cart and sent it to take wounded men from a house two doors off
the whole household  servants included  was bright and animated
natasha was in a state of rapturous excitement such as she had not known for a long time
 what could we fasten this onto   asked the servants  trying to fix a trunk on the narrow footboard behind a carriage
 we must keep at least one cart    what's in it   asked natasha
 leave it  vasilich will put it away
it's not wanted   the phaeton was full of people and there was a doubt as to where count peter could sit
 on the box
you'll sit on the box  won't you  petya   cried natasha
sonya too was busy all this time  but the aim of her efforts was quite different from natasha's
she was putting away the things that had to be left behind and making a list of them as the countess wished  and she tried to get as much taken away with them as possible
before two o'clock in the afternoon the rostovs' four carriages  packed full and with the horses harnessed  stood at the front door
one by one the carts with the wounded had moved out of the yard
the caleche in which prince andrew was being taken attracted sonya's attention as it passed the front porch
with the help of a maid she was arranging a seat for the countess in the huge high coach that stood at the entrance
 whose caleche is that   she inquired  leaning out of the carriage window
 why  didn't you know  miss   replied the maid
 the wounded prince  he spent the night in our house and is going with us    but who is it  what's his name    it's our intended that was prince bolkonski himself  they say he is dying   replied the maid with a sigh sonya jumped out of the coach and ran to the countess
the countess  tired out and already dressed in shawl and bonnet for her journey  was pacing up and down the drawing room  waiting for the household to assemble for the usual silent prayer with closed doors before starting
natasha was not in the room
 mamma   said sonya   prince andrew is here  mortally wounded
he is going with us   the countess opened her eyes in dismay and  seizing sonya's arm  glanced around
 natasha   she murmured
at that moment this news had only one significance for both of them
they knew their natasha  and alarm as to what would happen if she heard this news stifled all sympathy for the man they both liked
 natasha does not know yet  but he is going with us   said sonya
 you say he is dying   sonya nodded
the countess put her arms around sonya and began to cry  the ways of god are past finding out   she thought  feeling that the almighty hand  hitherto unseen  was becoming manifest in all that was now taking place
 well  mamma  everything is ready
what's the matter   asked natasha  as with animated face she ran into the room
 nothing   answered the countess
 if everything is ready let us start   and the countess bent over her reticule to hide her agitated face
sonya embraced natasha and kissed her
natasha looked at her inquiringly
 what is it  what has happened    nothing  
no      is it something very bad for me  what is it   persisted natasha with her quick intuition
sonya sighed and made no reply
the count  petya  madame schoss  mavra kuzminichna  and vasilich came into the drawing room and  having closed the doors  they all sat down and remained for some moments silently seated without looking at one another
the count was the first to rise  and with a loud sigh crossed himself before the icon all the others did the same
then the count embraced mavra kuzminichna and vasilich  who were to remain in moscow  and while they caught at his hand and kissed his shoulder he patted their backs lightly with some vaguely affectionate and comforting words
the countess went into the oratory and there sonya found her on her knees before the icons that had been left here and there hanging on the wall
 the most precious ones  with which some family tradition was connected  were being taken with them   in the porch and in the yard the men whom petya had armed with swords and daggers  with trousers tucked inside their high boots and with belts and girdles tightened  were taking leave of those remaining behind
as is always the case at a departure  much had been forgotten or put in the wrong place  and for a long time two menservants stood one on each side of the open door and the carriage steps waiting to help the countess in  while maids rushed with cushions and bundles from the house to the carriages  the caleche  the phaeton  and back again
 they always will forget everything   said the countess
 don't you know i can't sit like that   and dunyasha  with clenched teeth  without replying but with an aggrieved look on her face  hastily got into the coach to rearrange the seat
 oh  those servants   said the count  swaying his head
efim  the old coachman  who was the only one the countess trusted to drive her  sat perched up high on the box and did not so much as glance round at what was going on behind him
from thirty years' experience he knew it would be some time yet before the order   be off  in god's name   would be given him  and he knew that even when it was said he would be stopped once or twice more while they sent back to fetch something that had been forgotten  and even after that he would again be stopped and the countess herself would lean out of the window and beg him for the love of heaven to drive carefully down the hill he knew all this and therefore waited calmly for what would happen  with more patience than the horses  especially the near one  the chestnut falcon  who was pawing the ground and champing his bit
at last all were seated  the carriage steps were folded and pulled up  the door was shut  somebody was sent for a traveling case  and the countess leaned out and said what she had to say
then efim deliberately doffed his hat and began crossing himself the postilion and all the other servants did the same
 off  in god's name   said efim  putting on his hat
 start   the postilion started the horses  the off pole horse tugged at his collar  the high springs creaked  and the body of the coach swayed
the footman sprang onto the box of the moving coach which jolted as it passed out of the yard onto the uneven roadway  the other vehicles jolted in their turn  and the procession of carriages moved up the street
in the carriages  the caleche  and the phaeton  all crossed themselves as they passed the church opposite the house those who were to remain in moscow walked on either side of the vehicles seeing the travelers off
rarely had natasha experienced so joyful a feeling as now  sitting in the carriage beside the countess and gazing at the slowly receding walls of forsaken  agitated moscow
occasionally she leaned out of the carriage window and looked back and then forward at the long train of wounded in front of them
almost at the head of the line she could see the raised hood of prince andrew's caleche
she did not know who was in it  but each time she looked at the procession her eyes sought that caleche
she knew it was right in front
in kudrino  from the nikitski  presnya  and podnovinsk streets came several other trains of vehicles similar to the rostovs'  and as they passed along the sadovaya street the carriages and carts formed two rows abreast
as they were going round the sukharev water tower natasha  who was inquisitively and alertly scrutinizing the people driving or walking past  suddenly cried out in joyful surprise   dear me  mamma  sonya  look  it's he    who  who    look  yes  on my word  it's bezukhov   said natasha  putting her head out of the carriage and staring at a tall  stout man in a coachman's long coat  who from his manner of walking and moving was evidently a gentleman in disguise  and who was passing under the arch of the sukharev tower accompanied by a small  sallow faced  beardless old man in a frieze coat
 yes  it really is bezukhov in a coachman's coat  with a queer looking old boy
really   said natasha   look  look    no  it's not he
how can you talk such nonsense    mamma   screamed natasha   i'll stake my head it's he  i assure you  stop  stop   she cried to the coachman
but the coachman could not stop  for from the meshchanski street came more carts and carriages  and the rostovs were being shouted at to move on and not block the way
in fact  however  though now much farther off than before  the rostovs all saw pierre or someone extraordinarily like him in a coachman's coat  going down the street with head bent and a serious face beside a small  beardless old man who looked like a footman
that old man noticed a face thrust out of the carriage window gazing at them  and respectfully touching pierre's elbow said something to him and pointed to the carriage
pierre  evidently engrossed in thought  could not at first understand him
at length when he had understood and looked in the direction the old man indicated  he recognized natasha  and following his first impulse stepped instantly and rapidly toward the coach
but having taken a dozen steps he seemed to remember something and stopped
natasha's face  leaning out of the window  beamed with quizzical kindliness
 peter kirilovich  come here  we have recognized you  this is wonderful   she cried  holding out her hand to him
 what are you doing  why are you like this   pierre took her outstretched hand and kissed it awkwardly as he walked along beside her while the coach still moved on  what is the matter  count   asked the countess in a surprised and commiserating tone
 what  what  why  don't ask me   said pierre  and looked round at natasha whose radiant  happy expression of which he was conscious without looking at her filled him with enchantment
 are you remaining in moscow  then   pierre hesitated
 in moscow   he said in a questioning tone
 yes  in moscow
good bye    ah  if only i were a man  i'd certainly stay with you
how splendid   said natasha
 mamma  if you'll let me  i'll stay   pierre glanced absently at natasha and was about to say something  but the countess interrupted him
 you were at the battle  we heard    yes  i was   pierre answered
 there will be another battle tomorrow     he began  but natasha interrupted him
 but what is the matter with you  count  you are not like yourself       oh  don't ask me  don't ask me  i don't know myself
tomorrow  
but no  good bye  good by   he muttered
 it's an awful time   and dropping behind the carriage he stepped onto the pavement
natasha continued to lean out of the window for a long time  beaming at him with her kindly  slightly quizzical  happy smile
for the last two days  ever since leaving home  pierre had been living in the empty house of his deceased benefactor  bazdeev
this is how it happened
when he woke up on the morning after his return to moscow and his interview with count rostopchin  he could not for some time make out where he was and what was expected of him
when he was informed that among others awaiting him in his reception room there was a frenchman who had brought a letter from his wife  the countess helene  he felt suddenly overcome by that sense of confusion and hopelessness to which he was apt to succumb
he felt that everything was now at an end  all was in confusion and crumbling to pieces  that nobody was right or wrong  the future held nothing  and there was no escape from this position
smiling unnaturally and muttering to himself  he first sat down on the sofa in an attitude of despair  then rose  went to the door of the reception room and peeped through the crack  returned flourishing his the frenchman who had brought the letter from the countess was very anxious to see him if only for a minute  and that someone from bazdeev's widow had leaving for the country  oh  yes  in a minute  wait  
or no  no  of course  
go and say i will come directly   pierre replied to the major domo
but as soon as the man had left the room pierre took up his hat which was lying on the table and went out of his study by the other door
there was no one in the passage
he went along the whole length of this passage to the stairs and  frowning and rubbing his forehead with both hands  went down as far as the first landing
the hall porter was standing at the front door
from the landing where pierre stood there was a second staircase leading to the back entrance
he went down that staircase and out into the yard
no one had seen him
but there were some carriages waiting  and as soon as pierre stepped out of the gate the coachmen and the yard porter noticed him and raised their caps to him
when he felt he was being looked at he behaved like an ostrich which hides its head in a bush in order not to be seen  he hung his head and quickening his pace went down the street
of all the affairs awaiting pierre that day the sorting of joseph bazdeev's he hired the first cab he met and told the driver to go to the patriarch's ponds  where the widow bazdeev's house was
continually turning round to look at the rows of loaded carts that were making their way from all sides out of moscow  and balancing his bulky body so as not to slip out of the ramshackle old vehicle  pierre  experiencing the joyful feeling of a boy escaping from school  began to talk to his driver the man told him that arms were being distributed today at the kremlin and that tomorrow everyone would be sent out beyond the three hills gates and a great battle would be fought there having reached the patriarch's ponds pierre found the bazdeevs' house  where he had not been for a long time past
he went up to the gate
gerasim  that sallow beardless old man pierre had seen at torzhok five years before with joseph bazdeev  came out in answer to his knock
 at home   asked pierre
 owing to the present state of things sophia danilovna has gone to the torzhok estate with the children  your excellency    be so good as to step in
makar alexeevich  the brother of my late master  may the kingdom of heaven be his has remained here  but he is in a weak state as you know   said the old servant
pierre knew that makar alexeevich was joseph bazdeev's half insane brother and a hard drinker
 yes  yes  i know
let us go in     said pierre and entered the house
a tall  bald headed old man with a red nose  wearing a dressing gown and with galoshes on his bare feet  stood in the anteroom
on seeing pierre he muttered something angrily and went away along the passage
 he was a very clever man but has now grown quite feeble  as your honor sees   said gerasim
 will you step into the study   pierre nodded
 as it was sealed up so it has remained  but sophia danilovna gave orders that if anyone pierre went into that gloomy study which he had entered with such trepidation in his benefactor's lifetime
the room  dusty and untouched since the death of joseph bazdeev was now even gloomier
gerasim opened one of the shutters and left the room on tiptoe
pierre went round the study  approached the cupboard in which the manuscripts were kept  and took out what had once been one of the most important  the holy of holies of the order
this was the authentic scotch acts with bazdeev's notes and explanations
he sat down at the dusty writing table  and  having laid the manuscripts before him  opened them out  closed them  finally pushed them away  and resting his head on his hand sank into meditation
gerasim looked cautiously into the study several times and saw pierre always sitting in the same attitude
more than two hours passed and gerasim took the liberty of making a slight noise at the door to attract his attention  but pierre did not hear him
 is the cabman to be discharged  your honor    oh yes   said pierre  rousing himself and rising hurriedly  look here   he added  taking gerasim by a button of his coat and looking down at the old man with moist  shining  and ecstatic eyes   i say  do you know that there is going to be a battle tomorrow    we heard so   replied the man
 i beg you not to tell anyone who i am  and to do what i ask you    yes  your excellency   replied gerasim
 will you have something to eat    no  but i want something else
i want peasant clothes and a pistol   said pierre  unexpectedly blushing
 yes  your excellency   said gerasim after thinking for a moment
all the rest of that day pierre spent alone in his benefactor's study  and gerasim heard him pacing restlessly from one corner to another and talking to himself and he spent the night on a bed made up for him there
gerasim  being a servant who in his time had seen many strange things  accepted pierre's taking up his residence in the house without surprise  and seemed pleased to have someone to wait on
that same evening without even asking himself what they were wanted for he procured a coachman's coat and cap for pierre  and promised to get him the pistol next day makar alexeevich came twice that evening shuffling along in his galoshes as far as the door and stopped and looked ingratiatingly at pierre
but as soon as pierre turned toward him he wrapped his dressing gown around him with a shamefaced and angry look and hurried away
it was when pierre  wearing the coachman's coat which gerasim had procured for him and had disinfected by steam  was on his way with the old man to buy the pistol at the sukharev market that he met the rostovs
kutuzov's order to retreat through moscow to the ryazan road was issued at night on the first of september
the first troops started at once  and during the night they marched slowly and steadily without hurry
at daybreak  however  those nearing the town at the dorogomilov bridge saw ahead of them masses of soldiers crowding and hurrying across the bridge  ascending on the opposite side and blocking the streets and alleys  while endless masses of troops were bearing down on them from behind  and an unreasoning hurry and alarm overcame them
they all rushed forward to the bridge  onto it  and to the fords and the boats
kutuzov himself had driven round by side streets to the other side of moscow by ten o'clock in the morning of the second of september  only the rear guard remained in the dorogomilov suburb  where they had ample room
the main army was on the other side of moscow or beyond it
at that very time  at ten in the morning of the second of september  napoleon was standing among his troops on the poklonny hill looking at the panorama spread out before him
from the twenty sixth of august to the second of september  that is from the battle of borodino to the entry of the french into moscow  during the whole of that agitating  memorable week  there had been the extraordinary autumn weather that always comes as a surprise  when the sun hangs low and gives more heat than in spring  when everything shines so brightly in the rare clear atmosphere that the eyes smart  when the lungs are strengthened and refreshed by inhaling the aromatic autumn air  when even the nights are warm  and when in those dark warm nights  golden stars startle and delight us continually by falling from the sky
at ten in the morning of the second of september this weather still held
the brightness of the morning was magical
moscow seen from the poklonny hill lay spaciously spread out with her river  her gardens  and her churches  and she seemed to be living her usual life  her cupolas glittering like stars in the sunlight
the view of the strange city with its peculiar architecture  such as he had never seen before  filled napoleon with the rather envious and uneasy curiosity men feel when they see an alien form of life that has no knowledge of them
this city was evidently living with the full force of its own life
by the indefinite signs which  even at a distance  distinguish a living body from a dead one  napoleon from the poklonny hill perceived the throb of life in the town and felt  as it were  the breathing of that great and beautiful body
every russian looking at moscow feels her to be a mother  every foreigner who sees her  even if ignorant of her significance as the mother city  must feel her feminine character  and napoleon felt it
 cette ville asiatique aux innombrables eglises  moscou la sainte
la voila done enfin  cette fameuse ville  il etait temps   * said he  and dismounting he ordered a plan of moscow to be spread out before him  and summoned lelorgne d'ideville  the interpreter
*  that asiatic city of the innumerable churches  holy moscow  here it is then at last  that famous city
it was high time    a town captured by the enemy is like a maid who has lost her honor   thought he  he had said so to tuchkov at smolensk 
from that point of view he gazed at the oriental beauty he had not seen before
it seemed strange to him that his long felt wish  which had seemed unattainable  had at last been realized
in the clear morning light he gazed now at the city and now at the plan  considering its details  and the assurance of possessing it agitated and awed him
 but could it be otherwise   he thought
 here is this capital at my feet
where is alexander now  and of what is he thinking  a strange  beautiful  and majestic city  and a strange and majestic moment  in what light must i appear to them   thought he  thinking of his troops
 here she is  the reward for all those fainthearted men   he reflected  glancing at those near him and at the troops who were approaching and forming up
 one word from me  one movement of my hand  and that ancient capital of the tsars would perish
but my clemency is always ready to descend upon the vanquished
i must be magnanimous and truly great
but no  it can't be true that i am in moscow   he suddenly thought
 yet here she is lying at my feet  with her golden domes and crosses scintillating and twinkling in the sunshine
but i shall spare her
on the ancient monuments of barbarism and despotism i will inscribe great words of justice and mercy   
it is just this which alexander will feel most painfully  i know him    it seemed to napoleon that the chief import of what was taking place lay in the personal struggle between himself and alexander    from the height of the kremlin yes  there is the kremlin  yes i will give them just laws  i will teach them the meaning of true civilization  i will make generations of boyars remember their conqueror with love i will tell the deputation that i did not  and do not  desire war  that i have waged war only against the false policy of their court  that i love and respect alexander and that in moscow i will accept terms of peace worthy of myself and of my people i do not wish to utilize the fortunes of war to humiliate an honored monarch
'boyars ' i will say to them  'i do not desire war  i desire the peace and welfare of all my subjects ' however  i know their presence will inspire me  and i shall speak to them as i always do  clearly  impressively  and majestically
but can it be true that i am in moscow  yes  there she lies    qu'on m'amene les boyars   * said he to his suite
*  bring the boyars to me   a general with a brilliant suite galloped off at once to fetch the boyars two hours passed
napoleon had lunched and was again standing in the same place on the poklonny hill awaiting the deputation
his speech to the boyars had already taken definite shape in his imagination
that speech was full of dignity and greatness as napoleon understood it
he was himself carried away by the tone of magnanimity he intended to adopt toward moscow in his imagination he appointed days for assemblies at the palace of the tsars  at which russian notables and his own would mingle
he mentally appointed a governor  one who would win the hearts of the people
having learned that there were many charitable institutions in moscow he mentally decided that he would shower favors on them all
he thought that  as in africa he had to put on a burnoose and sit in a mosque  so in moscow he must be beneficent like the tsars
and in order finally to touch the hearts of the russians and being like all frenchmen unable to imagine anything sentimental without a reference to ma chere  ma tendre  ma pauvre mere *   he decided that he would place an inscription on all these establishments in large letters   this establishment is dedicated to my dear mother   or no  it should be simply  maison de ma mere  * 2  he concluded
 but am i really in moscow  yes  here it lies before me  but why is the deputation from the city so long in appearing   he wondered
*  my dear  my tender  my poor mother   *  2   house of my mother   meanwhile an agitated consultation was being carried on in whispers among his generals and marshals at the rear of his suite
those sent to fetch the deputation had returned with the news that moscow was empty  that everyone had left it the faces of those who were not conferring together were pale and perturbed
they were not alarmed by the fact that moscow had been abandoned by its inhabitants  grave as that fact seemed   but by the question how to tell the emperor without putting him in the terrible position of appearing ridiculous that he had been awaiting the boyars so long in vain  that there were drunken mobs left in moscow but no one else
some said that a deputation of some sort must be scraped together  others disputed that opinion and maintained that the emperor should first be carefully and skillfully prepared  and then told the truth
 he will have to be told  all the same   said some gentlemen of the suite
 but  gentlemen     the position was the more awkward because the emperor  meditating upon his magnanimous plans  was pacing patiently up and down before the outspread map  occasionally glancing along the road to moscow from under his lifted hand with a bright and proud smile
 but it's impossible     declared the gentlemen of the suite  shrugging their shoulders but not venturing to utter the implied word le ridicule  
at last the emperor  tired of futile expectation  his actor's instinct suggesting to him that the sublime moment having been too long drawn out was beginning to lose its sublimity  gave a sign with his hand
a single report of a signaling gun followed  and the troops  who were already spread out on different sides of moscow  moved into the city through tver  kaluga  and dorogomilov gates
faster and faster  vying with one another  they moved at the double or at a trot  vanishing amid the clouds of dust they raised and making the air ring with a deafening roar of mingling shouts
drawn on by the movement of his troops napoleon rode with them as far as the dorogomilov gate  but there again stopped and  dismounting from his horse  paced for a long time by the kammer kollezski rampart  awaiting the deputation
meanwhile moscow was empty
there were still people in it  perhaps a fiftieth part of its former inhabitants had remained  but it was empty
it was empty in the sense that a dying queenless hive is empty
in a queenless hive no life is left though to a superficial glance it seems as much alive as other hives the bees circle round a queenless hive in the hot beams of the midday sun as gaily as around the living hives  from a distance it smells of honey like the others  and bees fly in and out in the same way but one has only to observe that hive to realize that there is no longer any life in it
the bees do not fly in the same way  the smell and the sound that meet the beekeeper are not the same
to the beekeeper's tap on the wall of the sick hive  instead of the former instant unanimous humming of tens of thousands of bees with their abdomens threateningly compressed  and producing by the rapid vibration of their wings an aerial living sound  the only reply is a disconnected buzzing from different parts of the deserted hive
from the alighting board  instead of the former spirituous fragrant smell of honey and venom  and the warm whiffs of crowded life  comes an odor of emptiness and decay mingling with the smell of honey
there are no longer sentinels sounding the alarm with their abdomens raised  and ready to die in defense of the hive
there is no longer the measured quiet sound of throbbing activity  like the sound of boiling water  but diverse discordant sounds of disorder
in and out of the hive long black robber bees smeared with honey fly timidly and shiftily
they do not sting  but crawl away from danger
formerly only bees laden with honey flew into the hive  and they flew out empty  now they fly out laden
the beekeeper opens the lower part of the hive and peers in
instead of black  glossy bees tamed by toil  clinging to one another's legs and drawing out the wax  with a ceaseless hum of labor that used to hang in long clusters down to the floor of the hive  drowsy shriveled bees crawl about separately in various directions on the floor and walls of the hive
instead of a neatly glued floor  swept by the bees with the fanning of their wings  there is a floor littered with bits of wax  excrement  dying bees scarcely moving their legs  and dead ones that have not been cleared away
the beekeeper opens the upper part of the hive and examines the super
instead of serried rows of bees sealing up every gap in the combs and keeping the brood warm  he sees the skillful complex structures of the combs  but no longer in their former state of purity
all is neglected and foul
black robber bees are swiftly and stealthily prowling about the combs  and the short home bees  shriveled and listless as if they were old  creep slowly about without trying to hinder the robbers  having lost all motive and all sense of life
drones  bumblebees  wasps  and butterflies knock awkwardly against the walls of the hive in their flight
here and there among the cells containing dead brood and honey an angry buzzing can sometimes be heard
here and there a couple of bees  by force of habit and custom cleaning out the brood cells  with efforts beyond their strength laboriously drag away a dead bee or bumblebee without knowing why they do it
in another corner two old bees are languidly fighting  or cleaning themselves  or feeding one another  without themselves knowing whether they do it with friendly or hostile intent in a third place a crowd of bees  crushing one another  attack some victim and fight and smother it  and the victim  enfeebled or killed  drops from above slowly and lightly as a feather  among the heap of corpses
the keeper opens the two center partitions to examine the brood cells
in place of the former close dark circles formed by thousands of bees sitting back to back and guarding the high mystery of generation  he sees hundreds of dull  listless  and sleepy shells of bees
they have almost all died unawares  sitting in the sanctuary they had guarded and which is now no more
they reek of decay and death
only a few of them still move  rise  and feebly fly to settle on the enemy's hand  lacking the spirit to die stinging him  the rest are dead and fall as lightly as fish scales
the beekeeper closes the hive  chalks a mark on it  and when he has time tears out its contents and burns it clean
so in the same way moscow was empty when napoleon  weary  uneasy  and morose  paced up and down in front of the kammer kollezski rampart  awaiting what to his mind was a necessary  if but formal  observance of the proprieties a deputation
in various corners of moscow there still remained a few people aimlessly moving about  following their old habits and hardly aware of what they were doing
when with due circumspection napoleon was informed that moscow was empty  he looked angrily at his informant  turned away  and silently continued to walk to and fro  my carriage   he said
he took his seat beside the aide de camp on duty and drove into the suburb
 moscow deserted   he said to himself  what an incredible event   he did not drive into the town  but put up at an inn in the dorogomilov suburb
the coup de theatre had not come off
the russian troops were passing through moscow from two o'clock at night till two in the afternoon and bore away with them the wounded and the last of the inhabitants who were leaving
the greatest crush during the movement of the troops took place at the stone  moskva  and yauza bridges
while the troops  dividing into two parts when passing around the kremlin  were thronging the moskva and the stone bridges  a great many soldiers  taking advantage of the stoppage and congestion  turned back from the bridges and slipped stealthily and silently past the church of vasili the beatified and under the borovitski gate  back up the hill to the red square where some instinct told them they could easily take things not belonging to them
crowds of the kind seen at cheap sales filled all the passages and alleys of the bazaar
but there were no dealers with voices of ingratiating affability inviting customers to enter  there were no hawkers  nor the usual motley crowd of female purchasers but only soldiers  in uniforms and overcoats though without muskets  entering the bazaar empty handed and silently making their way out through its passages with bundles tradesmen and their assistants  of whom there were but few  moved about among the soldiers quite bewildered
they unlocked their shops and locked them up again  and themselves carried goods away with the help of their assistants on the square in front of the bazaar were drummers beating the muster call
but the roll of the drums did not make the looting soldiers run in the direction of the drum as formerly  but made them  on the contrary  run farther away among the soldiers in the shops and passages some men were to be seen in gray coats  with closely shaven heads
two officers  one with a scarf over his uniform and mounted on a lean  dark gray horse  the other in an overcoat and on foot  stood at the corner of ilyinka street  talking
a third officer galloped up to them
 the general orders them all to be driven out at once  without fail
this is outrageous  half the men have dispersed    where are you off to   
where      he shouted to three infantrymen without muskets who  holding up the skirts of their overcoats  were slipping past him into the bazaar passage
 stop  you rascals    but how are you going to stop them   replied another officer
 there is no getting them together
the army should push on before the rest bolt  that's all    how can one push on  they are stuck there  wedged on the bridge  and don't move
shouldn't we put a cordon round to prevent the rest from running away    come  go in there and drive them out   shouted the senior officer
the officer in the scarf dismounted  called up a drummer  and went with him into the arcade
some soldiers started running away in a group
a shopkeeper with red pimples on his cheeks near the nose  and a calm  persistent  calculating expression on his plump face  hurriedly and ostentatiously approached the officer  swinging his arms  your honor   said he
 be so good as to protect us  we won't grudge trifles  you are welcome to anything we shall be delighted  pray   
i'll fetch a piece of cloth at once for such an honorable gentleman  or even two pieces with pleasure for we feel how it is  but what's all this sheer robbery  if you please  could not guards be placed if only to let us close the shop      several shopkeepers crowded round the officer
 eh  what twaddle   said one of them  a thin  stern looking man
 when one's head is gone one doesn't weep for one's hair  take what any of you like   and flourishing his arm energetically he turned sideways to the officer
 it's all very well for you  ivan sidorych  to talk   said the first tradesman angrily
 please step inside  your honor    talk indeed   cried the thin one
 in my three shops here i have a hundred thousand rubles' worth of goods
can they be saved when the army has gone  eh  what people  'against god's might our hands can't fight '   come inside  your honor   repeated the tradesman  bowing
the officer stood perplexed and his face showed indecision
 it's not my business   he exclaimed  and strode on quickly down one of the passages
from one open shop came the sound of blows and vituperation  and just as the officer came up to it a man in a gray coat with a shaven head was flung out violently
this man  bent double  rushed past the tradesman and the officer
the officer pounced on the soldiers who were in the shops  but at that moment fearful screams reached them from the huge crowd on the moskva bridge and the officer ran out into the square  what is it  what is it   he asked  but his comrade was already galloping off past vasili the beatified in the direction from which the screams came the officer mounted his horse and rode after him when he reached the bridge he saw two unlimbered guns  the infantry crossing the bridge  several overturned carts  and frightened and laughing faces among the troops
beside the cannon a cart was standing to which two horses were harnessed
four borzois with collars were pressing close to the wheels
the cart was loaded high  and at the very top  beside a child's chair with its legs in the air  sat a peasant woman uttering piercing and desperate shrieks
he was told by his fellow officers that the screams of the crowd and the shrieks of the woman were due to the fact that general ermolov  coming up to the crowd and learning that soldiers were dispersing among the shops while crowds of civilians blocked the bridge  had ordered two guns to be unlimbered and made a show of firing at the bridge the crowd  crushing one another  upsetting carts  and shouting and squeezing desperately  had cleared off the bridge and the troops were now moving forward
meanwhile  the city itself was deserted
there was hardly anyone in the streets
the gates and shops were all closed  only here and there round the taverns solitary shouts or drunken songs could be heard
nobody drove through the streets and footsteps were rarely heard
the povarskaya was quite still and deserted
the huge courtyard of the rostovs' house was littered with wisps of hay and with dung from the horses  and not a soul was to be seen there
in the great drawing room of the house  which had been left with all it contained  were two people
they were the yard porter ignat  and the page boy mishka  vasilich's grandson who had stayed in moscow with his grandfather
mishka had opened the clavichord and was strumming on it with one finger
the yard porter  his arms akimbo  stood smiling with satisfaction before the large mirror  isn't it fine  eh  uncle ignat   said the boy  suddenly beginning to strike the keyboard with both hands
 only fancy   answered ignat  surprised at the broadening grin on his face in the mirror
 impudence  impudence   they heard behind them the voice of mavra kuzminichna who had entered silently
 how he's grinning  the fat mug  is that what you're here for  nothing's cleared away down there and vasilich is worn out
just you wait a bit   ignat left off smiling  adjusted his belt  and went out of the room with meekly downcast eyes
 aunt  i did it gently   said the boy
 i'll give you something gently  you monkey you   cried mavra kuzminichna  raising her arm threateningly
 go and get the samovar to boil for your grandfather   mavra kuzminichna flicked the dust off the clavichord and closed it  and with a deep sigh left the drawing room and locked its main door
going out into the yard she paused to consider where she should go next to drink tea in the servants' wing with vasilich  or into the storeroom to put away what still lay about
she heard the sound of quick footsteps in the quiet street
someone stopped at the gate  and the latch rattled as someone tried to open it
mavra kuzminichna went to the gate
 who do you want    the count count ilya andreevich rostov    and who are you    an officer  i have to see him   came the reply in a pleasant  well bred russian voice
mavra kuzminichna opened the gate and an officer of eighteen  with the round face of a rostov  entered the yard
 they have gone away  sir
went away yesterday at vespertime   said mavra kuzminichna cordially
the young officer standing in the gateway  as if hesitating whether to enter or not  clicked his tongue
 ah  how annoying   he muttered
 i should have come yesterday   
ah  what a pity   meanwhile  mavra kuzminichna was attentively and sympathetically examining the familiar rostov features of the young man's face  his tattered coat and trodden down boots
 what did you want to see the count for   she asked
 oh well  
it can't be helped   said he in a tone of vexation and placed his hand on the gate as if to leave
he again paused in indecision
 you see   he suddenly said   i am a kinsman of the count's and he has been very kind to me
as you see   he glanced with an amused air and good natured smile at his coat and boots   my things are worn out and i have no money  so i was going to ask the count     mavra kuzminichna did not let him finish
 just wait a minute  sir
one little moment   said she
and as soon as the officer let go of the gate handle she turned and  hurrying away on her old legs  went through the back yard to the servants' quarters
while mavra kuzminichna was running to her room the officer walked about the yard gazing at his worn out boots with lowered head and a faint smile on his lips
 what a pity i've missed uncle  what a nice old woman  where has she run off to  and how am i to find the nearest way to overtake my regiment  which must by now be getting near the rogozhski gate   thought he
just then mavra kuzminichna appeared from behind the corner of the house with a frightened yet resolute look  carrying a rolled up check kerchief in her hand
while still a few steps from the officer she unfolded the kerchief and took out of it a white twenty five ruble assignat and hastily handed it to him
 if his excellency had been at home  as a kinsman he would of course  
but as it is     mavra kuzminichna grew abashed and confused
the officer did not decline  but took the note quietly and thanked her
 if the count had been at home     mavra kuzminichna went on apologetically
 christ be with you  sir  may god preserve you   said she  bowing as she saw him out
swaying his head and smiling as if amused at himself  the officer ran almost at a trot through the deserted streets toward the yauza bridge to overtake his regiment but mavra kuzminichna stood at the closed gate for some time with moist eyes  pensively swaying her head and feeling an unexpected flow of motherly tenderness and pity for the unknown young officer
from an unfinished house on the varvarka  the ground floor of which was a dramshop  came drunken shouts and songs on benches round the tables in a dirty little room sat some ten factory hands
tipsy and perspiring  with dim eyes and wide open mouths  they were all laboriously singing some song or other
they were singing discordantly  arduously  and with great effort  evidently not because they wished to sing  but because they wanted to show they were drunk and on a spree
one  a tall  fair haired lad in a clean blue coat  was standing over the others
his face with its fine straight nose would have been handsome had it not been for his thin  compressed  twitching lips and dull  gloomy  fixed eyes
evidently possessed by some idea  he stood over those who were singing  and solemnly and jerkily flourished above their heads his white arm with the sleeve turned up to the elbow  trying unnaturally to spread out his dirty fingers
the sleeve of his coat kept slipping down and he always carefully rolled it up again with his left hand  as if it were most important that the sinewy white arm he was flourishing should be bare
in the midst of the song cries were heard  and fighting and blows in the passage and porch
the tall lad waved his arm
 stop it   he exclaimed peremptorily
 there's a fight  lads   and  still rolling up his sleeve  he went out to the porch
the factory hands followed him
these men  who under the leadership of the tall lad were drinking in the dramshop that morning  had brought the publican some skins from the factory and for this had had drink served them the blacksmiths from a neighboring smithy  hearing the sounds of revelry in the tavern and supposing it to have been broken into  wished to force their way in too and a fight in the porch had resulted
the publican was fighting one of the smiths at the door  and when the workmen came out the smith  wrenching himself free from the tavern keeper  fell face downward on the pavement another smith tried to enter the doorway  pressing against the publican with his chest
the lad with the turned up sleeve gave the smith a blow in the face and cried wildly   they're fighting us  lads   at that moment the first smith got up and  scratching his bruised face to make it bleed  shouted in a tearful voice   police  murder   
they've killed a man  lads    oh  gracious me  a man beaten to death killed      screamed a woman coming out of a gate close by
a crowd gathered round the bloodstained smith
 haven't you robbed people enough taking their last shirts   said a voice addressing the publican
 what have you killed a man for  you thief   the tall lad  standing in the porch  turned his bleared eyes from the publican to the smith and back again as if considering whom he ought to fight now
 murderer   he shouted suddenly to the publican
 bind him  lads    i daresay you would like to bind me   shouted the publican  pushing away the men advancing on him  and snatching his cap from his head he flung it on the ground
as if this action had some mysterious and menacing significance  the workmen surrounding the publican paused in indecision
 i know the law very well  mates  i'll take the matter to the captain of police
you think i won't get to him  robbery is not permitted to anybody now a days   shouted the publican  picking up his cap
 come along then  come along then   the publican and the tall young fellow repeated one after the other  and they moved up the street together
the bloodstained smith went beside them
the factory hands and others followed behind  talking and shouting
at the corner of the moroseyka  opposite a large house with closed shutters and bearing a bootmaker's signboard  stood a score of thin  worn out  gloomy  faced bootmakers  wearing overalls and long tattered coats
 he should pay folks off properly   a thin workingman  with frowning brows and a straggly beard  was saying
 but he's sucked our blood and now he thinks he's quit of us
he's been misleading us all the week and now that he's brought us to this pass he's made off   on seeing the crowd and the bloodstained man the workman ceased speaking  and with eager curiosity all the bootmakers joined the moving crowd
 where are all the folks going    why  to the police  of course    i say  is it true that we have been beaten    and what did you think  look what folks are saying   questions and answers were heard
the publican  taking advantage of the increased crowd  dropped behind and returned to his tavern
the tall youth  not noticing the disappearance of his foe  waved his bare arm and went on talking incessantly  attracting general attention to himself it was around him that the people chiefly crowded  expecting answers from him to the questions that occupied all their minds
 he must keep order  keep the law  that's what the government is there for
am i not right  good christians   said the tall youth  with a scarcely perceptible smile
 he thinks there's no government  how can one do without government  or else there would be plenty who'd rob us    why talk nonsense   rejoined voices in the crowd
 will they give up moscow like this  they told you that for fun  and you believed it  aren't there plenty of troops on the march  let him in  indeed  that's what the government is for
you'd better listen to what people are saying   said some of the mob pointing to the tall youth
by the wall of china town a smaller group of people were gathered round a man in a frieze coat who held a paper in his hand
 an ukase  they are reading an ukase  reading an ukase   cried voices in the crowd  and the people rushed toward the reader
the man in the frieze coat was reading the broadsheet of august 31
when the crowd collected round him he seemed confused  but at the demand of the tall lad who had pushed his way up to him  he began in a rather tremulous voice to read the sheet from the beginning
 early tomorrow i shall go to his serene highness   he read   sirin highness   said the tall fellow with a triumphant smile on his lips and a frown on his brow    to consult with him to act  and to aid the army to exterminate these scoundrels
we too will take part     the reader went on  and then paused   do you see   shouted the youth victoriously   he's going to clear up the whole affair for you         in destroying them  and will send these visitors to the devil
i will come back to dinner  and we'll set to work
we will do  completely do  and undo these scoundrels   the last words were read out in the midst of complete silence
the tall lad hung his head gloomily
it was evident that no one had understood the last part
in particular  the words  i will come back to dinner   evidently displeased both reader and audience
the people's minds were tuned to a high pitch and this was too simple and needlessly comprehensible it was what any one of them might have said and therefore was what an ukase emanating from the highest authority should not say
they all stood despondent and silent
the tall youth moved his lips and swayed from side to side
 we should ask him  
that's he himself      yes  ask him indeed   
why not  he'll explain   
voices in the rear of the crowd were suddenly heard saying  and the general attention turned to the police superintendent's trap which drove into the square attended by two mounted dragoons
the superintendent of police  who had gone that morning by count rostopchin's orders to burn the barges and had in connection with that matter acquired a large sum of money which was at that moment in his pocket  on seeing a crowd bearing down upon him told his coachman to stop
 what people are these   he shouted to the men  who were moving singly and timidly in the direction of his trap
 what people are these   he shouted again  receiving no answer
 your honor     replied the shopman in the frieze coat   your honor  in accord with the proclamation of his highest excellency the count  they desire to serve  not sparing their lives  and it is not any kind of riot  but as his highest excellence said      the count has not left  he is here  and an order will be issued concerning you   said the superintendent of police
 go on   he ordered his coachman
the crowd halted  pressing around those who had heard what the superintendent had said  and looking at the departing trap
the superintendent of police turned round at that moment with a scared look  said something to his coachman  and his horses increased their speed
 it's a fraud  lads  lead the way to him  himself   shouted the tall youth  don't let him go  lads  let him answer us  keep him   shouted different people and the people dashed in pursuit of the trap
following the superintendent of police and talking loudly the crowd went in the direction of the lubyanka street
 there now  the gentry and merchants have gone away and left us to perish
do they think we're dogs   voices in the crowd were heard saying more and more frequently
on the evening of the first of september  after his interview with kutuzov  count rostopchin had returned to moscow mortified and offended because he had not been invited to attend the council of war  and because kutuzov had paid no attention to his offer to take part in the defense of the city  amazed also at the novel outlook revealed to him at the camp  which treated the tranquillity of the capital and its patriotic fervor as not merely secondary but quite irrelevant and unimportant matters
distressed  offended  and surprised by all this  rostopchin had returned to moscow
after supper he lay down on a sofa without undressing  and was awakened soon after midnight by a courier bringing him a letter from kutuzov
this letter requested the count to send police officers to guide the troops through the town  as the army was retreating to the ryazan road beyond moscow
this was not news to rostopchin
he had known that moscow would be abandoned not merely since his interview the previous day with kutuzov on the poklonny hill but ever since the battle of borodino  for all the generals who came to moscow after that battle had said unanimously that it was impossible to fight another battle  and since then the government property had been removed every night  and half the inhabitants had left the city with rostopchin's own permission
yet all the same this information astonished and irritated the count  coming as it did in the form of a simple note with an order from kutuzov  and received at night  breaking in on his beauty sleep
when later on in his memoirs count rostopchin explained his actions at this time  he repeatedly says that he was then actuated by two important considerations  to maintain tranquillity in moscow and expedite the departure of the inhabitants
if one accepts this twofold aim all rostopchin's actions appear irreproachable
 why were the holy relics  the arms  ammunition  gunpowder  and stores of corn not removed  why were thousands of inhabitants deceived into believing that moscow would not be given up and thereby ruined    to preserve the tranquillity of the city   explains count rostopchin  why were bundles of useless papers from the government offices  and leppich's balloon and other articles removed    to leave the town empty   explains count rostopchin
one need only admit that public tranquillity is in danger and any action finds a justification
all the horrors of the reign of terror were based only on solicitude for public tranquillity
on what  then  was count rostopchin's fear for the tranquillity of moscow based in 1812  what reason was there for assuming any probability of an uprising in the city  the inhabitants were leaving it and the retreating troops were filling it
why should that cause the masses to riot  neither in moscow nor anywhere in russia did anything resembling an insurrection ever occur when the enemy entered a town
more than ten thousand people were still in moscow on the first and second of september  and except for a mob in the governor's courtyard  assembled there at his bidding  nothing happened
it is obvious that there would have been even less reason to expect a disturbance among the people if after the battle of borodino  when the surrender of moscow became certain or at least probable  rostopchin instead of exciting the people by distributing arms and broadsheets had taken steps to remove all the holy relics  the gunpowder  munitions  and money  and had told the population plainly that the town would be abandoned rostopchin  though he had patriotic sentiments  was a sanguine and impulsive man who had always moved in the highest administrative circles and had no understanding at all of the people he supposed himself to be guiding ever since the enemy's entry into smolensk he had in imagination been playing the role of director of the popular feeling of  the heart of russia   not only did it seem to him  as to all administrators  that he controlled the external actions of moscow's inhabitants  but he also thought he controlled their mental attitude by means of his broadsheets and posters  written in a coarse tone which the people despise in their own class and do not understand from those in authority
rostopchin was so pleased with the fine role of leader of popular feeling  and had grown so used to it  that the necessity of relinquishing that role and abandoning moscow without any heroic display took him unawares and he suddenly felt the ground slip away from under his feet  so that he positively did not know what to do
though he knew it was coming  he did not till the last moment wholeheartedly believe that moscow would be abandoned  and did not prepare for it
the inhabitants left against his wishes
if the government offices were removed  this was only done on the demand of officials to whom the count yielded reluctantly
he was absorbed in the role he had created for himself as is often the case with those gifted with an ardent imagination  though he had long known that moscow would be abandoned he knew it only with his intellect  he did not believe it in his heart and did not adapt himself mentally to this new position of affairs all his painstaking and energetic activity  in how far it was useful and had any effect on the people is another question  had been simply directed toward arousing in the masses his own feeling of patriotic hatred of the french
but when events assumed their true historical character  when expressing hatred for the french in words proved insufficient  when it was not even possible to express that hatred by fighting a battle  when self confidence was of no avail in relation to the one question before moscow  when the whole population streamed out of moscow as one man  abandoning their belongings and proving by that negative action all the depth of their national feeling  then the role chosen by rostopchin suddenly appeared senseless
he unexpectedly felt himself ridiculous  weak  and alone  with no ground to stand on when  awakened from his sleep  he received that cold  peremptory note from kutuzov  he felt the more irritated the more he felt himself to blame all that he had been specially put in charge of  the state property which he should have removed  was still in moscow and it was no longer possible to take the whole of it away
 who is to blame for it  who has let things come to such a pass   he ruminated
 not i  of course
i had everything ready
i had moscow firmly in hand
and this is what they have let it come to  villains  traitors   he thought  without clearly defining who the villains and traitors were  but feeling it necessary to hate those traitors whoever they might be who were to blame for the false and ridiculous position in which he found himself all that night count rostopchin issued orders  for which people came to him from all parts of moscow
those about him had never seen the count so morose and irritable
 your excellency  the director of the registrar's department has sent for instructions  
from the consistory  from the senate  from the university  from the foundling hospital  the suffragan has sent  
asking for information   
what are your orders about the fire brigade  from the governor of the prison  
from the superintendent of the lunatic asylum     all night long such announcements were continually being received by the count
to all these inquiries he gave brief and angry replies indicating that orders from him were not now needed  that the whole affair  carefully prepared by him  had now been ruined by somebody  and that that somebody would have to bear the whole responsibility for all that might happen
 oh  tell that blockhead   he said in reply to the question from the registrar's department   that he should remain to guard his documents
now why are you asking silly questions about the fire brigade  they have horses  let them be off to vladimir  and not leave them to the french    your excellency  the superintendent of the lunatic asylum has come  what are your commands    my commands  let them go away  that's all   
and let the lunatics out into the town
when lunatics command our armies god evidently means these other madmen to be free   in reply to an inquiry about the convicts in the prison  count rostopchin shouted angrily at the governor   do you expect me to give you two battalions which we have not got for a convoy  release them  that's all about it    your excellency  there are some political prisoners  meshkov  vereshchagin      vereshchagin  hasn't he been hanged yet   shouted rostopchin
 bring him to me   toward nine o'clock in the morning  when the troops were already moving through moscow  nobody came to the count any more for instructions
those who were able to get away were going of their own accord  those who remained behind decided for themselves what they must do the count ordered his carriage that he might drive to sokolniki  and sat in his study with folded hands  morose  sallow  and taciturn
in quiet and untroubled times it seems to every administrator that it is only by his efforts that the whole population under his rule is kept going  and in this consciousness of being indispensable every administrator finds the chief reward of his labor and efforts while the sea of history remains calm the ruler administrator in his frail bark  holding on with a boat hook to the ship of the people and himself moving  naturally imagines that his efforts move the ship he is holding on to but as soon as a storm arises and the sea begins to heave and the ship to move  such a delusion is no longer possible
the ship moves independently with its own enormous motion  the boat hook no longer reaches the moving vessel  and suddenly the administrator  instead of appearing a ruler and a source of power  becomes an insignificant  useless  feeble man
rostopchin felt this  and it was this which exasperated him
the superintendent of police  whom the crowd had stopped  went in to see him at the same time as an adjutant who informed the count that the horses were harnessed
they were both pale  and the superintendent of police  after reporting that he had executed the instructions he had received  informed the count that an immense crowd had collected in the courtyard and wished to see him
without saying a word rostopchin rose and walked hastily to his light  luxurious drawing room  went to the balcony door  took hold of the handle  let it go again  and went to the window from which he had a better view of the whole crowd
the tall lad was standing in front  flourishing his arm and saying something with a stern look
the blood stained smith stood beside him with a gloomy face
a drone of voices was audible through the closed window
 is my carriage ready   asked rostopchin  stepping back from the window
 it is  your excellency   replied the adjutant
rostopchin went again to the balcony door
 but what do they want   he asked the superintendent of police
 your excellency  they say they have got ready  according to your orders  to go against the french  and they shouted something about treachery
but it is a turbulent crowd  your excellency i hardly managed to get away from it
your excellency  i venture to suggest      you may go
i don't need you to tell me what to do   exclaimed rostopchin angrily
he stood by the balcony door looking at the crowd
 this is what they have done with russia  this is what they have done with me   thought he  full of an irrepressible fury that welled up within him against the someone to whom what was happening might be attributed
as often happens with passionate people  he was mastered by anger but was still seeking an object on which to vent it
 here is that mob  the dregs of the people   he thought as he gazed at the crowd   this rabble they have roused by their folly  they want a victim   he thought as he looked at the tall lad flourishing his arm
and this thought occurred to him just because he himself desired a victim  something on which to vent his rage  is the carriage ready   he asked again
 yes  your excellency
what are your orders about vereshchagin  he is waiting at the porch   said the adjutant
 ah   exclaimed rostopchin  as if struck by an unexpected recollection
and rapidly opening the door he went resolutely out onto the balcony
the talking instantly ceased  hats and caps were doffed  and all eyes were raised to the count
 good morning  lads   said the count briskly and loudly
 thank you for coming
i'll come out to you in a moment  but we must first settle with the villain
we must punish the villain who has caused the ruin of moscow
wait for me   and the count stepped as briskly back into the room and slammed the door behind him
a murmur of approbation and satisfaction ran through the crowd
 he'll settle with all the villains  you'll see  and you said the french  
he'll show you what law is   the mob were saying as if reproving one another for their lack of confidence
a few minutes later an officer came hurriedly out of the front door  gave an order  and the dragoons formed up in line
the crowd moved eagerly from the balcony toward the porch
rostopchin  coming out there with quick angry steps  looked hastily around as if seeking someone
 where is he   he inquired
and as he spoke he saw a young man coming round the corner of the house between two dragoons
he had a long thin neck  and his head  that had been half shaved  was again covered by short hair
this young man was dressed in a threadbare blue cloth coat lined with fox fur  that had once been smart  and dirty hempen convict trousers  over which were pulled his thin  dirty  trodden down boots
on his thin  weak legs were heavy chains which hampered his irresolute movements
 ah   said rostopchin  hurriedly turning away his eyes from the young man in the fur lined coat and pointing to the bottom step of the porch
 put him there   the young man in his clattering chains stepped clumsily to the spot indicated  holding away with one finger the coat collar which chafed his neck  turned his long neck twice this way and that  sighed  and submissively folded before him his thin hands  unused to work for several seconds while the young man was taking his place on the step the silence continued
only among the back rows of the people  who were all pressing toward the one spot  could sighs  groans  and the shuffling of feet be heard
while waiting for the young man to take his place on the step rostopchin stood frowning and rubbing his face with his hand
 lads   said he  with a metallic ring in his voice
 this man  vereshchagin  is the scoundrel by whose doing moscow is perishing   the young man in the fur lined coat  stooping a little  stood in a submissive attitude  his fingers clasped before him
his emaciated young face  disfigured by the half shaven head  hung down hopelessly
at the count's first words he raised it slowly and looked up at him as if wishing to say something or at least to meet his eye
but rostopchin did not look at him
a vein in the young man's long thin neck swelled like a cord and went blue behind the ear  and suddenly his face flushed
all eyes were fixed on him
he looked at the crowd  and rendered more hopeful by the expression he read on the faces there  he smiled sadly and timidly  and lowering his head shifted his feet on the step
 he has betrayed his tsar and his country  he has gone over to bonaparte
he alone of all the russians has disgraced the russian name  he has caused moscow to perish   said rostopchin in a sharp  even voice  but suddenly he glanced down at vereshchagin who continued to stand in the same submissive attitude
as if inflamed by the sight  he raised his arm and addressed the people  almost shouting   deal with him as you think fit  i hand him over to you   the crowd remained silent and only pressed closer and closer to one another
to keep one another back  to breathe in that stifling atmosphere  to be unable to stir  and to await something unknown  uncomprehended  and terrible  was becoming unbearable
those standing in front  who had seen and heard what had taken place before them  all stood with wide open eyes and mouths  straining with all their strength  and held back the crowd that was pushing behind them
 beat him   
let the traitor perish and not disgrace the russian name   shouted rostopchin
 cut him down
i command it   hearing not so much the words as the angry tone of rostopchin's voice  the crowd moaned and heaved forward  but again paused
 count   exclaimed the timid yet theatrical voice of vereshchagin in the midst of the momentary silence that ensued   count  one god is above us both      he lifted his head and again the thick vein in his thin neck filled with blood and the color rapidly came and went in his face
he did not finish what he wished to say
 cut him down  i command it     shouted rostopchin  suddenly growing pale like vereshchagin
 draw sabers   cried the dragoon officer  drawing his own
another still stronger wave flowed through the crowd and reaching the front ranks carried it swaying to the very steps of the porch
the tall youth  with a stony look on his face  and rigid and uplifted arm  stood beside vereshchagin
 saber him   the dragoon officer almost whispered
and one of the soldiers  his face all at once distorted with fury  struck vereshchagin on the head with the blunt side of his saber
 ah   cried vereshchagin in meek surprise  looking round with a frightened glance as if not understanding why this was done to him
a similar moan of surprise and horror ran through the crowd
 o lord   exclaimed a sorrowful voice
but after the exclamation of surprise that had escaped from vereshchagin he uttered a plaintive cry of pain  and that cry was fatal
the barrier of human feeling  strained to the utmost  that had held the crowd in check suddenly broke
the crime had begun and must now be completed
the plaintive moan of reproach was drowned by the threatening and angry roar of the crowd
like the seventh and last wave that shatters a ship  that last irresistible wave burst from the rear and reached the front ranks  carrying them off their feet and engulfing them all
the dragoon was about to repeat his blow
vereshchagin with a cry of horror  covering his head with his hands  rushed toward the crowd
the tall youth  against whom he stumbled  seized his thin neck with his hands and  yelling wildly  fell with him under the feet of the pressing  struggling crowd
some beat and tore at vereshchagin  others at the tall youth
and the screams of those that were being trampled on and of those who tried to rescue the tall lad only increased the fury of the crowd it was a long time before the dragoons could extricate the bleeding youth  beaten almost to death
and for a long time  despite the feverish haste with which the mob tried to end the work that had been begun  those who were hitting  throttling  and tearing at vereshchagin were unable to kill him  for the crowd pressed from all sides  swaying as one mass with them in the center and rendering it impossible for them either to kill him or let him go
 hit him with an ax  eh   
crushed   
traitor  he sold christ   
still alive  
tenacious  
serves him right  torture serves a thief right
use the hatchet   
what still alive   only when the victim ceased to struggle and his cries changed to a longdrawn  measured death rattle did the crowd around his prostrate  bleeding corpse begin rapidly to change places
each one came up  glanced at what had been done  and with horror  reproach  and astonishment pushed back again
 o lord  the people are like wild beasts  how could he be alive   voices in the crowd could be heard saying
 quite a young fellow too  
must have been a merchant's son
what men   
and they say he's not the right one   
how not the right one   
o lord  and there's another has been beaten too they say he's nearly done for   
oh  the people  
aren't they afraid of sinning      said the same mob now  looking with pained distress at the dead body with its long  thin  half severed neck and its livid face stained with blood and dust
a painstaking police officer  considering the presence of a corpse in his excellency's courtyard unseemly  told the dragoons to take it away
two dragoons took it by its distorted legs and dragged it along the ground
the gory  dust stained  half shaven head with its long neck trailed twisting along the ground
the crowd shrank back from it
at the moment when vereshchagin fell and the crowd closed in with savage yells and swayed about him  rostopchin suddenly turned pale and  instead of going to the back entrance where his carriage awaited him  went with hurried steps and bent head  not knowing where and why  along the passage leading to the rooms on the ground floor the count's face was white and he could not control the feverish twitching of his lower jaw
 this way  your excellency  
where are you going   
this way  please     said a trembling  frightened voice behind him
count rostopchin was unable to reply and  turning obediently  went in the direction indicated
at the back entrance stood his caleche
the distant roar of the yelling crowd was audible even there
he hastily took his seat and told the coachman to drive him to his country house in sokolniki
when they reached the myasnitski street and could no longer hear the shouts of the mob  the count began to repent
he remembered with dissatisfaction the agitation and fear he had betrayed before his subordinates
 the mob is terrible disgusting   he said to himself in french  they are like wolves whom nothing but flesh can appease    count  one god is above us both    vereshchagin's words suddenly recurred to him  and a disagreeable shiver ran down his back
but this was only a momentary feeling and count rostopchin smiled disdainfully at himself  i had other duties   thought he
 the people had to be appeased
many other victims have perished and are perishing for the public good  and he began thinking of his social duties to his family and to the city entrusted to him  and of himself not himself as theodore vasilyevich rostopchin  he fancied that theodore vasilyevich rostopchin was sacrificing himself for the public good  but himself as governor  the representative of authority and of the tsar  had i been simply theodore vasilyevich my course of action would have been quite different  but it was my duty to safeguard my life and dignity as commander in chief   lightly swaying on the flexible springs of his carriage and no longer hearing the terrible sounds of the crowd  rostopchin grew physically calm and  as always happens  as soon as he became physically tranquil his mind devised reasons why he should be mentally tranquil too
the thought which tranquillized rostopchin was not a new one
since the world began and men have killed one another no one has ever committed such a crime against his fellow man without comforting himself with this same idea this idea is le bien public  the hypothetical welfare of other people
to a man not swayed by passion that welfare is never certain  but he who commits such a crime always knows just where that welfare lies
and rostopchin now knew it
not only did his reason not reproach him for what he had done  but he even found cause for self satisfaction in having so successfully contrived to avail himself of a convenient opportunity to punish a criminal and at the same time pacify the mob  vereshchagin was tried and condemned to death   thought rostopchin  though the senate had only condemned vereshchagin to hard labor    he was a traitor and a spy
i could not let him go unpunished and so i have killed two birds with one stone  to appease the mob i gave them a victim and at the same time punished a miscreant   having reached his country house and begun to give orders about domestic arrangements  the count grew quite tranquil
half an hour later he was driving with his fast horses across the sokolniki field  no longer thinking of what had occurred but considering what was to come
he was driving to the yauza bridge where he had heard that kutuzov was
count rostopchin was mentally preparing the angry and stinging reproaches he meant to address to kutuzov for his deception
he would make that foxy old courtier feel that the responsibility for all the calamities that would follow the abandonment of the city and the ruin of russia  as rostopchin regarded it  would fall upon his doting old head
planning beforehand what he would say to kutuzov  rostopchin turned angrily in his caleche and gazed sternly from side to side
the sokolniki field was deserted
only at the end of it  in front of the almshouse and the lunatic asylum  could be seen some people in white and others like them walking singly across the field shouting and gesticulating one of these was running to cross the path of count rostopchin's carriage  and the count himself  his coachman  and his dragoons looked with vague horror and curiosity at these released lunatics and especially at the one running toward them swaying from side to side on his long  thin legs in his fluttering dressing gown  this lunatic was running impetuously  his gaze fixed on rostopchin  shouting something in a hoarse voice and making signs to him to stop
the lunatic's solemn  gloomy face was thin and yellow  with its beard growing in uneven tufts
his black  agate pupils with saffron yellow whites moved restlessly near the lower eyelids
 stop  pull up  i tell you   he cried in a piercing voice  and again shouted something breathlessly with emphatic intonations and gestures
coming abreast of the caleche he ran beside it
 thrice have they slain me  thrice have i risen from the dead
they stoned me  crucified me  
i shall rise  
shall rise  
shall rise
they have torn my body
the kingdom of god will be overthrown  
thrice will i overthrow it and thrice re establish it   he cried  raising his voice higher and higher
count rostopchin suddenly grew pale as he had done when the crowd closed in on vereshchagin
he turned away
 go fas  
faster   he cried in a trembling voice to his coachman
the caleche flew over the ground as fast as the horses could draw it  but for a long time count rostopchin still heard the insane despairing screams growing fainter in the distance  while his eyes saw nothing but the astonished  frightened  bloodstained face of  the traitor  in the furlined coat recent as that mental picture was  rostopchin already felt that it had cut deep into his heart and drawn blood
even now he felt clearly that the gory trace of that recollection would not pass with time  but that the terrible memory would  on the contrary  dwell in his heart ever more cruelly and painfully to the end of his life
he seemed still to hear the sound of his own words   cut him down  i command it       why did i utter those words  it was by some accident i said them   
i need not have said them   he thought
 and then nothing would have happened   he saw the frightened and then infuriated face of the dragoon who dealt the blow  the look of silent  timid reproach that boy in the fur lined coat had turned upon him
 but i did not do it for my own sake
i was bound to act that way   
the mob  the traitor  
the public welfare   thought he
troops were still crowding at the yauza bridge
it was hot
kutuzov  dejected and frowning  sat on a bench by the bridge toying with his whip in the sand when a caleche dashed up noisily
a man in a general's uniform with plumes in his hat went up to kutuzov and said something in french
it was count rostopchin
he told kutuzov that he had come because moscow  the capital  was no more and only the army remained
 things would have been different if your serene highness had not told me that you would not abandon moscow without another battle  all this would not have happened   he said
kutuzov looked at rostopchin as if  not grasping what was said to him  he was trying to read something peculiar written at that moment on the face of the man addressing him
rostopchin grew confused and became silent
kutuzov slightly shook his head and not taking his penetrating gaze from rostopchin's face muttered softly   no  i shall not give up moscow without a battle   whether kutuzov was thinking of something entirely different when he spoke those words  or uttered them purposely  knowing them to be meaningless  at any rate rostopchin made no reply and hastily left him
and strange to say  the governor of moscow  the proud count rostopchin  took up a cossack whip and went to the bridge where he began with shouts to drive on the carts that blocked the way
toward four o'clock in the afternoon murat's troops were entering moscow
in front rode a detachment of wurttemberg hussars and behind them rode the king of naples himself accompanied by a numerous suite about the middle of the arbat street  near the church of the miraculous icon of st
nicholas  murat halted to await news from the advanced detachment as to the condition in which they had found the citadel  le kremlin
around murat gathered a group of those who had remained in moscow
they all stared in timid bewilderment at the strange  long haired commander dressed up in feathers and gold
 is that their tsar himself  he's not bad   low voices could be heard saying an interpreter rode up to the group
 take off your cap  
your caps   these words went from one to another in the crowd
the interpreter addressed an old porter and asked if it was far to the kremlin
the porter  listening in perplexity to the unfamiliar polish accent and not realizing that the interpreter was speaking russian  did not understand what was being said to him and slipped behind the others
murat approached the interpreter and told him to ask where the russian army was
one of the russians understood what was asked and several voices at once began answering the interpreter
a french officer  returning from the advanced detachment  rode up to murat and reported that the gates of the citadel had been barricaded and that there was probably an ambuscade there
 good   said murat and  turning to one of the gentlemen in his suite  ordered four light guns to be moved forward to fire at the gates
the guns emerged at a trot from the column following murat and advanced up the arbat
when they reached the end of the vozdvizhenka street they halted and drew in the square
several french officers superintended the placing of the guns and looked at the kremlin through field glasses
the bells in the kremlin were ringing for vespers  and this sound troubled the french
they imagined it to be a call to arms a few infantrymen ran to the kutafyev gate
beams and wooden screens had been put there  and two musket shots rang out from under the gate as soon as an officer and men began to run toward it a general who was standing by the guns shouted some words of command to the officer  and the latter ran back again with his men
the sound of three more shots came from the gate
one shot struck a french soldier's foot  and from behind the screens came the strange sound of a few voices shouting
instantly as at a word of command the expression of cheerful serenity on the faces of the french general  officers  and men changed to one of determined concentrated readiness for strife and suffering
to all of them from the marshal to the least soldier  that place was not the vozdvizhenka  mokhavaya  or kutafyev street  nor the troitsa gate  places familiar in moscow   but a new battlefield which would probably prove sanguinary
and all made ready for that battle
the cries from the gates ceased
the guns were advanced  the artillerymen blew the ash off their linstocks  and an officer gave the word  fire   this was followed by two whistling sounds of canister shot  one after another
the shot rattled against the stone of the gate and upon the wooden beams and screens  and two wavering clouds of smoke rose over the square a few instants after the echo of the reports resounding over the stone built kremlin had died away the french heard a strange sound above their head
thousands of crows rose above the walls and circled in the air  cawing and noisily flapping their wings
together with that sound came a solitary human cry from the gateway and amid the smoke appeared the figure of a bareheaded man in a peasant's coat
he grasped a musket and took aim at the french
 fire   repeated the officer once more  and the reports of a musket and of two cannon shots were heard simultaneously
the gate was again hidden by smoke
nothing more stirred behind the screens and the french infantry soldiers and officers advanced to the gate
in the gateway lay three wounded and four dead
two men in peasant coats ran away at the foot of the wall  toward the znamenka
 clear that away   said the officer  pointing to the beams and the corpses  and the french soldiers  after dispatching the wounded  threw the corpses over the parapet who these men were nobody knew
 clear that away   was all that was said of them  and they were thrown over the parapet and removed later on that they might not stink
thiers alone dedicates a few eloquent lines to their memory   these wretches had occupied the sacred citadel  having supplied themselves with guns from the arsenal  and fired   the wretches   at the french some of them were sabered and the kremlin was purged of their presence   murat was informed that the way had been cleared the french entered the gates and began pitching their camp in the senate square
out of the windows of the senate house the soldiers threw chairs into the square for fuel and kindled fires there
other detachments passed through the kremlin and encamped along the moroseyka  the lubyanka  and pokrovka streets
others quartered themselves along the vozdvizhenka  the nikolski  and the tverskoy streets no masters of the houses being found anywhere  the french were not billeted on the inhabitants as is usual in towns but lived in it as in a camp
though tattered  hungry  worn out  and reduced to a third of their original number  the french entered moscow in good marching order
it was a weary and famished  but still a fighting and menacing army
but it remained an army only until its soldiers had dispersed into their different lodgings
as soon as the men of the various regiments began to disperse among the wealthy and deserted houses  the army was lost forever and there came into being something nondescript  neither citizens nor soldiers but what are known as marauders
when five weeks later these same men left moscow  they no longer formed an army
they were a mob of marauders  each carrying a quantity of articles which seemed to him valuable or useful
the aim of each man when he left moscow was no longer  as it had been  to conquer  but merely to keep what he had acquired
like a monkey which puts its paw into the narrow neck of a jug  and having seized a handful of nuts will not open its fist for fear of losing what it holds  and therefore perishes  the french when they left moscow had inevitably to perish because they carried their loot with them  yet to abandon what they had stolen was as impossible for them as it is for the monkey to open its paw and let go of its nuts
ten minutes after each regiment had entered a moscow district  not a soldier or officer was left
men in military uniforms and hessian boots could be seen through the windows  laughing and walking through the rooms in cellars and storerooms similar men were busy among the provisions  and in the yards unlocking or breaking open coach house and stable doors  lighting fires in kitchens and kneading and baking bread with rolled up sleeves  and cooking  or frightening  amusing  or caressing women and children there were many such men both in the shops and houses but there was no army
order after order was issued by the french commanders that day forbidding the men to disperse about the town  sternly forbidding any violence to the inhabitants or any looting  and announcing a roll call for that very evening
but despite all these measures the men  who had till then constituted an army  flowed all over the wealthy  deserted city with its comforts and plentiful supplies
as a hungry herd of cattle keeps well together when crossing a barren field  but gets out of hand and at once disperses uncontrollably as soon as it reaches rich pastures  so did the army disperse all over the wealthy city
no residents were left in moscow  and the soldiers like water percolating through sand spread irresistibly through the city in all directions from the kremlin into which they had first marched
the cavalry  on entering a merchant's house that had been abandoned and finding there stabling more than sufficient for their horses  went on  all the same  to the next house which seemed to them better
many of them appropriated several houses  chalked their names on them  and quarreled and even fought with other companies for them
before they had had time to secure quarters the soldiers ran out into the streets to see the city and  hearing that everything had been abandoned  rushed to places where valuables were to be had for the taking
the officers followed to check the soldiers and were involuntarily drawn into doing the same
in carriage row carriages had been left in the shops  and generals flocked there to select caleches and coaches for themselves the few inhabitants who had remained invited commanding officers to their houses  hoping thereby to secure themselves from being plundered there were masses of wealth and there seemed no end to it
all around the quarters occupied by the french were other regions still unexplored and unoccupied where  they thought  yet greater riches might be found
and moscow engulfed the army ever deeper and deeper
when water is spilled on dry ground both the dry ground and the water disappear and mud results  and in the same way the entry of the famished army into the rich and deserted city resulted in fires and looting and the destruction of both the army and the wealthy city
the french attributed the fire of moscow au patriotisme feroce de rostopchine  * the russians to the barbarity of the french
in reality  however  it was not  and could not be  possible to explain the burning of moscow by making any individual  or any group of people  responsible for it
moscow was burned because it found itself in a position in which any town built of wood was bound to burn  quite apart from whether it had  or had not  a hundred and thirty inferior fire engines
deserted moscow had to burn as inevitably as a heap of shavings has to burn on which sparks continually fall for several days
a town built of wood  where scarcely a day passes without conflagrations when the house owners are in residence and a police force is present  cannot help burning when its inhabitants have left it and it is occupied by soldiers who smoke pipes  make campfires of the senate chairs in the senate square  and cook themselves meals twice a day in peacetime it is only necessary to billet troops in the villages of any district and the number of fires in that district immediately increases
how much then must the probability of fire be increased in an abandoned  wooden town where foreign troops are quartered
 le patriotisme feroce de rostopchine  and the barbarity of the french were not to blame in the matter
moscow was set on fire by the soldiers' pipes  kitchens  and campfires  and by the carelessness of enemy soldiers occupying houses they did not own
even if there was any arson  which is very doubtful  for no one had any reason to burn the houses in any case a troublesome and dangerous thing to do   arson cannot be regarded as the cause  for the same thing would have happened without any incendiarism
* to rostopchin's ferocious patriotism
however tempting it might be for the french to blame rostopchin's ferocity and for russians to blame the scoundrel bonaparte  or later on to place an heroic torch in the hands of their own people  it is impossible not to see that there could be no such direct cause of the fire  for moscow had to burn as every village  factory  or house must burn which is left by its owners and in which strangers are allowed to live and cook their porridge
moscow was burned by its inhabitants  it is true  but by those who had abandoned it and not by those who remained in it
moscow when occupied by the enemy did not remain intact like berlin  vienna  and other towns  simply because its inhabitants abandoned it and did not welcome the french with bread and salt  nor bring them the keys of the city
the absorption of the french by moscow  radiating starwise as it did  only reached the quarter where pierre was staying by the evening of the second of september
after the last two days spent in solitude and unusual circumstances  pierre was in a state bordering on insanity he was completely obsessed by one persistent thought
he did not know how or when this thought had taken such possession of him  but he remembered nothing of the past  understood nothing of the present  and all he saw and heard appeared to him like a dream
he had left home only to escape the intricate tangle of life's demands that enmeshed him  and which in his present condition he was unable to unravel
he had gone to joseph alexeevich's house  on the plea of sorting the his mind the memory of joseph alexeevich was connected with a world of eternal  solemn  and calm thoughts  quite contrary to the restless confusion into which he felt himself being drawn he sought a quiet refuge  and in joseph alexeevich's study he really found it
when he sat with his elbows on the dusty writing table in the deathlike stillness of the study  calm and significant memories of the last few days rose one after another in his imagination  particularly of the battle of borodino and of that vague sense of his own insignificance and insincerity compared with the truth  simplicity  and strength of the class of men he mentally classed as they
when gerasim roused him from his reverie the idea occurred to him of taking part in the popular defense of moscow which he knew was projected
and with that object he had asked gerasim to get him a peasant's coat and a pistol  confiding to him his intentions of remaining in joseph alexeevich's house and keeping his name secret
then during the first day spent in inaction and solitude  he tried several times to fix his attention on the masonic manuscripts  but was unable to do so  the idea that had previously occurred to him of the cabalistic significance of his name in connection with bonaparte's more than once vaguely presented itself
but the idea that he  l'russe besuhof  was destined to set a limit to the power of the beast was as yet only one of the fancies that often passed through his mind and left no trace behind
when  having bought the coat merely with the object of taking part among the people in the defense of moscow  pierre had met the rostovs and natasha had said to him   are you remaining in moscow   
how splendid   the thought flashed into his mind that it really would be a good thing  even if moscow were taken  for him to remain there and do what he was predestined to do
next day  with the sole idea of not sparing himself and not lagging in any way behind them  pierre went to the three hills gate but when he returned to the house convinced that moscow would not be defended  he suddenly felt that what before had seemed to him merely a possibility had now become absolutely necessary and inevitable
he must remain in moscow  concealing his name  and must meet napoleon and kill him  and either perish or put an end to the misery of all europe which it seemed to him was solely due to napoleon
pierre knew all the details of the attempt on bonaparte's life in 1809 by a german student in vienna  and knew that the student had been shot
and the risk to which he would expose his life by carrying out his design excited him still more
two equally strong feelings drew pierre irresistibly to this purpose
the first was a feeling of the necessity of sacrifice and suffering in view of the common calamity  the same feeling that had caused him to go to mozhaysk on the twenty fifth and to make his way to the very thick of the battle and had now caused him to run away from his home and  in place of the luxury and comfort to which he was accustomed  to sleep on a hard sofa without undressing and eat the same food as gerasim
the other was that vague and quite russian feeling of contempt for everything conventional  artificial  and human for everything the majority of men regard as the greatest good in the world
pierre had first experienced this strange and fascinating feeling at the sloboda palace  when he had suddenly felt that wealth  power  and life all that men so painstakingly acquire and guard if it has any worth has so only by reason of the joy with which it can all be renounced
it was the feeling that induces a volunteer recruit to spend his last penny on drink  and a drunken man to smash mirrors or glasses for no apparent reason and knowing that it will cost him all the money he possesses  the feeling which causes a man to perform actions which from an ordinary point of view are insane  to test  as it were  his personal power and strength  affirming the existence of a higher  nonhuman criterion of life
from the very day pierre had experienced this feeling for the first time at the sloboda palace he had been continuously under its influence  but only now found full satisfaction for it
moreover  at this moment pierre was supported in his design and prevented from renouncing it by what he had already done in that direction
if he were now to leave moscow like everyone else  his flight from home  the peasant coat  the pistol  and his announcement to the rostovs that he would remain in moscow would all become not merely meaningless but contemptible and ridiculous  and to this pierre was very sensitive
pierre's physical condition  as is always the case  corresponded to his mental state
the unaccustomed coarse food  the vodka he drank during those days  the absence of wine and cigars  his dirty unchanged linen  two almost sleepless nights passed on a short sofa without bedding all this kept him in a state of excitement bordering on insanity
it was two o'clock in the afternoon
the french had already entered moscow
pierre knew this  but instead of acting he only thought about his undertaking  going over its minutest details in his mind
in his fancy he did not clearly picture to himself either the striking of the blow or the death of napoleon  but with extraordinary vividness and melancholy enjoyment imagined his own destruction and heroic endurance  yes  alone  for the sake of all  i must do it or perish   he thought
 yes  i will approach  
and then suddenly  
with pistol or dagger  but that is all the same  'it is not i but the hand of providence that punishes thee ' i shall say   thought he  imagining what he would say when killing napoleon
 well then  take me and execute me   he went on  speaking to himself and bowing his head with a sad but firm expression while pierre  standing in the middle of the room  was talking to himself in this way  the study door opened and on the threshold appeared the figure of makar alexeevich  always so timid before but now quite transformed his dressing gown was unfastened  his face red and distorted
he was obviously drunk
on seeing pierre he grew confused at first  but noticing embarrassment on pierre's face immediately grew bold and  staggering on his thin legs  advanced into the middle of the room
 they're frightened   he said confidentially in a hoarse voice
 i say i won't surrender  i say  
am i not right  sir   he paused and then suddenly seeing the pistol on the table seized it with unexpected rapidity and ran out into the corridor
gerasim and the porter  who had followed makar alexeevich  stopped him in the vestibule and tried to take the pistol from him
pierre  coming out into the corridor  looked with pity and repulsion at the half crazy old man
makar alexeevich  frowning with exertion  held on to the pistol and screamed hoarsely  evidently with some heroic fancy in his head
 to arms  board them  no  you shan't get it   he yelled  that will do  please  that will do
have the goodness please  sir  to let go  please  sir     pleaded gerasim  trying carefully to steer makar alexeevich by the elbows back to the door
 who are you  bonaparte      shouted makar alexeevich
 that's not right  sir
come to your room  please  and rest
allow me to have the pistol    be off  thou base slave  touch me not  see this   shouted makar alexeevich  brandishing the pistol
 board them    catch hold   whispered gerasim to the porter
they seized makar alexeevich by the arms and dragged him to the door the vestibule was filled with the discordant sounds of a struggle and of a tipsy  hoarse voice
suddenly a fresh sound  a piercing feminine scream  reverberated from the porch and the cook came running into the vestibule
 it's them  gracious heavens  o lord  four of them  horsemen   she cried
gerasim and the porter let makar alexeevich go  and in the now silent corridor the sound of several hands knocking at the front door could be heard
pierre  having decided that until he had carried out his design he would disclose neither his identity nor his knowledge of french  stood at the halfopen door of the corridor  intending to conceal himself as soon as the french entered but the french entered and still pierre did not retire an irresistible curiosity kept him there
there were two of them
one was an officer a tall  soldierly  handsome man  the other evidently a private or an orderly  sunburned  short  and thin  with sunken cheeks and a dull expression
the officer walked in front  leaning on a stick and slightly limping
when he had advanced a few steps he stopped  having apparently decided that these were good quarters  turned round to the soldiers standing at the entrance  and in a loud voice of command ordered them to put up the horses
having done that  the officer  lifting his elbow with a smart gesture  stroked his mustache and lightly touched his hat
 bonjour  la compagnie   * said he gaily  smiling and looking about him
*  good day  everybody   no one gave any reply
 vous etes le bourgeois   * the officer asked gerasim
*  are you the master here   gerasim gazed at the officer with an alarmed and inquiring look
 quartier  quartier  logement   said the officer  looking down at the little man with a condescending and good natured smile
 les francais sont de bons enfants
que diable  voyons  ne nous fachons pas  mon vieux   * added he  clapping the scared and silent gerasim on the shoulder
 well  does no one speak french in this establishment   he asked again in french  looking around and meeting pierre's eyes
pierre moved away from the door
*  quarters  quarters  lodgings  the french are good fellows
what the devil  there  don't let us be cross  old fellow   again the officer turned to gerasim and asked him to show him the rooms in the house  master  not here don't understand  
me  you     said gerasim  trying to render his words more comprehensible by contorting them
still smiling  the french officer spread out his hands before gerasim's nose  intimating that he did not understand him either  and moved  limping  to the door at which pierre was standing
pierre wished to go away and conceal himself  but at that moment he saw makar alexeevich appearing at the open kitchen door with the pistol in his hand with a madman's cunning  makar alexeevich eyed the frenchman  raised his pistol  and took aim
 board them   yelled the tipsy man  trying to press the trigger
hearing the yell the officer turned round  and at the same moment pierre threw himself on the drunkard just when pierre snatched at and struck up the pistol makar alexeevich at last got his fingers on the trigger  there was a deafening report  and all were enveloped in a cloud of smoke
the frenchman turned pale and rushed to the door
forgetting his intention of concealing his knowledge of french  pierre  snatching away the pistol and throwing it down  ran up to the officer and addressed him in french
 you are not wounded   he asked
 i think not   answered the frenchman  feeling himself over  but i have had a lucky escape this time   he added  pointing to the damaged plaster of the wall
 who is that man   said he  looking sternly at pierre
 oh  i am really in despair at what has occurred   said pierre rapidly  quite forgetting the part he had intended to play
 he is an unfortunate madman who did not know what he was doing   the officer went up to makar alexeevich and took him by the collar
makar alexeevich was standing with parted lips  swaying  as if about to fall asleep  as he leaned against the wall
 brigand  you shall pay for this   said the frenchman  letting go of him
 we french are merciful after victory  but we do not pardon traitors   he added  with a look of gloomy dignity and a fine energetic gesture
pierre continued  in french  to persuade the officer not to hold that drunken imbecile to account
the frenchman listened in silence with the same gloomy expression  but suddenly turned to pierre with a smile
for a few seconds he looked at him in silence
his handsome face assumed a melodramatically gentle expression and he held out his hand
 you have saved my life
you are french   said he
for a frenchman that deduction was indubitable
only a frenchman could perform a great deed  and to save his life the life of m
ramballe  captain of the 13th light regiment was undoubtedly a very great deed
but however indubitable that conclusion and the officer's conviction based upon it  pierre felt it necessary to disillusion him
 i am russian   he said quickly
 tut  tut  tut  tell that to others   said the officer  waving his finger before his nose and smiling
 you shall tell me all about that presently
i am delighted to meet a compatriot
well  and what are we to do with this man   he added  addressing himself to pierre as to a brother even if pierre were not a frenchman  having once received that loftiest of human appellations he could not renounce it  said the officer's look and tone
in reply to his last question pierre again explained who makar alexeevich was and how just before their arrival that drunken imbecile had seized the loaded pistol which they had not had time to recover from him  and begged the officer to let the deed go unpunished
the frenchman expanded his chest and made a majestic gesture with his arm
 you have saved my life  you are french
you ask his pardon  i grant it you
lead that man away   said he quickly and energetically  and taking the arm of pierre whom he had promoted to be a frenchman for saving his life  he went with him into the room
the soldiers in the yard  hearing the shot  came into the passage asking what had happened  and expressed their readiness to punish the culprits  but the officer sternly checked them
 you will be called in when you are wanted   he said
the soldiers went out again  and the orderly  who had meanwhile had time to visit the kitchen  came up to his officer
 captain  there is soup and a leg of mutton in the kitchen   said he
 shall i serve them up    yes  and some wine   answered the captain
when the french officer went into the room with pierre the latter again thought it his duty to assure him that he was not french and wished to go away  but the officer would not hear of it
he was so very polite  amiable  good natured  and genuinely grateful to pierre for saving his life that pierre had not the heart to refuse  and sat down with him in the parlor the first room they entered
to pierre's assurances that he was not a frenchman  the captain  evidently not understanding how anyone could decline so flattering an appellation  shrugged his shoulders and said that if pierre absolutely insisted on passing for a russian let it be so  but for all that he would be forever bound to pierre by gratitude for saving his life
had this man been endowed with the slightest capacity for perceiving the feelings of others  and had he at all understood what pierre's feelings were  the latter would probably have left him  but the man's animated obtuseness to everything other than himself disarmed pierre  a frenchman or a russian prince incognito   said the officer  looking at pierre's fine though dirty linen and at the ring on his finger
 i owe my life to you and offer you my friendship
a frenchman never forgets either an insult or a service
i offer you my friendship
that is all i can say   there was so much good nature and nobility  in the french sense of the word  in the officer's voice  in the expression of his face and in his gestures  that pierre  unconsciously smiling in response to the frenchman's smile  pressed the hand held out to him
 captain ramballe  of the 13th light regiment  chevalier of the legion of honor for the affair on the seventh of september   he introduced himself  a self satisfied irrepressible smile puckering his lips under his mustache  will you now be so good as to tell me with whom i have the honor of conversing so pleasantly  instead of being in the ambulance with that maniac's bullet in my body   pierre replied that he could not tell him his name and  blushing  began to try to invent a name and to say something about his reason for concealing it  but the frenchman hastily interrupted him
 oh  please   said he
 i understand your reasons
you are an officer  
a superior officer perhaps
you have borne arms against us that's not my business
i owe you my life
that is enough for me
i am quite at your service
you belong to the gentry   he concluded with a shade of inquiry in his tone
pierre bent his head
 your baptismal name  if you please
that is all i ask
monsieur pierre  you say   
that's all i want to know   when the mutton and an omelet had been served and a samovar and vodka brought  with some wine which the french had taken from a russian cellar and brought with them  ramballe invited pierre to share his dinner  and himself began to eat greedily and quickly like a healthy and hungry man  munching his food rapidly with his strong teeth  continually smacking his lips  and repeating  excellent  delicious   his face grew red and was covered with perspiration pierre was hungry and shared the dinner with pleasure
morel  the orderly  brought some hot water in a saucepan and placed a bottle of claret in it
he also brought a bottle of kvass  taken from the kitchen for them to try
that beverage was already known to the french and had been given a special name
they called it limonade de cochon  pig's lemonade   and morel spoke well of the limonade de cochon he had found in the kitchen
but as the captain had the wine they had taken while passing through moscow  he left the kvass to morel and applied himself to the bottle of bordeaux he wrapped the bottle up to its neck in a table napkin and poured out wine for himself and for pierre the satisfaction of his hunger and the wine rendered the captain still more lively and he chatted incessantly all through dinner
 yes  my dear monsieur pierre  i owe you a fine votive candle for saving me from that maniac   
you see  i have bullets enough in my body already
here is one i got at wagram   he touched his side   and a second at smolensk  he showed a scar on his cheek  and this leg which as you see does not want to march  i got that on the seventh at the great battle of la moskowa
sacre dieu  it was splendid  that deluge of fire was worth seeing
it was a tough job you set us there  my word  you may be proud of it  and on my honor  in spite of the cough i caught there  i should be ready to begin again
i pity those who did not see it    i was there   said pierre
 bah  really  so much the better  you are certainly brave foes
the great redoubt held out well  by my pipe   continued the frenchman
 and you made us pay dear for it
i was at it three times sure as i sit here
three times we reached the guns and three times we were thrown back like cardboard figures
oh  it was beautiful  monsieur pierre  your grenadiers were splendid  by heaven  i saw them close up their ranks six times in succession and march as if on parade
fine fellows  our king of naples  who knows what's what  cried 'bravo ' ha  ha  so you are one of us soldiers   he added  smiling  after a momentary pause
 so much the better  so much the better  monsieur pierre  terrible in battle  
gallant  
with the fair   he winked and smiled    that's what the french are  monsieur pierre  aren't they   the captain was so naively and good humoredly gay  so real  and so pleased with himself that pierre almost winked back as he looked merrily at him probably the word  gallant  turned the captain's thoughts to the state of moscow
 apropos  tell me please  is it true that the women have all left moscow  what a queer idea  what had they to be afraid of    would not the french ladies leave paris if the russians entered it   asked pierre
 ha  ha  ha   the frenchman emitted a merry  sanguine chuckle  patting pierre on the shoulder
 what a thing to say   he exclaimed
 paris   
but paris  paris      paris the capital of the world   pierre finished his remark for him
the captain looked at pierre
he had a habit of stopping short in the middle of his talk and gazing intently with his laughing  kindly eyes
 well  if you hadn't told me you were russian  i should have wagered that you were parisian  you have that  
i don't know what  that     and having uttered this compliment  he again gazed at him in silence
 i have been in paris
i spent years there   said pierre
 oh yes  one sees that plainly
paris   
a man who doesn't know paris is a savage
you can tell a parisian two leagues off
paris is talma  la duchenois  potier  the sorbonne  the boulevards   and noticing that his conclusion was weaker than what had gone before  he added quickly   there is only one paris in the world
you have been to paris and have remained russian
well  i don't esteem you the less for it   under the influence of the wine he had drunk  and after the days he had spent alone with his depressing thoughts  pierre involuntarily enjoyed talking with this cheerful and good natured man
 to return to your ladies i hear they are lovely
what a wretched idea to go and bury themselves in the steppes when the french army is in moscow what a chance those girls have missed  your peasants  now that's another thing  but you civilized people  you ought to know us better than that we took vienna  berlin  madrid  naples  rome  warsaw  all the world's capitals   
we are feared  but we are loved
we are nice to know
and then the emperor     he began  but pierre interrupted him
 the emperor   pierre repeated  and his face suddenly became sad and embarrassed   is the emperor       the emperor  he is generosity  mercy  justice  order  genius that's what the emperor is  it is i  ramballe  who tell you so   
i assure you i was his enemy eight years ago
my father was an emigrant count   
but that man has vanquished me
he has taken hold of me
i could not resist the sight of the grandeur and glory with which he has covered france
when i understood what he wanted when i saw that he was preparing a bed of laurels for us  you know  i said to myself  'that is a monarch ' and i devoted myself to him  so there  oh yes  mon cher  he is the greatest man of the ages past or future    is he in moscow   pierre stammered with a guilty look
the frenchman looked at his guilty face and smiled
 no  he will make his entry tomorrow   he replied  and continued his talk
their conversation was interrupted by the cries of several voices at the gate and by morel  who came to say that some wurttemberg hussars had come and wanted to put up their horses in the yard where the captain's horses were
this difficulty had arisen chiefly because the hussars did not understand what was said to them in french
the captain had their senior sergeant called in  and in a stern voice asked him to what regiment he belonged  who was his commanding officer  and by what right he allowed himself to claim quarters that were already occupied the german who knew little french  answered the two first questions by giving the names of his regiment and of his commanding officer  but in reply to the third question which he did not understand said  introducing broken french into his own german  that he was the quartermaster of the regiment and his commander had ordered him to occupy all the houses one after another
pierre  who knew german  translated what the german said to the captain and gave the captain's reply to the wurttemberg hussar in german
when he had understood what was said to him  the german submitted and took his men elsewhere
the captain went out into the porch and gave some orders in a loud voice
when he returned to the room pierre was sitting in the same place as before  with his head in his hands
his face expressed suffering
he really was suffering at that moment
when the captain went out and he was left alone  suddenly he came to himself and realized the position he was in it was not that moscow had been taken or that the happy conquerors were masters in it and were patronizing him
painful as that was it was not that which tormented pierre at the moment
he was tormented by the consciousness of his own weakness
the few glasses of wine he had drunk and the conversation with this good natured man had destroyed the mood of concentrated gloom in which he had spent the last few days and which was essential for the execution of his design
the pistol  dagger  and peasant coat were ready
napoleon was to enter the town next day
pierre still considered that it would be a useful and worthy action to slay the evildoer  but now he felt that he would not do it
he did not know why  but he felt a foreboding that he would not carry out his intention
he struggled against the confession of his weakness but dimly felt that he could not overcome it and that his former gloomy frame of mind  concerning vengeance  killing  and self sacrifice  had been dispersed like dust by contact with the first man he met
the captain returned to the room  limping slightly and whistling a tune
the frenchman's chatter which had previously amused pierre now repelled him
the tune he was whistling  his gait  and the gesture with which he twirled his mustache  all now seemed offensive
 i will go away immediately
i won't say another word to him   thought pierre
he thought this  but still sat in the same place
a strange feeling of weakness tied him to the spot  he wished to get up and go away  but could not do so
the captain  on the other hand  seemed very cheerful
he paced up and down the room twice
his eyes shone and his mustache twitched as if he were smiling to himself at some amusing thought  the colonel of those wurttembergers is delightful   he suddenly said
 he's a german  but a nice fellow all the same   
but he's a german   he sat down facing pierre
 by the way  you know german  then   pierre looked at him in silence
 what is the german for 'shelter'    shelter   pierre repeated
 the german for shelter is unterkunft    how do you say it   the captain asked quickly and doubtfully
 unterkunft   pierre repeated
 onterkoff   said the captain and looked at pierre for some seconds with laughing eyes
 these germans are first rate fools  don't you think so  monsieur pierre   he concluded
 well  let's have another bottle of this moscow bordeaux  shall we  morel will warm us up another little bottle
morel   he called out gaily
morel brought candles and a bottle of wine
the captain looked at pierre by the candlelight and was evidently struck by the troubled expression on his companion's face
ramballe  with genuine distress and sympathy in his face  went up to pierre and bent over him
 there now  we're sad   said he  touching pierre's hand
 have i upset you  no  really  have you anything against me   he asked pierre
 perhaps it's the state of affairs   pierre did not answer  but looked cordially into the frenchman's eyes whose expression of sympathy was pleasing to him
 honestly  without speaking of what i owe you  i feel friendship for you
can i do anything for you  dispose of me
it is for life and death
i say it with my hand on my heart   said he  striking his chest
 thank you   said pierre
the captain gazed intently at him as he had done when he learned that  shelter  was unterkunft in german  and his face suddenly brightened
 well  in that case  i drink to our friendship   he cried gaily  filling two glasses with wine
pierre took one of the glasses and emptied it
ramballe emptied his too  again pressed pierre's hand  and leaned his elbows on the table in a pensive attitude
 yes  my dear friend   he began   such is fortune's caprice
who would have said that i should be a soldier and a captain of dragoons in the service of bonaparte  as we used to call him  yet here i am in moscow with him
i must tell you  mon cher   he continued in the sad and measured tones of a man who intends to tell a long story   that our name is one of the most ancient in france   and with a frenchman's easy and naive frankness the captain told pierre the story of his ancestors  his childhood  youth  and manhood  and all about his relations and his financial and family affairs   ma pauvre mere  playing of course an important part in the story
 but all that is only life's setting  the real thing is love love  am i not right  monsieur pierre   said he  growing animated
 another glass   pierre again emptied his glass and poured himself out a third  oh  women  women   and the captain  looking with glistening eyes at pierre  began talking of love and of his love affairs
there were very many of these  as one could easily believe  looking at the officer's handsome  self satisfied face  and noting the eager enthusiasm with which he spoke of women
though all ramballe's love stories had the sensual character which frenchmen regard as the special charm and poetry of love  yet he told his story with such sincere conviction that he alone had experienced and known all the charm of love and he described women so alluringly that pierre listened to him with curiosity
it was plain that l'amour which the frenchman was so fond of was not that low and simple kind that pierre had once felt for his wife  nor was it the romantic love stimulated by himself that he experienced for natasha  ramballe despised both these kinds of love equally  the one he considered the  love of clodhoppers  and the other the  love of simpletons    l'amour which the frenchman worshiped consisted principally in the unnaturalness of his relation to the woman and in a combination of incongruities giving the chief charm to the feeling
thus the captain touchingly recounted the story of his love for a fascinating marquise of thirty five and at the same time for a charming  innocent child of seventeen  daughter of the bewitching marquise
the conflict of magnanimity between the mother and the daughter  ending in the mother's sacrificing herself and offering her daughter in marriage to her lover  even now agitated the captain  though it was the memory of a distant past
then he recounted an episode in which the husband played the part of the lover  and he the lover  assumed the role of the husband  as well as several droll incidents from his recollections of germany  where  shelter  is called unterkunft and where the husbands eat sauerkraut and the young girls are  too blonde   finally  the latest episode in poland still fresh in the captain's memory  and which he narrated with rapid gestures and glowing face  was of how he had saved the life of a pole  in general  the saving of life continually occurred in the captain's stories  and the pole had entrusted to him his enchanting wife  parisienne de coeur  while himself entering the french service the captain was happy  the enchanting polish lady wished to elope with him  but  prompted by magnanimity  the captain restored the wife to the husband  saying as he did so   i have saved your life  and i save your honor   having repeated these words the captain wiped his eyes and gave himself a shake  as if driving away the weakness which assailed him at this touching recollection listening to the captain's tales  pierre as often happens late in the evening and under the influence of wine followed all that was told him  understood it all  and at the same time followed a train of personal memories which  he knew not why  suddenly arose in his mind
while listening to these love stories his own love for natasha unexpectedly rose to his mind  and going over the pictures of that love in his imagination he mentally compared them with ramballe's tales
listening to the story of the struggle between love and duty  pierre saw before his eyes every minutest detail of his last meeting with the object of his love at the sukharev water tower
at the time of that meeting it had not produced an effect upon him he had not even once recalled it
but now it seemed to him that that meeting had had in it something very important and poetic
 peter kirilovich  come here  we have recognized you   he now seemed to hear the words she had uttered and to see before him her eyes  her smile  her traveling hood  and a stray lock of her hair  
and there seemed to him something pathetic and touching in all this
having finished his tale about the enchanting polish lady  the captain asked pierre if he had ever experienced a similar impulse to sacrifice himself for love and a feeling of envy of the legitimate husband challenged by this question pierre raised his head and felt a need to express the thoughts that filled his mind
he began to explain that he understood love for a women somewhat differently
he said that in all his life he had loved and still loved only one woman  and that she could never be his
 tiens   said the captain
pierre then explained that he had loved this woman from his earliest years  but that he had not dared to think of her because she was too young  and because he had been an illegitimate son without a name
afterwards when he had received a name and wealth he dared not think of her because he loved her too well  placing her far above everything in the world  and especially therefore above himself when he had reached this point  pierre asked the captain whether he understood that
the captain made a gesture signifying that even if he did not understand it he begged pierre to continue
 platonic love  clouds     he muttered
whether it was the wine he had drunk  or an impulse of frankness  or the thought that this man did not  and never would  know any of those who played a part in his story  or whether it was all these things together  something loosened pierre's tongue
speaking thickly and with a faraway look in his shining eyes  he told the whole story of his life  his marriage  natasha's love for his best friend  her betrayal of him  and all his own simple relations with her
urged on by ramballe's questions he also told what he had at first concealed his own position and even his name
more than anything else in pierre's story the captain was impressed by the fact that pierre was very rich  had two mansions in moscow  and that he had abandoned everything and not left the city  but remained there concealing his name and station
when it was late at night they went out together into the street
the night was warm and light
to the left of the house on the pokrovka a fire glowed the first of those that were beginning in moscow
to the right and high up in the sky was the sickle of the waning moon and opposite to it hung that bright comet which was connected in pierre's heart with his love
at the gate stood gerasim  the cook  and two frenchmen
their laughter and their mutually incomprehensible remarks in two languages could be heard
they were looking at the glow seen in the town
there was nothing terrible in the one small  distant fire in the immense city
gazing at the high starry sky  at the moon  at the comet  and at the glow from the fire  pierre experienced a joyful emotion
 there now  how good it is  what more does one need   thought he
and suddenly remembering his intention he grew dizzy and felt so faint that he leaned against the fence to save himself from falling without taking leave of his new friend  pierre left the gate with unsteady steps and returning to his room lay down on the sofa and immediately fell asleep
the glow of the first fire that began on the second of september was watched from the various roads by the fugitive muscovites and by the retreating troops  with many different feelings
the rostov party spent the night at mytishchi  fourteen miles from moscow
they had started so late on the first of september  the road had been so blocked by vehicles and troops  so many things had been forgotten for which servants were sent back  that they had decided to spend that night at a place three miles out of moscow
the next morning they woke late and were again delayed so often that they only got as far as great mytishchi
at ten o'clock that evening the rostov family and the wounded traveling with them were all distributed in the yards and huts of that large village
the rostovs' servants and coachmen and the orderlies of the wounded officers  after attending to their masters  had supper  fed the horses  and came out into the porches
in a neighboring hut lay raevski's adjutant with a fractured wrist
the awful pain he suffered made him moan incessantly and piteously  and his moaning sounded terrible in the darkness of the autumn night
he had spent the first night in the same yard as the rostovs
the countess said she had been unable to close her eyes on account of his moaning  and at mytishchi she moved into a worse hut simply to be farther away from the wounded man
in the darkness of the night one of the servants noticed  above the high body of a coach standing before the porch  the small glow of another fire
one glow had long been visible and everybody knew that it was little mytishchi burning  set on fire by mamonov's cossacks
 but look here  brothers  there's another fire   remarked an orderly
all turned their attention to the glow
 but they told us little mytishchi had been set on fire by mamonov's cossacks    but that's not mytishchi  it's farther away    look  it must be in moscow   two of the gazers went round to the other side of the coach and sat down on its steps
 it's more to the left  why  little mytishchi is over there  and this is right on the other side   several men joined the first two
 see how it's flaring   said one
 that's a fire in moscow  either in the sushchevski or the rogozhski quarter   no one replied to this remark and for some time they all gazed silently at the spreading flames of the second fire in the distance
old daniel terentich  the count's valet  as he was called   came up to the group and shouted at mishka
 what are you staring at  you good for nothing   
the count will be calling and there's nobody there  go and gather the clothes together    i only ran out to get some water   said mishka
 but what do you think  daniel terentich  doesn't it look as if that glow were in moscow   remarked one of the footmen
daniel terentich made no reply  and again for a long time they were all silent
the glow spread  rising and falling  farther and farther still
 god have mercy   
it's windy and dry     said another voice
 just look  see what it's doing now
o lord  you can even see the crows flying
lord have mercy on us sinners    they'll put it out  no fear    who's to put it out   daniel terentich  who had hitherto been silent  was heard to say
his voice was calm and deliberate
 moscow it is  brothers   said he
 mother moscow  the white     his voice faltered  and he gave way to an old man's sob
and it was as if they had all only waited for this to realize the significance for them of the glow they were watching
sighs were heard  words of prayer  and the sobbing of the count's old valet
the valet  returning to the cottage  informed the count that moscow was burning
the count donned his dressing gown and went out to look
sonya and madame schoss  who had not yet undressed  went out with him
only natasha and the countess remained in the room
petya was no longer with the family  he had gone on with his regiment which was making for troitsa
the countess  on hearing that moscow was on fire  began to cry
natasha  pale  with a fixed look  was sitting on the bench under the icons just where she had sat down on arriving and paid no attention to her father's words
she was listening to the ceaseless moaning of the adjutant  three houses off
 oh  how terrible   said sonya returning from the yard chilled and frightened
 i believe the whole of moscow will burn  there's an awful glow  natasha  do look  you can see it from the window   she said to her cousin  evidently wishing to distract her mind
but natasha looked at her as if not understanding what was said to her and again fixed her eyes on the corner of the stove
she had been in this condition of stupor since the morning  when sonya  to the surprise and annoyance of the countess  had for some unaccountable reason found it necessary to tell natasha of prince andrew's wound and of his being with their party
the countess had seldom been so angry with anyone as she was with sonya
sonya had cried and begged to be forgiven and now  as if trying to atone for her fault  paid unceasing attention to her cousin
 look  natasha  how dreadfully it is burning   said she
 what's burning   asked natasha
 oh  yes  moscow   and as if in order not to offend sonya and to get rid of her  she turned her face to the window  looked out in such a way that it was evident that she could not see anything  and again settled down in her former attitude
 but you didn't see it    yes  really i did   natasha replied in a voice that pleaded to be left in peace
both the countess and sonya understood that  naturally  neither moscow nor the burning of moscow nor anything else could seem of importance to natasha
the count returned and lay down behind the partition
the countess went up to her daughter and touched her head with the back of her hand as she was wont to do when natasha was ill  then touched her forehead with her lips as if to feel whether she was feverish  and finally kissed her
 you are cold
you are trembling all over
you'd better lie down   said the countess
 lie down  all right  i will
i'll lie down at once   said natasha
when natasha had been told that morning that prince andrew was seriously wounded and was traveling with their party  she had at first asked many questions  where was he going  how was he wounded  was it serious  and could she see him  but after she had been told that she could not see him  that he was seriously wounded but that his life was not in danger  she ceased to ask questions or to speak at all  evidently disbelieving what they told her  and convinced that say what she might she would still be told the same
all the way she had sat motionless in a corner of the coach with wide open eyes  and the expression in them which the countess knew so well and feared so much  and now she sat in the same way on the bench where she had seated herself on arriving
she was planning something and either deciding or had already decided something in her mind
the countess knew this  but what it might be she did not know  and this alarmed and tormented her
 natasha  undress  darling  lie down on my bed   a bed had been made on a bedstead for the countess only
madame schoss and the two girls were to sleep on some hay on the floor
 no  mamma  i will lie down here on the floor   natasha replied irritably and she went to the window and opened it
through the open window the moans of the adjutant could be heard more distinctly
she put her head out into the damp night air  and the countess saw her slim neck shaking with sobs and throbbing against the window frame
natasha knew it was not prince andrew who was moaning
she knew prince andrew was in the same yard as themselves and in a part of the hut across the passage  but this dreadful incessant moaning made her sob the countess exchanged a look with sonya
 lie down  darling  lie down  my pet   said the countess  softly touching natasha's shoulders
 come  lie down    oh  yes  
i'll lie down at once   said natasha  and began hurriedly undressing  tugging at the tapes of her petticoat
when she had thrown off her dress and put on a dressing jacket  she sat down with her foot under her on the bed that had been made up on the floor  jerked her thin and rather short plait of hair to the front  and began replaiting it
her long  thin  practiced fingers rapidly unplaited  replaited  and tied up her plait
her head moved from side to side from habit  but her eyes  feverishly wide  looked fixedly before her
when her toilet for the night was finished she sank gently onto the sheet spread over the hay on the side nearest the door
 natasha  you'd better lie in the middle   said sonya
 i'll stay here   muttered natasha
 do lie down   she added crossly  and buried her face in the pillow
the countess  madame schoss  and sonya undressed hastily and lay down
the small lamp in front of the icons was the only light left in the room
but in the yard there was a light from the fire at little mytishchi a mile and a half away  and through the night came the noise of people shouting at a tavern mamonov's cossacks had set up across the street  and the adjutant's unceasing moans could still be heard
for a long time natasha listened attentively to the sounds that reached her from inside and outside the room and did not move
first she heard her mother praying and sighing and the creaking of her bed under her  then madame schoss' familiar whistling snore and sonya's gentle breathing
then the countess called to natasha
natasha did not answer
 i think she's asleep  mamma   said sonya softly
after a short silence the countess spoke again but this time no one replied
soon after that natasha heard her mother's even breathing
natasha did not move  though her little bare foot  thrust out from under the quilt  was growing cold on the bare floor
as if to celebrate a victory over everybody  a cricket chirped in a crack in the wall
a cock crowed far off and another replied near by
the shouting in the tavern had died down  only the moaning of the adjutant was heard
natasha sat up
 sonya  are you asleep  mamma   she whispered
no one replied
natasha rose slowly and carefully  crossed herself  and stepped cautiously on the cold and dirty floor with her slim  supple  bare feet
the boards of the floor creaked
stepping cautiously from one foot to the other she ran like a kitten the few steps to the door and grasped the cold door handle
it seemed to her that something heavy was beating rhythmically against all the walls of the room  it was her own heart  sinking with alarm and terror and overflowing with love
she opened the door and stepped across the threshold and onto the cold  damp earthen floor of the passage
the cold she felt refreshed her
with her bare feet she touched a sleeping man  stepped over him  and opened the door into the part of the hut where prince andrew lay
it was dark in there
in the farthest corner  on a bench beside a bed on which something was lying  stood a tallow candle with a long  thick  and smoldering wick
from the moment she had been told that morning of prince andrew's wound and his presence there  natasha had resolved to see him
she did not know why she had to  she knew the meeting would be painful  but felt the more convinced that it was necessary
all day she had lived only in hope of seeing him that night
but now that the moment had come she was filled with dread of what she might see
how was he maimed  what was left of him  was he like that incessant moaning of the adjutant's  yes  he was altogether like that
in her imagination he was that terrible moaning personified
when she saw an indistinct shape in the corner  and mistook his knees raised under the quilt for his shoulders  she imagined a horrible body there  and stood still in terror
but an irresistible impulse drew her forward
she cautiously took one step and then another  and found herself in the middle of a small room containing baggage
another man timokhin  was lying in a corner on the benches beneath the icons  and two others the doctor and a valet lay on the floor
the valet sat up and whispered something
timokhin  kept awake by the pain in his wounded leg  gazed with wide open eyes at this strange apparition of a girl in a white chemise  dressing jacket  and nightcap
the valet's sleepy  frightened exclamation   what do you want  what's the matter   made natasha approach more swiftly to what was lying in the corner
horribly unlike a man as that body looked  she must see him
she passed the valet  the snuff fell from the candle wick  and she saw prince andrew clearly with his arms outside the quilt  and such as she had always seen him he was the same as ever  but the feverish color of his face  his glittering eyes rapturously turned toward her  and especially his neck  delicate as a child's  revealed by the turn down collar of his shirt  gave him a peculiarly innocent  childlike look  such as she had never seen on him before
she went up to him and with a swift  flexible  youthful movement dropped on her knees
he smiled and held out his hand to her
seven days had passed since prince andrew found himself in the ambulance station on the field of borodino his feverish state and the inflammation of his bowels  which were injured  were in the doctor's opinion sure to carry him off
but on the seventh day he ate with pleasure a piece of bread with some tea  and the doctor noticed that his temperature was lower
he had regained consciousness that morning
the first night after they left moscow had been fairly warm and he had remained in the caleche  but at mytishchi the wounded man himself asked to be taken out and given some tea the pain caused by his removal into the hut had made him groan aloud and again lose consciousness
when he had been placed on his camp bed he lay for a long time motionless with closed eyes
then he opened them and whispered softly   and the tea   his remembering such a small detail of everyday life astonished the doctor
he felt prince andrew's pulse  and to his surprise and dissatisfaction found it had improved
he was dissatisfied because he knew by experience that if his patient did not die now  he would do so a little later with greater suffering
timokhin  the red nosed major of prince andrew's regiment  had joined him in moscow and was being taken along with him  having been wounded in the leg at the battle of borodino
they were accompanied by a doctor  prince andrew's valet  his coachman  and two orderlies
they gave prince andrew some tea
he drank it eagerly  looking with feverish eyes at the door in front of him as if trying to understand and remember something
 i don't want any more
is timokhin here   he asked
timokhin crept along the bench to him
 i am here  your excellency    how's your wound    mine  sir  all right
but how about you   prince andrew again pondered as if trying to remember something
 the gospels
i haven't one   the doctor promised to procure it for him and began to ask how he was feeling
prince andrew answered all his questions reluctantly but reasonably  and then said he wanted a bolster placed under him as he was uncomfortable and in great pain
the doctor and valet lifted the cloak with which he was covered and  making wry faces at the noisome smell of mortifying flesh that came from the wound  began examining that dreadful place
the doctor was very much displeased about something and made a change in the dressings  turning the wounded man over so that he groaned again and grew unconscious it under him
 what trouble would it be to you   he said
 i have not got one
please get it for me and put it under for a moment   he pleaded in a piteous voice
the doctor went into the passage to wash his hands
 you fellows have no conscience   said he to the valet who was pouring water over his hands
 for just one moment i didn't look after you  
it's such pain  you know  that i wonder how he can bear it    by the lord jesus christ  i thought we had put something under him   said the valet
the first time prince andrew understood where he was and what was the matter with him and remembered being wounded and how was when he asked to be carried into the hut after his caleche had stopped at mytishchi
after growing confused from pain while being carried into the hut he again regained consciousness  and while drinking tea once more recalled all that had happened to him  and above all vividly remembered the moment at the ambulance station when  at the sight of the sufferings of a man he disliked  those new thoughts had come to him which promised him happiness
and those thoughts  though now vague and indefinite  again possessed his soul
he remembered that he had now a new source of happiness and that this happiness had something to do with the gospels
that was why he asked for a copy of them
the uncomfortable position in which they had put him and turned him over again confused his thoughts  and when he came to himself a third time it was in the complete stillness of the night everybody near him was sleeping
a cricket chirped from across the passage  someone was shouting and singing in the street  cockroaches rustled on the table  on the icons  and on the walls  and a big fly flopped at the head of the bed and around the candle beside him  the wick of which was charred and had shaped itself like a mushroom
his mind was not in a normal state
a healthy man usually thinks of  feels  and remembers innumerable things simultaneously  but has the power and will to select one sequence of thoughts or events on which to fix his whole attention
a healthy man can tear himself away from the deepest reflections to say a civil word to someone who comes in and can then return again to his own thoughts but prince andrew's mind was not in a normal state in that respect
all the powers of his mind were more active and clearer than ever  but they acted apart from his will
most diverse thoughts and images occupied him simultaneously
at times his brain suddenly began to work with a vigor  clearness  and depth it had never reached when he was in health  but suddenly in the midst of its work it would turn to some unexpected idea and he had not the strength to turn it back again
 yes  a new happiness was revealed to me of which man cannot be deprived   he thought as he lay in the semidarkness of the quiet hut  gazing fixedly before him with feverish wide open eyes
 a happiness lying beyond material forces  outside the material influences that act on man a happiness of the soul alone  the happiness of loving
every man can understand it  but to conceive it and enjoin it was possible only for god
but how did god enjoin that law  and why was the son      and suddenly the sequence of these thoughts broke off  and prince andrew heard  without knowing whether it was a delusion or reality  a soft whispering voice incessantly and rhythmically repeating  piti piti piti   and then  titi   and then again  piti piti piti   and  ti ti  once more
at the same time he felt that above his face  above the very middle of it  some strange airy structure was being erected out of slender needles or splinters  to the sound of this whispered music
he felt that he had to balance carefully  though it was difficult  so that this airy structure should not collapse  but nevertheless it kept collapsing and again slowly rising to the sound of whispered rhythmic music   it stretches  stretches  spreading out and stretching   said prince andrew to himself while listening to this whispering and feeling the sensation of this drawing out and the construction of this edifice of needles  he also saw by glimpses a red halo round the candle  and heard the rustle of the cockroaches and the buzzing of the fly that flopped against his pillow and his face each time the fly touched his face it gave him a burning sensation and yet to his surprise it did not destroy the structure  though it knocked against the very region of his face where it was rising
but besides this there was something else of importance
it was something white by the door the statue of a sphinx  which also oppressed him
 but perhaps that's my shirt on the table   he thought   and that's my legs  and that is the door  but why is it always stretching and drawing itself out  and 'piti piti piti' and 'ti ti' and 'piti piti piti'     that's enough  please leave off   prince andrew painfully entreated someone and suddenly thoughts and feelings again swam to the surface of his mind with peculiar clearness and force
 yes love   he thought again quite clearly
 but not love which loves for something  for some quality  for some purpose  or for some reason  but the love which i while dying first experienced when i saw my enemy and yet loved him
i experienced that feeling of love which is the very essence of the soul and does not require an object
now again i feel that bliss
to love one's neighbors  to love one's enemies  to love everything  to love god in all his manifestations
it is possible to love someone dear to you with human love  but an enemy can only be loved by divine love
that is why i experienced such joy when i felt that i loved that man
what has become of him  is he alive   
 when loving with human love one may pass from love to hatred  but divine love cannot change
no  neither death nor anything else can destroy it
it is the very essence of the soul
yet how many people have i hated in my life  and of them all  i loved and hated none as i did her   and he vividly pictured to himself natasha  not as he had done in the past with nothing but her charms which gave him delight  but for the first time picturing to himself her soul and he understood her feelings  her sufferings  shame  and remorse
he now understood for the first time all the cruelty of his rejection of her  the cruelty of his rupture with her
 if only it were possible for me to see her once more  just once  looking into those eyes to say      piti piti piti and ti ti and piti piti piti boom   flopped the fly  
and his attention was suddenly carried into another world  a world of reality and delirium in which something particular was happening
in that world some structure was still being erected and did not fall  something was still stretching out  and the candle with its red halo was still burning  and the same shirtlike sphinx lay near the door  but besides all this something creaked  there was a whiff of fresh air  and a new white sphinx appeared  standing at the door and that sphinx had the pale face and shining eyes of the very natasha of whom he had just been thinking
 oh  how oppressive this continual delirium is   thought prince andrew  trying to drive that face from his imagination
but the face remained before him with the force of reality and drew nearer
prince andrew wished to return to that former world of pure thought  but he could not  and delirium drew him back into its domain
the soft whispering voice continued its rhythmic murmur  something oppressed him and stretched out  and the strange face was before him prince andrew collected all his strength in an effort to recover his senses  he moved a little  and suddenly there was a ringing in his ears  a dimness in his eyes  and like a man plunged into water he lost consciousness
when he came to himself  natasha  that same living natasha whom of all people he most longed to love with this new pure divine love that had been revealed to him  was kneeling before him he realized that it was the real living natasha  and he was not surprised but quietly happy
natasha  motionless on her knees  she was unable to stir   with frightened eyes riveted on him  was restraining her sobs
her face was pale and rigid
only in the lower part of it something quivered
prince andrew sighed with relief  smiled  and held out his hand
 you   he said
 how fortunate   with a rapid but careful movement natasha drew nearer to him on her knees and  taking his hand carefully  bent her face over it and began kissing it  just touching it lightly with her lips
 forgive me   she whispered  raising her head and glancing at him
 forgive me    i love you   said prince andrew
 forgive       forgive what   he asked
 forgive me for what i ha ve do ne   faltered natasha in a scarcely audible  broken whisper  and began kissing his hand more rapidly  just touching it with her lips
 i love you more  better than before   said prince andrew  lifting her face with his hand so as to look into her eyes
those eyes  filled with happy tears  gazed at him timidly  compassionately  and with joyous love
natasha's thin pale face  with its swollen lips  was more than plain it was dreadful
but prince andrew did not see that  he saw her shining eyes which were beautiful
they heard the sound of voices behind them
peter the valet  who was now wide awake  had roused the doctor
timokhin  who had not slept at all because of the pain in his leg  had long been watching all that was going on  carefully covering his bare body with the sheet as he huddled up on his bench
 what's this   said the doctor  rising from his bed
 please go away  madam   at that moment a maid sent by the countess  who had noticed her daughter's absence  knocked at the door
like a somnambulist aroused from her sleep natasha went out of the room and  returning to her hut  fell sobbing on her bed
from that time  during all the rest of the rostovs' journey  at every halting place and wherever they spent a night  natasha never left the wounded bolkonski  and the doctor had to admit that he had not expected from a young girl either such firmness or such skill in nursing a wounded man
dreadful as the countess imagined it would be should prince andrew die in her daughter's arms during the journey as  judging by what the doctor said  it seemed might easily happen she could not oppose natasha though with the intimacy now established between the wounded man and natasha the thought occurred that should he recover their former engagement would be renewed  no one least of all natasha and prince andrew spoke of this  the unsettled question of life and death  which hung not only over bolkonski but over all russia  shut out all other considerations
on the third of september pierre awoke late
his head was aching  the clothes in which he had slept without undressing felt uncomfortable on his body  and his mind had a dim consciousness of something shameful he had done the day before
that something shameful was his yesterday's conversation with captain ramballe
it was eleven by the clock  but it seemed peculiarly dark out of doors
pierre rose  rubbed his eyes  and seeing the pistol with an engraved stock which gerasim had replaced on the writing table  he remembered where he was and what lay before him that very day
 am i not too late   he thought
 no  probably he won't make his entry into moscow before noon   pierre did not allow himself to reflect on what lay before him  but hastened to act after arranging his clothes  he took the pistol and was about to go out
but it then occurred to him for the first time that he certainly could not carry the weapon in his hand through the streets
it was difficult to hide such a big pistol even under his wide coat
he could not carry it unnoticed in his belt or under his arm
besides  it had been discharged  and he had not had time to reload it
 no matter  dagger will do   he said to himself  though when planning his design he had more than once come to the conclusion that the chief mistake made by the student in 1809 had been to try to kill napoleon with a dagger but as his chief aim consisted not in carrying out his design  but in proving to himself that he would not abandon his intention and was doing all he could to achieve it  pierre hastily took the blunt jagged dagger in a green sheath which he had bought at the sukharev market with the pistol  and hid it under his waistcoat having tied a girdle over his coat and pulled his cap low on his head  pierre went down the corridor  trying to avoid making a noise or meeting the captain  and passed out into the street
the conflagration  at which he had looked with so much indifference the evening before  had greatly increased during the night
moscow was on fire in several places
the buildings in carriage row  across the river  in the bazaar and the povarskoy  as well as the barges on the moskva river and the timber yards by the dorogomilov bridge  were all ablaze
pierre's way led through side streets to the povarskoy and from there to the church of st
nicholas on the arbat  where he had long before decided that the deed should be done
the gates of most of the houses were locked and the shutters up
the streets and lanes were deserted
the air was full of smoke and the smell of burning
now and then he met russians with anxious and timid faces  and frenchmen with an air not of the city but of the camp  walking in the middle of the streets
both the russians and the french looked at pierre with surprise
besides his height and stoutness  and the strange morose look of suffering in his face and whole figure  the russians stared at pierre because they could not make out to what class he could belong
the french followed him with astonishment in their eyes chiefly because pierre  unlike all the other russians who gazed at the french with fear and curiosity  paid no attention to them
at the gate of one house three frenchmen  who were explaining something to some russians who did not understand them  stopped pierre asking if he did not know french
pierre shook his head and went on
in another side street a sentinel standing beside a green caisson shouted at him  but only when the shout was threateningly repeated and he heard the click of the man's musket as he raised it did pierre understand that he had to pass on the other side of the street
he heard nothing and saw nothing of what went on around him
he carried his resolution within himself in terror and haste  like something dreadful and alien to him  for  after the previous night's experience  he was afraid of losing it but he was not destined to bring his mood safely to his destination
and even had he not been hindered by anything on the way  his intention could not now have been carried out  for napoleon had passed the arbat more than four hours previously on his way from the dorogomilov suburb to the kremlin  and was now sitting in a very gloomy frame of mind in a royal study in the kremlin  giving detailed and exact orders as to measures to be taken immediately to extinguish the fire  to prevent looting  and to reassure the inhabitants
but pierre did not know this  he was entirely absorbed in what lay before him  and was tortured as those are who obstinately undertake a task that is impossible for them not because of its difficulty but because of its incompatibility with their natures by the fear of weakening at the decisive moment and so losing his self esteem
though he heard and saw nothing around him he found his way by instinct and did not go wrong in the side streets that led to the povarskoy
as pierre approached that street the smoke became denser and denser he even felt the heat of the fire
occasionally curly tongues of flame rose from under the roofs of the houses
he met more people in the streets and they were more excited
but pierre  though he felt that something unusual was happening around him  did not realize that he was approaching the fire
as he was going along a foot path across a wide open space adjoining the povarskoy on one side and the gardens of prince gruzinski's house on the other  pierre suddenly heard the desperate weeping of a woman close to him
he stopped as if awakening from a dream and lifted his head
by the side of the path  on the dusty dry grass  all sorts of household goods lay in a heap  featherbeds  a samovar  icons  and trunks
on the ground  beside the trunks  sat a thin woman no longer young  with long  prominent upper teeth  and wearing a black cloak and cap
this woman  swaying to and fro and muttering something  was choking with sobs
two girls of about ten and twelve  dressed in dirty short frocks and cloaks  were staring at their mother with a look of stupefaction on their pale frightened faces
the youngest child  a boy of about seven  who wore an overcoat and an immense cap evidently not his own  was crying in his old nurse's arms a dirty  barefooted maid was sitting on a trunk  and  having undone her pale colored plait  was pulling it straight and sniffing at her singed hair
the woman's husband  a short  roundshouldered man in the undress uniform of a civilian official  with sausageshaped whiskers and showing under his square set cap the hair smoothly brushed forward over his temples  with expressionless face was moving the trunks  which were placed one on another  and was dragging some garments from under them
as soon as she saw pierre  the woman almost threw herself at his feet
 dear people  good christians  save me  help me  dear friends  
help us  somebody   she muttered between her sobs
 my girl  
my daughter  my youngest daughter is left behind
she's burned  ooh  was it for this i nursed you   
ooh    don't  mary nikolievna   said her husband to her in a low voice  evidently only to justify himself before the stranger  sister must have taken her  or else where can she be   he added
 monster  villain   shouted the woman angrily  suddenly ceasing to weep
 you have no heart  you don't feel for your own child  another man would have rescued her from the fire
but this is a monster and neither a man nor a father  you  honored sir  are a noble man   she went on  addressing pierre rapidly between her sobs
 the fire broke out alongside  and blew our way  the maid called out 'fire ' and we rushed to collect our things
we ran out just as we were   
this is what we have brought away   
the icons  and my dowry bed  all the rest is lost
we seized the children
but not katie  ooh  o lord      and again she began to sob
 my child  my dear one  burned  burned    but where was she left   asked pierre
from the expression of his animated face the woman saw that this man might help her
 oh  dear sir   she cried  seizing him by the legs
 my benefactor  set my heart at ease   
aniska  go  you horrid girl  show him the way   she cried to the maid  angrily opening her mouth and still farther exposing her long teeth
 show me the way  show me  i  
i'll do it   gasped pierre rapidly
the dirty maidservant stepped from behind the trunk  put up her plait  sighed  and went on her short  bare feet along the path
pierre felt as if he had come back to life after a heavy swoon
he held his head higher  his eyes shone with the light of life  and with swift steps he followed the maid  overtook her  and came out on the povarskoy
the whole street was full of clouds of black smoke
tongues of flame here and there broke through that cloud
a great number of people crowded in front of the conflagration
in the middle of the street stood a french general saying something to those around him
pierre  accompanied by the maid  was advancing to the spot where the general stood  but the french soldiers stopped him
 on ne passe pas   * cried a voice
*  you can't pass    this way  uncle   cried the girl
 we'll pass through the side street  by the nikulins'   pierre turned back  giving a spring now and then to keep up with her
she ran across the street  turned down a side street to the left  and  passing three houses  turned into a yard on the right
 it's here  close by   said she and  running across the yard  opened a gate in a wooden fence and  stopping  pointed out to him a small wooden wing of the house  which was burning brightly and fiercely
one of its sides had fallen in  another was on fire  and bright flames issued from the openings of the windows and from under the roof
as pierre passed through the fence gate  he was enveloped by hot air and involuntarily stopped
 which is it  which is your house   he asked
 ooh   wailed the girl  pointing to the wing
 that's it  that was our lodging
you've burned to death  our treasure  katie  my precious little missy  ooh   lamented aniska  who at the sight of the fire felt that she too must give expression to her feelings
pierre rushed to the wing  but the heat was so great that he involuntarily passed round in a curve and came upon the large house that was as yet burning only at one end  just below the roof  and around which swarmed a crowd of frenchmen
at first pierre did not realize what these men  who were dragging something out  were about  but seeing before him a frenchman hitting a peasant with a blunt saber and trying to take from him a fox fur coat  he vaguely understood that looting was going on there  but he had no time to dwell on that idea
the sounds of crackling and the din of falling walls and ceilings  the whistle and hiss of the flames  the excited shouts of the people  and the sight of the swaying smoke  now gathering into thick black clouds and now soaring up with glittering sparks  with here and there dense sheaves of flame  now red and now like golden fish scales creeping along the walls   and the heat and smoke and rapidity of motion  produced on pierre the usual animating effects of a conflagration
it had a peculiarly strong effect on him because at the sight of the fire he felt himself suddenly freed from the ideas that had weighed him down he felt young  bright  adroit  and resolute
he ran round to the other side of the lodge and was about to dash into that part of it which was still standing  when just above his head he heard several voices shouting and then a cracking sound and the ring of something heavy falling close beside him
pierre looked up and saw at a window of the large house some frenchmen who had just thrown out the drawer of a chest  filled with metal articles
other french soldiers standing below went up to the drawer
 what does this fellow want   shouted one of them referring to pierre
 there's a child in that house
haven't you seen a child   cried pierre
 what's he talking about  get along   said several voices  and one of the soldiers  evidently afraid that pierre might want to take from them some of the plate and bronzes that were in the drawer  moved threateningly toward him
 a child   shouted a frenchman from above
 i did hear something squealing in the garden
perhaps it's his brat that the fellow is looking for
after all  one must be human  you know       where is it  where   said pierre
 there  there   shouted the frenchman at the window  pointing to the garden at the back of the house
 wait a bit i'm coming down   and a minute or two later the frenchman  a black eyed fellow with a spot on his cheek  in shirt sleeves  really did jump out of a window on the ground floor  and clapping pierre on the shoulder ran with him into the garden
 hurry up  you others   he called out to his comrades  it's getting hot   when they reached a gravel path behind the house the frenchman pulled pierre by the arm and pointed to a round  graveled space where a three yearold girl in a pink dress was lying under a seat
 there is your child  oh  a girl  so much the better   said the frenchman
 good bye  fatty
we must be human  we are all mortal you know   and the frenchman with the spot on his cheek ran back to his comrades breathless with joy  pierre ran to the little girl and was going to take her in his arms but seeing a stranger the sickly  scrofulous looking child  unattractively like her mother  began to yell and run away
pierre  however  seized her and lifted her in his arms she screamed desperately and angrily and tried with her little hands to pull pierre's hands away and to bite them with her slobbering mouth
pierre was seized by a sense of horror and repulsion such as he had experienced when touching some nasty little animal
but he made an effort not to throw the child down and ran with her to the large house
it was now  however  impossible to get back the way he had come  the maid  aniska  was no longer there  and pierre with a feeling of pity and disgust pressed the wet  painfully sobbing child to himself as tenderly as he could and ran with her through the garden seeking another way out having run through different yards and side streets  pierre got back with his little burden to the gruzinski garden at the corner of the povarskoy
he did not at first recognize the place from which he had set out to look for the child  so crowded was it now with people and goods that had been dragged out of the houses
besides russian families who had taken refuge here from the fire with their belongings  there were several french soldiers in a variety of clothing
pierre took no notice of them
he hurried to find the family of that civil servant in order to restore the daughter to her mother and go to save someone else
pierre felt that he had still much to do and to do quickly
glowing with the heat and from running  he felt at that moment more strongly than ever the sense of youth  animation  and determination that had come on him when he ran to save the child
she had now become quiet and  clinging with her little hands to pierre's coat  sat on his arm gazing about her like some little wild animal
he glanced at her occasionally with a slight smile
he fancied he saw something pathetically innocent in that frightened  sickly little face
he did not find the civil servant or his wife where he had left them
he walked among the crowd with rapid steps  scanning the various faces he met
involuntarily he noticed a georgian or armenian family consisting of a very handsome old man of oriental type  wearing a new  cloth covered  sheepskin coat and new boots  an old woman of similar type  and a young woman
that very young woman seemed to pierre the perfection of oriental beauty  with her sharply outlined  arched  black eyebrows and the extraordinarily soft  bright color of her long  beautiful  expressionless face
amid the scattered property and the crowd on the open space  she  in her rich satin cloak with a bright lilac shawl on her head  suggested a delicate exotic plant thrown out onto the snow
she was sitting on some bundles a little behind the old woman  and looked from under her long lashes with motionless  large  almond shaped eyes at the ground before her
evidently she was aware of her beauty and fearful because of it
her face struck pierre and  hurrying along by the fence  he turned several times to look at her
when he had reached the fence  still without finding those he sought  he stopped and looked about him
with the child in his arms his figure was now more conspicuous than before  and a group of russians  both men and women  gathered about him  have you lost anyone  my dear fellow  you're of the gentry yourself  aren't you  whose child is it   they asked him
pierre replied that the child belonged to a woman in a black coat who had been sitting there with her other children  and he asked whether anyone knew where she had gone
 why  that must be the anferovs   said an old deacon  addressing a pockmarked peasant woman
 lord have mercy  lord have mercy   he added in his customary bass
 the anferovs  no   said the woman
 they left in the morning
that must be either mary nikolievna's or the ivanovs'    he says 'a woman ' and mary nikolievna is a lady   remarked a house serf
 do you know her  she's thin  with long teeth   said pierre
 that's mary nikolievna  they went inside the garden when these wolves swooped down   said the woman  pointing to the french soldiers
 o lord  have mercy   added the deacon
 go over that way  they're there
it's she  she kept on lamenting and crying   continued the woman
 it's she
here  this way   but pierre was not listening to the woman
he had for some seconds been intently watching what was going on a few steps away
he was looking at the armenian family and at two french soldiers who had gone up to them
one of these  a nimble little man  was wearing a blue coat tied round the waist with a rope
he had a nightcap on his head and his feet were bare
the other  whose appearance particularly struck pierre  was a long  lank  round shouldered  fairhaired man  slow in his movements and with an idiotic expression of face
he wore a woman's loose gown of frieze  blue trousers  and large torn hessian boots
the little barefooted frenchman in the blue coat went up to the armenians and  saying something  immediately seized the old man by his legs and the old man at once began pulling off his boots
the other in the frieze gown stopped in front of the beautiful armenian girl and with his hands in his pockets stood staring at her  motionless and silent
 here  take the child   said pierre peremptorily and hurriedly to the woman  handing the little girl to her
 give her back to them  give her back   he almost shouted  putting the child  who began screaming  on the ground  and again looking at the frenchman and the armenian family
the old man was already sitting barefoot
the little frenchman had secured his second boot and was slapping one boot against the other
the old man was saying something in a voice broken by sobs  but pierre caught but a glimpse of this  his whole attention was directed to the frenchman in the frieze gown who meanwhile  swaying slowly from side to side  had drawn nearer to the young woman and taking his hands from his pockets had seized her by the neck
the beautiful armenian still sat motionless and in the same attitude  with her long lashes drooping as if she did not see or feel what the soldier was doing to her
while pierre was running the few steps that separated him from the frenchman  the tall marauder in the frieze gown was already tearing from her neck the necklace the young armenian was wearing  and the young woman  clutching at her neck  screamed piercingly
 let that woman alone   exclaimed pierre hoarsely in a furious voice  seizing the soldier by his round shoulders and throwing him aside
the soldier fell  got up  and ran away
but his comrade  throwing down the boots and drawing his sword  moved threateningly toward pierre  voyons  pas de betises   * he cried
*  look here  no nonsense   pierre was in such a transport of rage that he remembered nothing and his strength increased tenfold
he rushed at the barefooted frenchman and  before the latter had time to draw his sword  knocked him off his feet and hammered him with his fists
shouts of approval were heard from the crowd around  and at the same moment a mounted patrol of french uhlans appeared from round the corner
the uhlans came up at a trot to pierre and the frenchman and surrounded them
pierre remembered nothing of what happened after that
he only remembered beating someone and being beaten and finally feeling that his hands were bound and that a crowd of french soldiers stood around him and were searching him
 lieutenant  he has a dagger   were the first words pierre understood
 ah  a weapon   said the officer and turned to the barefooted soldier who had been arrested with pierre
 all right  you can tell all about it at the courtmartial   then he turned to pierre
 do you speak french   pierre looked around him with bloodshot eyes and did not reply
his face probably looked very terrible  for the officer said something in a whisper and four more uhlans left the ranks and placed themselves on both sides of pierre  do you speak french   the officer asked again  keeping at a distance from pierre
 call the interpreter   a little man in russian civilian clothes rode out from the ranks  and by his clothes and manner of speaking pierre at once knew him to be a french salesman from one of the moscow shops
 he does not look like a common man   said the interpreter  after a searching look at pierre
 ah  he looks very much like an incendiary   remarked the officer
 and ask him who he is   he added
 who are you   asked the interpreter in poor russian
 you must answer the chief    i will not tell you who i am
i am your prisoner take me   pierre suddenly replied in french
 ah  ah   muttered the officer with a frown
 well then  march   a crowd had collected round the uhlans
nearest to pierre stood the pockmarked peasant woman with the little girl  and when the patrol started she moved forward
 where are they taking you to  you poor dear   said she
 and the little girl  the little girl  what am i to do with her if she's not theirs   said the woman
 what does that woman want   asked the officer
pierre was as if intoxicated
his elation increased at the sight of the little girl he had saved
 what does she want   he murmured
 she is bringing me my daughter whom i have just saved from the flames   said he
 good bye   and without knowing how this aimless lie had escaped him  he went along with resolute and triumphant steps between the french soldiers
the french patrol was one of those sent out through the various streets of moscow by durosnel's order to put a stop to the pillage  and especially to catch the incendiaries who  according to the general opinion which had that day originated among the higher french officers  were the cause of the conflagrations
after marching through a number of streets the patrol arrested five more russian suspects  a small shopkeeper  two seminary students  a peasant  and a house serf  besides several looters
but of all these various suspected characters  pierre was considered to be the most suspicious of all
when they had all been brought for the night to a large house on the zubov rampart that was being used as a guardhouse  pierre was placed apart under strict guard
in petersburg at that time a complicated struggle was being carried on with greater heat than ever in the highest circles  between the parties of rumyantsev  the french  marya fedorovna  the tsarevich  and others  drowned as usual by the buzzing of the court drones
but the calm  luxurious life of petersburg  concerned only about phantoms and reflections of real life  went on in its old way and made it hard  except by a great effort  to realize the danger and the difficult position of the russian people there were the same receptions and balls  the same french theater  the same court interests and service interests and intrigues as usual
only in the very highest circles were attempts made to keep in mind the difficulties of the actual position
stories were whispered of how differently the two empresses behaved in these difficult circumstances the empress marya  concerned for the welfare of the charitable and educational institutions under her patronage  had given directions that they should all be removed to kazan  and the things belonging to these institutions had already been packed up
the empress elisabeth  however  when asked what instructions she would be pleased to give with her characteristic russian patriotism had replied that she could give no directions about state institutions for that was the affair of the sovereign  but as far as she personally was concerned she would be the last to quit petersburg
at anna pavlovna's on the twenty sixth of august  the very day of the battle of borodino  there was a soiree  the chief feature of which was to be the reading of a letter from his lordship the bishop when sending the emperor an icon of the venerable sergius
it was regarded as a model of ecclesiastical  patriotic eloquence
prince vasili himself  famed for his elocution  was to read it  he used to read at the empress'   the art of his reading was supposed to lie in rolling out the words  quite independently of their meaning  in a loud and singsong voice alternating between a despairing wail and a tender murmur  so that the wail fell quite at random on one word and the murmur on another
this reading  as was always the case at anna pavlovna's soirees  had a political significance
that evening she expected several important personages who had to be made ashamed of their visits to the french theater and aroused to a patriotic temper
a good many people had already arrived  but anna pavlovna  not yet seeing all those whom she wanted in her drawing room  did not let the reading begin but wound up the springs of a general conversation
the news of the day in petersburg was the illness of countess bezukhova
she had fallen ill unexpectedly a few days previously  had missed several gatherings of which she was usually ornament  and was said to be receiving no one  and instead of the celebrated petersburg doctors who usually attended her had entrusted herself to some italian doctor who was treating her in some new and unusual way
they all knew very well that the enchanting countess' illness arose from an inconvenience resulting from marrying two husbands at the same time  and that the italian's cure consisted in removing such inconvenience  but in anna pavlovna's presence no one dared to think of this or even appear to know it
 they say the poor countess is very ill
the doctor says it is angina pectoris    angina  oh  that's a terrible illness    they say that the rivals are reconciled  thanks to the angina     and the word angina was repeated with great satisfaction
 the count is pathetic  they say
he cried like a child when the doctor told him the case was dangerous    oh  it would be a terrible loss  she is an enchanting woman    you are speaking of the poor countess   said anna pavlovna  coming up just then
 i sent to ask for news  and hear that she is a little better
oh  she is certainly the most charming woman in the world   she went on  with a smile at her own enthusiasm
 we belong to different camps  but that does not prevent my esteeming her as she deserves
she is very unfortunate   added anna pavlovna
supposing that by these words anna pavlovna was somewhat lifting the veil from the secret of the countess' malady  an unwary young man ventured to express surprise that well known doctors had not been called in and that the countess was being attended by a charlatan who might employ dangerous remedies
 your information may be better than mine   anna pavlovna suddenly and venomously retorted on the inexperienced young man   but i know on good authority that this doctor is a very learned and able man
he is private physician to the queen of spain   and having thus demolished the young man  anna pavlovna turned to another group where bilibin was talking about the austrians  having wrinkled up his face he was evidently preparing to smooth it out again and utter one of his mots
 i think it is delightful   he said  referring to a diplomatic note that had been sent to vienna with some austrian banners captured from the french by wittgenstein   the hero of petropol  as he was then called in petersburg
 what  what's that   asked anna pavlovna  securing silence for the mot  which she had heard before
and bilibin repeated the actual words of the diplomatic dispatch  which he had himself composed  the emperor returns these austrian banners   said bilibin   friendly banners gone astray and found on a wrong path   and his brow became smooth again
 charming  charming   observed prince vasili
 the path to warsaw  perhaps   prince hippolyte remarked loudly and unexpectedly
everybody looked at him  understanding what he meant
prince hippolyte himself glanced around with amused surprise he knew no more than the others what his words meant
during his diplomatic career he had more than once noticed that such utterances were received as very witty  and at every opportunity he uttered in that way the first words that entered his head
 it may turn out very well   he thought   but if not  they'll know how to arrange matters   and really  during the awkward silence that ensued  that insufficiently patriotic person entered whom anna pavlovna had been waiting for and wished to convert  and she  smiling and shaking a finger at hippolyte  invited prince vasili to the table and bringing him two candles and the manuscript begged him to begin
everyone became silent
 most gracious sovereign and emperor   prince vasili sternly declaimed  looking round at his audience as if to inquire whether anyone had anything to say to the contrary
but no one said anything
 moscow  our ancient capital  the new jerusalem  receives her christ  he placed a sudden emphasis on the word her  as a mother receives her zealous sons into her arms  and through the gathering mists  foreseeing the brilliant glory of thy rule  sings in exultation  'hosanna  blessed is he that cometh '  prince vasili pronounced these last words in a tearful voice bilibin attentively examined his nails  and many of those present appeared intimidated  as if asking in what they were to blame
anna pavlovna whispered the next words in advance  like an old woman muttering the prayer at communion   let the bold and insolent goliath     she whispered
prince vasili continued
 let the bold and insolent goliath from the borders of france encompass the realms of russia with death bearing terrors  humble faith  the sling of the russian david  shall suddenly smite his head in his bloodthirsty pride this icon of the venerable sergius  the servant of god and zealous champion of old of our country's weal  is offered to your imperial majesty
i grieve that my waning strength prevents rejoicing in the sight of your most gracious presence
i raise fervent prayers to heaven that the almighty may exalt the race of the just  and mercifully fulfill the desires of your majesty    what force  what a style   was uttered in approval both of reader and of author
animated by that address anna pavlovna's guests talked for a long time of the state of the fatherland and offered various conjectures as to the result of the battle to be fought in a few days
 you will see   said anna pavlovna   that tomorrow  on the emperor's birthday  we shall receive news
i have a favorable presentiment   anna pavlovna's presentiment was in fact fulfilled
next day during the service at the palace church in honor of the emperor's birthday  prince volkonski was called out of the church and received a dispatch from prince kutuzov
it was kutuzov's report  written from tatarinova on the day of the battle
kutuzov wrote that the russians had not retreated a step  that the french losses were much heavier than ours  and that he was writing in haste from the field of battle before collecting full information
it followed that there must have been a victory
and at once  without leaving the church  thanks were rendered to the creator for his help and for the victory
anna pavlovna's presentiment was justified  and all that morning a joyously festive mood reigned in the city
everyone believed the victory to have been complete  and some even spoke of napoleon's having been captured  of his deposition  and of the choice of a new ruler for france
it is very difficult for events to be reflected in their real strength and completeness amid the conditions of court life and far from the scene of action
general events involuntarily group themselves around some particular incident so now the courtiers' pleasure was based as much on the fact that the news had arrived on the emperor's birthday as on the fact of the victory itself
it was like a successfully arranged surprise
mention was made in kutuzov's report of the russian losses  among which figured the names of tuchkov  bagration  and kutaysov
in the petersburg world this sad side of the affair again involuntarily centered round a single incident  kutaysov's death
everybody knew him  the emperor liked him  and he was young and interesting
that day everyone met with the words   what a wonderful coincidence  just during the service
but what a loss kutaysov is  how sorry i am    what did i tell about kutuzov   prince vasili now said with a prophet's pride
 i always said he was the only man capable of defeating napoleon   but next day no news arrived from the army and the public mood grew anxious
the courtiers suffered because of the suffering the suspense occasioned the emperor
 fancy the emperor's position   said they  and instead of extolling kutuzov as they had done the day before  they condemned him as the cause of the emperor's anxiety
that day prince vasili no longer boasted of his protege kutuzov  but remained silent when the commander in chief was mentioned
moreover  toward evening  as if everything conspired to make petersburg society anxious and uneasy  a terrible piece of news was added
countess helene bezukhova had suddenly died of that terrible malady it had been so agreeable to mention
officially  at large gatherings  everyone said that countess bezukhova had died of a terrible attack of angina pectoris  but in intimate circles details were mentioned of how the private physician of the queen of spain had prescribed small doses of a certain drug to produce a certain effect  but helene  tortured by the fact that the old count suspected her and that her husband to whom she had written  that wretched  profligate pierre  had not replied  had suddenly taken a very large dose of the drug  and had died in agony before assistance could be rendered her it was said that prince vasili and the old count had turned upon the italian  but the latter had produced such letters from the unfortunate deceased that they had immediately let the matter drop
talk in general centered round three melancholy facts  the emperor's lack of news  the loss of kutaysov  and the death of helene
on the third day after kutuzov's report a country gentleman arrived from moscow  and news of the surrender of moscow to the french spread through the whole town
this was terrible  what a position for the emperor to be in  kutuzov was a traitor  and prince vasili during the visits of condolence paid to him on the occasion of his daughter's death said of kutuzov  whom he had formerly praised  it was excusable for him in his grief to forget what he had said   that it was impossible to expect anything else from a blind and depraved old man
 i only wonder that the fate of russia could have been entrusted to such a man   as long as this news remained unofficial it was possible to doubt it  but the next day the following communication was received from count rostopchin  prince kutuzov's adjutant has brought me a letter in which he demands police officers to guide the army to the ryazan road
he writes that he is regretfully abandoning moscow
sire  kutuzov's action decides the fate of the capital and of your empire  russia will shudder to learn of the abandonment of the city in which her greatness is centered and in which lie the ashes of your ancestors  i shall follow the army
i have had everything removed  and it only remains for me to weep over the fate of my fatherland
on receiving this dispatch the emperor sent prince volkonski to kutuzov with the following rescript  prince michael ilarionovich  since the twenty ninth of august i have received no communication from you  yet on the first of september i received from the commander in chief of moscow  via yaroslavl  the sad news that you  with the army  have decided to abandon moscow
you can yourself imagine the effect this news has had on me  and your silence increases my astonishment
i am sending this by adjutant general prince volkonski  to hear from you the situation of the army and the reasons that have induced you to take this melancholy decision
nine days after the abandonment of moscow  a messenger from kutuzov reached petersburg with the official announcement of that event
this messenger was michaud  a frenchman who did not know russian  but who was quoique etranger  russe de coeur et d'ame  * as he said of himself * though a foreigner  russian in heart and soul
the emperor at once received this messenger in his study at the palace on stone island
michaud  who had never seen moscow before the campaign and who did not know russian  yet felt deeply moved  as he wrote  when he appeared before notre tres gracieux souverain * with the news of the burning of moscow  dont les flammes eclairaient sa route
* 2  * our most gracious sovereign
*  2  whose flames illumined his route
though the source of m
michaud's chagrin must have been different from that which caused russians to grieve  he had such a sad face when shown into the emperor's study that the latter at once asked   have you brought me sad news  colonel    very sad  sire   replied michaud  lowering his eyes with a sigh
 the abandonment of moscow    have they surrendered my ancient capital without a battle   asked the emperor quickly  his face suddenly flushing
michaud respectfully delivered the message kutuzov had entrusted to him  which was that it had been impossible to fight before moscow  and that as the only remaining choice was between losing the army as well as moscow  or losing moscow alone  the field marshal had to choose the latter
the emperor listened in silence  not looking at michaud
 has the enemy entered the city   he asked
 yes  sire  and moscow is now in ashes
i left it all in flames   replied michaud in a decided tone  but glancing at the emperor he was frightened by what he had done
the emperor began to breathe heavily and rapidly  his lower lip trembled  and tears instantly appeared in his fine blue eyes
but this lasted only a moment
he suddenly frowned  as if blaming himself for his weakness  and raising his head addressed michaud in a firm voice   i see  colonel  from all that is happening  that providence requires great sacrifices of us   i am ready to submit myself in all things to his will  but tell me  michaud  how did you leave the army when it saw my ancient capital abandoned without a battle  did you not notice discouragement      seeing that his most gracious ruler was calm once more  michaud also grew calm  but was not immediately ready to reply to the emperor's direct and relevant question which required a direct answer
 sire  will you allow me to speak frankly as befits a loyal soldier   he asked to gain time
 colonel  i always require it   replied the emperor
 conceal nothing from me  i wish to know absolutely how things are    sire   said michaud with a subtle  scarcely perceptible smile on his lips  having now prepared a well phrased reply   sire  i left the whole army  from its chiefs to the lowest soldier  without exception in desperate and agonized terror      how is that   the emperor interrupted him  frowning sternly
 would misfortune make my russians lose heart   
never   michaud had only waited for this to bring out the phrase he had prepared
 sire   he said  with respectful playfulness   they are only afraid lest your majesty  in the goodness of your heart  should allow yourself to be persuaded to make peace
they are burning for the combat   declared this representative of the russian nation   and to prove to your majesty by the sacrifice of their lives how devoted they are       ah   said the emperor reassured  and with a kindly gleam in his eyes  he patted michaud on the shoulder
 you set me at ease  colonel   he bent his head and was silent for some time
 well  then  go back to the army   he said  drawing himself up to his full height and addressing michaud with a gracious and majestic gesture   and tell our brave men and all my good subjects wherever you go that when i have not a soldier left i shall put myself at the head of my beloved nobility and my good peasants and so use the last resources of my empire it still offers me more than my enemies suppose   said the emperor growing more and more animated   but should it ever be ordained by divine providence   he continued  raising to heaven his fine eyes shining with emotion   that my dynasty should cease to reign on the throne of my ancestors  then after exhausting all the means at my command  i shall let my beard grow to here   he pointed halfway down his chest   and go and eat potatoes with the meanest of my peasants  rather than sign the disgrace of my country and of my beloved people whose sacrifices i know how to appreciate   having uttered these words in an agitated voice the emperor suddenly turned away as if to hide from michaud the tears that rose to his eyes  and went to the further end of his study
having stood there a few moments  he strode back to michaud and pressed his arm below the elbow with a vigorous movement
the emperor's mild and handsome face was flushed and his eyes gleamed with resolution and anger
 colonel michaud  do not forget what i say to you here  perhaps we may recall it with pleasure someday  
napoleon or i   said the emperor  touching his breast
 we can no longer both reign together
i have learned to know him  and he will not deceive me any more      and the emperor paused  with a frown
when he heard these words and saw the expression of firm resolution in the emperor's eyes  michaud quoique etranger  russe de coeur et d'ame at that solemn moment felt himself enraptured by all that he had heard  as he used afterwards to say   and gave expression to his own feelings and those of the russian people whose representative he considered himself to be  in the following words   sire   said he   your majesty is at this moment signing the glory of the nation and the salvation of europe   with an inclination of the head the emperor dismissed him it is natural for us who were not living in those days to imagine that when half russia had been conquered and the inhabitants were fleeing to distant provinces  and one levy after another was being raised for the defense of the fatherland  all russians from the greatest to the least were solely engaged in sacrificing themselves  saving their fatherland  or weeping over its downfall the tales and descriptions of that time without exception speak only of the self sacrifice  patriotic devotion  despair  grief  and the heroism of the russians
but it was not really so
it appears so to us because we see only the general historic interest of that time and do not see all the personal human interests that people had
yet in reality those personal interests of the moment so much transcend the general interests that they always prevent the public interest from being felt or even noticed
most of the people at that time paid no attention to the general progress of events but were guided only by their private interests  and they were the very people whose activities at that period were most useful
those who tried to understand the general course of events and to take part in it by self sacrifice and heroism were the most useless members of society  they saw everything upside down  and all they did for the common good turned out to be useless and foolish like pierre's and mamonov's regiments which looted russian villages  and the lint the young ladies prepared and that never reached the wounded  and so on
even those  fond of intellectual talk and of expressing their feelings  who discussed russia's position at the time involuntarily introduced into their conversation either a shade of pretense and falsehood or useless condemnation and anger directed against people accused of actions no one could possibly be guilty of
in historic events the rule forbidding us to eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge is specially applicable
only unconscious action bears fruit  and he who plays a part in an historic event never understands its significance
if he tries to realize it his efforts are fruitless
the more closely a man was engaged in the events then taking place in russia the less did he realize their significance
in petersburg and in the provinces at a distance from moscow  ladies  and gentlemen in militia uniforms  wept for russia and its ancient capital and talked of self sacrifice and so on  but in the army which retired beyond moscow there was little talk or thought of moscow  and when they caught sight of its burned ruins no one swore to be avenged on the french  but they thought about their next pay  their next quarters  of matreshka the vivandiere  and like matters as the war had caught him in the service  nicholas rostov took a close and prolonged part in the defense of his country  but did so casually  without any aim at self sacrifice  and he therefore looked at what was going on in russia without despair and without dismally racking his brains over it
had he been asked what he thought of the state of russia  he would have said that it was not his business to think about it  that kutuzov and others were there for that purpose  but that he had heard that the regiments were to be made up to their full strength  that fighting would probably go on for a long time yet  and that things being so it was quite likely he might be in command of a regiment in a couple of years' time
as he looked at the matter in this way  he learned that he was being sent to voronezh to buy remounts for his division  not only without regret at being prevented from taking part in the coming battle  but with the greatest pleasure  which he did not conceal and which his comrades fully understood a few days before the battle of borodino  nicholas received the necessary money and warrants  and having sent some hussars on in advance  he set out with post horses for voronezh
only a man who has experienced it that is  has passed some months continuously in an atmosphere of campaigning and war can understand the delight nicholas felt when he escaped from the region covered by the army's foraging operations  provision trains  and hospitals
when free from soldiers  wagons  and the filthy traces of a camp he saw villages with peasants and peasant women  gentlemen's country houses  fields where cattle were grazing  posthouses with stationmasters asleep in them  he rejoiced as though seeing all this for the first time
what for a long while specially surprised and delighted him were the women  young and healthy  without a dozen officers making up to each of them  women  too  who were pleased and flattered that a passing officer should joke with them
in the highest spirits nicholas arrived at night at a hotel in voronezh  ordered things he had long been deprived of in camp  and next day  very clean shaven and in a full dress uniform he had not worn for a long time  went to present himself to the authorities the commander of the militia was a civilian general  an old man who was evidently pleased with his military designation and rank
he received nicholas brusquely  imagining this to be characteristically military  and questioned him with an important air  as if considering the general progress of affairs and approving and disapproving with full right to do so
nicholas was in such good spirits that this merely amused him
from the commander of the militia he drove to the governor
the governor was a brisk little man  very simple and affable
he indicated the stud farms at which nicholas might procure horses  recommended to him a horse dealer in the town and a landowner fourteen miles out of town who had the best horses  and promised to assist him in every way  you are count ilya rostov's son  my wife was a great friend of your mother's
we are at home on thursdays today is thursday  so please come and see us quite informally   said the governor  taking leave of him
immediately on leaving the governor's  nicholas hired post horses and  taking his squadron quartermaster with him  drove at a gallop to the landowner  fourteen miles away  who had the stud
everything seemed to him pleasant and easy during that first part of his stay in voronezh and  as usually happens when a man is in a pleasant state of mind  everything went well and easily
the landowner to whom nicholas went was a bachelor  an old cavalryman  a horse fancier  a sportsman  the possessor of some century old brandy and some old hungarian wine  who had a snuggery where he smoked  and who owned some splendid horses
in very few words nicholas bought seventeen picked stallions for six thousand rubles to serve  as he said  as samples of his remounts
after dining and taking rather too much of the hungarian wine  nicholas having exchanged kisses with the landowner  with whom he was already on the friendliest terms  galloped back over abominable roads  in the brightest frame of mind  continually urging on the driver so as to be in time for the governor's party when he had changed  poured water over his head  and scented himself  nicholas arrived at the governor's rather late  but with the phrase  better late than never  on his lips it was not a ball  nor had dancing been announced  but everyone knew that catherine petrovna would play valses and the ecossaise on the clavichord and that there would be dancing  and so everyone had come as to a ball
provincial life in 1812 went on very much as usual  but with this difference  that it was livelier in the towns in consequence of the arrival of many wealthy families from moscow  and as in everything that went on in russia at that time a special recklessness was noticeable  an  in for a penny  in for a pound who cares   spirit  and the inevitable small talk  instead of turning on the weather and mutual acquaintances  now turned on moscow  the army  and napoleon
the society gathered together at the governor's was the best in voronezh
there were a great many ladies and some of nicholas' moscow acquaintances  but there were no men who could at all vie with the cavalier of st
george  the hussar remount officer  the good natured and well bred count rostov
among the men was an italian prisoner  an officer of the french army  and nicholas felt that the presence of that prisoner enhanced his own importance as a russian hero
the italian was  as it were  a war trophy
nicholas felt this  it seemed to him that everyone regarded the italian in the same light  and he treated him cordially though with dignity and restraint
as soon as nicholas entered in his hussar uniform  diffusing around him a fragrance of perfume and wine  and had uttered the words  better late than never  and heard them repeated several times by others  people clustered around him  all eyes turned on him  and he felt at once that he had entered into his proper position in the province that of a universal favorite  a very pleasant position  and intoxicatingly so after his long privations
at posting stations  at inns  and in the landowner's snuggery  maidservants had been flattered by his notice  and here too at the governor's party there were  as it seemed to nicholas  an inexhaustible number of pretty young women  married and unmarried  impatiently awaiting his notice
the women and girls flirted with him and  from the first day  the people concerned themselves to get this fine young daredevil of an hussar married and settled down among these was the governor's wife herself  who welcomed rostov as a near relative and called him  nicholas   catherine petrovna did actually play valses and the ecossaise  and dancing began in which nicholas still further captivated the provincial society by his agility
his particularly free manner of dancing even surprised them all
nicholas was himself rather surprised at the way he danced that evening he had never danced like that in moscow and would even have considered such a very free and easy manner improper and in bad form  but here he felt it incumbent on him to astonish them all by something unusual  something they would have to accept as the regular thing in the capital though new to them in the provinces
all the evening nicholas paid attention to a blue eyed  plump and pleasing little blonde  the wife of one of the provincial officials
with the naive conviction of young men in a merry mood that other men's wives were created for them  rostov did not leave the lady's side and treated her husband in a friendly and conspiratorial style  as if  without speaking of it  they knew how capitally nicholas and the lady would get on together
the husband  however  did not seem to share that conviction and tried to behave morosely with rostov
but the latter's good natured naivete was so boundless that sometimes even he involuntarily yielded to nicholas' good humor
toward the end of the evening  however  as the wife's face grew more flushed and animated  the husband's became more and more melancholy and solemn  as though there were but a given amount of animation between them and as the wife's share increased the husband's diminished
nicholas sat leaning slightly forward in an armchair  bending closely over the blonde lady and paying her mythological compliments with a smile that never left his face
jauntily shifting the position of his legs in their tight riding breeches  diffusing an odor of perfume  and admiring his partner  himself  and the fine outlines of his legs in their well fitting hessian boots  nicholas told the blonde lady that he wished to run away with a certain lady here in voronezh  which lady    a charming lady  a divine one
her eyes   nicholas looked at his partner   are blue  her mouth coral and ivory  her figure   he glanced at her shoulders   like diana's      the husband came up and sullenly asked his wife what she was talking about
 ah  nikita ivanych   cried nicholas  rising politely  and as if wishing nikita ivanych to share his joke  he began to tell him of his intention to elope with a blonde lady
the husband smiled gloomily  the wife gaily
the governor's good natured wife came up with a look of disapproval
 anna ignatyevna wants to see you  nicholas   said she  pronouncing the name so that nicholas at once understood that anna ignatyevna was a very important person
 come  nicholas  you know you let me call you so    oh  yes  aunt
who is she    anna ignatyevna malvintseva
she has heard from her niece how you rescued her  
can you guess    i rescued such a lot of them   said nicholas
 her niece  princess bolkonskaya
she is here in voronezh with her aunt
oho  how you blush
why  are       not a bit  please don't  aunt    very well  very well   
oh  what a fellow you are   the governor's wife led him up to a tall and very stout old lady with a blue headdress  who had just finished her game of cards with the most important personages of the town
this was malvintseva  princess mary's aunt on her mother's side  a rich  childless widow who always lived in voronezh
when rostov approached her she was standing settling up for the game
she looked at him and  screwing up her eyes sternly  continued to upbraid the general who had won from her
 very pleased  mon cher   she then said  holding out her hand to nicholas
 pray come and see me   after a few words about princess mary and her late father  whom malvintseva had evidently not liked  and having asked what nicholas knew of prince andrew  who also was evidently no favorite of hers  the important old lady dismissed nicholas after repeating her invitation to come to see her
nicholas promised to come and blushed again as he bowed
at the mention of princess mary he experienced a feeling of shyness and even of fear  which he himself did not understand when he had parted from malvintseva nicholas wished to return to the dancing  but the governor's little wife placed her plump hand on his sleeve and  saying that she wanted to have a talk with him  led him to her sitting room  from which those who were there immediately withdrew so as not to be in her way
 do you know  dear boy   began the governor's wife with a serious expression on her kind little face   that really would be the match for you  would you like me to arrange it    whom do you mean  aunt   asked nicholas
 i will make a match for you with the princess
catherine petrovna speaks of lily  but i say  no the princess  do you want me to do it  i am sure your mother will be grateful to me
what a charming girl she is  really  and she is not at all so plain  either    not at all   replied nicholas as if offended at the idea
 as befits a soldier  aunt  i don't force myself on anyone or refuse anything   he said before he had time to consider what he was saying
 well then  remember  this is not a joke    of course not    yes  yes   the governor's wife said as if talking to herself
 but  my dear boy  among other things you are too attentive to the other  the blonde
one is sorry for the husband  really       oh no  we are good friends with him   said nicholas in the simplicity of his heart  it did not enter his head that a pastime so pleasant to himself might not be pleasant to someone else  but what nonsense i have been saying to the governor's wife   thought nicholas suddenly at supper
 she will really begin to arrange a match  
and sonya      and on taking leave of the governor's wife  when she again smilingly said to him   well then  remember   he drew her aside
 but see here  to tell the truth  aunt      what is it  my dear  come  let's sit down here   said she
nicholas suddenly felt a desire and need to tell his most intimate thoughts  which he would not have told to his mother  his sister  or his friend  to this woman who was almost a stranger
when he afterwards recalled that impulse to unsolicited and inexplicable frankness which had very important results for him  it seemed to him as it seems to everyone in such cases that it was merely some silly whim that seized him  yet that burst of frankness  together with other trifling events  had immense consequences for him and for all his family  you see  aunt  mamma has long wanted me to marry an heiress  but the very idea of marrying for money is repugnant to me    oh yes  i understand   said the governor's wife
 but princess bolkonskaya that's another matter
i will tell you the truth
in the first place i like her very much  i feel drawn to her  and then  after i met her under such circumstances so strangely  the idea often occurred to me  'this is fate ' especially if you remember that mamma had long been thinking of it  but i had never happened to meet her before  somehow it had always happened that we did not meet and as long as my sister natasha was engaged to her brother it was of course out of the question for me to think of marrying her
and it must needs happen that i should meet her just when natasha's engagement had been broken off  
and then everything  
so you see  
i never told this to anyone and never will  only to you   the governor's wife pressed his elbow gratefully
 you know sonya  my cousin  i love her  and promised to marry her  and will do so   
so you see there can be no question about   said nicholas incoherently and blushing
 my dear boy  what a way to look at it  you know sonya has nothing and you yourself say your papa's affairs are in a very bad way
and what about your mother  it would kill her  that's one thing
and what sort of life would it be for sonya if she's a girl with a heart  your mother in despair  and you all ruined   
no  my dear  you and sonya ought to understand that   nicholas remained silent
it comforted him to hear these arguments
 all the same  aunt  it is impossible   he rejoined with a sigh  after a short pause
 besides  would the princess have me  and besides  she is now in mourning
how can one think of it    but you don't suppose i'm going to get you married at once  there is always a right way of doing things   replied the governor's wife
 what a matchmaker you are  aunt     said nicholas  kissing her plump little hand
on reaching moscow after her meeting with rostov  princess mary had found her nephew there with his tutor  and a letter from prince andrew giving her instructions how to get to her aunt malvintseva at voronezh
that feeling akin to temptation which had tormented her during her father's illness  since his death  and especially since her meeting with rostov was smothered by arrangements for the journey  anxiety about her brother  settling in a new house  meeting new people  and attending to her nephew's education
she was sad
now  after a month passed in quiet surroundings  she felt more and more deeply the loss of her father which was associated in her mind with the ruin of russia
she was agitated and incessantly tortured by the thought of the dangers to which her brother  the only intimate person now remaining to her  was exposed
she was worried too about her nephew's education for which she had always felt herself incompetent  but in the depths of her soul she felt at peace a peace arising from consciousness of having stifled those personal dreams and hopes that had been on the point of awakening within her and were related to her meeting with rostov the day after her party the governor's wife came to see malvintseva and  after discussing her plan with the aunt  remarked that though under present circumstances a formal betrothal was  of course  not to be thought of  all the same the young people might be brought together and could get to know one another malvintseva expressed approval  and the governor's wife began to speak of rostov in mary's presence  praising him and telling how he had blushed when princess mary's name was mentioned
but princess mary experienced a painful rather than a joyful feeling her mental tranquillity was destroyed  and desires  doubts  self reproach  and hopes reawoke
during the two days that elapsed before rostov called  princess mary continually thought of how she ought to behave to him
first she decided not to come to the drawing room when he called to see her aunt that it would not be proper for her  in her deep mourning  to receive visitors  then she thought this would be rude after what he had done for her  then it occurred to her that her aunt and the governor's wife had intentions concerning herself and rostov  their looks and words at times seemed to confirm this supposition then she told herself that only she  with her sinful nature  could think this of them  they could not forget that situated as she was  while still wearing deep mourning  such matchmaking would be an insult to her and to her father's memory
assuming that she did go down to see him  princess mary imagined the words he would say to her and what she would say to him  and these words sometimes seemed undeservedly cold and then to mean too much
more than anything she feared lest the confusion she felt might overwhelm her and betray her as soon as she saw him
but when on sunday after church the footman announced in the drawing room that count rostov had called  the princess showed no confusion  only a slight blush suffused her cheeks and her eyes lit up with a new and radiant light
 you have met him  aunt   said she in a calm voice  unable herself to understand that she could be outwardly so calm and natural
when rostov entered the room  the princess dropped her eyes for an instant  as if to give the visitor time to greet her aunt  and then just as nicholas turned to her she raised her head and met his look with shining eyes
with a movement full of dignity and grace she half rose with a smile of pleasure  held out her slender  delicate hand to him  and began to speak in a voice in which for the first time new deep womanly notes vibrated
mademoiselle bourienne  who was in the drawing room  looked at princess mary in bewildered surprise
herself a consummate coquette  she could not have maneuvered better on meeting a man she wished to attract
 either black is particularly becoming to her or she really has greatly improved without my having noticed it
and above all  what tact and grace   thought mademoiselle bourienne
had princess mary been capable of reflection at that moment  she would have been more surprised than mademoiselle bourienne at the change that had taken place in herself
from the moment she recognized that dear  loved face  a new life force took possession of her and compelled her to speak and act apart from her own will
from the time rostov entered  her face became suddenly transformed
it was as if a light had been kindled in a carved and painted lantern and the intricate  skillful  artistic work on its sides  that previously seemed dark  coarse  and meaningless  was suddenly shown up in unexpected and striking beauty
for the first time all that pure  spiritual  inward travail through which she had lived appeared on the surface
all her inward labor  her dissatisfaction with herself  her sufferings  her strivings after goodness  her meekness  love  and self sacrifice all this now shone in those radiant eyes  in her delicate smile  and in every trait of her gentle face
rostov saw all this as clearly as if he had known her whole life
he felt that the being before him was quite different from  and better than  anyone he had met before  and above all better than himself their conversation was very simple and unimportant
they spoke of the war  and like everyone else unconsciously exaggerated their sorrow about it  they spoke of their last meeting nicholas trying to change the subject they talked of the governor's kind wife  of nicholas' relations  and of princess mary's
she did not talk about her brother  diverting the conversation as soon as her aunt mentioned andrew
evidently she could speak of russia's misfortunes with a certain artificiality  but her brother was too near her heart and she neither could nor would speak lightly of him
nicholas noticed this  as he noticed every shade of princess mary's character with an observation unusual to him  and everything confirmed his conviction that she was a quite unusual and extraordinary being
nicholas blushed and was confused when people spoke to him about the princess  as she did when he was mentioned  and even when he thought of her  but in her presence he felt quite at ease  and said not at all what he had prepared  but what  quite appropriately  occurred to him at the moment
when a pause occurred during his short visit  nicholas  as is usual when there are children  turned to prince andrew's little son  caressing him and asking whether he would like to be an hussar
he took the boy on his knee  played with him  and looked round at princess mary
with a softened  happy  timid look she watched the boy she loved in the arms of the man she loved nicholas also noticed that look and  as if understanding it  flushed with pleasure and began to kiss the boy with good natured playfulness
as she was in mourning princess mary did not go out into society  and nicholas did not think it the proper thing to visit her again  but all the same the governor's wife went on with her matchmaking  passing on to nicholas the flattering things princess mary said of him and vice versa  and insisting on his declaring himself to princess mary for this purpose she arranged a meeting between the young people at the bishop's house before mass
though rostov told the governor's wife that he would not make any declaration to princess mary  he promised to go
as at tilsit rostov had not allowed himself to doubt that what everybody considered right was right  so now  after a short but sincere struggle between his effort to arrange his life by his own sense of justice  and in obedient submission to circumstances  he chose the latter and yielded to the power he felt irresistibly carrying him he knew not where he knew that after his promise to sonya it would be what he deemed base to declare his feelings to princess mary
and he knew that he would never act basely
but he also knew  or rather felt at the bottom of his heart  that by resigning himself now to the force of circumstances and to those who were guiding him  he was not only doing nothing wrong  but was doing something very important more important than anything he had ever done in his life after meeting princess mary  though the course of his life went on externally as before  all his former amusements lost their charm for him and he often thought about her
but he never thought about her as he had thought of all the young ladies without exception whom he had met in society  nor as he had for a long time  and at one time rapturously  thought about sonya
he had pictured each of those young ladies as almost all honest hearted young men do  that is  as a possible wife  adapting her in his imagination to all the conditions of married life  a white dressing gown  his wife at the tea table  his wife's carriage  little ones  mamma and papa  their relations to her  and so on and these pictures of the future had given him pleasure
but with princess mary  to whom they were trying to get him engaged  he could never picture anything of future married life
if he tried  his pictures seemed incongruous and false
it made him afraid
the dreadful news of the battle of borodino  of our losses in killed and wounded  and the still more terrible news of the loss of moscow reached voronezh in the middle of september
princess mary  having learned of her brother's wound only from the gazette and having no definite news of him  prepared  so nicholas heard  he had not seen her again himself  to set off in search of prince andrew when he received the news of the battle of borodino and the abandonment of moscow  rostov was not seized with despair  anger  the desire for vengeance  or any feeling of that kind  but everything in voronezh suddenly seemed to him dull and tiresome  and he experienced an indefinite feeling of shame and awkwardness
the conversations he heard seemed to him insincere  he did not know how to judge all these affairs and felt that only in the regiment would everything again become clear to him
he made haste to finish buying the horses  and often became unreasonably angry with his servant and squadron quartermaster
a few days before his departure a special thanksgiving  at which nicholas was present  was held in the cathedral for the russian victory
he stood a little behind the governor and held himself with military decorum through the service  meditating on a great variety of subjects when the service was over the governor's wife beckoned him to her
 have you seen the princess   she asked  indicating with a movement of her head a lady standing on the opposite side  beyond the choir
nicholas immediately recognized princess mary not so much by the profile he saw under her bonnet as by the feeling of solicitude  timidity  and pity that immediately overcame him
princess mary  evidently engrossed by her thoughts  was crossing herself for the last time before leaving the church
nicholas looked at her face with surprise
it was the same face he had seen before  there was the same general expression of refined  inner  spiritual labor  but now it was quite differently lit up
there was a pathetic expression of sorrow  prayer  and hope in it
as had occurred before when she was present  nicholas went up to her without waiting to be prompted by the governor's wife and not asking himself whether or not it was right and proper to address her here in church  and told her he had heard of her trouble and sympathized with his whole soul as soon as she heard his voice a vivid glow kindled in her face  lighting up both her sorrow and her joy
 there is one thing i wanted to tell you  princess   said rostov
 it is that if your brother  prince andrew nikolievich  were not living  it would have been at once announced in the gazette  as he is a colonel   the princess looked at him  not grasping what he was saying  but cheered by the expression of regretful sympathy on his face
 and i have known so many cases of a splinter wound   the gazette said it was a shell   either proving fatal at once or being very slight   continued nicholas
 we must hope for the best  and i am sure     princess mary interrupted him
 oh  that would be so dread     she began and  prevented by agitation from finishing  she bent her head with a movement as graceful as everything she did in his presence and  looking up at him gratefully  went out  following her aunt
that evening nicholas did not go out  but stayed at home to settle some accounts with the horse dealers
when he had finished that business it was already too late to go anywhere but still too early to go to bed  and for a long time he paced up and down the room  reflecting on his life  a thing he rarely did
princess mary had made an agreeable impression on him when he had met her in smolensk province
his having encountered her in such exceptional circumstances  and his mother having at one time mentioned her to him as a good match  had drawn his particular attention to her when he met her again in voronezh the impression she made on him was not merely pleasing but powerful
nicholas had been struck by the peculiar moral beauty he observed in her at this time
he was  however  preparing to go away and it had not entered his head to regret that he was thus depriving himself of chances of meeting her but that day's encounter in church had  he felt  sunk deeper than was desirable for his peace of mind
that pale  sad  refined face  that radiant look  those gentle graceful gestures  and especially the deep and tender sorrow expressed in all her features agitated him and evoked his sympathy
in men rostov could not bear to see the expression of a higher spiritual life  that was why he did not like prince andrew  and he referred to it contemptuously as philosophy and dreaminess  but in princess mary that very sorrow which revealed the depth of a whole spiritual world foreign to him was an irresistible attraction
 she must be a wonderful woman
a real angel   he said to himself  why am i not free  why was i in such a hurry with sonya   and he involuntarily compared the two  the lack of spirituality in the one and the abundance of it in the other a spirituality he himself lacked and therefore valued most highly he tried to picture what would happen were he free
how he would propose to her and how she would become his wife
but no  he could not imagine that
he felt awed  and no clear picture presented itself to his mind
he had long ago pictured to himself a future with sonya  and that was all clear and simple just because it had all been thought out and he knew all there was in sonya  but it was impossible to picture a future with princess mary  because he did not understand her but simply loved her reveries about sonya had had something merry and playful in them  but to dream of princess mary was always difficult and a little frightening
 how she prayed   he thought
 it was plain that her whole soul was in her prayer
yes  that was the prayer that moves mountains  and i am sure her prayer will be answered
why don't i pray for what i want   he suddenly thought
 what do i want  to be free  released from sonya  
she was right   he thought  remembering what the governor's wife had said   nothing but misfortune can come of marrying sonya
muddles  grief for mamma  
business difficulties  
muddles  terrible muddles  besides  i don't love her  not as i should
o  god  release me from this dreadful  inextricable position   he suddenly began to pray
 yes  prayer can move mountains  but one must have faith and not pray as natasha and i used to as children  that the snow might turn into sugar and then run out into the yard to see whether it had done so
no  but i am not praying for trifles now   he thought as he put his pipe down in a corner  and folding his hands placed himself before the icon softened by memories of princess mary he began to pray as he had not done for a long time
tears were in his eyes and in his throat when the door opened and lavrushka came in with some papers
 blockhead  why do you come in without being called   cried nicholas  quickly changing his attitude
 from the governor   said lavrushka in a sleepy voice
 a courier has arrived and there's a letter for you    well  all right  thanks
you can go   nicholas took the two letters  one of which was from his mother and the other from sonya
he recognized them by the handwriting and opened sonya's first
he had read only a few lines when he turned pale and his eyes opened wide with fear and joy
 no  it's not possible   he cried aloud
unable to sit still he paced up and down the room holding the letter and reading it
he glanced through it  then read it again  and then again  and standing still in the middle of the room he raised his shoulders  stretching out his hands  with his mouth wide open and his eyes fixed what he had just been praying for with confidence that god would hear him had come to pass  but nicholas was as much astonished as if it were something extraordinary and unexpected  and as if the very fact that it had happened so quickly proved that it had not come from god to whom he had prayed  but by some ordinary coincidence
this unexpected and  as it seemed to nicholas  quite voluntary letter from sonya freed him from the knot that fettered him and from which there had seemed no escape
she wrote that the last unfortunate events the loss of almost the whole of the rostovs' moscow property and the countess' repeatedly expressed wish that nicholas should marry princess bolkonskaya  together with his silence and coldness of late  had all combined to make her decide to release him from his promise and set him completely free
it would be too painful to me to think that i might be a cause of sorrow or discord in the family that has been so good to me  she wrote   and my love has no aim but the happiness of those i love  so  nicholas  i beg you to consider yourself free  and to be assured that  in spite of everything  no one can love you more than does your sonya both letters were written from troitsa
the other  from the countess  described their last days in moscow  their departure  the fire  and the destruction of all their property
in this letter the countess also mentioned that prince andrew was among the wounded traveling with them  his state was very critical  but the doctor said there was now more hope
sonya and natasha were nursing him
next day nicholas took his mother's letter and went to see princess mary
neither he nor she said a word about what  natasha nursing him  might mean  but thanks to this letter nicholas suddenly became almost as intimate with the princess as if they were relations
the following day he saw princess mary off on her journey to yaroslavl  and a few days later left to rejoin his regiment
sonya's letter written from troitsa  which had come as an answer to nicholas' prayer  was prompted by this  the thought of getting nicholas married to an heiress occupied the old countess' mind more and more
she knew that sonya was the chief obstacle to this happening  and sonya's life in the countess' house had grown harder and harder  especially after they had received a letter from nicholas telling of his meeting with princess mary in bogucharovo
the countess let no occasion slip of making humiliating or cruel allusions to sonya
but a few days before they left moscow  moved and excited by all that was going on  she called sonya to her and  instead of reproaching and making demands on her  tearfully implored her to sacrifice herself and repay all that the family had done for her by breaking off her engagement with nicholas
 i shall not be at peace till you promise me this   sonya burst into hysterical tears and replied through her sobs that she would do anything and was prepared for anything  but gave no actual promise and could not bring herself to decide to do what was demanded of her
she must sacrifice herself for the family that had reared and brought her up
to sacrifice herself for others was sonya's habit
her position in the house was such that only by sacrifice could she show her worth  and she was accustomed to this and loved doing it
but in all her former acts of self sacrifice she had been happily conscious that they raised her in her own esteem and in that of others  and so made her more worthy of nicholas whom she loved more than anything in the world
but now they wanted her to sacrifice the very thing that constituted the whole reward for her self sacrifice and the whole meaning of her life
and for the first time she felt bitterness against those who had been her benefactors only to torture her the more painfully  she felt jealous of natasha who had never experienced anything of this sort  had never needed to sacrifice herself  but made others sacrifice themselves for her and yet was beloved by everybody and for the first time sonya felt that out of her pure  quiet love for nicholas a passionate feeling was beginning to grow up which was stronger than principle  virtue  or religion
under the influence of this feeling sonya  whose life of dependence had taught her involuntarily to be secretive  having answered the countess in vague general terms  avoided talking with her and resolved to wait till she should see nicholas  not in order to set him free but on the contrary at that meeting to bind him to her forever the bustle and terror of the rostovs' last days in moscow stifled the gloomy thoughts that oppressed sonya
she was glad to find escape from them in practical activity
but when she heard of prince andrew's presence in their house  despite her sincere pity for him and for natasha  she was seized by a joyful and superstitious feeling that god did not intend her to be separated from nicholas
she knew that natasha loved no one but prince andrew and had never ceased to love him
she knew that being thrown together again under such terrible circumstances they would again fall in love with one another  and that nicholas would then not be able to marry princess mary as they would be within the prohibited degrees of affinity despite all the terror of what had happened during those last days and during the first days of their journey  this feeling that providence was intervening in her personal affairs cheered sonya
at the troitsa monastery the rostovs first broke their journey for a whole day
three large rooms were assigned to them in the monastery hostelry  one of which was occupied by prince andrew the wounded man was much better that day and natasha was sitting with him
in the next room sat the count and countess respectfully conversing with the prior  who was calling on them as old acquaintances and benefactors of the monastery
sonya was there too  tormented by curiosity as to what prince andrew and natasha were talking about
she heard the sound of their voices through the door
that door opened and natasha came out  looking excited
not noticing the monk  who had risen to greet her and was drawing back the wide sleeve on his right arm  she went up to sonya and took her hand
 natasha  what are you about  come here   said the countess
natasha went up to the monk for his blessing  and he advised her to pray for aid to god and his saint
as soon as the prior withdrew  natasha took her friend by the hand and went with her into the unoccupied room
 sonya  will he live   she asked
 sonya  how happy i am  and how unhappy   
sonya  dovey  everything is as it used to be
if only he lives  he cannot  
because  
because  
of  and natasha burst into tears
 yes  i knew it  thank god   murmured sonya
 he will live   sonya was not less agitated than her friend by the latter's fear and grief and by her own personal feelings which she shared with no one
sobbing  she kissed and comforted natasha
 if only he lives   she thought
having wept  talked  and wiped away their tears  the two friends went together to prince andrew's door
natasha opened it cautiously and glanced into the room  sonya standing beside her at the half open door
prince andrew was lying raised high on three pillows
his pale face was calm  his eyes closed  and they could see his regular breathing
 o  natasha   sonya suddenly almost screamed  catching her companion's arm and stepping back from the door
 what  what is it   asked natasha
 it's that  that     said sonya  with a white face and trembling lips
natasha softly closed the door and went with sonya to the window  not yet understanding what the latter was telling her
 you remember   said sonya with a solemn and frightened expression
 you remember when i looked in the mirror for you  
at otradnoe at christmas  do you remember what i saw    yes  yes   cried natasha opening her eyes wide  and vaguely recalling that sonya had told her something about prince andrew whom she had seen lying down
 you remember   sonya went on
 i saw it then and told everybody  you and dunyasha
i saw him lying on a bed   said she  making a gesture with her hand and a lifted finger at each detail   and that he had his eyes closed and was covered just with a pink quilt  and that his hands were folded   she concluded  convincing herself that the details she had just seen were exactly what she had seen in the mirror
she had in fact seen nothing then but had mentioned the first thing that came into her head  but what she had invented then seemed to her now as real as any other recollection
she not only remembered what she had then said that he turned to look at her and smiled and was covered with something red but was firmly convinced that she had then seen and said that he was covered with a pink quilt and that his eyes were closed
 yes  yes  it really was pink   cried natasha  who now thought she too remembered the word pink being used  and saw in this the most extraordinary and mysterious part of the prediction
 but what does it mean   she added meditatively
 oh  i don't know  it is all so strange   replied sonya  clutching at her head
a few minutes later prince andrew rang and natasha went to him  but sonya  feeling unusually excited and touched  remained at the window thinking about the strangeness of what had occurred
they had an opportunity that day to send letters to the army  and the countess was writing to her son
 sonya   said the countess  raising her eyes from her letter as her niece passed   sonya  won't you write to nicholas   she spoke in a soft  tremulous voice  and in the weary eyes that looked over her spectacles sonya read all that the countess meant to convey with these words
those eyes expressed entreaty  shame at having to ask  fear of a refusal  and readiness for relentless hatred in case of such refusal
sonya went up to the countess and  kneeling down  kissed her hand
 yes  mamma  i will write   said she
sonya was softened  excited  and touched by all that had occurred that day  especially by the mysterious fulfillment she had just seen of her vision
now that she knew that the renewal of natasha's relations with prince andrew would prevent nicholas from marrying princess mary  she was joyfully conscious of a return of that self sacrificing spirit in which she was accustomed to live and loved to live
so with a joyful consciousness of performing a magnanimous deed interrupted several times by the tears that dimmed her velvety black eyes she wrote that touching letter the arrival of which had so amazed nicholas
the officer and soldiers who had arrested pierre treated him with hostility but yet with respect  in the guardhouse to which he was taken
in their attitude toward him could still be felt both uncertainty as to who he might be perhaps a very important person and hostility as a result of their recent personal conflict with him
but when the guard was relieved next morning  pierre felt that for the new guard both officers and men he was not as interesting as he had been to his captors  and in fact the guard of the second day did not recognize in this big  stout man in a peasant coat the vigorous person who had fought so desperately with the marauder and the convoy and had uttered those solemn words about saving a child  they saw in him only no
17 of the captured russians  arrested and detained for some reason by order of the higher command
if they noticed anything remarkable about pierre  it was only his unabashed  meditative concentration and thoughtfulness  and the way he spoke french  which struck them as surprisingly good
in spite of this he was placed that day with the other arrested suspects  as the separate room he had occupied was required by an officer
all the russians confined with pierre were men of the lowest class and  recognizing him as a gentleman  they all avoided him  more especially as he spoke french
pierre felt sad at hearing them making fun of him
that evening he learned that all these prisoners  he  probably  among them  were to be tried for incendiarism
on the third day he was taken with the others to a house where a french general with a white mustache sat with two colonels and other frenchmen with scarves on their arms with the precision and definiteness customary in addressing prisoners  and which is supposed to preclude human frailty  pierre like the others was questioned as to who he was  where he had been  with what object  and so on
these questions  like questions put at trials generally  left the essence of the matter aside  shut out the possibility of that essence's being revealed  and were designed only to form a channel through which the judges wished the answers of the accused to flow so as to lead to the desired result  namely a conviction
as soon as pierre began to say anything that did not fit in with that aim  the channel was removed and the water could flow to waste
pierre felt  moreover  what the accused always feel at their trial  perplexity as to why these questions were put to him
he had a feeling that it was only out of condescension or a kind of civility that this device of placing a channel was employed
he knew he was in these men's power  that only by force had they brought him there  that force alone gave them the right to demand answers to their questions  and that the sole object of that assembly was to inculpate him
and so  as they had the power and wish to inculpate him  this expedient of an inquiry and trial seemed unnecessary
it was evident that any answer would lead to conviction
when asked what he was doing when he was arrested  pierre replied in a rather tragic manner that he was restoring to its parents a child he had saved from the flames
why had he fought the marauder  pierre answered that he  was protecting a woman   and that  to protect a woman who was being insulted was the duty of every man  that     they interrupted him  for this was not to the point
why was he in the yard of a burning house where witnesses had seen him  he replied that he had gone out to see what was happening in moscow
again they interrupted him  they had not asked where he was going  but why he was found near the fire  who was he  they asked  repeating their first question  which he had declined to answer
again he replied that he could not answer it
 put that down  that's bad  
very bad   sternly remarked the general with the white mustache and red flushed face
on the fourth day fires broke out on the zubovski rampart
pierre and thirteen others were moved to the coach house of a merchant's house near the crimean bridge
on his way through the streets pierre felt stifled by the smoke which seemed to hang over the whole city
fires were visible on all sides
he did not then realize the significance of the burning of moscow  and looked at the fires with horror
he passed four days in the coach house near the crimean bridge and during that time learned  from the talk of the french soldiers  that all those confined there were awaiting a decision which might come any day from the marshal
what marshal this was  pierre could not learn from the soldiers
evidently for them  the marshal  represented a very high and rather mysterious power
these first days  before the eighth of september when the prisoners were had up for a second examination  were the hardest of all for pierre
on the eighth of september an officer a very important one judging by the respect the guards showed him entered the coach house where the prisoners were
this officer  probably someone on the staff  was holding a paper in his hand  and called over all the russians there  naming pierre as  the man who does not give his name   glancing indolently and indifferently at all the prisoners  he ordered the officer in charge to have them decently dressed and tidied up before taking them to the marshal
an hour later a squad of soldiers arrived and pierre with thirteen others was led to the virgin's field
it was a fine day  sunny after rain  and the air was unusually pure
the smoke did not hang low as on the day when pierre had been taken from the guardhouse on the zubovski rampart  but rose through the pure air in columns
no flames were seen  but columns of smoke rose on all sides  and all moscow as far as pierre could see was one vast charred ruin
on all sides there were waste spaces with only stoves and chimney stacks still standing  and here and there the blackened walls of some brick houses
pierre gazed at the ruins and did not recognize districts he had known well
here and there he could see churches that had not been burned
the kremlin  which was not destroyed  gleamed white in the distance with its towers and the belfry of ivan the great
the domes of the new convent of the virgin glittered brightly and its bells were ringing particularly clearly
these bells reminded pierre that it was sunday and the feast of the nativity of the virgin
but there seemed to be no one to celebrate this holiday  everywhere were blackened ruins  and the few russians to be seen were tattered and frightened people who tried to hide when they saw the french
it was plain that the russian nest was ruined and destroyed  but in place of the russian order of life that had been destroyed  pierre unconsciously felt that a quite different  firm  french order had been established over this ruined nest
he felt this in the looks of the soldiers who  marching in regular ranks briskly and gaily  were escorting him and the other criminals  he felt it in the looks of an important french official in a carriage and pair driven by a soldier  whom they met on the way
he felt it in the merry sounds of regimental music he heard from the left side of the field  and felt and realized it especially from the list of prisoners the french officer had read out when he came that morning
pierre had been taken by one set of soldiers and led first to one and then to another place with dozens of other men  and it seemed that they might have forgotten him  or confused him with the others
but no  the answers he had given when questioned had come back to him in his designation as  the man who does not give his name   and under that appellation  which to pierre seemed terrible  they were now leading him somewhere with unhesitating assurance on their faces that he and all the other prisoners were exactly the ones they wanted and that they were being taken to the proper place
pierre felt himself to be an insignificant chip fallen among the wheels of a machine whose action he did not understand but which was working well he and the other prisoners were taken to the right side of the virgin's field  to a large white house with an immense garden not far from the convent
this was prince shcherbitov's house  where pierre had often been in other days  and which  as he learned from the talk of the soldiers  was now occupied by the marshal  the duke of eckmuhl  davout 
they were taken to the entrance and led into the house one by one
pierre was the sixth to enter
he was conducted through a glass gallery  an anteroom  and a hall  which were familiar to him  into a long low study at the door of which stood an adjutant
davout  spectacles on nose  sat bent over a table at the further end of the room
pierre went close up to him  but davout  evidently consulting a paper that lay before him  did not look up
without raising his eyes  he said in a low voice   who are you   pierre was silent because he was incapable of uttering a word
to him davout was not merely a french general  but a man notorious for his cruelty
looking at his cold face  as he sat like a stern schoolmaster who was prepared to wait awhile for an answer  pierre felt that every instant of delay might cost him his life  but he did not know what to say
he did not venture to repeat what he had said at his first examination  yet to disclose his rank and position was dangerous and embarrassing
so he was silent
but before he had decided what to do  davout raised his head  pushed his spectacles back on his forehead  screwed up his eyes  and looked intently at him
 i know that man   he said in a cold  measured tone  evidently calculated to frighten pierre
the chill that had been running down pierre's back now seized his head as in a vise
 you cannot know me  general  i have never seen you      he is a russian spy   davout interrupted  addressing another general who was present  but whom pierre had not noticed
davout turned away
with an unexpected reverberation in his voice pierre rapidly began   no  monseigneur   he said  suddenly remembering that davout was a duke
 no  monseigneur  you cannot have known me
i am a militia officer and have not quitted moscow    your name   asked davout
 bezukhov    what proof have i that you are not lying    monseigneur   exclaimed pierre  not in an offended but in a pleading voice
davout looked up and gazed intently at him
for some seconds they looked at one another  and that look saved pierre
apart from conditions of war and law  that look established human relations between the two men
at that moment an immense number of things passed dimly through both their minds  and they realized that they were both children of humanity and were brothers
at the first glance  when davout had only raised his head from the papers where human affairs and lives were indicated by numbers  pierre was merely a circumstance  and davout could have shot him without burdening his conscience with an evil deed  but now he saw in him a human being he reflected for a moment
 how can you show me that you are telling the truth   said davout coldly
pierre remembered ramballe  and named him and his regiment and the street where the house was
 you are not what you say   returned davout
in a trembling  faltering voice pierre began adducing proofs of the truth of his statements
but at that moment an adjutant entered and reported something to davout
davout brightened up at the news the adjutant brought  and began buttoning up his uniform
it seemed that he had quite forgotten pierre
when the adjutant reminded him of the prisoner  he jerked his head in pierre's direction with a frown and ordered him to be led away
but where they were to take him pierre did not know  back to the coach house or to the place of execution his companions had pointed out to him as they crossed the virgin's field
he turned his head and saw that the adjutant was putting another question to davout
 yes  of course   replied davout  but what this  yes  meant  pierre did not know
pierre could not afterwards remember how he went  whether it was far  or in which direction
his faculties were quite numbed  he was stupefied  and noticing nothing around him went on moving his legs as the others did till they all stopped and he stopped too
the only thought in his mind at that time was  who was it that had really sentenced him to death  not the men on the commission that had first examined him not one of them wished to or  evidently  could have done it
it was not davout  who had looked at him in so human a way
in another moment davout would have realized that he was doing wrong  but just then the adjutant had come in and interrupted him
the adjutant  also  had evidently had no evil intent though he might have refrained from coming in
then who was executing him  killing him  depriving him of life him  pierre  with all his memories  aspirations  hopes  and thoughts  who was doing this  and pierre felt that it was no one
it was a system a concurrence of circumstances a system of some sort was killing him pierre depriving him of life  of everything  annihilating him
from prince shcherbatov's house the prisoners were led straight down the virgin's field  to the left of the nunnery  as far as a kitchen garden in which a post had been set up
beyond that post a fresh pit had been dug in the ground  and near the post and the pit a large crowd stood in a semicircle
the crowd consisted of a few russians and many of napoleon's soldiers who were not on duty germans  italians  and frenchmen  in a variety of uniforms to the right and left of the post stood rows of french troops in blue uniforms with red epaulets and high boots and shakos the prisoners were placed in a certain order  according to the list  pierre was sixth   and were led to the post
several drums suddenly began to beat on both sides of them  and at that sound pierre felt as if part of his soul had been torn away he lost the power of thinking or understanding
he could only hear and see
and he had only one wish that the frightful thing that had to happen should happen quickly
pierre looked round at his fellow prisoners and scrutinized them
the two first were convicts with shaven heads
one was tall and thin  the other dark  shaggy  and sinewy  with a flat nose
the third was a domestic serf  about forty five years old  with grizzled hair and a plump  well nourished body
the fourth was a peasant  a very handsome man with a broad  lightbrown beard and black eyes
the fifth was a factory hand  a thin  sallow faced lad of eighteen in a loose coat
pierre heard the french consulting whether to shoot them separately or two at a time
 in couples   replied the officer in command in a calm voice
there was a stir in the ranks of the soldiers and it was evident that they were all hurrying not as men hurry to do something they understand  but as people hurry to finish a necessary but unpleasant and incomprehensible task
a french official wearing a scarf came up to the right of the row of prisoners and read out the sentence in russian and in french
then two pairs of frenchmen approached the criminals and at the officer's command took the two convicts who stood first in the row
the convicts stopped when they reached the post and  while sacks were being brought  looked dumbly around as a wounded beast looks at an approaching huntsman
one crossed himself continually  the other scratched his back and made a movement of the lips resembling a smile with hurried hands the soldiers blindfolded them  drawing the sacks over their heads  and bound them to the post
twelve sharpshooters with muskets stepped out of the ranks with a firm regular tread and halted eight paces from the post
pierre turned away to avoid seeing what was going to happen
suddenly a crackling  rolling noise was heard which seemed to him louder than the most terrific thunder  and he looked round
there was some smoke  and the frenchmen were doing something near the pit  with pale faces and trembling hands
two more prisoners were led up
in the same way and with similar looks  these two glanced vainly at the onlookers with only a silent appeal for protection in their eyes  evidently unable to understand or believe what was going to happen to them
they could not believe it because they alone knew what their life meant to them  and so they neither understood nor believed that it could be taken from them
again pierre did not wish to look and again turned away  but again the sound as of a frightful explosion struck his ear  and at the same moment he saw smoke  blood  and the pale  scared faces of the frenchmen who were again doing something by the post  their trembling hands impeding one another
pierre  breathing heavily  looked around as if asking what it meant
the same question was expressed in all the looks that met his
on the faces of all the russians and of the french soldiers and officers without exception  he read the same dismay  horror  and conflict that were in his own heart
 but who  after all  is doing this  they are all suffering as i am
who then is it  who   flashed for an instant through his mind
 sharpshooters of the 86th  forward   shouted someone
the fifth prisoner  the one next to pierre  was led away alone
pierre did not understand that he was saved  that he and the rest had been brought there only to witness the execution
with ever growing horror  and no sense of joy or relief  he gazed at what was taking place
the fifth man was the factory lad in the loose cloak
the moment they laid hands on him he sprang aside in terror and clutched at pierre
 pierre shuddered and shook himself free   the lad was unable to walk they dragged him along  holding him up under the arms  and he screamed when they got him to the post he grew quiet  as if he suddenly understood something
whether he understood that screaming was useless or whether he thought it incredible that men should kill him  at any rate he took his stand at the post  waiting to be blindfolded like the others  and like a wounded animal looked around him with glittering eyes
pierre was no longer able to turn away and close his eyes
his curiosity and agitation  like that of the whole crowd  reached the highest pitch at this fifth murder
like the others this fifth man seemed calm  he wrapped his loose cloak closer and rubbed one bare foot with the other
when they began to blindfold him he himself adjusted the knot which hurt the back of his head  then when they propped him against the bloodstained post  he leaned back and  not being comfortable in that position  straightened himself  adjusted his feet  and leaned back again more comfortably pierre did not take his eyes from him and did not miss his slightest movement
probably a word of command was given and was followed by the reports of eight muskets  but try as he would pierre could not afterwards remember having heard the slightest sound of the shots
he only saw how the workman suddenly sank down on the cords that held him  how blood showed itself in two places  how the ropes slackened under the weight of the hanging body  and how the workman sat down  his head hanging unnaturally and one leg bent under him
pierre ran up to the post
no one hindered him
pale  frightened people were doing something around the workman
the lower jaw of an old frenchman with a thick mustache trembled as he untied the ropes
the body collapsed
the soldiers dragged it awkwardly from the post and began pushing it into the pit
they all plainly and certainly knew that they were criminals who must hide the traces of their guilt as quickly as possible
pierre glanced into the pit and saw that the factory lad was lying with his knees close up to his head and one shoulder higher than the other
that shoulder rose and fell rhythmically and convulsively  but spadefuls of earth were already being thrown over the whole body
one of the soldiers  evidently suffering  shouted gruffly and angrily at pierre to go back
but pierre did not understand him and remained near the post  and no one drove him away
when the pit had been filled up a command was given
pierre was taken back to his place  and the rows of troops on both sides of the post made a half turn and went past it at a measured pace
the twenty four sharpshooters with discharged muskets  standing in the center of the circle  ran back to their places as the companies passed by
pierre gazed now with dazed eyes at these sharpshooters who ran in couples out of the circle
all but one rejoined their companies
this one  a young soldier  his face deadly pale  his shako pushed back  and his musket resting on the ground  still stood near the pit at the spot from which he had fired
he swayed like a drunken man  taking some steps forward and back to save himself from falling an old  noncommissioned officer ran out of the ranks and taking him by the elbow dragged him to his company
the crowd of russians and frenchmen began to disperse
they all went away silently and with drooping heads
 that will teach them to start fires   said one of the frenchmen
pierre glanced round at the speaker and saw that it was a soldier who was trying to find some relief after what had been done  but was not able to do so
without finishing what he had begun to say he made a hopeless movement with his arm and went away
after the execution pierre was separated from the rest of the prisoners and placed alone in a small  ruined  and befouled church
toward evening a noncommissioned officer entered with two soldiers and told him that he had been pardoned and would now go to the barracks for the prisoners of war
without understanding what was said to him  pierre got up and went with the soldiers
they took him to the upper end of the field  where there were some sheds built of charred planks  beams  and battens  and led him into one of them in the darkness some twenty different men surrounded pierre
he looked at them without understanding who they were  why they were there  or what they wanted of him
he heard what they said  but did not understand the meaning of the words and made no kind of deduction from or application of them
he replied to questions they put to him  but did not consider who was listening to his replies  nor how they would understand them
he looked at their faces and figures  but they all seemed to him equally meaningless
from the moment pierre had witnessed those terrible murders committed by men who did not wish to commit them  it was as if the mainspring of his life  on which everything depended and which made everything appear alive  had suddenly been wrenched out and everything had collapsed into a heap of meaningless rubbish
though he did not acknowledge it to himself  his faith in the right ordering of the universe  in humanity  in his own soul  and in god  had been destroyed he had experienced this before  but never so strongly as now
when similar doubts had assailed him before  they had been the result of his own wrongdoing  and at the bottom of his heart he had felt that relief from his despair and from those doubts was to be found within himself but now he felt that the universe had crumbled before his eyes and only meaningless ruins remained  and this not by any fault of his own
he felt that it was not in his power to regain faith in the meaning of life
around him in the darkness men were standing and evidently something about him interested them greatly
they were telling him something and asking him something
then they led him away somewhere  and at last he found himself in a corner of the shed among men who were laughing and talking on all sides  well  then  mates  
that very prince who     some voice at the other end of the shed was saying  with a strong emphasis on the word who
sitting silent and motionless on a heap of straw against the wall  pierre sometimes opened and sometimes closed his eyes
but as soon as he closed them he saw before him the dreadful face of the factory lad especially dreadful because of its simplicity and the faces of the murderers  even more dreadful because of their disquiet
and he opened his eyes again and stared vacantly into the darkness around him
beside him in a stooping position sat a small man of whose presence he was first made aware by a strong smell of perspiration which came from him every time he moved
this man was doing something to his legs in the darkness  and though pierre could not see his face he felt that the man continually glanced at him
on growing used to the darkness pierre saw that the man was taking off his leg bands  and the way he did it aroused pierre's interest
having unwound the string that tied the band on one leg  he carefully coiled it up and immediately set to work on the other leg  glancing up at pierre
while one hand hung up the first string the other was already unwinding the band on the second leg
in this way  having carefully removed the leg bands by deft circular motions of his arm following one another uninterruptedly  the man hung the leg bands up on some pegs fixed above his head
then he took out a knife  cut something  closed the knife  placed it under the head of his bed  and  seating himself comfortably  clasped his arms round his lifted knees and fixed his eyes on pierre the latter was conscious of something pleasant  comforting  and well rounded in these deft movements  in the man's wellordered arrangements in his corner  and even in his very smell  and he looked at the man without taking his eyes from him
 you've seen a lot of trouble  sir  eh   the little man suddenly said
and there was so much kindliness and simplicity in his singsong voice that pierre tried to reply  but his jaw trembled and he felt tears rising to his eyes
the little fellow  giving pierre no time to betray his confusion  instantly continued in the same pleasant tones   eh  lad  don't fret   said he  in the tender singsong caressing voice old russian peasant women employ
 don't fret  friend 'suffer an hour  live for an age ' that's how it is  my dear fellow
and here we live  thank heaven  without offense
among these folk  too  there are good men as well as bad   said he  and still speaking  he turned on his knees with a supple movement  got up  coughed  and went off to another part of the shed
 eh  you rascal   pierre heard the same kind voice saying at the other end of the shed
 so you've come  you rascal  she remembers  
now  now  that'll do   and the soldier  pushing away a little dog that was jumping up at him  returned to his place and sat down
in his hands he had something wrapped in a rag
 here  eat a bit  sir   said he  resuming his former respectful tone as he unwrapped and offered pierre some baked potatoes
 we had soup for dinner and the potatoes are grand   pierre had not eaten all day and the smell of the potatoes seemed extremely pleasant to him
he thanked the soldier and began to eat
 well  are they all right   said the soldier with a smile
 you should do like this   he took a potato  drew out his clasp knife  cut the potato into two equal halves on the palm of his hand  sprinkled some salt on it from the rag  and handed it to pierre
 the potatoes are grand   he said once more
 eat some like that   pierre thought he had never eaten anything that tasted better
 oh  i'm all right   said he   but why did they shoot those poor fellows  the last one was hardly twenty    tss  tt      said the little man
 ah  what a sin  
what a sin   he added quickly  and as if his words were always waiting ready in his mouth and flew out involuntarily he went on   how was it  sir  that you stayed in moscow    i didn't think they would come so soon
i stayed accidentally   replied pierre
 and how did they arrest you  dear lad  at your house    no  i went to look at the fire  and they arrested me there  and tried me as an incendiary    where there's law there's injustice   put in the little man
 and have you been here long   pierre asked as he munched the last of the potato
 i  it was last sunday they took me  out of a hospital in moscow    why  are you a soldier then    yes  we are soldiers of the apsheron regiment
i was dying of fever
we weren't told anything
there were some twenty of us lying there
we had no idea  never guessed at all    and do you feel sad here   pierre inquired
 how can one help it  lad  my name is platon  and the surname is karataev   he added  evidently wishing to make it easier for pierre to address him
 they call me 'little falcon' in the regiment
how is one to help feeling sad  moscow  she's the mother of cities
how can one see all this and not feel sad  but 'the maggot gnaws the cabbage  yet dies first'  that's what the old folks used to tell us   he added rapidly
 what  what did you say   asked pierre
 who  i   said karataev
 i say things happen not as we plan but as god judges   he replied  thinking that he was repeating what he had said before  and immediately continued   well  and you  have you a family estate  sir  and a house  so you have abundance  then  and a housewife  and your old parents  are they still living   he asked
and though it was too dark for pierre to see  he felt that a suppressed smile of kindliness puckered the soldier's lips as he put these questions
he seemed grieved that pierre had no parents  especially that he had no mother
 a wife for counsel  a mother in law for welcome  but there's none as dear as one's own mother   said he
 well  and have you little ones   he went on asking
again pierre's negative answer seemed to distress him  and he hastened to add   never mind  you're young folks yet  and please god may still have some
the great thing is to live in harmony       but it's all the same now   pierre could not help saying
 ah  my dear fellow   rejoined karataev   never decline a prison or a beggar's sack   he seated himself more comfortably and coughed  evidently preparing to tell a long story  well  my dear fellow  i was still living at home   he began
 we had a wellto do homestead  plenty of land  we peasants lived well and our house was one to thank god for
when father and we went out mowing there were seven of us
we lived well
we were real peasants
it so happened     and platon karataev told a long story of how he had gone into someone's copse to take wood  how he had been caught by the keeper  had been tried  flogged  and sent to serve as a soldier
 well  lad   and a smile changed the tone of his voice  we thought it was a misfortune but it turned out a blessing  if it had not been for my sin  my brother would have had to go as a soldier
but he  my younger brother  had five little ones  while i  you see  only left a wife behind
we had a little girl  but god took her before i went as a soldier
i come home on leave and i'll tell you how it was  i look and see that they are living better than before
the yard full of cattle  the women at home  two brothers away earning wages  and only michael the youngest  at home
father  he says  'all my children are the same to me  it hurts the same whichever finger gets bitten
but if platon hadn't been shaved for a soldier  michael would have had to go ' called us all to him and  will you believe it  placed us in front of the icons
'michael ' he says  'come here and bow down to his feet  and you  young woman  you bow down too  and you  grandchildren  also bow down before him  do you understand ' he says
that's how it is  dear fellow
fate looks for a head
but we are always judging  'that's not well that's not right ' our luck is like water in a dragnet  you pull at it and it bulges  but when you've drawn it out it's empty  that's how it is   and platon shifted his seat on the straw
after a short silence he rose
 well  i think you must be sleepy   said he  and began rapidly crossing himself and repeating   lord jesus christ  holy saint nicholas  frola and lavra  lord jesus christ  holy saint nicholas  frola and lavra  lord jesus christ  have mercy on us and save us   he concluded  then bowed to the ground  got up  sighed  and sat down again on his heap of straw  that's the way
lay me down like a stone  o god  and raise me up like a loaf   he muttered as he lay down  pulling his coat over him
 what prayer was that you were saying   asked pierre
 eh   murmured platon  who had almost fallen asleep
 what was i saying  i was praying
don't you pray    yes  i do   said pierre
 but what was that you said  frola and lavra    well  of course   replied platon quickly   the horses' saints
one must pity the animals too
eh  the rascal  now you've curled up and got warm  you daughter of a bitch   said karataev  touching the dog that lay at his feet  and again turning over he fell asleep immediately
sounds of crying and screaming came from somewhere in the distance outside  and flames were visible through the cracks of the shed  but inside it was quiet and dark
for a long time pierre did not sleep  but lay with eyes open in the darkness  listening to the regular snoring of platon who lay beside him  and he felt that the world that had been shattered was once more stirring in his soul with a new beauty and on new and unshakable foundations
twenty three soldiers  three officers  and two officials were confined in the shed in which pierre had been placed and where he remained for four weeks
when pierre remembered them afterwards they all seemed misty figures to him except platon karataev  who always remained in his mind a most vivid and precious memory and the personification of everything russian  kindly  and round
when pierre saw his neighbor next morning at dawn the first impression of him  as of something round  was fully confirmed  platon's whole figure in a french overcoat girdled with a cord  a soldier's cap  and bast shoes was round
his head was quite round  his back  chest  shoulders  and even his arms  which he held as if ever ready to embrace something  were rounded  his pleasant smile and his large  gentle brown eyes were also round platon karataev must have been fifty  judging by his stories of campaigns he had been in  told as by an old soldier
he did not himself know his age and was quite unable to determine it but his brilliantly white  strong teeth which showed in two unbroken semicircles when he laughed as he often did were all sound and good  there was not a gray hair in his beard or on his head  and his whole body gave an impression of suppleness and especially of firmness and endurance
his face  despite its fine  rounded wrinkles  had an expression of innocence and youth  his voice was pleasant and musical
but the chief peculiarity of his speech was its directness and appositeness
it was evident that he never considered what he had said or was going to say  and consequently the rapidity and justice of his intonation had an irresistible persuasiveness
his physical strength and agility during the first days of his imprisonment were such that he seemed not to know what fatigue and sickness meant
every night before lying down  he said   lord  lay me down as a stone and raise me up as a loaf   and every morning on getting up  he said   i lay down and curled up  i get up and shake myself   and indeed he only had to lie down  to fall asleep like a stone  and he only had to shake himself  to be ready without a moment's delay for some work  just as children are ready to play directly they awake he could do everything  not very well but not badly
he baked  cooked  sewed  planed  and mended boots
he was always busy  and only at night allowed himself conversation of which he was fond and songs he did not sing like a trained singer who knows he is listened to  but like the birds  evidently giving vent to the sounds in the same way that one stretches oneself or walks about to get rid of stiffness  and the sounds were always highpitched  mournful  delicate  and almost feminine  and his face at such times was very serious having been taken prisoner and allowed his beard to grow  he seemed to have thrown off all that had been forced upon him everything military and alien to himself and had returned to his former peasant habits  a soldier on leave a shirt outside breeches   he would say
he did not like talking about his life as a soldier  though he did not complain  and often mentioned that he had not been flogged once during the whole of his army service
when he related anything it was generally some old and evidently precious memory of his  christian  life  as he called his peasant existence
the proverbs  of which his talk was full  were for the most part not the coarse and indecent saws soldiers employ  but those folk sayings which taken without a context seem so insignificant  but when used appositely suddenly acquire a significance of profound wisdom
he would often say the exact opposite of what he had said on a previous occasion  yet both would be right
he liked to talk and he talked well  adorning his speech with terms of endearment and with folk sayings which pierre thought he invented himself  but the chief charm of his talk lay in the fact that the commonest events sometimes just such as pierre had witnessed without taking notice of them assumed in karataev's a character of solemn fitness he liked to hear the folk tales one of the soldiers used to tell of an evening  they were always the same   but most of all he liked to hear stories of real life
he would smile joyfully when listening to such stories  now and then putting in a word or asking a question to make the moral beauty of what he was told clear to himself karataev had no attachments  friendships  or love  as pierre understood them  but loved and lived affectionately with everything life brought him in contact with  particularly with man not any particular man  but those with whom he happened to be
he loved his dog  his comrades  the french  and pierre who was his neighbor  but pierre felt that in spite of karataev's affectionate tenderness for him  by which he unconsciously gave pierre's spiritual life its due  he would not have grieved for a moment at parting from him and pierre began to feel in the same way toward karataev
to all the other prisoners platon karataev seemed a most ordinary soldier
they called him  little falcon  or  platosha   chaffed him good naturedly  and sent him on errands
but to pierre he always remained what he had seemed that first night  an unfathomable  rounded  eternal personification of the spirit of simplicity and truth
platon karataev knew nothing by heart except his prayers
when he began to speak he seemed not to know how he would conclude
sometimes pierre  struck by the meaning of his words  would ask him to repeat them  but platon could never recall what he had said a moment before  just as he never could repeat to pierre the words of his favorite song  native and birch tree and my heart is sick occurred in it  but when spoken and not sung  no meaning could be got out of it
he did not  and could not  understand the meaning of words apart from their context
every word and action of his was the manifestation of an activity unknown to him  which was his life
but his life  as he regarded it  had no meaning as a separate thing
it had meaning only as part of a whole of which he was always conscious
his words and actions flowed from him as evenly  inevitably  and spontaneously as fragrance exhales from a flower
he could not understand the value or significance of any word or deed taken separately
when princess mary heard from nicholas that her brother was with the rostovs at yaroslavl she at once prepared to go there  in spite of her aunt's efforts to dissuade her and not merely to go herself but to take her nephew with her
whether it were difficult or easy  possible or impossible  she did not ask and did not want to know  it was her duty  not only to herself  to be near her brother who was perhaps dying  but to do everything possible to take his son to him  and so she prepared to set off
that she had not heard from prince andrew himself  princess mary attributed to his being too weak to write or to his considering the long journey too hard and too dangerous for her and his son in a few days princess mary was ready to start
her equipages were the huge family coach in which she had traveled to voronezh  a semiopen trap  and a baggage cart
with her traveled mademoiselle bourienne  little nicholas and his tutor  her old nurse  three maids  tikhon  and a young footman and courier her aunt had sent to accompany her
the usual route through moscow could not be thought of  and the roundabout way princess mary was obliged to take through lipetsk  ryazan  vladimir  and shuya was very long and  as post horses were not everywhere obtainable  very difficult  and near ryazan where the french were said to have shown themselves was even dangerous during this difficult journey mademoiselle bourienne  dessalles  and princess mary's servants were astonished at her energy and firmness of spirit
she went to bed later and rose earlier than any of them  and no difficulties daunted her
thanks to her activity and energy  which infected her fellow travelers  they approached yaroslavl by the end of the second week
the last days of her stay in voronezh had been the happiest of her life
her love for rostov no longer tormented or agitated her
it filled her whole soul  had become an integral part of herself  and she no longer struggled against it
latterly she had become convinced that she loved and was beloved  though she never said this definitely to herself in words
she had become convinced of it at her last interview with nicholas  when he had come to tell her that her brother was with the rostovs
not by a single word had nicholas alluded to the fact that prince andrew's relations with natasha might  if he recovered  be renewed  but princess mary saw by his face that he knew and thought of this
yet in spite of that  his relation to her considerate  delicate  and loving not only remained unchanged  but it sometimes seemed to princess mary that he was even glad that the family connection between them allowed him to express his friendship more freely
she knew that she loved for the first and only time in her life and felt that she was beloved  and was happy in regard to it
but this happiness on one side of her spiritual nature did not prevent her feeling grief for her brother with full force  on the contrary  that spiritual tranquility on the one side made it the more possible for her to give full play to her feeling for her brother
that feeling was so strong at the moment of leaving voronezh that those who saw her off  as they looked at her careworn  despairing face  felt sure she would fall ill on the journey
but the very difficulties and preoccupations of the journey  which she took so actively in hand  saved her for a while from her grief and gave her strength
as always happens when traveling  princess mary thought only of the journey itself  forgetting its object
but as she approached yaroslavl the thought of what might await her there not after many days  but that very evening  again presented itself to her and her agitation increased to its utmost limit
the courier who had been sent on in advance to find out where the rostovs were staying in yaroslavl  and in what condition prince andrew was  when he met the big coach just entering the town gates was appalled by the terrible pallor of the princess' face that looked out at him from the window
 i have found out everything  your excellency  the rostovs are staying at the merchant bronnikov's house  in the square not far from here  right above the volga   said the courier
princess mary looked at him with frightened inquiry  not understanding why he did not reply to what she chiefly wanted to know  how was her brother  mademoiselle bourienne put that question for her
 how is the prince   she asked
 his excellency is staying in the same house with them    then he is alive   thought princess mary  and asked in a low voice   how is he    the servants say he is still the same   what  still the same  might mean princess mary did not ask  but with an unnoticed glance at little seven year old nicholas  who was sitting in front of her looking with pleasure at the town  she bowed her head and did not raise it again till the heavy coach  rumbling  shaking and swaying  came to a stop
the carriage steps clattered as they were let down
the carriage door was opened
on the left there was water a great river  and on the right a porch
there were people at the entrance  servants  and a rosy girl with a large plait of black hair  smiling as it seemed to princess mary in an unpleasantly affected way
 this was sonya   princess mary ran up the steps
 this way  this way   said the girl  with the same artificial smile  and the princess found herself in the hall facing an elderly woman of oriental type  who came rapidly to meet her with a look of emotion
this was the countess
she embraced princess mary and kissed her
 mon enfant   she muttered   je vous aime et vous connais depuis longtemps   * *  my child  i love you and have known you a long time   despite her excitement  princess mary realized that this was the countess and that it was necessary to say something to her
hardly knowing how she did it  she contrived to utter a few polite phrases in french in the same tone as those that had been addressed to her  and asked   how is he    the doctor says that he is not in danger   said the countess  but as she spoke she raised her eyes with a sigh  and her gesture conveyed a contradiction of her words
 where is he  can i see him can i   asked the princess
 one moment  princess  one moment  my dear  is this his son   said the countess  turning to little nicholas who was coming in with dessalles
 there will be room for everybody  this is a big house
oh  what a lovely boy   the countess took princess mary into the drawing room  where sonya was talking to mademoiselle bourienne
the countess caressed the boy  and the old count came in and welcomed the princess
he had changed very much since princess mary had last seen him
then he had been a brisk  cheerful  self assured old man  now he seemed a pitiful  bewildered person
while talking to princess mary he continually looked round as if asking everyone whether he was doing the right thing
after the destruction of moscow and of his property  thrown out of his accustomed groove he seemed to have lost the sense of his own significance and to feel that there was no longer a place for him in life
in spite of her one desire to see her brother as soon as possible  and her vexation that at the moment when all she wanted was to see him they should be trying to entertain her and pretending to admire her nephew  the princess noticed all that was going on around her and felt the necessity of submitting  for a time  to this new order of things which she had entered
she knew it to be necessary  and though it was hard for her she was not vexed with these people
 this is my niece   said the count  introducing sonya  you don't know her  princess   princess mary turned to sonya and  trying to stifle the hostile feeling that arose in her toward the girl  she kissed her
but she felt oppressed by the fact that the mood of everyone around her was so far from what was in her own heart
 where is he   she asked again  addressing them all
 he is downstairs
natasha is with him   answered sonya  flushing
 we have sent to ask
i think you must be tired  princess   tears of vexation showed themselves in princess mary's eyes she turned away and was about to ask the countess again how to go to him  when light  impetuous  and seemingly buoyant steps were heard at the door
the princess looked round and saw natasha coming in  almost running that natasha whom she had liked so little at their meeting in moscow long since
but hardly had the princess looked at natasha's face before she realized that here was a real comrade in her grief  and consequently a friend she ran to meet her  embraced her  and began to cry on her shoulder
as soon as natasha  sitting at the head of prince andrew's bed  heard of princess mary's arrival  she softly left his room and hastened to her with those swift steps that had sounded buoyant to princess mary
there was only one expression on her agitated face when she ran into the drawing room that of love boundless love for him  for her  and for all that was near to the man she loved  and of pity  suffering for others  and passionate desire to give herself entirely to helping them
it was plain that at that moment there was in natasha's heart no thought of herself or of her own relations with prince andrew
princess mary  with her acute sensibility  understood all this at the first glance at natasha's face  and wept on her shoulder with sorrowful pleasure
 come  come to him  mary   said natasha  leading her into the other room
princess mary raised her head  dried her eyes  and turned to natasha
she felt that from her she would be able to understand and learn everything
 how     she began her question but stopped short
she felt that it was impossible to ask  or to answer  in words
natasha's face and eyes would have to tell her all more clearly and profoundly
natasha was gazing at her  but seemed afraid and in doubt whether to say all she knew or not  she seemed to feel that before those luminous eyes which penetrated into the very depths of her heart  it was impossible not to tell the whole truth which she saw
and suddenly  natasha's lips twitched  ugly wrinkles gathered round her mouth  and covering her face with her hands she burst into sobs
princess mary understood
but she still hoped  and asked  in words she herself did not trust   but how is his wound  what is his general condition    you  you  
will see   was all natasha could say
they sat a little while downstairs near his room till they had left off crying and were able to go to him with calm faces
 how has his whole illness gone  is it long since he grew worse  when did this happen   princess mary inquired
natasha told her that at first there had been danger from his feverish condition and the pain he suffered  but at troitsa that had passed and the doctor had only been afraid of gangrene
that danger had also passed
when they reached yaroslavl the wound had begun to fester  natasha knew all about such things as festering  and the doctor had said that the festering might take a normal course
then fever set in  but the doctor had said the fever was not very serious
 but two days ago this suddenly happened   said natasha  struggling with her sobs
 i don't know why  but you will see what he is like    is he weaker  thinner   asked the princess
 no  it's not that  but worse
you will see
o  mary  he is too good  he cannot  cannot live  because     when natasha opened prince andrew's door with a familiar movement and let princess mary pass into the room before her  the princess felt the sobs in her throat
hard as she had tried to prepare herself  and now tried to remain tranquil  she knew that she would be unable to look at him without tears
the princess understood what natasha had meant by the words   two days ago this suddenly happened   she understood those words to mean that he had suddenly softened and that this softening and gentleness were signs of approaching death
as she stepped to the door she already saw in imagination andrew's face as she remembered it in childhood  a gentle  mild  sympathetic face which he had rarely shown  and which therefore affected her very strongly
she was sure he would speak soft  tender words to her such as her father had uttered before his death  and that she would not be able to bear it and would burst into sobs in his presence
yet sooner or later it had to be  and she went in
the sobs rose higher and higher in her throat as she more and more clearly distinguished his form and her shortsighted eyes tried to make out his features  and then she saw his face and met his gaze
he was lying in a squirrel fur dressing gown on a divan  surrounded by pillows
he was thin and pale
in one thin  translucently white hand he held a handkerchief  while with the other he stroked the delicate mustache he had grown  moving his fingers slowly
his eyes gazed at them as they entered
on seeing his face and meeting his eyes princess mary's pace suddenly slackened  she felt her tears dry up and her sobs ceased
she suddenly felt guilty and grew timid on catching the expression of his face and eyes
 but in what am i to blame   she asked herself
and his cold  stern look replied   because you are alive and thinking of the living  while i     in the deep gaze that seemed to look not outwards but inwards there was an almost hostile expression as he slowly regarded his sister and natasha
he kissed his sister  holding her hand in his as was their wont
 how are you  mary  how did you manage to get here   said he in a voice as calm and aloof as his look
had he screamed in agony  that scream would not have struck such horror into princess mary's heart as the tone of his voice
 and have you brought little nicholas   he asked in the same slow  quiet manner and with an obvious effort to remember
 how are you now   said princess mary  herself surprised at what she was saying
 that  my dear  you must ask the doctor   he replied  and again making an evident effort to be affectionate  he said with his lips only  his words clearly did not correspond to his thoughts    merci  chere amie  d'etre venue   * *  thank you for coming  my dear   princess mary pressed his hand
the pressure made him wince just perceptibly
he was silent  and she did not know what to say
she now understood what had happened to him two days before
in his words  his tone  and especially in that calm  almost antagonistic look could be felt an estrangement from everything belonging to this world  terrible in one who is alive
evidently only with an effort did he understand anything living  but it was obvious that he failed to understand  not because he lacked the power to do so but because he understood something else something the living did not and could not understand and which wholly occupied his mind
 there  you see how strangely fate has brought us together   said he  breaking the silence and pointing to natasha
 she looks after me all the time   princess mary heard him and did not understand how he could say such a thing
he  the sensitive  tender prince andrew  how could he say that  before her whom he loved and who loved him  had he expected to live he could not have said those words in that offensively cold tone
if he had not known that he was dying  how could he have failed to pity her and how could he speak like that in her presence  the only explanation was that he was indifferent  because something else  much more important  had been revealed to him
the conversation was cold and disconnected and continually broke off
 mary came by way of ryazan   said natasha
prince andrew did not notice that she called his sister mary  and only after calling her so in his presence did natasha notice it herself
 really   he asked
 they told her that all moscow has been burned down  and that     natasha stopped
it was impossible to talk
it was plain that he was making an effort to listen  but could not do so
 yes  they say it's burned   he said
 it's a great pity   and he gazed straight before him  absently stroking his mustache with his fingers
 and so you have met count nicholas  mary   prince andrew suddenly said  evidently wishing to speak pleasantly to them
 he wrote here that he took a great liking to you   he went on simply and calmly  evidently unable to understand all the complex significance his words had for living people
 if you liked him too  it would be a good thing for you to get married   he added rather more quickly  as if pleased at having found words he had long been seeking
princess mary heard his words but they had no meaning for her  except as a proof of how far away he now was from everything living
 why talk of me   she said quietly and glanced at natasha
natasha  who felt her glance  did not look at her
all three were again silent
 andrew  would you like     princess mary suddenly said in a trembling voice   would you like to see little nicholas  he is always talking about you   prince andrew smiled just perceptibly and for the first time  but princess mary  who knew his face so well  saw with horror that he did not smile with pleasure or affection for his son  but with quiet  gentle irony because he thought she was trying what she believed to be the last means of arousing him
 yes  i shall be very glad to see him
is he quite well   when little nicholas was brought into prince andrew's room he looked at his father with frightened eyes  but did not cry  because no one else was crying
prince andrew kissed him and evidently did not know what to say to him
when nicholas had been led away  princess mary again went up to her brother  kissed him  and unable to restrain her tears any longer began to cry
he looked at her attentively
 is it about nicholas   he asked
princess mary nodded her head  weeping
 mary  you know the gosp     but he broke off
 what did you say    nothing
you mustn't cry here   he said  looking at her with the same cold expression
when princess mary began to cry  he understood that she was crying at the thought that little nicholas would be left without a father
with a great effort he tried to return to life and to see things from their point of view
 yes  to them it must seem sad   he thought
 but how simple it is
 the fowls of the air sow not  neither do they reap  yet your father feedeth them   he said to himself and wished to say to princess mary   but no  they will take it their own way  they won't understand  they can't understand that all those feelings they prize so all our feelings  all those ideas that seem so important to us  are unnecessary we cannot understand one another   and he remained silent
prince andrew's little son was seven
he could scarcely read  and knew nothing
after that day he lived through many things  gaining knowledge  observation  and experience  but had he possessed all the faculties he afterwards acquired  he could not have had a better or more profound understanding of the meaning of the scene he had witnessed between his father  mary  and natasha  than he had then
he understood it completely  and  leaving the room without crying  went silently up to natasha who had come out with him and looked shyly at her with his beautiful  thoughtful eyes  then his uplifted  rosy upper lip trembled and leaning his head against her he began to cry
after that he avoided dessalles and the countess who caressed him and either sat alone or came timidly to princess mary  or to natasha of whom he seemed even fonder than of his aunt  and clung to them quietly and shyly
when princess mary had left prince andrew she fully understood what natasha's face had told her
she did not speak any more to natasha of hopes of saving his life
she took turns with her beside his sofa  and did not cry any more  but prayed continually  turning in soul to that eternal and unfathomable  whose presence above the dying man was now so evident
not only did prince andrew know he would die  but he felt that he was dying and was already half dead
he was conscious of an aloofness from everything earthly and a strange and joyous lightness of existence
without haste or agitation he awaited what was coming
that inexorable  eternal  distant  and unknown the presence of which he had felt continually all his life was now near to him and  by the strange lightness he experienced  almost comprehensible and palpable  
formerly he had feared the end
he had twice experienced that terribly tormenting fear of death the end but now he no longer understood that fear
he had felt it for the first time when the shell spun like a top before him  and he looked at the fallow field  the bushes  and the sky  and knew that he was face to face with death
when he came to himself after being wounded and the flower of eternal  unfettered love had instantly unfolded itself in his soul as if freed from the bondage of life that had restrained it  he no longer feared death and ceased to think about it during the hours of solitude  suffering  and partial delirium he spent after he was wounded  the more deeply he penetrated into the new principle of eternal love revealed to him  the more he unconsciously detached himself from earthly life to love everything and everybody and always to sacrifice oneself for love meant not to love anyone  not to live this earthly life
and the more imbued he became with that principle of love  the more he renounced life and the more completely he destroyed that dreadful barrier which in the absence of such love stands between life and death
when during those first days he remembered that he would have to die  he said to himself   well  what of it  so much the better   but after the night in mytishchi when  half delirious  he had seen her for whom he longed appear before him and  having pressed her hand to his lips  had shed gentle  happy tears  love for a particular woman again crept unobserved into his heart and once more bound him to life and joyful and agitating thoughts began to occupy his mind
recalling the moment at the ambulance station when he had seen kuragin  he could not now regain the feeling he then had  but was tormented by the question whether kuragin was alive
and he dared not inquire
his illness pursued its normal physical course  but what natasha referred to when she said   this suddenly happened   had occurred two days before princess mary arrived
it was the last spiritual struggle between life and death  in which death gained the victory
it was the unexpected realization of the fact that he still valued life as presented to him in the form of his love for natasha  and a last  though ultimately vanquished  attack of terror before the unknown
it was evening
as usual after dinner he was slightly feverish  and his thoughts were preternaturally clear
sonya was sitting by the table
he began to doze
suddenly a feeling of happiness seized him
 ah  she has come   thought he
and so it was  in sonya's place sat natasha who had just come in noiselessly
since she had begun looking after him  he had always experienced this physical consciousness of her nearness
she was sitting in an armchair placed sideways  screening the light of the candle from him  and was knitting a stocking
she had learned to knit stockings since prince andrew had casually mentioned that no one nursed the sick so well as old nurses who knit stockings  and that there is something soothing in the knitting of stockings
the needles clicked lightly in her slender  rapidly moving hands  and he could clearly see the thoughtful profile of her drooping face
she moved  and the ball rolled off her knees
she started  glanced round at him  and screening the candle with her hand stooped carefully with a supple and exact movement  picked up the ball  and regained her former position
he looked at her without moving and saw that she wanted to draw a deep breath after stooping  but refrained from doing so and breathed cautiously
at the troitsa monastery they had spoken of the past  and he had told her that if he lived he would always thank god for his wound which had brought them together again  but after that they never spoke of the future
 can it or can it not be   he now thought as he looked at her and listened to the light click of the steel needles
 can fate have brought me to her so strangely only for me to die   
is it possible that the truth of life has been revealed to me only to show me that i have spent my life in falsity  i love her more than anything in the world  but what am i to do if i love her   he thought  and he involuntarily groaned  from a habit acquired during his sufferings
on hearing that sound natasha put down the stocking  leaned nearer to him  and suddenly  noticing his shining eyes  stepped lightly up to him and bent over him
 you are not asleep    no  i have been looking at you a long time
i felt you come in
no one else gives me that sense of soft tranquillity that you do  
that light
i want to weep for joy   natasha drew closer to him
her face shone with rapturous joy
 natasha  i love you too much  more than anything in the world    and i   she turned away for an instant
 why too much   she asked
 why too much   
well  what do you  what do you feel in your soul  your whole soul shall i live  what do you think    i am sure of it  sure   natasha almost shouted  taking hold of both his hands with a passionate movement
he remained silent awhile
 how good it would be   and taking her hand he kissed it
natasha felt happy and agitated  but at once remembered that this would not do and that he had to be quiet
 but you have not slept   she said  repressing her joy
 try to sleep  
please   he pressed her hand and released it  and she went back to the candle and sat down again in her former position
twice she turned and looked at him  and her eyes met his beaming at her
she set herself a task on her stocking and resolved not to turn round till it was finished
soon he really shut his eyes and fell asleep
he did not sleep long and suddenly awoke with a start and in a cold perspiration
as he fell asleep he had still been thinking of the subject that now always occupied his mind about life and death  and chiefly about death
he felt himself nearer to it  love  what is love   he thought
 love hinders death
love is life
all  everything that i understand  i understand only because i love
everything is  everything exists  only because i love
everything is united by it alone
love is god  and to die means that i  a particle of love  shall return to the general and eternal source   these thoughts seemed to him comforting
but they were only thoughts
something was lacking in them  they were not clear  they were too one sidedly personal and brain spun
and there was the former agitation and obscurity
he fell asleep
he dreamed that he was lying in the room he really was in  but that he was quite well and unwounded
many various  indifferent  and insignificant people appeared before him
he talked to them and discussed something trivial
they were preparing to go away somewhere
prince andrew dimly realized that all this was trivial and that he had more important cares  but he continued to speak  surprising them by empty witticisms gradually  unnoticed  all these persons began to disappear and a single question  that of the closed door  superseded all else
he rose and went to the door to bolt and lock it
everything depended on whether he was  or was not  in time to lock it
he went  and tried to hurry  but his legs refused to move and he knew he would not be in time to lock the door though he painfully strained all his powers
he was seized by an agonizing fear
and that fear was the fear of death
it stood behind the door
but just when he was clumsily creeping toward the door  that dreadful something on the other side was already pressing against it and forcing its way in something not human death was breaking in through that door  and had to be kept out
he seized the door  making a final effort to hold it back to lock it was no longer possible but his efforts were weak and clumsy and the door  pushed from behind by that terror  opened and closed again once again it pushed from outside
his last superhuman efforts were vain and both halves of the door noiselessly opened
it entered  and it was death  and prince andrew died
but at the instant he died  prince andrew remembered that he was asleep  and at the very instant he died  having made an effort  he awoke
 yes  it was death  i died and woke up
yes  death is an awakening   and all at once it grew light in his soul and the veil that had till then concealed the unknown was lifted from his spiritual vision
he felt as if powers till then confined within him had been liberated  and that strange lightness did not again leave him
when  waking in a cold perspiration  he moved on the divan  natasha went up and asked him what was the matter
he did not answer and looked at her strangely  not understanding
that was what had happened to him two days before princess mary's arrival
from that day  as the doctor expressed it  the wasting fever assumed a malignant character  but what the doctor said did not interest natasha  she saw the terrible moral symptoms which to her were more convincing from that day an awakening from life came to prince andrew together with his awakening from sleep
and compared to the duration of life it did not seem to him slower than an awakening from sleep compared to the duration of a dream
there was nothing terrible or violent in this comparatively slow awakening
his last days and hours passed in an ordinary and simple way
both princess mary and natasha  who did not leave him  felt this
they did not weep or shudder and during these last days they themselves felt that they were not attending on him  he was no longer there  he had left them  but on what reminded them most closely of him his body both felt this so strongly that the outward and terrible side of death did not affect them and they did not feel it necessary to foment their grief
neither in his presence nor out of it did they weep  nor did they ever talk to one another about him
they felt that they could not express in words what they understood
they both saw that he was sinking slowly and quietly  deeper and deeper  away from them  and they both knew that this had to be so and that it was right
he confessed  and received communion  everyone came to take leave of him
when they brought his son to him  he pressed his lips to the boy's and turned away  not because he felt it hard and sad  princess mary and natasha understood that  but simply because he thought it was all that was required of him  but when they told him to bless the boy  he did what was demanded and looked round as if asking whether there was anything else he should do
when the last convulsions of the body  which the spirit was leaving  occurred  princess mary and natasha were present
 is it over   said princess mary when his body had for a few minutes lain motionless  growing cold before them
natasha went up  looked at the dead eyes  and hastened to close them
she closed them but did not kiss them  but clung to that which reminded her most nearly of him his body
 where has he gone  where is he now      when the body  washed and dressed  lay in the coffin on a table  everyone came to take leave of him and they all wept
little nicholas cried because his heart was rent by painful perplexity
the countess and sonya cried from pity for natasha and because he was no more
the old count cried because he felt that before long  he  too  must take the same terrible step
natasha and princess mary also wept now  but not because of their own personal grief  they wept with a reverent and softening emotion which had taken possession of their souls at the consciousness of the simple and solemn mystery of death that had been accomplished in their presence
man's mind cannot grasp the causes of events in their completeness  but the desire to find those causes is implanted in man's soul
and without considering the multiplicity and complexity of the conditions any one of which taken separately may seem to be the cause  he snatches at the first approximation to a cause that seems to him intelligible and says   this is the cause   in historical events  where the actions of men are the subject of observation  the first and most primitive approximation to present itself was the will of the gods and  after that  the will of those who stood in the most prominent position  the heroes of history but we need only penetrate to the essence of any historic event which lies in the activity of the general mass of men who take part in it to be convinced that the will of the historic hero does not control the actions of the mass but is itself continually controlled
it may seem to be a matter of indifference whether we understand the meaning of historical events this way or that  yet there is the same difference between a man who says that the people of the west moved on the east because napoleon wished it and a man who says that this happened because it had to happen  as there is between those who declared that the earth was stationary and that the planets moved round it and those who admitted that they did not know what upheld the earth  but knew there were laws directing its movement and that of the other planets
there is  and can be  no cause of an historical event except the one cause of all causes
but there are laws directing events  and some of these laws are known to us while we are conscious of others we cannot comprehend
the discovery of these laws is only possible when we have quite abandoned the attempt to find the cause in the will of some one man  just as the discovery of the laws of the motion of the planets was possible only when men abandoned the conception of the fixity of the earth
the historians consider that  next to the battle of borodino and the occupation of moscow by the enemy and its destruction by fire  the most important episode of the war of 1812 was the movement of the russian army from the ryazana to the kaluga road and to the tarutino camp the so called flank march across the krasnaya pakhra river
they ascribe the glory of that achievement of genius to different men and dispute as to whom the honor is due
even foreign historians  including the french  acknowledge the genius of the russian commanders when they speak of that flank march
but it is hard to understand why military writers  and following them others  consider this flank march to be the profound conception of some one man who saved russia and destroyed napoleon
in the first place it is hard to understand where the profundity and genius of this movement lay  for not much mental effort was needed to see that the best position for an army when it is not being attacked is where there are most provisions  and even a dull boy of thirteen could have guessed that the best position for an army after its retreat from moscow in 1812 was on the kaluga road
so it is impossible to understand by what reasoning the historians reach the conclusion that this maneuver was a profound one
and it is even more difficult to understand just why they think that this maneuver was calculated to save russia and destroy the french  for this flank march  had it been preceded  accompanied  or followed by other circumstances  might have proved ruinous to the russians and salutary for the french if the position of the russian army really began to improve from the time of that march  it does not at all follow that the march was the cause of it
that flank march might not only have failed to give any advantage to the russian army  but might in other circumstances have led to its destruction what would have happened had moscow not burned down  if murat had not lost sight of the russians  if napoleon had not remained inactive  if the russian army at krasnaya pakhra had given battle as bennigsen and barclay advised  what would have happened had the french attacked the russians while they were marching beyond the pakhra  what would have happened if on approaching tarutino  napoleon had attacked the russians with but a tenth of the energy he had shown when he attacked them at smolensk  what would have happened had the french moved on petersburg   
in any of these eventualities the flank march that brought salvation might have proved disastrous
the third and most incomprehensible thing is that people studying history deliberately avoid seeing that this flank march cannot be attributed to any one man  that no one ever foresaw it  and that in reality  like the retreat from fili  it did not suggest itself to anyone in its entirety  but resulted moment by moment  step by step  event by event from an endless number of most diverse circumstances and was only seen in its entirety when it had been accomplished and belonged to the past at the council at fili the prevailing thought in the minds of the russian commanders was the one naturally suggesting itself  namely  a direct retreat by the nizhni road
in proof of this there is the fact that the majority of the council voted for such a retreat  and above all there is the well known conversation after the council  between the commander in chief and lanskoy  who was in charge of the commissariat department
lanskoy informed the commander in chief that the army supplies were for the most part stored along the oka in the tula and ryazan provinces  and that if they retreated on nizhni the army would be separated from its supplies by the broad river oka  which cannot be crossed early in winter
this was the first indication of the necessity of deviating from what had previously seemed the most natural course a direct retreat on nizhni novgorod
the army turned more to the south  along the ryazan road and nearer to its supplies
subsequently the inactivity of the french  who even lost sight of the russian army   concern for the safety of the arsenal at tula  and especially the advantages of drawing nearer to its supplies caused the army to turn still further south to the tula road
having crossed over  by a forced march  to the tula road beyond the pakhra  the russian commanders intended to remain at podolsk and had no thought of the tarutino position  but innumerable circumstances and the reappearance of french troops who had for a time lost touch with the russians  and projects of giving battle  and above all the abundance of provisions in kaluga province  obliged our army to turn still more to the south and to cross from the tula to the kaluga road and go to tarutino  which was between the roads along which those supplies lay just as it is impossible to say when it was decided to abandon moscow  so it is impossible to say precisely when  or by whom  it was decided to move to tarutino
only when the army had got there  as the result of innumerable and varying forces  did people begin to assure themselves that they had desired this movement and long ago foreseen its result the famous flank movement merely consisted in this  after the advance of the french had ceased  the russian army  which had been continually retreating straight back from the invaders  deviated from that direct course and  not finding itself pursued  was naturally drawn toward the district where supplies were abundant
if instead of imagining to ourselves commanders of genius leading the russian army  we picture that army without any leaders  it could not have done anything but make a return movement toward moscow  describing an arc in the direction where most provisions were to be found and where the country was richest
that movement from the nizhni to the ryazan  tula  and kaluga roads was so natural that even the russian marauders moved in that direction  and demands were sent from petersburg for kutuzov to take his army that way
at tarutino kutuzov received what was almost a reprimand from the emperor for having moved his army along the ryazan road  and the emperor's letter indicated to him the very position he had already occupied near kaluga
having rolled like a ball in the direction of the impetus given by the whole campaign and by the battle of borodino  the russian army when the strength of that impetus was exhausted and no fresh push was received assumed the position natural to it
kutuzov's merit lay  not in any strategic maneuver of genius  as it is called  but in the fact that he alone understood the significance of what had happened
he alone then understood the meaning of the french army's inactivity  he alone continued to assert that the battle of borodino had been a victory  he alone  who as commander in chief might have been expected to be eager to attack  employed his whole strength to restrain the russian army from useless engagements
the beast wounded at borodino was lying where the fleeing hunter had left him  but whether he was still alive  whether he was strong and merely lying low  the hunter did not know
suddenly the beast was heard to moan
the moan of that wounded beast  the french army  which betrayed its calamitous condition was the sending of lauriston to kutuzov's camp with overtures for peace
napoleon  with his usual assurance that whatever entered his head was right  wrote to kutuzov the first words that occurred to him  though they were meaningless
monsieur le prince koutouzov  i am sending one of my adjutantsgeneral to discuss several interesting questions with you
i beg your highness to credit what he says to you  especially when he expresses the sentiment of esteem and special regard i have long entertained for your person
this letter having no other object  i pray god  monsieur le prince koutouzov  to keep you in his holy and gracious protection  napoleon moscow  october 30  1812 kutuzov replied   i should be cursed by posterity were i looked on as the initiator of a settlement of any sort
such is the present spirit of my nation   but he continued to exert all his powers to restrain his troops from attacking
during the month that the french troops were pillaging in moscow and the russian troops were quietly encamped at tarutino  a change had taken place in the relative strength of the two armies both in spirit and in number as a result of which the superiority had passed to the russian side
though the condition and numbers of the french army were unknown to the russians  as soon as that change occurred the need of attacking at once showed itself by countless signs
these signs were  lauriston's mission  the abundance of provisions at tarutino  the reports coming in from all sides of the inactivity and disorder of the french  the flow of recruits to our regiments  the fine weather  the long rest the russian soldiers had enjoyed  and the impatience to do what they had been assembled for  which usually shows itself in an army that has been resting  curiosity as to what the french army  so long lost sight of  was doing  the boldness with which our outposts now scouted close up to the french stationed at tarutino  the news of easy successes gained by peasants and guerrilla troops over the french  the envy aroused by this  the desire for revenge that lay in the heart of every russian as long as the french were in moscow  and  above all  a dim consciousness in every soldier's mind that the relative strength of the armies had changed and that the advantage was now on our side
there was a substantial change in the relative strength  and an advance had become inevitable
and at once  as a clock begins to strike and chime as soon as the minute hand has completed a full circle  this change was shown by an increased activity  whirring  and chiming in the higher spheres
the russian army was commanded by kutuzov and his staff  and also by the emperor from petersburg
before the news of the abandonment of moscow had been received in petersburg  a detailed plan of the whole campaign had been drawn up and sent to kutuzov for his guidance
though this plan had been drawn up on the supposition that moscow was still in our hands  it was approved by the staff and accepted as a basis for action
kutuzov only replied that movements arranged from a distance were always difficult to execute
so fresh instructions were sent for the solution of difficulties that might be encountered  as well as fresh people who were to watch kutuzov's actions and report upon them
besides this  the whole staff of the russian army was now reorganized
the posts left vacant by bagration  who had been killed  and by barclay  who had gone away in dudgeon  had to be filled
very serious consideration was given to the question whether it would be better to put a in b's place and b in d's  or on the contrary to put d in a's place  and so on as if anything more than a's or b's satisfaction depended on this
as a result of the hostility between kutuzov and bennigsen  his chief of staff  the presence of confidential representatives of the emperor  and these transfers  a more than usually complicated play of parties was going on among the staff of the army
a was undermining b  d was undermining c  and so on in all possible combinations and permutations
in all these plottings the subject of intrigue was generally the conduct of the war  which all these men believed they were directing  but this affair of the war went on independently of them  as it had to go  that is  never in the way people devised  but flowing always from the essential attitude of the masses
only in the highest spheres did all these schemes  crossings  and interminglings appear to be a true reflection of what had to happen
prince michael ilarionovich   wrote the emperor on the second of october in a letter that reached kutuzov after the battle at tarutino  since september 2 moscow has been in the hands of the enemy
your last reports were written on the twentieth  and during all this time not only has no action been taken against the enemy or for the relief of the ancient capital  but according to your last report you have even retreated farther
serpukhov is already occupied by an enemy detachment and tula with its famous arsenal so indispensable to the army  is in danger
from general wintzingerode's reports  i see that an enemy corps of ten thousand men is moving on the petersburg road
another corps of several thousand men is moving on dmitrov
a third has advanced along the vladimir road  and a fourth  rather considerable detachment is stationed between ruza and mozhaysk
napoleon himself was in moscow as late as the twenty fifth in view of all this information  when the enemy has scattered his forces in large detachments  and with napoleon and his guards in moscow  is it possible that the enemy's forces confronting you are so considerable as not to allow of your taking the offensive  on the contrary  he is probably pursuing you with detachments  or at most with an army corps much weaker than the army entrusted to you
it would seem that  availing yourself of these circumstances  you might advantageously attack a weaker one and annihilate him  or at least oblige him to retreat  retaining in our hands an important part of the provinces now occupied by the enemy  and thereby averting danger from tula and other towns in the interior you will be responsible if the enemy is able to direct a force of any size against petersburg to threaten this capital in which it has not been possible to retain many troops  for with the army entrusted to you  and acting with resolution and energy  you have ample means to avert this fresh calamity
remember that you have still to answer to our offended country for the loss of moscow
you have experienced my readiness to reward you
that readiness will not weaken in me  but i and russia have a right to expect from you all the zeal  firmness  and success which your intellect  military talent  and the courage of the troops you command justify us in expecting
but by the time this letter  which proved that the real relation of the forces had already made itself felt in petersburg  was dispatched  kutuzov had found himself unable any longer to restrain the army he commanded from attacking and a battle had taken place on the second of october a cossack  shapovalov  who was out scouting  killed one hare and wounded another
following the wounded hare he made his way far into the forest and came upon the left flank of murat's army  encamped there without any precautions
the cossack laughingly told his comrades how he had almost fallen into the hands of the french a cornet  hearing the story  informed his commander
the cossack was sent for and questioned
the cossack officers wished to take advantage of this chance to capture some horses  but one of the superior officers  who was acquainted with the higher authorities  reported the incident to a general on the staff
the state of things on the staff had of late been exceedingly strained
ermolov had been to see bennigsen a few days previously and had entreated him to use his influence with the commander inchief to induce him to take the offensive
 if i did not know you i should think you did not want what you are asking for
i need only advise anything and his highness is sure to do the opposite   replied bennigsen
the cossack's report  confirmed by horse patrols who were sent out  was the final proof that events had matured
the tightly coiled spring was released  the clock began to whirr and the chimes to play
despite all his supposed power  his intellect  his experience  and his knowledge of men  kutuzov having taken into consideration the cossack's report  a note from bennigsen who sent personal reports to the emperor  the wishes he supposed the emperor to hold  and the fact that all the generals expressed the same wish could no longer check the inevitable movement  and gave the order to do what he regarded as useless and harmful gave his approval  that is  to the accomplished fact
bennigsen's note and the cossack's information that the left flank of the french was unguarded were merely final indications that it was necessary to order an attack  and it was fixed for the fifth of october
on the morning of the fourth of october kutuzov signed the dispositions
toll read them to ermolov  asking him to attend to the further arrangements
 all right all right
i haven't time just now   replied ermolov  and left the hut
the dispositions drawn up by toll were very good
as in the austerlitz dispositions  it was written though not in german this time   the first column will march here and here    the second column will march there and there   and so on  and on paper  all these columns arrived at their places at the appointed time and destroyed the enemy
everything had been admirably thought out as is usual in dispositions  and as is always the case  not a single column reached its place at the appointed time
when the necessary number of copies of the dispositions had been prepared  an officer was summoned and sent to deliver them to ermolov to deal with
a young officer of the horse guards  kutuzov's orderly  pleased at the importance of the mission entrusted to him  went to ermolov's quarters
 gone away   said ermolov's orderly
the officer of the horse guards went to a general with whom ermolov was often to be found
 no  and the general's out too   the officer  mounting his horse  rode off to someone else
 no  he's gone out    if only they don't make me responsible for this delay  what a nuisance it is   thought the officer  and he rode round the whole camp
one man said he had seen ermolov ride past with some other generals  others said he must have returned home
the officer searched till six o'clock in the evening without even stopping to eat
ermolov was nowhere to be found and no one knew where he was
the officer snatched a little food at a comrade's  and rode again to the vanguard to find miloradovich miloradovich too was away  but here he was told that he had gone to a ball at general kikin's and that ermolov was probably there too
 but where is it    why  there  over at echkino   said a cossack officer  pointing to a country house in the far distance
 what  outside our line    they've put two regiments as outposts  and they're having such a spree there  it's awful  two bands and three sets of singers   the officer rode out beyond our lines to echkino
while still at a distance he heard as he rode the merry sounds of a soldier's dance song proceeding from the house
 in the meadows  
in the meadows   he heard  accompanied by whistling and the sound of a torban  drowned every now and then by shouts
these sounds made his spirits rise  but at the same time he was afraid that he would be blamed for not having executed sooner the important order entrusted to him
it was already past eight o'clock
he dismounted and went up into the porch of a large country house which had remained intact between the russian and french forces
in the refreshment room and the hall  footmen were bustling about with wine and viands
groups of singers stood outside the windows
the officer was admitted and immediately saw all the chief generals of the army together  and among them ermolov's big imposing figure
they all had their coats unbuttoned and were standing in a semicircle with flushed and animated faces  laughing loudly
in the middle of the room a short handsome general with a red face was dancing the trepak with much spirit and agility
 ha  ha  ha  bravo  nicholas ivanych  ha  ha  ha   the officer felt that by arriving with important orders at such a moment he was doubly to blame  and he would have preferred to wait  but one of the generals espied him and  hearing what he had come about  informed ermolov
ermolov came forward with a frown on his face and  hearing what the officer had to say  took the papers from him without a word
 you think he went off just by chance   said a comrade  who was on the staff that evening  to the officer of the horse guards  referring to ermolov  it was a trick
it was done on purpose to get konovnitsyn into trouble
you'll see what a mess there'll be tomorrow   next day the decrepit kutuzov  having given orders to be called early  said his prayers  dressed  and  with an unpleasant consciousness of having to direct a battle he did not approve of  got into his caleche and drove from letashovka  a village three and a half miles from tarutino  to the place where the attacking columns were to meet
he sat in the caleche  dozing and waking up by turns  and listening for any sound of firing on the right as an indication that the action had begun
but all was still quiet
a damp dull autumn morning was just dawning
on approaching tarutino kutuzov noticed cavalrymen leading their horses to water across the road along which he was driving
kutuzov looked at them searchingly  stopped his carriage  and inquired what regiment they belonged to
they belonged to a column that should have been far in front and in ambush long before then
 it may be a mistake   thought the old commander in chief
but a little further on he saw infantry regiments with their arms piled and the soldiers  only partly dressed  eating their rye porridge and carrying fuel he sent for an officer
the officer reported that no order to advance had been received
 how  not rec     kutuzov began  but checked himself immediately and sent for a senior officer getting out of his caleche  he waited with drooping head and breathing heavily  pacing silently up and down
when eykhen  the officer of the general staff whom he had summoned  appeared  kutuzov went purple in the face  not because that officer was to blame for the mistake  but because he was an object of sufficient importance for him to vent his wrath on
trembling and panting the old man fell into that state of fury in which he sometimes used to roll on the ground  and he fell upon eykhen  threatening him with his hands  shouting and loading him with gross abuse
another man  captain brozin  who happened to turn up and who was not at all to blame  suffered the same fate
 what sort of another blackguard are you  i'll have you shot  scoundrels   yelled kutuzov in a hoarse voice  waving his arms and reeling he was suffering physically
he  the commander in chief  a serene highness who everybody said possessed powers such as no man had ever had in russia  to be placed in this position made the laughingstock of the whole army   i needn't have been in such a hurry to pray about today  or have kept awake thinking everything over all night   thought he to himself  when i was a chit of an officer no one would have dared to mock me so  
and now   he was in a state of physical suffering as if from corporal punishment  and could not avoid expressing it by cries of anger and distress
but his strength soon began to fail him  and looking about him  conscious of having said much that was amiss  he again got into his caleche and drove back in silence
his wrath  once expended  did not return  and blinking feebly he listened to excuses and self justifications  ermolov did not come to see him till the next day  and to the insistence of bennigsen  konovnitsyn  and toll that the movement that had miscarried should be executed next day
and once more kutuzov had to consent
next day the troops assembled in their appointed places in the evening and advanced during the night
it was an autumn night with dark purple clouds  but no rain
the ground was damp but not muddy  and the troops advanced noiselessly  only occasionally a jingling of the artillery could be faintly heard
the men were forbidden to talk out loud  to smoke their pipes  or to strike a light  and they tried to prevent their horses neighing
the secrecy of the undertaking heightened its charm and they marched gaily
some columns  supposing they had reached their destination  halted  piled arms  and settled down on the cold ground  but the majority marched all night and arrived at places where they evidently should not have been only count orlov denisov with his cossacks  the least important detachment of all  got to his appointed place at the right time
this detachment halted at the outskirts of a forest  on the path leading from the village of stromilova to dmitrovsk
toward dawn  count orlov denisov  who had dozed off  was awakened by a deserter from the french army being brought to him
this was a polish sergeant of poniatowski's corps  who explained in polish that he had come over because he had been slighted in the service  that he ought long ago to have been made an officer  that he was braver than any of them  and so he had left them and wished to pay them out
he said that murat was spending the night less than a mile from where they were  and that if they would let him have a convoy of a hundred men he would capture him alive
count orlovdenisov consulted his fellow officers
the offer was too tempting to be refused
everyone volunteered to go and everybody advised making the attempt
after much disputing and arguing  major general grekov with two cossack regiments decided to go with the polish sergeant
 now  remember   said count orlov denisov to the sergeant at parting   if you have been lying i'll have you hanged like a dog  but if it's true you shall have a hundred gold pieces   without replying  the sergeant  with a resolute air  mounted and rode away with grekov whose men had quickly assembled
they disappeared into the forest  and count orlov denisov  having seen grekov off  returned  shivering from the freshness of the early dawn and excited by what he had undertaken on his own responsibility  and began looking at the enemy camp  now just visible in the deceptive light of dawn and the dying campfires
our columns ought to have begun to appear on an open declivity to his right
he looked in that direction  but though the columns would have been visible quite far off  they were not to be seen
it seemed to the count that things were beginning to stir in the french camp  and his keen sighted adjutant confirmed this
 oh  it is really too late   said count orlov  looking at the camp
as often happens when someone we have trusted is no longer before our eyes  it suddenly seemed quite clear and obvious to him that the sergeant was an impostor  that he had lied  and that the whole russian attack would be ruined by the absence of those two regiments  which he would lead away heaven only knew where
how could one capture a commander in chief from among such a mass of troops   i am sure that rascal was lying   said the count
 they can still be called back   said one of his suite  who like count orlov felt distrustful of the adventure when he looked at the enemy's camp
 eh  really  
what do you think  should we let them go on or not    will you have them fetched back    fetch them back  fetch them back   said count orlov with sudden determination  looking at his watch  it will be too late
it is quite light   and the adjutant galloped through the forest after grekov
when grekov returned  count orlov denisov  excited both by the abandoned attempt and by vainly awaiting the infantry columns that still did not appear  as well as by the proximity of the enemy  resolved to advance
all his men felt the same excitement
 mount   he commanded in a whisper
the men took their places and crossed themselves     forward  with god's aid    hurrah ah ah   reverberated in the forest  and the cossack companies  trailing their lances and advancing one after another as if poured out of a sack  dashed gaily across the brook toward the camp
one desperate  frightened yell from the first french soldier who saw the cossacks  and all who were in the camp  undressed and only just waking up  ran off in all directions  abandoning cannons  muskets  and horses
had the cossacks pursued the french  without heeding what was behind and around them  they would have captured murat and everything there
that was what the officers desired
but it was impossible to make the cossacks budge when once they had got booty and prisoners
none of them listened to orders
fifteen hundred prisoners and thirty eight guns were taken on the spot  besides standards and  what seemed most important to the cossacks  horses  saddles  horsecloths  and the like
all this had to be dealt with  the prisoners and guns secured  the booty divided not without some shouting and even a little fighting among themselves and it was on this that the cossacks all busied themselves the french  not being farther pursued  began to recover themselves  they formed into detachments and began firing orlov denisov  still waiting for the other columns to arrive  advanced no further
meantime  according to the dispositions which said that  the first column will march  and so on  the infantry of the belated columns  commanded by bennigsen and directed by toll  had started in due order and  as always happens  had got somewhere  but not to their appointed places
as always happens the men  starting cheerfully  began to halt  murmurs were heard  there was a sense of confusion  and finally a backward movement
adjutants and generals galloped about  shouted  grew angry  quarreled  said they had come quite wrong and were late  gave vent to a little abuse  and at last gave it all up and went forward  simply to get somewhere
 we shall get somewhere or other   and they did indeed get somewhere  though not to their right places  a few eventually even got to their right place  but too late to be of any use and only in time to be fired at
toll  who in this battle played the part of weyrother at austerlitz  galloped assiduously from place to place  finding everything upside down everywhere
thus he stumbled on bagovut's corps in a wood when it was already broad daylight  though the corps should long before have joined orlov denisov
excited and vexed by the failure and supposing that someone must be responsible for it  toll galloped up to the commander of the corps and began upbraiding him severely  saying that he ought to be shot
general bagovut  a fighting old soldier of placid temperament  being also upset by all the delay  confusion  and cross purposes  fell into a rage to everybody's surprise and quite contrary to his usual character and said disagreeable things to toll
 i prefer not to take lessons from anyone  but i can die with my men as well as anybody   he said  and advanced with a single division
coming out onto a field under the enemy's fire  this brave general went straight ahead  leading his men under fire  without considering in his agitation whether going into action now  with a single division  would be of any use or no
danger  cannon balls  and bullets were just what he needed in his angry mood
one of the first bullets killed him  and other bullets killed many of his men
and his division remained under fire for some time quite uselessly
meanwhile another column was to have attacked the french from the front  but kutuzov accompanied that column
he well knew that nothing but confusion would come of this battle undertaken against his will  and as far as was in his power held the troops back
he did not advance
he rode silently on his small gray horse  indolently answering suggestions that they should attack
 the word attack is always on your tongue  but you don't see that we are unable to execute complicated maneuvers   said he to miloradovich who asked permission to advance
 we couldn't take murat prisoner this morning or get to the place in time  and nothing can be done now   he replied to someone else
when kutuzov was informed that at the french rear where according to the reports of the cossacks there had previously been nobody there were now two battalions of poles  he gave a sidelong glance at ermolov who was behind him and to whom he had not spoken since the previous day
 you see  they are asking to attack and making plans of all kinds  but as soon as one gets to business nothing is ready  and the enemy  forewarned  takes measures accordingly   ermolov screwed up his eyes and smiled faintly on hearing these words
he understood that for him the storm had blown over  and that kutuzov would content himself with that hint  he's having a little fun at my expense   said ermolov softly  nudging with his knee raevski who was at his side
soon after this  ermolov moved up to kutuzov and respectfully remarked   it is not too late yet  your highness the enemy has not gone away if you were to order an attack  if not  the guards will not so much as see a little smoke   kutuzov did not reply  but when they reported to him that murat's troops were in retreat he ordered an advance  though at every hundred paces he halted for three quarters of an hour
the whole battle consisted in what orlov denisov's cossacks had done  the rest of the army merely lost some hundreds of men uselessly
in consequence of this battle kutuzov received a diamond decoration  and bennigsen some diamonds and a hundred thousand rubles  others also received pleasant recognitions corresponding to their various grades  and following the battle fresh changes were made in the staff
 that's how everything is done with us  all topsy turvy   said the russian officers and generals after the tarutino battle  letting it be understood that some fool there is doing things all wrong but that we ourselves should not have done so  just as people speak today
but people who talk like that either do not know what they are talking about or deliberately deceive themselves no battle tarutino  borodino  or austerlitz takes place as those who planned it anticipated
that is an essential condition
a countless number of free forces  for nowhere is man freer than during a battle  where it is a question of life and death  influence the course taken by the fight  and that course never can be known in advance and never coincides with the direction of any one force
if many simultaneously and variously directed forces act on a given body  the direction of its motion cannot coincide with any one of those forces  but will always be a mean what in mechanics is represented by the diagonal of a parallelogram of forces
if in the descriptions given by historians  especially french ones  we find their wars and battles carried out in accordance with previously formed plans  the only conclusion to be drawn is that those descriptions are false
the battle of tarutino obviously did not attain the aim toll had in view to lead the troops into action in the order prescribed by the dispositions  nor that which count orlov denisov may have had in view to take murat prisoner  nor the result of immediately destroying the whole corps  which bennigsen and others may have had in view  nor the aim of the officer who wished to go into action to distinguish himself  nor that of the cossack who wanted more booty than he got  and so on but if the aim of the battle was what actually resulted and what all the russians of that day desired to drive the french out of russia and destroy their army it is quite clear that the battle of tarutino  just because of its incongruities  was exactly what was wanted at that stage of the campaign
it would be difficult and even impossible to imagine any result more opportune than the actual outcome of this battle
with a minimum of effort and insignificant losses  despite the greatest confusion  the most important results of the whole campaign were attained  the transition from retreat to advance  an exposure of the weakness of the french  and the administration of that shock which napoleon's army had only awaited to begin its flight
napoleon enters moscow after the brilliant victory de la moskowa  there can be no doubt about the victory for the battlefield remains in the hands of the french
the russians retreat and abandon their ancient capital
moscow  abounding in provisions  arms  munitions  and incalculable wealth  is in napoleon's hands the russian army  only half the strength of the french  does not make a single attempt to attack for a whole month
napoleon's position is most brilliant
he can either fall on the russian army with double its strength and destroy it  negotiate an advantageous peace  or in case of a refusal make a menacing move on petersburg  or even  in the case of a reverse  return to smolensk or vilna  or remain in moscow  in short  no special genius would seem to be required to retain the brilliant position the french held at that time
for that  only very simple and easy steps were necessary  not to allow the troops to loot  to prepare winter clothing of which there was sufficient in moscow for the whole army and methodically to collect the provisions  of which  according to the french historians  there were enough in moscow to supply the whole army for six months
yet napoleon  that greatest of all geniuses  who the historians declare had control of the army  took none of these steps
he not merely did nothing of the kind  but on the contrary he used his power to select the most foolish and ruinous of all the courses open to him
of all that napoleon might have done  wintering in moscow  advancing on petersburg or on nizhni novgorod  or retiring by a more northerly or more southerly route  say by the road kutuzov afterwards took   nothing more stupid or disastrous can be imagined than what he actually did
he remained in moscow till october  letting the troops plunder the city  then  hesitating whether to leave a garrison behind him  he quitted moscow  approached kutuzov without joining battle  turned to the right and reached malo yaroslavets  again without attempting to break through and take the road kutuzov took  but retiring instead to mozhaysk along the devastated smolensk road
nothing more stupid than that could have been devised  or more disastrous for the army  as the sequel showed
had napoleon's aim been to destroy his army  the most skillful strategist could hardly have devised any series of actions that would so completely have accomplished that purpose  independently of anything the russian army might do
napoleon  the man of genius  did this  but to say that he destroyed his army because he wished to  or because he was very stupid  would be as unjust as to say that he had brought his troops to moscow because he wished to and because he was very clever and a genius
in both cases his personal activity  having no more force than the personal activity of any soldier  merely coincided with the laws that guided the event
the historians quite falsely represent napoleon's faculties as having weakened in moscow  and do so only because the results did not justify his actions
he employed all his ability and strength to do the best he could for himself and his army  as he had done previously and as he did subsequently in 1813 his activity at that time was no less astounding than it was in egypt  in italy  in austria  and in prussia
we do not know for certain in how far his genius was genuine in egypt where forty centuries looked down upon his grandeur for his great exploits there are all told us by frenchmen
we cannot accurately estimate his genius in austria or prussia  for we have to draw our information from french or german sources  and the incomprehensible surrender of whole corps without fighting and of fortresses without a siege must incline germans to recognize his genius as the only explanation of the war carried on in germany
but we  thank god  have no need to recognize his genius in order to hide our shame
we have paid for the right to look at the matter plainly and simply  and we will not abandon that right
his activity in moscow was as amazing and as full of genius as elsewhere
order after order and plan after plan were issued by him from the time he entered moscow till the time he left it
the absence of citizens and of a deputation  and even the burning of moscow  did not disconcert him
he did not lose sight either of the welfare of his army or of the doings of the enemy  or of the welfare of the people of russia  or of the direction of affairs in paris  or of diplomatic considerations concerning the terms of the anticipated peace with regard to military matters  napoleon immediately on his entry into moscow gave general sabastiani strict orders to observe the movements of the russian army  sent army corps out along the different roads  and charged murat to find kutuzov
then he gave careful directions about the fortification of the kremlin  and drew up a brilliant plan for a future campaign over the whole map of russia
with regard to diplomatic questions  napoleon summoned captain yakovlev  who had been robbed and was in rags and did not know how to get out of moscow  minutely explained to him his whole policy and his magnanimity  and having written a letter to the emperor alexander in which he considered it his duty to inform his friend and brother that rostopchin had managed affairs badly in moscow  he dispatched yakovlev to petersburg
having similarly explained his views and his magnanimity to tutolmin  he dispatched that old man also to petersburg to negotiate
with regard to legal matters  immediately after the fires he gave orders to find and execute the incendiaries
and the scoundrel rostopchin was punished by an order to burn down his houses
with regard to administrative matters  moscow was granted a constitution
a municipality was established and the following announcement issued  inhabitants of moscow  your misfortunes are cruel  but his majesty the emperor and king desires to arrest their course
terrible examples have taught you how he punishes disobedience and crime
strict measures have been taken to put an end to disorder and to re establish public security
a paternal administration  chosen from among yourselves  will form your municipality or city government
it will take care of you  of your needs  and of your welfare
its members will be distinguished by a red ribbon worn across the shoulder  and the mayor of the city will wear a white belt as well
but when not on duty they will only wear a red ribbon round the left arm
the city police is established on its former footing  and better order already prevails in consequence of its activity
the government has appointed two commissaries general  or chiefs of police  and twenty commissaries or captains of wards have been appointed to the different wards of the city
you will recognize them by the white ribbon they will wear on the left arm
several churches of different denominations are open  and divine service is performed in them unhindered
your fellow citizens are returning every day to their homes and orders have been given that they should find in them the help and protection due to their misfortunes
these are the measures the government has adopted to re establish order and relieve your condition
but to achieve this aim it is necessary that you should add your efforts and should  if possible  forget the misfortunes you have suffered  should entertain the hope of a less cruel fate  should be certain that inevitable and ignominious death awaits those who make any attempt on your persons or on what remains of your property  and finally that you should not doubt that these will be safeguarded  since such is the will of the greatest and most just of monarchs
soldiers and citizens  of whatever nation you may be  re establish public confidence  the source of the welfare of a state  live like brothers  render mutual aid and protection one to another  unite to defeat the intentions of the evil minded  obey the military and civil authorities  and your tears will soon cease to flow  with regard to supplies for the army  napoleon decreed that all the troops in turn should enter moscow a la maraude * to obtain provisions for themselves  so that the army might have its future provided for * as looters
with regard to religion  napoleon ordered the priests to be brought back and services to be again performed in the churches
with regard to commerce and to provisioning the army  the following was placarded everywhere  proclamation  you  peaceful inhabitants of moscow  artisans and workmen whom misfortune has driven from the city  and you scattered tillers of the soil  still kept out in the fields by groundless fear  listen  tranquillity is returning to this capital and order is being restored in it
your fellow countrymen are emerging boldly from their hiding places on finding that they are respected
any violence to them or to their property is promptly punished
his majesty the emperor and king protects them  and considers no one among you his enemy except those who disobey his orders
he desires to end your misfortunes and restore you to your homes and families
respond  therefore  to his benevolent intentions and come to us without fear
inhabitants  return with confidence to your abodes  you will soon find means of satisfying your needs
craftsmen and industrious artisans  return to your work  your houses  your shops  where the protection of guards awaits you  you shall receive proper pay for your work
and lastly you too  peasants  come from the forests where you are hiding in terror  return to your huts without fear  in full assurance that you will find protection  markets are established in the city where peasants can bring their surplus supplies and the products of the soil
the government has taken the following steps to ensure freedom of sale for them   1  from today  peasants  husbandmen  and those living in the neighborhood of moscow may without any danger bring their supplies of all kinds to two appointed markets  of which one is on the mokhovaya street and the other at the provision market
 2  such supplies will be bought from them at such prices as seller and buyer may agree on  and if a seller is unable to obtain a fair price he will be free to take his goods back to his village and no one may hinder him under any pretense
 3  sunday and wednesday of each week are appointed as the chief market days and to that end a sufficient number of troops will be stationed along the highroads on tuesdays and saturdays at such distances from the town as to protect the carts
 4  similar measures will be taken that peasants with their carts and horses may meet with no hindrance on their return journey
 5  steps will immediately be taken to re establish ordinary trading
inhabitants of the city and villages  and you  workingmen and artisans  to whatever nation you belong  you are called on to carry out the paternal intentions of his majesty the emperor and king and to co operate with him for the public welfare  lay your respect and confidence at his feet and do not delay to unite with us  with the object of raising the spirits of the troops and of the people  reviews were constantly held and rewards distributed
the emperor rode through the streets to comfort the inhabitants  and  despite his preoccupation with state affairs  himself visited the theaters that were established by his order in regard to philanthropy  the greatest virtue of crowned heads  napoleon also did all in his power
he caused the words maison de ma mere to be inscribed on the charitable institutions  thereby combining tender filial affection with the majestic benevolence of a monarch
he visited the foundling hospital and  allowing the orphans saved by him to kiss his white hands  graciously conversed with tutolmin
then  as thiers eloquently recounts  he ordered his soldiers to be paid in forged russian money which he had prepared   raising the use of these means by an act worthy of himself and of the french army  he let relief be distributed to those who had been burned out but as food was too precious to be given to foreigners  who were for the most part enemies  napoleon preferred to supply them with money with which to purchase food from outside  and had paper rubles distributed to them   with reference to army discipline  orders were continually being issued to inflict severe punishment for the nonperformance of military duties and to suppress robbery
but strange to say  all these measures  efforts  and plans which were not at all worse than others issued in similar circumstances did not affect the essence of the matter but  like the hands of a clock detached from the mechanism  swung about in an arbitrary and aimless way without engaging the cogwheels with reference to the military side the plan of campaign that work of genius of which thiers remarks that   his genius never devised anything more profound  more skillful  or more admirable   and enters into a polemic with m
fain to prove that this work of genius must be referred not to the fourth but to the fifteenth of october that plan never was or could be executed  for it was quite out of touch with the facts of the case
the fortifying of the kremlin  for which la mosquee  as napoleon termed the church of basil the beatified  was to have been razed to the ground  proved quite useless
the mining of the kremlin only helped toward fulfilling napoleon's wish that it should be blown up when he left moscow as a child wants the floor on which he has hurt himself to be beaten the pursuit of the russian army  about which napoleon was so concerned  produced an unheard of result
the french generals lost touch with the russian army of sixty thousand men  and according to thiers it was only eventually found  like a lost pin  by the skill and apparently the genius of murat
with reference to diplomacy  all napoleon's arguments as to his magnanimity and justice  both to tutolmin and to yakovlev  whose chief concern was to obtain a greatcoat and a conveyance   proved useless  alexander did not receive these envoys and did not reply to their embassage
with regard to legal matters  after the execution of the supposed incendiaries the rest of moscow burned down
with regard to administrative matters  the establishment of a municipality did not stop the robberies and was only of use to certain people who formed part of that municipality and under pretext of preserving order looted moscow or saved their own property from being looted
with regard to religion  as to which in egypt matters had so easily been settled by napoleon's visit to a mosque  no results were achieved
two or three priests who were found in moscow did try to carry out napoleon's wish  but one of them was slapped in the face by a french soldier while conducting service  and a french official reported of another that   the priest whom i found and invited to say mass cleaned and locked up the church
that night the doors disorders perpetrated   with reference to commerce  the proclamation to industrious workmen and to peasants evoked no response
there were no industrious workmen  and the peasants caught the commissaries who ventured too far out of town with the proclamation and killed them
as to the theaters for the entertainment of the people and the troops  these did not meet with success either
the theaters set up in the kremlin and in posnyakov's house were closed again at once because the actors and actresses were robbed
even philanthropy did not have the desired effect
the genuine as well as the false paper money which flooded moscow lost its value
the french  collecting booty  cared only for gold
not only was the paper money valueless which napoleon so graciously distributed to the unfortunate  but even silver lost its value in relation to gold
but the most amazing example of the ineffectiveness of the orders given by the authorities at that time was napoleon's attempt to stop the looting and reestablish discipline
this is what the army authorities were reporting   looting continues in the city despite the decrees against it
order is not yet restored and not a single merchant is carrying on trade in a lawful manner
the sutlers alone venture to trade  and they sell stolen goods    the neighborhood of my ward continues to be pillaged by soldiers of the 3rd corps who  not satisfied with taking from the unfortunate inhabitants hiding in the cellars the little they have left  even have the ferocity to wound them with their sabers  as i have repeatedly witnessed    nothing new  except that the soldiers are robbing and pillaging october 9    robbery and pillaging continue
there is a band of thieves in our district who ought to be arrested by a strong force october 11    the emperor is extremely displeased that despite the strict orders to stop pillage  parties of marauding guards are continually seen returning to the kremlin
among the old guard disorder and pillage were renewed more violently than ever yesterday evening  last night  and today
the emperor sees with regret that the picked soldiers appointed to guard his person  who should set an example of discipline  carry disobedience to such a point that they break into the cellars and stores containing army supplies
others have disgraced themselves to the extent of disobeying sentinels and officers  and have abused and beaten them    the grand marshal of the palace   wrote the governor   complains bitterly that in spite of repeated orders  the soldiers continue to commit nuisances in all the courtyards and even under the very windows of the emperor   that army  like a herd of cattle run wild and trampling underfoot the provender which might have saved it from starvation  disintegrated and perished with each additional day it remained in moscow but it did not go away
it began to run away only when suddenly seized by a panic caused by the capture of transport trains on the smolensk road  and by the battle of tarutino
the news of that battle of tarutino  unexpectedly received by napoleon at a review  evoked in him a desire to punish the russians  thiers says   and he issued the order for departure which the whole army was demanding
fleeing from moscow the soldiers took with them everything they had stolen
napoleon  too  carried away his own personal tresor  but on seeing the baggage trains that impeded the army  he was  thiers says  horror struck
and yet with his experience of war he did not order all the superfluous vehicles to be burned  as he had done with those of a certain marshal when approaching moscow
he gazed at the caleches and carriages in which soldiers were riding and remarked that it was a very good thing  as those vehicles could be used to carry provisions  the sick  and the wounded
the plight of the whole army resembled that of a wounded animal which feels it is perishing and does not know what it is doing
to study the skillful tactics and aims of napoleon and his army from the time it entered moscow till it was destroyed is like studying the dying leaps and shudders of a mortally wounded animal very often a wounded animal  hearing a rustle  rushes straight at the hunter's gun  runs forward and back again  and hastens its own end
napoleon  under pressure from his whole army  did the same thing
the rustle of the battle of tarutino frightened the beast  and it rushed forward onto the hunter's gun  reached him  turned back  and finally like any wild beast ran back along the most disadvantageous and dangerous path  where the old scent was familiar
during the whole of that period napoleon  who seems to us to have been the leader of all these movements as the figurehead of a ship may seem to a savage to guide the vessel acted like a child who  holding a couple of strings inside a carriage  thinks he is driving it early in the morning of the sixth of october pierre went out of the shed  and on returning stopped by the door to play with a little blue gray dog  with a long body and short bandy legs  that jumped about him
this little dog lived in their shed  sleeping beside karataev at night  it sometimes made excursions into the town but always returned again
probably it had never had an owner  and it still belonged to nobody and had no name
the french called it azor  the soldier who told stories called it femgalka  karataev and others called it gray  or sometimes flabby
its lack of a master  a name  or even of a breed or any definite color did not seem to trouble the blue gray dog in the least
its furry tail stood up firm and round as a plume  its bandy legs served it so well that it would often gracefully lift a hind leg and run very easily and quickly on three legs  as if disdaining to use all four
everything pleased it
now it would roll on its back  yelping with delight  now bask in the sun with a thoughtful air of importance  and now frolic about playing with a chip of wood or a straw
pierre's attire by now consisted of a dirty torn shirt  the only remnant of his former clothing   a pair of soldier's trousers which by karataev's advice he tied with string round the ankles for warmth  and a peasant coat and cap
physically he had changed much during this time
he no longer seemed stout  though he still had the appearance of solidity and strength hereditary in his family
a beard and mustache covered the lower part of his face  and a tangle of hair  infested with lice  curled round his head like a cap
the look of his eyes was resolute  calm  and animatedly alert  as never before
the former slackness which had shown itself even in his eyes was now replaced by an energetic readiness for action and resistance
his feet were bare
pierre first looked down the field across which vehicles and horsemen were passing that morning  then into the distance across the river  then at the dog who was pretending to be in earnest about biting him  and then at his bare feet which he placed with pleasure in various positions  moving his dirty thick big toes
every time he looked at his bare feet a smile of animated self satisfaction flitted across his face
the sight of them reminded him of all he had experienced and learned during these weeks and this recollection was pleasant to him
for some days the weather had been calm and clear with slight frosts in the mornings what is called an  old wives' summer   in the sunshine the air was warm  and that warmth was particularly pleasant with the invigorating freshness of the morning frost still in the air
on everything far and near lay the magic crystal glitter seen only at that time of autumn
the sparrow hills were visible in the distance  with the village  the church  and the large white house
the bare trees  the sand  the bricks and roofs of the houses  the green church spire  and the corners of the white house in the distance  all stood out in the transparent air in most delicate outline and with unnatural clearness
near by could be seen the familiar ruins of a half burned mansion occupied by the french  with lilac bushes still showing dark green beside the fence
and even that ruined and befouled house  which in dull weather was repulsively ugly seemed quietly beautiful now  in the clear  motionless brilliance
a french corporal  with coat unbuttoned in a homely way  a skullcap on his head  and a short pipe in his mouth  came from behind a corner of the shed and approached pierre with a friendly wink
 what sunshine  monsieur kiril    their name for pierre    eh  just like spring   and the corporal leaned against the door and offered pierre his pipe  though whenever he offered it pierre always declined it
 to be on the march in such weather     he began
pierre inquired what was being said about leaving  and the corporal told him that nearly all the troops were starting and there ought to be an order about the prisoners that day
sokolov  one of the soldiers in the shed with pierre  was dying  and pierre told the corporal that something should be done about him
the corporal replied that pierre need not worry about that as they had an ambulance and a permanent hospital and arrangements would be made for the sick  and that in general everything that could happen had been foreseen by the authorities
 besides  monsieur kiril  you have only to say a word to the captain  you know
he is a man who never forgets anything
speak to the captain when he makes his round  he will do anything for you    the captain of whom the corporal spoke often had long chats with pierre and showed him all sorts of favors    'you see  st
thomas ' he said to me the other day
'monsieur kiril is a man of education  who speaks french
he is a russian seigneur who has had misfortunes  but he is a man
he knows what's what   
if he wants anything and asks me  he won't get a refusal
when one has studied  you see  one likes education and well bred people ' it is for your sake i mention it  monsieur kiril
the other day if it had not been for you that affair would have ended ill   and after chatting a while longer  the corporal went away
 the affair he had alluded to had happened a few days before a fight between the prisoners and the french soldiers  in which pierre had succeeded in pacifying his comrades   some of the prisoners who had heard pierre talking to the corporal immediately asked what the frenchman had said while pierre was repeating what he had been told about the army leaving moscow  a thin  sallow  tattered french soldier came up to the door of the shed
rapidly and timidly raising his fingers to his forehead by way of greeting  he asked pierre whether the soldier platoche to whom he had given a shirt to sew was in that shed
a week before the french had had boot leather and linen issued to them  which they had given out to the prisoners to make up into boots and shirts for them
 ready  ready  dear fellow   said karataev  coming out with a neatly folded shirt
karataev  on account of the warm weather and for convenience at work  was wearing only trousers and a tattered shirt as black as soot
his hair was bound round  workman fashion  with a wisp of lime tree bast  and his round face seemed rounder and pleasanter than ever
 a promise is own brother to performance  i said friday and here it is  ready   said platon  smiling and unfolding the shirt he had sewn
the frenchman glanced around uneasily and then  as if overcoming his hesitation  rapidly threw off his uniform and put on the shirt
he had a long  greasy  flowered silk waistcoat next to his sallow  thin bare body  but no shirt
he was evidently afraid the prisoners looking on would laugh at him  and thrust his head into the shirt hurriedly
none of the prisoners said a word
 see  it fits well   platon kept repeating  pulling the shirt straight
the frenchman  having pushed his head and hands through  without raising his eyes  looked down at the shirt and examined the seams  you see  dear man  this is not a sewing shop  and i had no proper tools  and  as they say  one needs a tool even to kill a louse   said platon with one of his round smiles  obviously pleased with his work
 it's good  quite good  thank you   said the frenchman  in french   but there must be some linen left over    it will fit better still when it sets to your body   said karataev  still admiring his handiwork
 you'll be nice and comfortable       thanks  thanks  old fellow   
but the bits left over   said the frenchman again and smiled
he took out an assignation ruble note and gave it to karataev
 but give me the pieces that are over   pierre saw that platon did not want to understand what the frenchman was saying  and he looked on without interfering
karataev thanked the frenchman for the money and went on admiring his own work
the frenchman insisted on having the pieces returned that were left over and asked pierre to translate what he said
 what does he want the bits for   said karataev
 they'd make fine leg bands for us
well  never mind   and karataev  with a suddenly changed and saddened expression  took a small bundle of scraps from inside his shirt and gave it to the frenchman without looking at him
 oh dear   muttered karataev and went away
the frenchman looked at the linen  considered for a moment  then looked inquiringly at pierre and  as if pierre's look had told him something  suddenly blushed and shouted in a squeaky voice   platoche  eh  platoche  keep them yourself   and handing back the odd bits he turned and went out
 there  look at that   said karataev  swaying his head
 people said they were not christians  but they too have souls
it's what the old folk used to say  'a sweating hand's an open hand  a dry hand's close ' he's naked  but yet he's given it back   karataev smiled thoughtfully and was silent awhile looking at the pieces
 but they'll make grand leg bands  dear friend   he said  and went back into the shed
four weeks had passed since pierre had been taken prisoner and though the french had offered to move him from the men's to the officers' shed  he had stayed in the shed where he was first put
in burned and devastated moscow pierre experienced almost the extreme limits of privation a man can endure  but thanks to his physical strength and health  of which he had till then been unconscious  and thanks especially to the fact that the privations came so gradually that it was impossible to say when they began  he endured his position not only lightly but joyfully
and just at this time he obtained the tranquillity and ease of mind he had formerly striven in vain to reach
he had long sought in different ways that tranquillity of mind  that inner harmony which had so impressed him in the soldiers at the battle of borodino
he had sought it in philanthropy  in freemasonry  in the dissipations of town life  in wine  in heroic feats of self sacrifice  and in romantic love for natasha  he had sought it by reasoning and all these quests and experiments had failed him
and now without thinking about it he had found that peace and inner harmony only through the horror of death  through privation  and through what he recognized in karataev
those dreadful moments he had lived through at the executions had as it were forever washed away from his imagination and memory the agitating thoughts and feelings that had formerly seemed so important
it did not now occur to him to think of russia  or the war  or politics  or napoleon
it was plain to him that all these things were no business of his  and that he was not called on to judge concerning them and therefore could not do so
 russia and summer weather are not bound together   he thought  repeating words of karataev's which he found strangely consoling
his intention of killing napoleon and his calculations of the cabalistic number of the beast of the apocalypse now seemed to him meaningless and even ridiculous
his anger with his wife and anxiety that his name should not be smirched now seemed not merely trivial but even amusing
what concern was it of his that somewhere or other that woman was leading the life she preferred  what did it matter to anybody  and especially to him  whether or not they found out that their prisoner's name was count bezukhov  he now often remembered his conversation with prince andrew and quite agreed with him  though he understood prince andrew's thoughts somewhat differently
prince andrew had thought and said that happiness could only be negative  but had said it with a shade of bitterness and irony as though he was really saying that all desire for positive happiness is implanted in us merely to torment us and never be satisfied
but pierre believed it without any mental reservation
the absence of suffering  the satisfaction of one's needs and consequent freedom in the choice of one's occupation  that is  of one's way of life  now seemed to pierre to be indubitably man's highest happiness
here and now for the first time he fully appreciated the enjoyment of eating when he wanted to eat  drinking when he wanted to drink  sleeping when he wanted to sleep  of warmth when he was cold  of talking to a fellow man when he wished to talk and to hear a human voice
the satisfaction of one's needs  good food  cleanliness  and freedom now that he was deprived of all this  seemed to pierre to constitute perfect happiness  and the choice of occupation  that is  of his way of life now that that was so restricted seemed to him such an easy matter that he forgot that a superfluity of the comforts of life destroys all joy in satisfying one's needs  while great freedom in the choice of occupation such freedom as his wealth  his education  and his social position had given him in his own life is just what makes the choice of occupation insolubly difficult and destroys the desire and possibility of having an occupation
all pierre's daydreams now turned on the time when he would be free yet subsequently  and for the rest of his life  he thought and spoke with enthusiasm of that month of captivity  of those irrecoverable  strong  joyful sensations  and chiefly of the complete peace of mind and inner freedom which he experienced only during those weeks
when on the first day he got up early  went out of the shed at dawn  and saw the cupolas and crosses of the new convent of the virgin still dark at first  the hoarfrost on the dusty grass  the sparrow hills  and the wooded banks above the winding river vanishing in the purple distance  when he felt the contact of the fresh air and heard the noise of the crows flying from moscow across the field  and when afterwards light gleamed from the east and the sun's rim appeared solemnly from behind a cloud  and the cupolas and crosses  the hoarfrost  the distance and the river  all began to sparkle in the glad light  pierre felt a new joy and strength in life such as he had never before known
and this not only stayed with him during the whole of his imprisonment  but even grew in strength as the hardships of his position increased
that feeling of alertness and of readiness for anything was still further strengthened in him by the high opinion his fellow prisoners formed of him soon after his arrival at the shed
with his knowledge of languages  the respect shown him by the french  his simplicity  his readiness to give anything asked of him  he received the allowance of three rubles a week made to officers   with his strength  which he showed to the soldiers by pressing nails into the walls of the hut  his gentleness to his companions  and his capacity for sitting still and thinking without doing anything  which seemed to them incomprehensible   he appeared to them a rather mysterious and superior being
the very qualities that had been a hindrance  if not actually harmful  to him in the world he had lived in his strength  his disdain for the comforts of life  his absent mindedness and simplicity here among these people gave him almost the status of a hero
and pierre felt that their opinion placed responsibilities upon him
the french evacuation began on the night between the sixth and seventh of october  kitchens and sheds were dismantled  carts loaded  and troops and baggage trains started
at seven in the morning a french convoy in marching trim  wearing shakos and carrying muskets  knapsacks  and enormous sacks  stood in front of the sheds  and animated french talk mingled with curses sounded all along the lines
in the shed everyone was ready  dressed  belted  shod  and only awaited the order to start
the sick soldier  sokolov  pale and thin with dark shadows round his eyes  alone sat in his place barefoot and not dressed
his eyes  prominent from the emaciation of his face  gazed inquiringly at his comrades who were paying no attention to him  and he moaned regularly and quietly it was evidently not so much his sufferings that caused him to moan  he had dysentery  as his fear and grief at being left alone
pierre  girt with a rope round his waist and wearing shoes karataev had made for him from some leather a french soldier had torn off a tea chest and brought to have his boots mended with  went up to the sick man and squatted down beside him
 you know  sokolov  they are not all going away  they have a hospital here
you may be better off than we others   said pierre
 o lord  oh  it will be the death of me  o lord   moaned the man in a louder voice
 i'll go and ask them again directly   said pierre  rising and going to the door of the shed
just as pierre reached the door  the corporal who had offered him a pipe the day before came up to it with two soldiers
the corporal and soldiers were in marching kit with knapsacks and shakos that had metal straps  and these changed their familiar faces
the corporal came  according to orders  to shut the door
the prisoners had to be counted before being let out
 corporal  what will they do with the sick man      pierre began
but even as he spoke he began to doubt whether this was the corporal he knew or a stranger  so unlike himself did the corporal seem at that moment moreover  just as pierre was speaking a sharp rattle of drums was suddenly heard from both sides the corporal frowned at pierre's words and  uttering some meaningless oaths  slammed the door
the shed became semidark  and the sharp rattle of the drums on two sides drowned the sick man's groans  there it is   
it again      said pierre to himself  and an involuntary shudder ran down his spine in the corporal's changed face  in the sound of his voice  in the stirring and deafening noise of the drums  he recognized that mysterious  callous force which compelled people against their will to kill their fellow men  that force the effect of which he had witnessed during the executions to fear or to try to escape that force  to address entreaties or exhortations to those who served as its tools  was useless
pierre knew this now
one had to wait and endure
he did not again go to the sick man  nor turn to look at him  but stood frowning by the door of the hut
when that door was opened and the prisoners  crowding against one another like a flock of sheep  squeezed into the exit  pierre pushed his way forward and approached that very captain who as the corporal had assured him was ready to do anything for him
the captain was also in marching kit  and on his cold face appeared that same it which pierre had recognized in the corporal's words and in the roll of the drums  pass on  pass on   the captain reiterated  frowning sternly  and looking at the prisoners who thronged past him
pierre went up to him  though he knew his attempt would be vain
 what now   the officer asked with a cold look as if not recognizing pierre
pierre told him about the sick man
 he'll manage to walk  devil take him   said the captain
 pass on  pass on   he continued without looking at pierre
 but he is dying   pierre again began
 be so good     shouted the captain  frowning angrily
 dram da da dam  dam dam     rattled the drums  and pierre understood that this mysterious force completely controlled these men and that it was now useless to say any more the officer prisoners were separated from the soldiers and told to march in front
there were about thirty officers  with pierre among them  and about three hundred men
the officers  who had come from the other sheds  were all strangers to pierre and much better dressed than he
they looked at him and at his shoes mistrustfully  as at an alien
not far from him walked a fat major with a sallow  bloated  angry face  who was wearing a kazan dressing gown tied round with a towel  and who evidently enjoyed the respect of his fellow prisoners
he kept one hand  in which he clasped his tobacco pouch  inside the bosom of his dressing gown and held the stem of his pipe firmly with the other
panting and puffing  the major grumbled and growled at everybody because he thought he was being pushed and that they were all hurrying when they had nowhere to hurry to and were all surprised at something when there was nothing to be surprised at
another  a thin little officer  was speaking to everyone  conjecturing where they were now being taken and how far they would get that day
an official in felt boots and wearing a commissariat uniform ran round from side to side and gazed at the ruins of moscow  loudly announcing his observations as to what had been burned down and what this or that part of the city was that they could see
a third officer  who by his accent was a pole  disputed with the commissariat officer  arguing that he was mistaken in his identification of the different wards of moscow
 what are you disputing about   said the major angrily
 what does it matter whether it is st
nicholas or st
blasius  you see it's burned down  and there's an end of it   
what are you pushing for  isn't the road wide enough   said he  turning to a man behind him who was not pushing him at all
 oh  oh  oh  what have they done   the prisoners on one side and another were heard saying as they gazed on the charred ruins
 all beyond the river  and zubova  and in the kremlin   
just look  there's not half of it left
yes  i told you the whole quarter beyond the river  and so it is    well  you know it's burned  so what's the use of talking   said the major
as they passed near a church in the khamovniki  one of the few unburned quarters of moscow  the whole mass of prisoners suddenly started to one side and exclamations of horror and disgust were heard
 ah  the villains  what heathens  yes  dead  dead  so he is  
and smeared with something   pierre too drew near the church where the thing was that evoked these exclamations  and dimly made out something leaning against the palings surrounding the church
from the words of his comrades who saw better than he did  he found that this was the body of a man  set upright against the palings with its face smeared with soot  go on  what the devil  
go on  thirty thousand devils      the convoy guards began cursing and the french soldiers  with fresh virulence  drove away with their swords the crowd of prisoners who were gazing at the dead man
through the cross streets of the khamovniki quarter the prisoners marched  followed only by their escort and the vehicles and wagons belonging to that escort  but when they reached the supply stores they came among a huge and closely packed train of artillery mingled with private vehicles
at the bridge they all halted  waiting for those in front to get across
from the bridge they had a view of endless lines of moving baggage trains before and behind them
to the right  where the kaluga road turns near neskuchny  endless rows of troops and carts stretched away into the distance these were troops of beauharnais' corps which had started before any of the others
behind  along the riverside and across the stone bridge  were ney's troops and transport
davout's troops  in whose charge were the prisoners  were crossing the crimean bridge and some were already debouching into the kaluga road
but the baggage trains stretched out so that the last of beauharnais' train had not yet got out of moscow and reached the kaluga road when the vanguard of ney's army was already emerging from the great ordynka street when they had crossed the crimean bridge the prisoners moved a few steps forward  halted  and again moved on  and from all sides vehicles and men crowded closer and closer together
they advanced the few hundred paces that separated the bridge from the kaluga road  taking more than an hour to do so  and came out upon the square where the streets of the transmoskva ward and the kaluga road converge  and the prisoners jammed close together had to stand for some hours at that crossway
from all sides  like the roar of the sea  were heard the rattle of wheels  the tramp of feet  and incessant shouts of anger and abuse
pierre stood pressed against the wall of a charred house  listening to that noise which mingled in his imagination with the roll of the drums to get a better view  several officer prisoners climbed onto the wall of the half burned house against which pierre was leaning
 what crowds  just look at the crowds   
they've loaded goods even on the cannon  look there  those are furs   they exclaimed
 just see what the blackguards have looted   
there  see what that one has behind in the cart   
why  those are settings taken from some icons  by heaven   
oh  the rascals   
see how that fellow has loaded himself up  he can hardly walk  good lord  they've even grabbed those chaises    see that fellow there sitting on the trunks   
heavens  they're fighting    that's right  hit him on the snout on his snout  like this  we shan't get away before evening
look  look there   
why  that must be napoleon's own
see what horses  and the monograms with a crown  it's like a portable house    that fellow's dropped his sack and doesn't see it
fighting again  
a woman with a baby  and not bad looking either  yes  i dare say  that's the way they'll let you pass  
just look  there's no end to it
russian wenches  by heaven  so they are  in carriages see how comfortably they've settled themselves   again  as at the church in khamovniki  a wave of general curiosity bore all the prisoners forward onto the road  and pierre  thanks to his stature  saw over the heads of the others what so attracted their curiosity in three carriages involved among the munition carts  closely squeezed together  sat women with rouged faces  dressed in glaring colors  who were shouting something in shrill voices
from the moment pierre had recognized the appearance of the mysterious force nothing had seemed to him strange or dreadful  neither the corpse smeared with soot for fun nor these women hurrying away nor the burned ruins of moscow
all that he now witnessed scarcely made an impression on him as if his soul  making ready for a hard struggle  refused to receive impressions that might weaken it
the women's vehicles drove by
behind them came more carts  soldiers  wagons  soldiers  gun carriages  carriages  soldiers  ammunition carts  more soldiers  and now and then women
pierre did not see the people as individuals but saw their movement
all these people and horses seemed driven forward by some invisible power
during the hour pierre watched them they all came flowing from the different streets with one and the same desire to get on quickly  they all jostled one another  began to grow angry and to fight  white teeth gleamed  brows frowned  ever the same words of abuse flew from side to side  and all the faces bore the same swaggeringly resolute and coldly cruel expression that had struck pierre that morning on the corporal's face when the drums were beating it was not till nearly evening that the officer commanding the escort collected his men and with shouts and quarrels forced his way in among the baggage trains  and the prisoners  hemmed in on all sides  emerged onto the kaluga road
they marched very quickly  without resting  and halted only when the sun began to set
the baggage carts drew up close together and the men began to prepare for their night's rest
they all appeared angry and dissatisfied
for a long time  oaths  angry shouts  and fighting could be heard from all sides
a carriage that followed the escort ran into one of the carts and knocked a hole in it with its pole
several soldiers ran toward the cart from different sides  some beat the carriage horses on their heads  turning them aside  others fought among themselves  and pierre saw that one german was badly wounded on the head by a sword it seemed that all these men  now that they had stopped amid fields in the chill dusk of the autumn evening  experienced one and the same feeling of unpleasant awakening from the hurry and eagerness to push on that had seized them at the start
once at a standstill they all seemed to understand that they did not yet know where they were going  and that much that was painful and difficult awaited them on this journey
during this halt the escort treated the prisoners even worse than they had done at the start
it was here that the prisoners for the first time received horseflesh for their meat ration
from the officer down to the lowest soldier they showed what seemed like personal spite against each of the prisoners  in unexpected contrast to their former friendly relations
this spite increased still more when  on calling over the roll of prisoners  it was found that in the bustle of leaving moscow one russian soldier  who had pretended to suffer from colic  had escaped
pierre saw a frenchman beat a russian soldier cruelly for straying too far from the road  and heard his friend the captain reprimand and threaten to court martial a noncommissioned officer on account of the escape of the russian
to the noncommissioned officer's excuse that the prisoner was ill and could not walk  the officer replied that the order was to shoot those who lagged behind
pierre felt that that fatal force which had crushed him during the executions  but which he had not felt during his imprisonment  now again controlled his existence
it was terrible  but he felt that in proportion to the efforts of that fatal force to crush him  there grew and strengthened in his soul a power of life independent of it
he ate his supper of buckwheat soup with horseflesh and chatted with his comrades neither pierre nor any of the others spoke of what they had seen in moscow  or of the roughness of their treatment by the french  or of the order to shoot them which had been announced to them
as if in reaction against the worsening of their position they were all particularly animated and gay
they spoke of personal reminiscences  of amusing scenes they had witnessed during the campaign  and avoided all talk of their present situation
the sun had set long since
bright stars shone out here and there in the sky
a red glow as of a conflagration spread above the horizon from the rising full moon  and that vast red ball swayed strangely in the gray haze
it grew light
the evening was ending  but the night had not yet come
pierre got up and left his new companions  crossing between the campfires to the other side of the road where he had been told the common soldier prisoners were stationed
he wanted to talk to them
on the road he was stopped by a french sentinel who ordered him back
pierre turned back  not to his companions by the campfire  but to an unharnessed cart where there was nobody
tucking his legs under him and dropping his head he sat down on the cold ground by the wheel of the cart and remained motionless a long while sunk in thought
suddenly he burst out into a fit of his broad  good natured laughter  so loud that men from various sides turned with surprise to see what this strange and evidently solitary laughter could mean
 ha ha ha   laughed pierre
and he said aloud to himself   the soldier did not let me pass they took me and shut me up
they hold me captive
what  me  me  my immortal soul  ha ha ha  ha ha ha      and he laughed till tears started to his eyes
a man got up and came to see what this queer big fellow was laughing at all by himself pierre stopped laughing  got up  went farther away from the inquisitive man  and looked around him
the huge  endless bivouac that had previously resounded with the crackling of campfires and the voices of many men had grown quiet  the red campfires were growing paler and dying down
high up in the light sky hung the full moon
forests and fields beyond the camp  unseen before  were now visible in the distance
and farther still  beyond those forests and fields  the bright  oscillating  limitless distance lured one to itself
pierre glanced up at the sky and the twinkling stars in its faraway depths
 and all that is me  all that is within me  and it is all i   thought pierre
 and they caught all that and put it into a shed boarded up with planks   he smiled  and went and lay down to sleep beside his companions
in the early days of october another envoy came to kutuzov with a letter from napoleon proposing peace and falsely dated from moscow  though napoleon was already not far from kutuzov on the old kaluga road
kutuzov replied to this letter as he had done to the one formerly brought by lauriston  saying that there could be no question of peace
soon after that a report was received from dorokhov's guerrilla detachment operating to the left of tarutino that troops of broussier's division had been seen at forminsk and that being separated from the rest of the french army they might easily be destroyed
the soldiers and officers again demanded action
generals on the staff  excited by the memory of the easy victory at tarutino  urged kutuzov to carry out dorokhov's suggestion
kutuzov did not consider any offensive necessary
the result was a compromise which was inevitable  a small detachment was sent to forminsk to attack broussier
by a strange coincidence  this task  which turned out to be a most difficult and important one  was entrusted to dokhturov that same modest little dokhturov whom no one had described to us as drawing up plans of battles  dashing about in front of regiments  showering crosses on batteries  and so on  and who was thought to be and was spoken of as undecided and undiscerning  but whom we find commanding wherever the position was most difficult all through the russo french wars from austerlitz to the year 1813
at austerlitz he remained last at the augezd dam  rallying the regiments  saving what was possible when all were flying and perishing and not a single general was left in the rear guard
ill with fever he went to smolensk with twenty thousand men to defend the town against napoleon's whole army
in smolensk  at the malakhov gate  he had hardly dozed off in a paroxysm of fever before he was awakened by the bombardment of the town and smolensk held out all day long
at the battle of borodino  when bagration was killed and nine tenths of the men of our left flank had fallen and the full force of the french artillery fire was directed against it  the man sent there was this same irresolute and undiscerning dokhturov kutuzov hastening to rectify a mistake he had made by sending someone else there first
and the quiet little dokhturov rode thither  and borodino became the greatest glory of the russian army
many heroes have been described to us in verse and prose  but of dokhturov scarcely a word has been said
it was dokhturov again whom they sent to forminsk and from there to maloyaroslavets  the place where the last battle with the french was fought and where the obvious disintegration of the french army began  and we are told of many geniuses and heroes of that period of the campaign  but of dokhturov nothing or very little is said and that dubiously
and this silence about dokhturov is the clearest testimony to his merit
it is natural for a man who does not understand the workings of a machine to imagine that a shaving that has fallen into it by chance and is interfering with its action and tossing about in it is its most important part
the man who does not understand the construction of the machine cannot conceive that the small connecting cogwheel which revolves quietly is one of the most essential parts of the machine  and not the shaving which merely harms and hinders the working on the tenth of october when dokhturov had gone halfway to forminsk and stopped at the village of aristovo  preparing faithfully to execute the orders he had received  the whole french army having  in its convulsive movement  reached murat's position apparently in order to give battle suddenly without any reason turned off to the left onto the new kaluga road and began to enter forminsk  where only broussier had been till then
at that time dokhturov had under his command  besides dorokhov's detachment  the two small guerrilla detachments of figner and seslavin
on the evening of october 11 seslavin came to the aristovo headquarters with a french guardsman he had captured
the prisoner said that the troops that had entered forminsk that day were the vanguard of the whole army  that napoleon was there and the whole army had left moscow four days previously
that same evening a house serf who had come from borovsk said he had seen an immense army entering the town
some cossacks of dokhturov's detachment reported having sighted the french guards marching along the road to borovsk
from all these reports it was evident that where they had expected to meet a single division there was now the whole french army marching from moscow in an unexpected direction along the kaluga road
dokhturov was unwilling to undertake any action  as it was not clear to him now what he ought to do
he had been ordered to attack forminsk
but only broussier had been there at that time and now the whole french army was there
ermolov wished to act on his own judgment  but dokhturov insisted that he must have kutuzov's instructions
so it was decided to send a dispatch to the staff
for this purpose a capable officer  bolkhovitinov  was chosen  who was to explain the whole affair by word of mouth  besides delivering a written report
toward midnight bolkhovitinov  having received the dispatch and verbal instructions  galloped off to the general staff accompanied by a cossack with spare horses
it was a warm  dark  autumn night
it had been raining for four days
having changed horses twice and galloped twenty miles in an hour and a half over a sticky  muddy road  bolkhovitinov reached litashevka after one o'clock at night
dismounting at a cottage on whose wattle fence hung a signboard  general staff  and throwing down his reins  he entered a dark passage
 the general on duty  quick  it's very important   said he to someone who had risen and was sniffing in the dark passage
 he has been very unwell since the evening and this is the third night he has not slept   said the orderly pleadingly in a whisper
 you should wake the captain first    but this is very important  from general dokhturov   said bolkhovitinov  entering the open door which he had found by feeling in the dark
the orderly had gone in before him and began waking somebody
 your honor  your honor  a courier    what  what's that  from whom   came a sleepy voice
 from dokhturov and from alexey petrovich
napoleon is at forminsk   said bolkhovitinov  unable to see in the dark who was speaking but guessing by the voice that it was not konovnitsyn
the man who had wakened yawned and stretched himself  i don't like waking him   he said  fumbling for something  he is very ill
perhaps this is only a rumor    here is the dispatch   said bolkhovitinov
 my orders are to give it at once to the general on duty    wait a moment  i'll light a candle
you damned rascal  where do you always hide it   said the voice of the man who was stretching himself  to the orderly  this was shcherbinin  konovnitsyn's adjutant    i've found it  i've found it   he added the orderly was striking a light and shcherbinin was fumbling for something on the candlestick
 oh  the nasty beasts   said he with disgust
by the light of the sparks bolkhovitinov saw shcherbinin's youthful face as he held the candle  and the face of another man who was still asleep
this was konovnitsyn
when the flame of the sulphur splinters kindled by the tinder burned up  first blue and then red  shcherbinin lit the tallow candle  from the candlestick of which the cockroaches that had been gnawing it were running away  and looked at the messenger
bolkhovitinov was bespattered all over with mud and had smeared his face by wiping it with his sleeve
 who gave the report   inquired shcherbinin  taking the envelope
 the news is reliable   said bolkhovitinov
 prisoners  cossacks  and the scouts all say the same thing    there's nothing to be done  we'll have to wake him   said shcherbinin  rising and going up to the man in the nightcap who lay covered by a greatcoat
 peter petrovich   said he
 konovnitsyn did not stir    to the general staff   he said with a smile  knowing that those words would be sure to arouse him
and in fact the head in the nightcap was lifted at once
on konovnitsyn's handsome  resolute face with cheeks flushed by fever  there still remained for an instant a faraway dreamy expression remote from present affairs  but then he suddenly started and his face assumed its habitual calm and firm appearance
 well  what is it  from whom   he asked immediately but without hurry  blinking at the light
while listening to the officer's report konovnitsyn broke the seal and read the dispatch
hardly had he done so before he lowered his legs in their woolen stockings to the earthen floor and began putting on his boots
then he took off his nightcap  combed his hair over his temples  and donned his cap
 did you get here quickly  let us go to his highness   konovnitsyn had understood at once that the news brought was of great importance and that no time must be lost
he did not consider or ask himself whether the news was good or bad that did not interest him
he regarded the whole business of the war not with his intelligence or his reason but by something else
there was within him a deep unexpressed conviction that all would be well  but that one must not trust to this and still less speak about it  but must only attend to one's own work
and he did his work  giving his whole strength to the task
peter petrovich konovnitsyn  like dokhturov  seems to have been included merely for propriety's sake in the list of the so called heroes of 1812 the barclays  raevskis  ermolovs  platovs  and miloradoviches like dokhturov he had the reputation of being a man of very limited capacity and information  and like dokhturov he never made plans of battle but was always found where the situation was most difficult
since his appointment as general on duty he had always slept with his door open  giving orders that every messenger should be allowed to wake him up
in battle he was always under fire  so that kutuzov reproved him for it and feared to send him to the front  and like dokhturov he was one of those unnoticed cogwheels that  without clatter or noise  constitute the most essential part of the machine
coming out of the hut into the damp  dark night konovnitsyn frowned partly from an increased pain in his head and partly at the unpleasant thought that occurred to him  of how all that nest of influential men on the staff would be stirred up by this news  especially bennigsen  who ever since tarutino had been at daggers drawn with kutuzov  and how they would make suggestions  quarrel  issue orders  and rescind them
and this premonition was disagreeable to him though he knew it could not be helped
and in fact toll  to whom he went to communicate the news  immediately began to expound his plans to a general sharing his quarters  until konovnitsyn  who listened in weary silence  reminded him that they must go to see his highness
kutuzov like all old people did not sleep much at night
he often fell asleep unexpectedly in the daytime  but at night  lying on his bed without undressing  he generally remained awake thinking
so he lay now on his bed  supporting his large  heavy  scarred head on his plump hand  with his one eye open  meditating and peering into the darkness
since bennigsen  who corresponded with the emperor and had more influence than anyone else on the staff  had begun to avoid him  kutuzov was more at ease as to the possibility of himself and his troops being obliged to take part in useless aggressive movements the lesson of the tarutino battle and of the day before it  which kutuzov remembered with pain  must  he thought  have some effect on others too
 they must understand that we can only lose by taking the offensive
patience and time are my warriors  my champions   thought kutuzov
he knew that an apple should not be plucked while it is green
it will fall of itself when ripe  but if picked unripe the apple is spoiled  the tree is harmed  and your teeth are set on edge
like an experienced sportsman he knew that the beast was wounded  and wounded as only the whole strength of russia could have wounded it  but whether it was mortally wounded or not was still an undecided question
now by the fact of lauriston and barthelemi having been sent  and by the reports of the guerrillas  kutuzov was almost sure that the wound was mortal
but he needed further proofs and it was necessary to wait
 they want to run to see how they have wounded it
wait and we shall see  continual maneuvers  continual advances   thought he
 what for  only to distinguish themselves  as if fighting were fun they are like children from whom one can't get any sensible account of what has happened because they all want to show how well they can fight
but that's not what is needed now
 and what ingenious maneuvers they all propose to me  it seems to them that when they have thought of two or three contingencies   he remembered the general plan sent him from petersburg   they have foreseen everything but the contingencies are endless   the undecided question as to whether the wound inflicted at borodino was mortal or not had hung over kutuzov's head for a whole month
on the one hand the french had occupied moscow
on the other kutuzov felt assured with all his being that the terrible blow into which he and all the russians had put their whole strength must have been mortal
but in any case proofs were needed  he had waited a whole month for them and grew more impatient the longer he waited
lying on his bed during those sleepless nights he did just what he reproached those younger generals for doing
he imagined all sorts of possible contingencies  just like the younger men  but with this difference  that he saw thousands of contingencies instead of two or three and based nothing on them
the longer he thought the more contingencies presented themselves he imagined all sorts of movements of the napoleonic army as a whole or in sections against petersburg  or against him  or to outflank him
he thought too of the possibility  which he feared most of all  that napoleon might fight him with his own weapon and remain in moscow awaiting him
kutuzov even imagined that napoleon's army might turn back through medyn and yukhnov  but the one thing he could not foresee was what happened the insane  convulsive stampede of napoleon's army during its first eleven days after leaving moscow  a stampede which made possible what kutuzov had not yet even dared to think of the complete extermination of the french
dorokhov's report about broussier's division  the guerrillas' reports of distress in napoleon's army  rumors of preparations for leaving moscow  all confirmed the supposition that the french army was beaten and preparing for flight
but these were only suppositions  which seemed important to the younger men but not to kutuzov
with his sixty years' experience he knew what value to attach to rumors  knew how apt people who desire anything are to group all news so that it appears to confirm what they desire  and he knew how readily in such cases they omit all that makes for the contrary
and the more he desired it the less he allowed himself to believe it this question absorbed all his mental powers
all else was to him only life's customary routine
to such customary routine belonged his conversations with the staff  the letters he wrote from tarutino to madame de stael  the reading of novels  the distribution of awards  his correspondence with petersburg  and so on
but the destruction of the french  which he alone foresaw  was his heart's one desire
on the night of the eleventh of october he lay leaning on his arm and thinking of that
there was a stir in the next room and he heard the steps of toll  konovnitsyn  and bolkhovitinov
 eh  who's there  come in  come in  what news   the field marshal called out to them
while a footman was lighting a candle  toll communicated the substance of the news
 who brought it   asked kutuzov with a look which  when the candle was lit  struck toll by its cold severity
 there can be no doubt about it  your highness    call him in  call him here   kutuzov sat up with one leg hanging down from the bed and his big paunch resting against the other which was doubled under him
he screwed up his seeing eye to scrutinize the messenger more carefully  as if wishing to read in his face what preoccupied his own mind
 tell me  tell me  friend   said he to bolkhovitinov in his low  aged voice  as he pulled together the shirt which gaped open on his chest   come nearer  nearer
what news have you brought me  eh  that napoleon has left moscow  are you sure  eh   bolkhovitinov gave a detailed account from the beginning of all he had been told to report
 speak quicker  quicker  don't torture me   kutuzov interrupted him
bolkhovitinov told him everything and was then silent  awaiting instructions
toll was beginning to say something but kutuzov checked him
he tried to say something  but his face suddenly puckered and wrinkled  he waved his arm at toll and turned to the opposite side of the room  to the corner darkened by the icons that hung there
 o lord  my creator  thou has heard our prayer     said he in a tremulous voice with folded hands
 russia is saved
i thank thee  o lord   and he wept
from the time he received this news to the end of the campaign all kutuzov's activity was directed toward restraining his troops  by authority  by guile  and by entreaty  from useless attacks  maneuvers  or encounters with the perishing enemy
dokhturov went to malo yaroslavets  but kutuzov lingered with the main army and gave orders for the evacuation of kaluga a retreat beyond which town seemed to him quite possible
everywhere kutuzov retreated  but the enemy without waiting for his retreat fled in the opposite direction
napoleon's historians describe to us his skilled maneuvers at tarutino and malo yaroslavets  and make conjectures as to what would have happened had napoleon been in time to penetrate into the rich southern provinces
but not to speak of the fact that nothing prevented him from advancing into those southern provinces  for the russian army did not bar his way   the historians forget that nothing could have saved his army  for then already it bore within itself the germs of inevitable ruin how could that army which had found abundant supplies in moscow and had trampled them underfoot instead of keeping them  and on arriving at smolensk had looted provisions instead of storing them how could that army recuperate in kaluga province  which was inhabited by russians such as those who lived in moscow  and where fire had the same property of consuming what was set ablaze  that army could not recover anywhere
since the battle of borodino and the pillage of moscow it had borne within itself  as it were  the chemical elements of dissolution
the members of what had once been an army napoleon himself and all his soldiers fled without knowing whither  each concerned only to make his escape as quickly as possible from this position  of the hopelessness of which they were all more or less vaguely conscious so it came about that at the council at malo yaroslavets  when the generals pretending to confer together expressed various opinions  all mouths were closed by the opinion uttered by the simple minded soldier mouton who  speaking last  said what they all felt  that the one thing needful was to get away as quickly as possible  and no one  not even napoleon  could say anything against that truth which they all recognized
but though they all realized that it was necessary to get away  there still remained a feeling of shame at admitting that they must flee
an external shock was needed to overcome that shame  and this shock came in due time
it was what the french called  le hourra de l'empereur   the day after the council at malo yaroslavets napoleon rode out early in the morning amid the lines of his army with his suite of marshals and an escort  on the pretext of inspecting the army and the scene of the previous and of the impending battle
some cossacks on the prowl for booty fell in with the emperor and very nearly captured him
if the cossacks did not capture napoleon then  what saved him was the very thing that was destroying the french army  the booty on which the cossacks fell
here as at tarutino they went after plunder  leaving the men
disregarding napoleon they rushed after the plunder and napoleon managed to escape
when les enfants du don might so easily have taken the emperor himself in the midst of his army  it was clear that there was nothing for it but to fly as fast as possible along the nearest  familiar road napoleon with his forty year old stomach understood that hint  not feeling his former agility and boldness  and under the influence of the fright the cossacks had given him he at once agreed with mouton and issued orders as the historians tell us to retreat by the smolensk road
that napoleon agreed with mouton  and that the army retreated  does not prove that napoleon caused it to retreat  but that the forces which influenced the whole army and directed it along the mozhaysk  that is  the smolensk  road acted simultaneously on him also
a man in motion always devises an aim for that motion
to be able to go a thousand miles he must imagine that something good awaits him at the end of those thousand miles
one must have the prospect of a promised land to have the strength to move
the promised land for the french during their advance had been moscow  during their retreat it was their native land
but that native land was too far off  and for a man going a thousand miles it is absolutely necessary to set aside his final goal and to say to himself   today i shall get to a place twenty five miles off where i shall rest and spend the night   and during the first day's journey that resting place eclipses his ultimate goal and attracts all his hopes and desires and the impulses felt by a single person are always magnified in a crowd
for the french retreating along the old smolensk road  the final goal their native land was too remote  and their immediate goal was smolensk  toward which all their desires and hopes  enormously intensified in the mass  urged them on
it was not that they knew that much food and fresh troops awaited them in smolensk  nor that they were told so  on the contrary their superior officers  and napoleon himself  knew that provisions were scarce there   but because this alone could give them strength to move on and endure their present privations so both those who knew and those who did not know deceived themselves  and pushed on to smolensk as to a promised land coming out onto the highroad the french fled with surprising energy and unheard of rapidity toward the goal they had fixed on
besides the common impulse which bound the whole crowd of french into one mass and supplied them with a certain energy  there was another cause binding them together  their great numbers
as with the physical law of gravity  their enormous mass drew the individual human atoms to itself in their hundreds of thousands they moved like a whole nation
each of them desired nothing more than to give himself up as a prisoner to escape from all this horror and misery  but on the one hand the force of this common attraction to smolensk  their goal  drew each of them in the same direction  on the other hand an army corps could not surrender to a company  and though the french availed themselves of every convenient opportunity to detach themselves and to surrender on the slightest decent pretext  such pretexts did not always occur their very numbers and their crowded and swift movement deprived them of that possibility and rendered it not only difficult but impossible for the russians to stop this movement  to which the french were directing all their energies
beyond a certain limit no mechanical disruption of the body could hasten the process of decomposition
a lump of snow cannot be melted instantaneously
there is a certain limit of time in less than which no amount of heat can melt the snow
on the contrary the greater the heat the more solidified the remaining snow becomes
of the russian commanders kutuzov alone understood this
when the flight of the french army along the smolensk road became well defined  what konovnitsyn had foreseen on the night of the eleventh of october began to occur
the superior officers all wanted to distinguish themselves  to cut off  to seize  to capture  and to overthrow the french  and all clamored for action kutuzov alone used all his power  and such power is very limited in the case of any commander in chief  to prevent an attack
he could not tell them what we say now   why fight  why block the road  losing our own men and inhumanly slaughtering unfortunate wretches  what is the use of that  when a third of their army has melted away on the road from moscow to vyazma without any battle   but drawing from his aged wisdom what they could understand  he told them of the golden bridge  and they laughed at and slandered him  flinging themselves on  rending and exulting over the dying beast ermolov  miloradovich  platov  and others in proximity to the french near vyazma could not resist their desire to cut off and break up two french corps  and by way of reporting their intention to kutuzov they sent him a blank sheet of paper in an envelope and try as kutuzov might to restrain the troops  our men attacked  trying to bar the road
infantry regiments  we are told  advanced to the attack with music and with drums beating  and killed and lost thousands of men but they did not cut off or overthrow anybody and the french army  closing up more firmly at the danger  continued  while steadily melting away  to pursue its fatal path to smolensk
the battle of borodino  with the occupation of moscow that followed it and the flight of the french without further conflicts  is one of the most instructive phenomena in history
all historians agree that the external activity of states and nations in their conflicts with one another is expressed in wars  and that as a direct result of greater or less success in war the political strength of states and nations increases or decreases
strange as may be the historical account of how some king or emperor  having quarreled with another  collects an army  fights his enemy's army  gains a victory by killing three  five  or ten thousand men  and subjugates a kingdom and an entire nation of several millions  all the facts of history  as far as we know it  confirm the truth of the statement that the greater or lesser success of one army against another is the cause  or at least an essential indication  of an increase or decrease in the strength of the nation even though it is unintelligible why the defeat of an army a hundredth part of a nation  should oblige that whole nation to submit
an army gains a victory  and at once the rights of the conquering nation have increased to the detriment of the defeated
an army has suffered defeat  and at once a people loses its rights in proportion to the severity of the reverse  and if its army suffers a complete defeat the nation is quite subjugated
so according to history it has been found from the most ancient times  and so it is to our own day
all napoleon's wars serve to confirm this rule
in proportion to the defeat of the austrian army austria loses its rights  and the rights and the strength of france increase
the victories of the french at jena and auerstadt destroy the independent existence of prussia
but then  in 1812  the french gain a victory near moscow
moscow is taken and after that  with no further battles  it is not russia that ceases to exist  but the french army of six hundred thousand  and then napoleonic france itself
to strain the facts to fit the rules of history  to say that the field of battle at borodino remained in the hands of the russians  or that after moscow there were other battles that destroyed napoleon's army  is impossible
after the french victory at borodino there was no general engagement nor any that were at all serious  yet the french army ceased to exist
what does this mean  if it were an example taken from the history of china  we might say that it was not an historic phenomenon  which is the historians' usual expedient when anything does not fit their standards   if the matter concerned some brief conflict in which only a small number of troops took part  we might treat it as an exception  but this event occurred before our fathers' eyes  and for them it was a question of the life or death of their fatherland  and it happened in the greatest of all known wars
the period of the campaign of 1812 from the battle of borodino to the expulsion of the french proved that the winning of a battle does not produce a conquest and is not even an invariable indication of conquest  it proved that the force which decides the fate of peoples lies not in the conquerors  nor even in armies and battles  but in something else
the french historians  describing the condition of the french army before it left moscow  affirm that all was in order in the grand army  except the cavalry  the artillery  and the transport there was no forage for the horses or the cattle
that was a misfortune no one could remedy  for the peasants of the district burned their hay rather than let the french have it
the victory gained did not bring the usual results because the peasants karp and vlas  who after the french had evacuated moscow drove in their carts to pillage the town  and in general personally failed to manifest any heroic feelings   and the whole innumerable multitude of such peasants  did not bring their hay to moscow for the high price offered them  but burned it instead
let us imagine two men who have come out to fight a duel with rapiers according to all the rules of the art of fencing
the fencing has gone on for some time  suddenly one of the combatants  feeling himself wounded and understanding that the matter is no joke but concerns his life  throws down his rapier  and seizing the first cudgel that comes to hand begins to brandish it then let us imagine that the combatant who so sensibly employed the best and simplest means to attain his end was at the same time influenced by traditions of chivalry and  desiring to conceal the facts of the case  insisted that he had gained his victory with the rapier according to all the rules of art
one can imagine what confusion and obscurity would result from such an account of the duel
the fencer who demanded a contest according to the rules of fencing was the french army  his opponent who threw away the rapier and snatched up the cudgel was the russian people  those who try to explain the matter according to the rules of fencing are the historians who have described the event
after the burning of smolensk a war began which did not follow any previous traditions of war
the burning of towns and villages  the retreats after battles  the blow dealt at borodino and the renewed retreat  the burning of moscow  the capture of marauders  the seizure of transports  and the guerrilla war were all departures from the rules
napoleon felt this  and from the time he took up the correct fencing attitude in moscow and instead of his opponent's rapier saw a cudgel raised above his head  he did not cease to complain to kutuzov and to the emperor alexander that the war was being carried on contrary to all the rules as if there were any rules for killing people
in spite of the complaints of the french as to the nonobservance of the rules  in spite of the fact that to some highly placed russians it seemed rather disgraceful to fight with a cudgel and they wanted to assume a pose en quarte or en tierce according to all the rules  and to make an adroit thrust en prime  and so on the cudgel of the people's war was lifted with all its menacing and majestic strength  and without consulting anyone's tastes or rules and regardless of anything else  it rose and fell with stupid simplicity  but consistently  and belabored the french till the whole invasion had perished
and it is well for a people who do not as the french did in 1813 salute according to all the rules of art  and  presenting the hilt of their rapier gracefully and politely  hand it to their magnanimous conqueror  but at the moment of trial  without asking what rules others have adopted in similar cases  simply and easily pick up the first cudgel that comes to hand and strike with it till the feeling of resentment and revenge in their soul yields to a feeling of contempt and compassion
one of the most obvious and advantageous departures from the so called laws of war is the action of scattered groups against men pressed together in a mass
such action always occurs in wars that take on a national character
in such actions  instead of two crowds opposing each other  the men disperse  attack singly  run away when attacked by stronger forces  but again attack when opportunity offers
this was done by the guerrillas in spain  by the mountain tribes in the caucasus  and by the russians in 1812
people have called this kind of war  guerrilla warfare  and assume that by so calling it they have explained its meaning
but such a war does not fit in under any rule and is directly opposed to a well known rule of tactics which is accepted as infallible
that rule says that an attacker should concentrate his forces in order to be stronger than his opponent at the moment of conflict
guerrilla war  always successful  as history shows  directly infringes that rule
this contradiction arises from the fact that military science assumes the strength of an army to be identical with its numbers
military science says that the more troops the greater the strength
les gros bataillons ont toujours raison
* * large battalions are always victorious
for military science to say this is like defining momentum in mechanics by reference to the mass only  stating that momenta are equal or unequal to each other simply because the masses involved are equal or unequal
momentum  quantity of motion  is the product of mass and velocity
in military affairs the strength of an army is the product of its mass and some unknown x
military science  seeing in history innumerable instances of the fact that the size of any army does not coincide with its strength and that small detachments defeat larger ones  obscurely admits the existence of this unknown factor and tries to discover it now in a geometric formation  now in the equipment employed  now  and most usually  in the genius of the commanders
but the assignment of these various meanings to the factor does not yield results which accord with the historic facts
yet it is only necessary to abandon the false view  adopted to gratify the  heroes   of the efficacy of the directions issued in wartime by commanders  in order to find this unknown quantity
that unknown quantity is the spirit of the army  that is to say  the greater or lesser readiness to fight and face danger felt by all the men composing an army  quite independently of whether they are  or are not  fighting under the command of a genius  in two or three line formation  with cudgels or with rifles that repeat thirty times a minute
men who want to fight will always put themselves in the most advantageous conditions for fighting the spirit of an army is the factor which multiplied by the mass gives the resulting force
to define and express the significance of this unknown factor  the spirit of an army is a problem for science
this problem is only solvable if we cease arbitrarily to substitute for the unknown x itself the conditions under which that force becomes apparent  such as the commands of the general  the equipment employed  and so on  mistaking these for the real significance of the factor  and if we recognize this unknown quantity in its entirety as being the greater or lesser desire to fight and to face danger
only then  expressing known historic facts by equations and comparing the relative significance of this factor  can we hope to define the unknown
ten men  battalions  or divisions  fighting fifteen men  battalions  or divisions  conquer that is  kill or take captive all the others  while themselves losing four  so that on the one side four and on the other fifteen were lost consequently the four were equal to the fifteen  and therefore 4x = 15y
consequently x/y = 15/4
this equation does not give us the value of the unknown factor but gives us a ratio between two unknowns
and by bringing variously selected historic units  battles  campaigns  periods of war  into such equations  a series of numbers could be obtained in which certain laws should exist and might be discovered
the tactical rule that an army should act in masses when attacking  and in smaller groups in retreat  unconsciously confirms the truth that the strength of an army depends on its spirit to lead men forward under fire more discipline  obtainable only by movement in masses  is needed than is needed to resist attacks
but this rule which leaves out of account the spirit of the army continually proves incorrect and is in particularly striking contrast to the facts when some strong rise or fall in the spirit of the troops occurs  as in all national wars
the french  retreating in 1812 though according to tactics they should have separated into detachments to defend themselves congregated into a mass because the spirit of the army had so fallen that only the mass held the army together the russians  on the contrary  ought according to tactics to have attacked in mass  but in fact they split up into small units  because their spirit had so risen that separate individuals  without orders  dealt blows at the french without needing any compulsion to induce them to expose themselves to hardships and dangers the so called partisan war began with the entry of the french into smolensk
before partisan warfare had been officially recognized by the government  thousands of enemy stragglers  marauders  and foragers had been destroyed by the cossacks and the peasants  who killed them off as instinctively as dogs worry a stray mad dog to death
denis davydov  with his russian instinct  was the first to recognize the value of this terrible cudgel which regardless of the rules of military science destroyed the french  and to him belongs the credit for taking the first step toward regularizing this method of warfare
on august 24 davydov's first partisan detachment was formed and then others were recognized
the further the campaign progressed the more numerous these detachments became
the irregulars destroyed the great army piecemeal
they gathered the fallen leaves that dropped of themselves from that withered tree the french army  and sometimes shook that tree itself by october  when the french were fleeing toward smolensk  there were hundreds of such companies  of various sizes and characters
there were some that adopted all the army methods and had infantry  artillery  staffs  and the comforts of life
others consisted solely of cossack cavalry
there were also small scratch groups of foot and horse  and groups of peasants and landowners that remained unknown
a sacristan commanded one party which captured several hundred prisoners in the course of a month  and there was vasilisa  the wife of a village elder  who slew hundreds of the french
the partisan warfare flamed up most fiercely in the latter days of october
its first period had passed  when the partisans themselves  amazed at their own boldness  feared every minute to be surrounded and captured by the french  and hid in the forests without unsaddling  hardly daring to dismount and always expecting to be pursued by the end of october this kind of warfare had taken definite shape  it had become clear to all what could be ventured against the french and what could not
now only the commanders of detachments with staffs  and moving according to rules at a distance from the french  still regarded many things as impossible
the small bands that had started their activities long before and had already observed the french closely considered things possible which the commanders of the big detachments did not dare to contemplate
the cossacks and peasants who crept in among the french now considered everything possible
on october 22  denisov  who was one of the irregulars  was with his group at the height of the guerrilla enthusiasm
since early morning he and his party had been on the move
all day long he had been watching from the forest that skirted the highroad a large french convoy of cavalry baggage and russian prisoners separated from the rest of the army  which as was learned from spies and prisoners was moving under a strong escort to smolensk
besides denisov and dolokhov  who also led a small party and moved in denisov's vicinity   the commanders of some large divisions with staffs also knew of this convoy and  as denisov expressed it  were sharpening their teeth for it
two of the commanders of large parties one a pole and the other a german sent invitations to denisov almost simultaneously  requesting him to join up with their divisions to attack the convoy
 no  bwother  i have gwown mustaches myself   said denisov on reading these documents  and he wrote to the german that  despite his heartfelt desire to serve under so valiant and renowned a general  he had to forgo that pleasure because he was already under the command of the polish general
to the polish general he replied to the same effect  informing him that he was already under the command of the german
having arranged matters thus  denisov and dolokhov intended  without reporting matters to the higher command  to attack and seize that convoy with their own small forces
on october 22 it was moving from the village of mikulino to that of shamshevo to the left of the road between mikulino and shamshevo there were large forests  extending in some places up to the road itself though in others a mile or more back from it through these forests denisov and his party rode all day  sometimes keeping well back in them and sometimes coming to the very edge  but never losing sight of the moving french
that morning  cossacks of denisov's party had seized and carried off into the forest two wagons loaded with cavalry saddles  which had stuck in the mud not far from mikulino where the forest ran close to the road
since then  and until evening  the party had watched the movements of the french without attacking
it was necessary to let the french reach shamshevo quietly without alarming them and then  after joining dolokhov who was to come that evening to a consultation at a watchman's hut in the forest less than a mile from shamshevo  to surprise the french at dawn  falling like an avalanche on their heads from two sides  and rout and capture them all at one blow in their rear  more than a mile from mikulino where the forest came right up to the road  six cossacks were posted to report if any fresh columns of french should show themselves beyond shamshevo  dolokhov was to observe the road in the same way  to find out at what distance there were other french troops they reckoned that the convoy had fifteen hundred men
denisov had two hundred  and dolokhov might have as many more  but the disparity of numbers did not deter denisov
all that he now wanted to know was what troops these were and to learn that he had to capture a  tongue  that is  a man from the enemy column
that morning's attack on the wagons had been made so hastily that the frenchmen with the wagons had all been killed  only a little drummer boy had been taken alive  and as he was a straggler he could tell them nothing definite about the troops in that column
denisov considered it dangerous to make a second attack for fear of putting the whole column on the alert  so he sent tikhon shcherbaty  a peasant of his party  to shamshevo to try and seize at least one of the french quartermasters who had been sent on in advance it was a warm rainy autumn day
the sky and the horizon were both the color of muddy water
at times a sort of mist descended  and then suddenly heavy slanting rain came down
denisov in a felt cloak and a sheepskin cap from which the rain ran down was riding a thin thoroughbred horse with sunken sides
like his horse  which turned its head and laid its ears back  he shrank from the driving rain and gazed anxiously before him
his thin face with its short  thick black beard looked angry
beside denisov rode an esaul  * denisov's fellow worker  also in felt cloak and sheepskin cap  and riding a large sleek don horse
* a captain of cossacks
esaul lovayski the third was a tall man as straight as an arrow  pale faced  fair haired  with narrow light eyes and with calm self satisfaction in his face and bearing
though it was impossible to say in what the peculiarity of the horse and rider lay  yet at first glance at the esaul and denisov one saw that the latter was wet and uncomfortable and was a man mounted on a horse  while looking at the esaul one saw that he was as comfortable and as much at ease as always and that he was not a man who had mounted a horse  but a man who was one with his horse  a being consequently possessed of twofold strength
a little ahead of them walked a peasant guide  wet to the skin and wearing a gray peasant coat and a white knitted cap
a little behind  on a poor  small  lean kirghiz mount with an enormous tail and mane and a bleeding mouth  rode a young officer in a blue french overcoat
beside him rode an hussar  with a boy in a tattered french uniform and blue cap behind him on the crupper of his horse
the boy held on to the hussar with cold  red hands  and raising his eyebrows gazed about him with surprise
this was the french drummer boy captured that morning
behind them along the narrow  sodden  cutup forest road came hussars in threes and fours  and then cossacks  some in felt cloaks  some in french greatcoats  and some with horsecloths over their heads
the horses  being drenched by the rain  all looked black whether chestnut or bay
their necks  with their wet  close clinging manes  looked strangely thin
steam rose from them
clothes  saddles  reins  were all wet  slippery  and sodden  like the ground and the fallen leaves that strewed the road
the men sat huddled up trying not to stir  so as to warm the water that had trickled to their bodies and not admit the fresh cold water that was leaking in under their seats  their knees  and at the back of their necks
in the midst of the outspread line of cossacks two wagons  drawn by french horses and by saddled cossack horses that had been hitched on in front  rumbled over the tree stumps and branches and splashed through the water that lay in the ruts
denisov's horse swerved aside to avoid a pool in the track and bumped his rider's knee against a tree
 oh  the devil   exclaimed denisov angrily  and showing his teeth he struck his horse three times with his whip  splashing himself and his comrades with mud denisov was out of sorts both because of the rain and also from hunger  none of them had eaten anything since morning   and yet more because he still had no news from dolokhov and the man sent to capture a  tongue  had not returned  there'll hardly be another such chance to fall on a transport as today
it's too risky to attack them by oneself  and if we put it off till another day one of the big guerrilla detachments will snatch the prey from under our noses   thought denisov  continually peering forward  hoping to see a messenger from dolokhov
on coming to a path in the forest along which he could see far to the right  denisov stopped
 there's someone coming   said he
the esaul looked in the direction denisov indicated
 there are two  an officer and a cossack
but it is not presupposable that it is the lieutenant colonel himself   said the esaul  who was fond of using words the cossacks did not know the approaching riders having descended a decline were no longer visible  but they reappeared a few minutes later
in front  at a weary gallop and using his leather whip  rode an officer  disheveled and drenched  whose trousers had worked up to above his knees
behind him  standing in the stirrups  trotted a cossack
the officer  a very young lad with a broad rosy face and keen merry eyes  galloped up to denisov and handed him a sodden envelope
 from the general   said the officer
 please excuse its not being quite dry   denisov  frowning  took the envelope and opened it
 there  they kept telling us  'it's dangerous  it's dangerous '  said the officer  addressing the esaul while denisov was reading the dispatch
 but komarov and i  he pointed to the cossack  were prepared
we have each of us two pistols   
but what's this   he asked  noticing the french drummer boy
 a prisoner  you've already been in action  may i speak to him    wostov  petya   exclaimed denisov  having run through the dispatch
 why didn't you say who you were   and turning with a smile he held out his hand to the lad
the officer was petya rostov
all the way petya had been preparing himself to behave with denisov as befitted a grownup man and an officer without hinting at their previous acquaintance but as soon as denisov smiled at him petya brightened up  blushed with pleasure  forgot the official manner he had been rehearsing  and began telling him how he had already been in a battle near vyazma and how a certain hussar had distinguished himself there  well  i am glad to see you   denisov interrupted him  and his face again assumed its anxious expression
 michael feoklitych   said he to the esaul   this is again fwom that german  you know
he  he indicated petya  is serving under him   and denisov told the esaul that the dispatch just delivered was a repetition of the german general's demand that he should join forces with him for an attack on the transport
 if we don't take it tomowwow  he'll snatch it fwom under our noses   he added
while denisov was talking to the esaul  petya abashed by denisov's cold tone and supposing that it was due to the condition of his trousers furtively tried to pull them down under his greatcoat so that no one should notice it  while maintaining as martial an air as possible
 will there be any orders  your honor   he asked denisov  holding his hand at the salute and resuming the game of adjutant and general for which he had prepared himself   or shall i remain with your honor    orders   denisov repeated thoughtfully  but can you stay till tomowwow    oh  please  
may i stay with you   cried petya
 but  just what did the genewal tell you  to weturn at once   asked denisov
petya blushed
 he gave me no instructions
i think i could   he returned  inquiringly
 well  all wight   said denisov
and turning to his men he directed a party to go on to the halting place arranged near the watchman's hut in the forest  and told the officer on the kirghiz horse  who performed the duties of an adjutant  to go and find out where dolokhov was and whether he would come that evening
denisov himself intended going with the esaul and petya to the edge of the forest where it reached out to shamshevo  to have a look at the part of the french bivouac they were to attack next day  well  old fellow   said he to the peasant guide   lead us to shamshevo   denisov  petya  and the esaul  accompanied by some cossacks and the hussar who had the prisoner  rode to the left across a ravine to the edge of the forest the rain had stopped  and only the mist was falling and drops from the trees
denisov  the esaul  and petya rode silently  following the peasant in the knitted cap who  stepping lightly with outturned toes and moving noiselessly in his bast shoes over the roots and wet leaves  silently led them to the edge of the forest
he ascended an incline  stopped  looked about him  and advanced to where the screen of trees was less dense
on reaching a large oak tree that had not yet shed its leaves  he stopped and beckoned mysteriously to them with his hand
denisov and petya rode up to him
from the spot where the peasant was standing they could see the french
immediately beyond the forest  on a downward slope  lay a field of spring rye
to the right  beyond a steep ravine  was a small village and a landowner's house with a broken roof
in the village  in the house  in the garden  by the well  by the pond  over all the rising ground  and all along the road uphill from the bridge leading to the village  not more than five hundred yards away  crowds of men could be seen through the shimmering mist
their un russian shouting at their horses which were straining uphill with the carts  and their calls to one another  could be clearly heard
 bwing the prisoner here   said denisov in a low voice  not taking his eyes off the french
a cossack dismounted  lifted the boy down  and took him to denisov
pointing to the french troops  denisov asked him what these and those of them were
the boy  thrusting his cold hands into his pockets and lifting his eyebrows  looked at denisov in affright  but in spite of an evident desire to say all he knew gave confused answers  merely assenting to everything denisov asked him
denisov turned away from him frowning and addressed the esaul  conveying his own conjectures to him
petya  rapidly turning his head  looked now at the drummer boy  now at denisov  now at the esaul  and now at the french in the village and along the road  trying not to miss anything of importance
 whether dolokhov comes or not  we must seize it  eh   said denisov with a merry sparkle in his eyes
 it is a very suitable spot   said the esaul
 we'll send the infantwy down by the swamps   denisov continued
 they'll cweep up to the garden  you'll wide up fwom there with the cossacks  he pointed to a spot in the forest beyond the village  and i with my hussars fwom here
and at the signal shot      the hollow is impassable there's a swamp there   said the esaul
 the horses would sink
we must ride round more to the left      while they were talking in undertones the crack of a shot sounded from the low ground by the pond  a puff of white smoke appeared  then another  and the sound of hundreds of seemingly merry french voices shouting together came up from the slope
for a moment denisov and the esaul drew back
they were so near that they thought they were the cause of the firing and shouting
but the firing and shouting did not relate to them
down below  a man wearing something red was running through the marsh
the french were evidently firing and shouting at him
 why  that's our tikhon   said the esaul
 so it is  it is    the wascal   said denisov
 he'll get away   said the esaul  screwing up his eyes
the man whom they called tikhon  having run to the stream  plunged in so that the water splashed in the air  and  having disappeared for an instant  scrambled out on all fours  all black with the wet  and ran on
the french who had been pursuing him stopped
 smart  that   said the esaul
 what a beast   said denisov with his former look of vexation
 what has he been doing all this time    who is he   asked petya
 he's our plastun
i sent him to capture a 'tongue '   oh  yes   said petya  nodding at the first words denisov uttered as if he understood it all  though he really did not understand anything of it
tikhon shcherbaty was one of the most indispensable men in their band
he was a peasant from pokrovsk  near the river gzhat
when denisov had come to pokrovsk at the beginning of his operations and had as usual summoned the village elder and asked him what he knew about the french  the elder  as though shielding himself  had replied  as all village elders did  that he had neither seen nor heard anything of them but when denisov explained that his purpose was to kill the french  and asked if no french had strayed that way  the elder replied that some  more orderers  had really been at their village  but that tikhon shcherbaty was the only man who dealt with such matters
denisov had tikhon called and  having praised him for his activity  said a few words in the elder's presence about loyalty to the tsar and the country and the hatred of the french that all sons of the fatherland should cherish
 we don't do the french any harm   said tikhon  evidently frightened by denisov's words
 we only fooled about with the lads for fun  you know  we killed a score or so of 'more orderers ' but we did no harm else     next day when denisov had left pokrovsk  having quite forgotten about this peasant  it was reported to him that tikhon had attached himself to their party and asked to be allowed to remain with it denisov gave orders to let him do so
tikhon  who at first did rough work  laying campfires  fetching water  flaying dead horses  and so on  soon showed a great liking and aptitude for partisan warfare at night he would go out for booty and always brought back french clothing and weapons  and when told to would bring in french captives also
denisov then relieved him from drudgery and began taking him with him when he went out on expeditions and had him enrolled among the cossacks
tikhon did not like riding  and always went on foot  never lagging behind the cavalry
he was armed with a musketoon  which he carried rather as a joke   a pike and an ax  which latter he used as a wolf uses its teeth  with equal ease picking fleas out of its fur or crunching thick bones
tikhon with equal accuracy would split logs with blows at arm's length  or holding the head of the ax would cut thin little pegs or carve spoons
in denisov's party he held a peculiar and exceptional position
when anything particularly difficult or nasty had to be done to push a cart out of the mud with one's shoulders  pull a horse out of a swamp by its tail  skin it  slink in among the french  or walk more than thirty miles in a day everybody pointed laughingly at tikhon
 it won't hurt that devil he's as strong as a horse   they said of him
once a frenchman tikhon was trying to capture fired a pistol at him and shot him in the fleshy part of the back
that wound  which tikhon treated only with internal and external applications of vodka  was the subject of the liveliest jokes by the whole detachment jokes in which tikhon readily joined
 hallo  mate  never again  gave you a twist   the cossacks would banter him
and tikhon  purposely writhing and making faces  pretended to be angry and swore at the french with the funniest curses
the only effect of this incident on tikhon was that after being wounded he seldom brought in prisoners
he was the bravest and most useful man in the party
no one found more opportunities for attacking  no one captured or killed more frenchmen  and consequently he was made the buffoon of all the cossacks and hussars and willingly accepted that role
now he had been sent by denisov overnight to shamshevo to capture a  tongue   but whether because he had not been content to take only one frenchman or because he had slept through the night  he had crept by day into some bushes right among the french and  as denisov had witnessed from above  had been detected by them after talking for some time with the esaul about next day's attack  which now  seeing how near they were to the french  he seemed to have definitely decided on  denisov turned his horse and rode back
 now  my lad  we'll go and get dwy   he said to petya
as they approached the watchhouse denisov stopped  peering into the forest
among the trees a man with long legs and long  swinging arms  wearing a short jacket  bast shoes  and a kazan hat  was approaching with long  light steps he had a musketoon over his shoulder and an ax stuck in his girdle
when he espied denisov he hastily threw something into the bushes  removed his sodden hat by its floppy brim  and approached his commander
it was tikhon
his wrinkled and pockmarked face and narrow little eyes beamed with self satisfied merriment
he lifted his head high and gazed at denisov as if repressing a laugh
 well  where did you disappear to   inquired denisov
 where did i disappear to  i went to get frenchmen   answered tikhon boldly and hurriedly  in a husky but melodious bass voice
 why did you push yourself in there by daylight  you ass  well  why haven't you taken one    oh  i took one all right   said tikhon
 where is he    you see  i took him first thing at dawn   tikhon continued  spreading out his flat feet with outturned toes in their bast shoes
 i took him into the forest
then i see he's no good and think i'll go and fetch a likelier one    you see    what a wogue it's just as i thought   said denisov to the esaul
 why didn't you bwing that one    what was the good of bringing him   tikhon interrupted hastily and angrily   that one wouldn't have done for you
as if i don't know what sort you want    what a bwute you are   
well    i went for another one   tikhon continued   and i crept like this through the wood and lay down    he suddenly lay down on his stomach with a supple movement to show how he had done it    one turned up and i grabbed him  like this    he jumped up quickly and lightly    'come along to the colonel ' i said
he starts yelling  and suddenly there were four of them
they rushed at me with their little swords
so i went for them with my ax  this way  'what are you up to ' says i
'christ be with you '  shouted tikhon  waving his arms with an angry scowl and throwing out his chest  yes  we saw from the hill how you took to your heels through the puddles   said the esaul  screwing up his glittering eyes
petya badly wanted to laugh  but noticed that they all refrained from laughing
he turned his eyes rapidly from tikhon's face to the esaul's and denisov's  unable to make out what it all meant
 don't play the fool   said denisov  coughing angrily
 why didn't you bwing the first one   tikhon scratched his back with one hand and his head with the other  then suddenly his whole face expanded into a beaming  foolish grin  disclosing a gap where he had lost a tooth  that was why he was called shcherbaty the gap toothed 
denisov smiled  and petya burst into a peal of merry laughter in which tikhon himself joined  oh  but he was a regular good for nothing   said tikhon
 the clothes on him  poor stuff  how could i bring him  and so rude  your honor  why  he says  'i'm a general's son myself  i won't go ' he says    you are a bwute   said denisov
 i wanted to question      but i questioned him   said tikhon
 he said he didn't know much
'there are a lot of us ' he says  'but all poor stuff only soldiers in name ' he says
'shout loud at them ' he says  'and you'll take them all '  tikhon concluded  looking cheerfully and resolutely into denisov's eyes
 i'll give you a hundwed sharp lashes that'll teach you to play the fool   said denisov severely
 but why are you angry   remonstrated tikhon   just as if i'd never seen your frenchmen  only wait till it gets dark and i'll fetch you any of them you want  three if you like    well  let's go   said denisov  and rode all the way to the watchhouse in silence and frowning angrily tikhon followed behind and petya heard the cossacks laughing with him and at him  about some pair of boots he had thrown into the bushes
when the fit of laughter that had seized him at tikhon's words and smile had passed and petya realized for a moment that this tikhon had killed a man  he felt uneasy
he looked round at the captive drummer boy and felt a pang in his heart
but this uneasiness lasted only a moment
he felt it necessary to hold his head higher  to brace himself  and to question the esaul with an air of importance about tomorrow's undertaking  that he might not be unworthy of the company in which he found himself the officer who had been sent to inquire met denisov on the way with the news that dolokhov was soon coming and that all was well with him
denisov at once cheered up and  calling petya to him  said   well  tell me about yourself   petya  having left his people after their departure from moscow  joined his regiment and was soon taken as orderly by a general commanding a large guerrilla detachment
from the time he received his commission  and especially since he had joined the active army and taken part in the battle of vyazma  petya had been in a constant state of blissful excitement at being grown up and in a perpetual ecstatic hurry not to miss any chance to do something really heroic
he was highly delighted with what he saw and experienced in the army  but at the same time it always seemed to him that the really heroic exploits were being performed just where he did not happen to be
and he was always in a hurry to get where he was not
when on the twenty first of october his general expressed a wish to send somebody to denisov's detachment  petya begged so piteously to be sent that the general could not refuse
but when dispatching him he recalled petya's mad action at the battle of vyazma  where instead of riding by the road to the place to which he had been sent  he had galloped to the advanced line under the fire of the french and had there twice fired his pistol
so now the general explicitly forbade his taking part in any action whatever of denisov's
that was why petya had blushed and grown confused when denisov asked him whether he could stay
before they had ridden to the outskirts of the forest petya had considered he must carry out his instructions strictly and return at once
but when he saw the french and saw tikhon and learned that there would certainly be an attack that night  he decided  with the rapidity with which young people change their views  that the general  whom he had greatly respected till then  was a rubbishy german  that denisov was a hero  the esaul a hero  and tikhon a hero too  and that it would be shameful for him to leave them at a moment of difficulty
it was already growing dusk when denisov  petya  and the esaul rode up to the watchhouse
in the twilight saddled horses could be seen  and cossacks and hussars who had rigged up rough shelters in the glade and were kindling glowing fires in a hollow of the forest where the french could not see the smoke
in the passage of the small watchhouse a cossack with sleeves rolled up was chopping some mutton
in the room three officers of denisov's band were converting a door into a tabletop
petya took off his wet clothes  gave them to be dried  and at once began helping the officers to fix up the dinner table
in ten minutes the table was ready and a napkin spread on it
on the table were vodka  a flask of rum  white bread  roast mutton  and salt
sitting at table with the officers and tearing the fat savory mutton with his hands  down which the grease trickled  petya was in an ecstatic childish state of love for all men  and consequently of confidence that others loved him in the same way
 so then what do you think  vasili dmitrich   said he to denisov
 it's all right my staying a day with you   and not waiting for a reply he answered his own question   you see i was told to find out well  i am finding out   
only do let me into the very  
into the chief  
i don't want a reward  
but i want     petya clenched his teeth and looked around  throwing back his head and flourishing his arms  into the vewy chief     denisov repeated with a smile
 only  please let me command something  so that i may really command     petya went on
 what would it be to you   
oh  you want a knife   he said  turning to an officer who wished to cut himself a piece of mutton and he handed him his clasp knife
the officer admired it
 please keep it
i have several like it   said petya  blushing
 heavens  i was quite forgetting   he suddenly cried
 i have some raisins  fine ones  you know  seedless ones
we have a new sutler and he has such capital things
i bought ten pounds
i am used to something sweet
would you like some      and petya ran out into the passage to his cossack and brought back some bags which contained about five pounds of raisins
 have some  gentlemen  have some    you want a coffeepot  don't you   he asked the esaul
 i bought a capital one from our sutler  he has splendid things
and he's very honest  that's the chief thing
i'll be sure to send it to you
or perhaps your flints are giving out  or are worn out that happens sometimes  you know
i have brought some with me  here they are  and he showed a bag  a hundred flints
i bought them very cheap
please take as many as you want  or all if you like      then suddenly  dismayed lest he had said too much  petya stopped and blushed
he tried to remember whether he had not done anything else that was foolish
and running over the events of the day he remembered the french drummer boy
 it's capital for us here  but what of him  where have they put him  have they fed him  haven't they hurt his feelings   he thought
but having caught himself saying too much about the flints  he was now afraid to speak out  i might ask   he thought   but they'll say  'he's a boy himself and so he pities the boy ' i'll show them tomorrow whether i'm a boy will it seem odd if i ask   petya thought
 well  never mind   and immediately  blushing and looking anxiously at the officers to see if they appeared ironical  he said   may i call in that boy who was taken prisoner and give him something to eat   
perhaps      yes  he's a poor little fellow   said denisov  who evidently saw nothing shameful in this reminder
 call him in
his name is vincent bosse
have him fetched    i'll call him   said petya  yes  yes  call him
a poor little fellow   denisov repeated
petya was standing at the door when denisov said this
he slipped in between the officers  came close to denisov  and said   let me kiss you  dear old fellow  oh  how fine  how splendid   and having kissed denisov he ran out of the hut
 bosse  vincent   petya cried  stopping outside the door
 who do you want  sir   asked a voice in the darkness
petya replied that he wanted the french lad who had been captured that day
 ah  vesenny   said a cossack
vincent  the boy's name  had already been changed by the cossacks into vesenny  vernal  and into vesenya by the peasants and soldiers
in both these adaptations the reference to spring  vesna  matched the impression made by the young lad
 he is warming himself there by the bonfire ho  vesenya  vesenya   vesenny   laughing voices were heard calling to one another in the darkness
 he's a smart lad   said an hussar standing near petya
 we gave him something to eat a while ago
he was awfully hungry   the sound of bare feet splashing through the mud was heard in the darkness  and the drummer boy came to the door
 ah  c'est vous   said petya
 voulez vous manger  n'ayez pas peur  on ne vous fera pas de mal   * he added shyly and affectionately  touching the boy's hand
 entrez  entrez   * 2  *  ah  it's you  do you want something to eat  don't be afraid  they won't hurt you   *  2   come in  come in    merci  monsieur   * said the drummer boy in a trembling almost childish voice  and he began scraping his dirty feet on the threshold
*  thank you  sir   there were many things petya wanted to say to the drummer boy  but did not dare to
he stood irresolutely beside him in the passage
then in the darkness he took the boy's hand and pressed it
 come in  come in   he repeated in a gentle whisper
 oh  what can i do for him   he thought  and opening the door he let the boy pass in first
when the boy had entered the hut  petya sat down at a distance from him  considering it beneath his dignity to pay attention to him
but he fingered the money in his pocket and wondered whether it would seem ridiculous to give some to the drummer boy
the arrival of dolokhov diverted petya's attention from the drummer boy  to whom denisov had had some mutton and vodka given  and whom he had had dressed in a russian coat so that he might be kept with their band and not sent away with the other prisoners
petya had heard in the army many stories of dolokhov's extraordinary bravery and of his cruelty to the french  so from the moment he entered the hut petya did not take his eyes from him  but braced himself up more and more and held his head high  that he might not be unworthy even of such company dolokhov's appearance amazed petya by its simplicity
denisov wore a cossack coat  had a beard  had an icon of nicholas the wonder worker on his breast  and his way of speaking and everything he did indicated his unusual position
but dolokhov  who in moscow had worn a persian costume  had now the appearance of a most correct officer of the guards
he was clean shaven and wore a guardsman's padded coat with an order of st
george at his buttonhole and a plain forage cap set straight on his head
he took off his wet felt cloak in a corner of the room  and without greeting anyone went up to denisov and began questioning him about the matter in hand
denisov told him of the designs the large detachments had on the transport  of the message petya had brought  and his own replies to both generals
then he told him all he knew of the french detachment
 that's so
but we must know what troops they are and their numbers   said dolokhov
 it will be necessary to go there
we can't start the affair without knowing for certain how many there are
i like to work accurately
here now  wouldn't one of these gentlemen like to ride over to the french camp with me  i have brought a spare uniform    i  i  
i'll go with you   cried petya
 there's no need for you to go at all   said denisov  addressing dolokhov   and as for him  i won't let him go on any account    i like that   exclaimed petya
 why shouldn't i go    because it's useless    well  you must excuse me  because  
because  
i shall go  and that's all
you'll take me  won't you   he said  turning to dolokhov
 why not   dolokhov answered absently  scrutinizing the face of the french drummer boy
 have you had that youngster with you long   he asked denisov
 he was taken today but he knows nothing
i'm keeping him with me    yes  and where do you put the others   inquired dolokhov
 where  i send them away and take a weceipt for them   shouted denisov  suddenly flushing
 and i say boldly that i have not a single man's life on my conscience
would it be difficult for you to send thirty or thwee hundwed men to town under escort  instead of staining i speak bluntly staining the honor of a soldier    that kind of amiable talk would be suitable from this young count of sixteen   said dolokhov with cold irony   but it's time for you to drop it    why  i've not said anything  i only say that i'll certainly go with you   said petya shyly
 but for you and me  old fellow  it's time to drop these amenities   continued dolokhov  as if he found particular pleasure in speaking of this subject which irritated denisov
 now  why have you kept this lad   he went on  swaying his head
 because you are sorry for him  don't we know those 'receipts' of yours  you send a hundred men away  and thirty get there
the rest either starve or get killed
so isn't it all the same not to send them   the esaul  screwing up his light colored eyes  nodded approvingly
 that's not the point
i'm not going to discuss the matter
i do not wish to take it on my conscience
you say they'll die
all wight
only not by my fault   dolokhov began laughing
 who has told them not to capture me these twenty times over  but if they did catch me they'd string me up to an aspen tree  and with all your chivalry just the same   he paused
 however  we must get to work
tell the cossack to fetch my kit i have two french uniforms in it well  are you coming with me   he asked petya
 i  yes  yes  certainly   cried petya  blushing almost to tears and glancing at denisov
while dolokhov had been disputing with denisov what should be done with prisoners  petya had once more felt awkward and restless  but again he had no time to grasp fully what they were talking about
 if grown up  distinguished men think so  it must be necessary and right   thought he
 but above all denisov must not dare to imagine that i'll obey him and that he can order me about
i will certainly go to the french camp with dolokhov
if he can  so can i   and to all denisov's persuasions  petya replied that he too was accustomed to do everything accurately and not just anyhow  and that he never considered personal danger
 for you'll admit that if we don't know for sure how many of them there are  
hundreds of lives may depend on it  while there are only two of us
besides  i want to go very much and certainly will go  so don't hinder me   said he
 it will only make things worse     having put on french greatcoats and shakos  petya and dolokhov rode to the clearing from which denisov had reconnoitered the french camp  and emerging from the forest in pitch darkness they descended into the hollow
on reaching the bottom  dolokhov told the cossacks accompanying him to await him there and rode on at a quick trot along the road to the bridge
petya  his heart in his mouth with excitement  rode by his side
 if we're caught  i won't be taken alive  i have a pistol   whispered he
 don't talk russian   said dolokhov in a hurried whisper  and at that very moment they heard through the darkness the challenge   qui vive   * and the click of a musket
*  who goes there   the blood rushed to petya's face and he grasped his pistol
 lanciers du 6 me   * replied dolokhov  neither hastening nor slackening his horse's pace
*  lancers of the 6th regiment   the black figure of a sentinel stood on the bridge
 mot d'ordre   * *  password   dolokhov reined in his horse and advanced at a walk
 dites donc  le colonel gerard est ici   * he asked
*  tell me  is colonel gerard here    mot d'ordre   repeated the sentinel  barring the way and not replying
 quand un officier fait sa ronde  les sentinelles ne demandent pas le mot d'ordre     cried dolokhov suddenly flaring up and riding straight at the sentinel
 je vous demande si le colonel est ici   * *  when an officer is making his round  sentinels don't ask him for the password   
i am asking you if the colonel is here   and without waiting for an answer from the sentinel  who had stepped aside  dolokhov rode up the incline at a walk
noticing the black outline of a man crossing the road  dolokhov stopped him and inquired where the commander and officers were
the man  a soldier with a sack over his shoulder  stopped  came close up to dolokhov's horse  touched it with his hand  and explained simply and in a friendly way that the commander and the officers were higher up the hill to the right in the courtyard of the farm  as he called the landowner's house
having ridden up the road  on both sides of which french talk could be heard around the campfires  dolokhov turned into the courtyard of the landowner's house
having ridden in  he dismounted and approached a big blazing campfire  around which sat several men talking noisily
something was boiling in a small cauldron at the edge of the fire and a soldier in a peaked cap and blue overcoat  lit up by the fire  was kneeling beside it stirring its contents with a ramrod  oh  he's a hard nut to crack   said one of the officers who was sitting in the shadow at the other side of the fire
 he'll make them get a move on  those fellows   said another  laughing
both fell silent  peering out through the darkness at the sound of dolokhov's and petya's steps as they advanced to the fire leading their horses
 bonjour  messieurs   * said dolokhov loudly and clearly
*  good day  gentlemen   there was a stir among the officers in the shadow beyond the fire  and one tall  long necked officer  walking round the fire  came up to dolokhov
 is that you  clement   he asked
 where the devil      but  noticing his mistake  he broke off short and  with a frown  greeted dolokhov as a stranger  asking what he could do for him
dolokhov said that he and his companion were trying to overtake their regiment  and addressing the company in general asked whether they knew anything of the 6th regiment
none of them knew anything  and petya thought the officers were beginning to look at him and dolokhov with hostility and suspicion
for some seconds all were silent
 if you were counting on the evening soup  you have come too late   said a voice from behind the fire with a repressed laugh
dolokhov replied that they were not hungry and must push on farther that night
he handed the horses over to the soldier who was stirring the pot and squatted down on his heels by the fire beside the officer with the long neck
that officer did not take his eyes from dolokhov and again asked to what regiment he belonged
dolokhov  as if he had not heard the question  did not reply  but lighting a short french pipe which he took from his pocket began asking the officer in how far the road before them was safe from cossacks
 those brigands are everywhere   replied an officer from behind the fire
dolokhov remarked that the cossacks were a danger only to stragglers such as his companion and himself   but probably they would not dare to attack large detachments   he added inquiringly no one replied
 well  now he'll come away   petya thought every moment as he stood by the campfire listening to the talk
but dolokhov restarted the conversation which had dropped and began putting direct questions as to how many men there were in the battalion  how many battalions  and how many prisoners
asking about the russian prisoners with that detachment  dolokhov said   a horrid business dragging these corpses about with one  it would be better to shoot such rabble   and burst into loud laughter  so strange that petya thought the french would immediately detect their disguise  and involuntarily took a step back from the campfire
no one replied a word to dolokhov's laughter  and a french officer whom they could not see  he lay wrapped in a greatcoat  rose and whispered something to a companion
dolokhov got up and called to the soldier who was holding their horses
 will they bring our horses or not   thought petya  instinctively drawing nearer to dolokhov
the horses were brought
 good evening  gentlemen   said dolokhov
petya wished to say  good night  but could not utter a word
the officers were whispering together
dolokhov was a long time mounting his horse which would not stand still  then he rode out of the yard at a footpace
petya rode beside him  longing to look round to see whether or not the french were running after them  but not daring to
coming out onto the road dolokhov did not ride back across the open country  but through the village
at one spot he stopped and listened
 do you hear   he asked
petya recognized the sound of russian voices and saw the dark figures of russian prisoners round their campfires
when they had descended to the bridge petya and dolokhov rode past the sentinel  who without saying a word paced morosely up and down it  then they descended into the hollow where the cossacks awaited them
 well now  good by
tell denisov  'at the first shot at daybreak '  said dolokhov and was about to ride away  but petya seized hold of him
 really   he cried   you are such a hero  oh  how fine  how splendid  how i love you    all right  all right   said dolokhov
but petya did not let go of him and dolokhov saw through the gloom that petya was bending toward him and wanted to kiss him
dolokhov kissed him  laughed  turned his horse  and vanished into the darkness
having returned to the watchman's hut  petya found denisov in the passage
he was awaiting petya's return in a state of agitation  anxiety  and selfreproach for having let him go
 thank god   he exclaimed
 yes  thank god   he repeated  listening to petya's rapturous account
 but  devil take you  i haven't slept because of you  well  thank god
now lie down
we can still get a nap before morning    but  
no   said petya   i don't want to sleep yet
besides i know myself  if i fall asleep it's finished
and then i am used to not sleeping before a battle   he sat awhile in the hut joyfully recalling the details of his expedition and vividly picturing to himself what would happen next day then  noticing that denisov was asleep  he rose and went out of doors
it was still quite dark outside
the rain was over  but drops were still falling from the trees
near the watchman's hut the black shapes of the cossacks' shanties and of horses tethered together could be seen
behind the hut the dark shapes of the two wagons with their horses beside them were discernible  and in the hollow the dying campfire gleamed red
not all the cossacks and hussars were asleep  here and there  amid the sounds of falling drops and the munching of the horses near by  could be heard low voices which seemed to be whispering
petya came out  peered into the darkness  and went up to the wagons
someone was snoring under them  and around them stood saddled horses munching their oats
in the dark petya recognized his own horse  which he called  karabakh  though it was of ukranian breed  and went up to it
 well  karabakh  we'll do some service tomorrow   said he  sniffing its nostrils and kissing it
 why aren't you asleep  sir   said a cossack who was sitting under a wagon
 no  ah  
likhachev isn't that your name  do you know i have only just come back  we've been into the french camp   and petya gave the cossack a detailed account not only of his ride but also of his object  and why he considered it better to risk his life than to act  just anyhow    well  you should get some sleep now   said the cossack
 no  i am used to this   said petya
 i say  aren't the flints in your pistols worn out  i brought some with me
don't you want any  you can have some   the cossack bent forward from under the wagon to get a closer look at petya
 because i am accustomed to doing everything accurately   said petya
 some fellows do things just anyhow  without preparation  and then they're sorry for it afterwards
i don't like that    just so   said the cossack
 oh yes  another thing  please  my dear fellow  will you sharpen my saber for me  it's got bl      petya feared to tell a lie  and the saber never had been sharpened    can you do it    of course i can   likhachev got up  rummaged in his pack  and soon petya heard the warlike sound of steel on whetstone
he climbed onto the wagon and sat on its edge
the cossack was sharpening the saber under the wagon
 i say  are the lads asleep   asked petya
 some are  and some aren't like us    well  and that boy    vesenny  oh  he's thrown himself down there in the passage fast asleep after his fright
he was that glad   after that petya remained silent for a long time  listening to the sounds
he heard footsteps in the darkness and a black figure appeared
 what are you sharpening   asked a man coming up to the wagon
 why  this gentleman's saber    that's right   said the man  whom petya took to be an hussar
 was the cup left here    there  by the wheel   the hussar took the cup
 it must be daylight soon   said he  yawning  and went away
petya ought to have known that he was in a forest with denisov's guerrilla band  less than a mile from the road  sitting on a wagon captured from the french beside which horses were tethered  that under it likhachev was sitting sharpening a saber for him  that the big dark blotch to the right was the watchman's hut  and the red blotch below to the left was the dying embers of a campfire  that the man who had come for the cup was an hussar who wanted a drink  but he neither knew nor waited to know anything of all this
he was in a fairy kingdom where nothing resembled reality
the big dark blotch might really be the watchman's hut or it might be a cavern leading to the very depths of the earth
perhaps the red spot was a fire  or it might be the eye of an enormous monster
perhaps he was really sitting on a wagon  but it might very well be that he was not sitting on a wagon but on a terribly high tower from which  if he fell  he would have to fall for a whole day or a whole month  or go on falling and never reach the bottom
perhaps it was just the cossack  likhachev  who was sitting under the wagon  but it might be the kindest  bravest  most wonderful  most splendid man in the world  whom no one knew of
it might really have been that the hussar came for water and went back into the hollow  but perhaps he had simply vanished disappeared altogether and dissolved into nothingness
nothing petya could have seen now would have surprised him
he was in a fairy kingdom where everything was possible
he looked up at the sky
and the sky was a fairy realm like the earth
it was clearing  and over the tops of the trees clouds were swiftly sailing as if unveiling the stars
sometimes it looked as if the clouds were passing  and a clear black sky appeared
sometimes it seemed as if the black spaces were clouds
sometimes the sky seemed to be rising high  high overhead  and then it seemed to sink so low that one could touch it with one's hand
petya's eyes began to close and he swayed a little
the trees were dripping
quiet talking was heard
the horses neighed and jostled one another
someone snored
 ozheg zheg  ozheg zheg     hissed the saber against the whetstone  and suddenly petya heard an harmonious orchestra playing some unknown  sweetly solemn hymn
petya was as musical as natasha and more so than nicholas  but had never learned music or thought about it  and so the melody that unexpectedly came to his mind seemed to him particularly fresh and attractive
the music became more and more audible
the melody grew and passed from one instrument to another
and what was played was a fugue  though petya had not the least conception of what a fugue is
each instrument  now resembling a violin and now a horn  but better and clearer than violin or horn played its own part  and before it had finished the melody merged with another instrument that began almost the same air  and then with a third and a fourth  and they all blended into one and again became separate and again blended  now into solemn church music  now into something dazzlingly brilliant and triumphant
 oh why  that was in a dream   petya said to himself  as he lurched forward  it's in my ears
but perhaps it's music of my own
well  go on  my music  now      he closed his eyes  and  from all sides as if from a distance  sounds fluttered  grew into harmonies  separated  blended  and again all mingled into the same sweet and solemn hymn
 oh  this is delightful  as much as i like and as i like   said petya to himself he tried to conduct that enormous orchestra
 now softly  softly die away   and the sounds obeyed him
 now fuller  more joyful
still more and more joyful   and from an unknown depth rose increasingly triumphant sounds
 now voices join in   ordered petya
and at first from afar he heard men's voices and then women's
the voices grew in harmonious triumphant strength  and petya listened to their surpassing beauty in awe and joy
with a solemn triumphal march there mingled a song  the drip from the trees  and the hissing of the saber   ozheg zheg zheg     and again the horses jostled one another and neighed  not disturbing the choir but joining in it
petya did not know how long this lasted  he enjoyed himself all the time  wondered at his enjoyment and regretted that there was no one to share it he was awakened by likhachev's kindly voice
 it's ready  your honor  you can split a frenchman in half with it   petya woke up
 it's getting light  it's really getting light   he exclaimed
the horses that had previously been invisible could now be seen to their very tails  and a watery light showed itself through the bare branches
petya shook himself  jumped up  took a ruble from his pocket and gave it to likhachev  then he flourished the saber  tested it  and sheathed it the cossacks were untying their horses and tightening their saddle girths
 and here's the commander   said likhachev
denisov came out of the watchman's hut and  having called petya  gave orders to get ready
the men rapidly picked out their horses in the semidarkness  tightened their saddle girths  and formed companies
denisov stood by the watchman's hut giving final orders
the infantry of the detachment passed along the road and quickly disappeared amid the trees in the mist of early dawn  hundreds of feet splashing through the mud
the esaul gave some orders to his men
petya held his horse by the bridle  impatiently awaiting the order to mount
his face  having been bathed in cold water  was all aglow  and his eyes were particularly brilliant
cold shivers ran down his spine and his whole body pulsed rhythmically
 well  is ev'wything weady   asked denisov
 bwing the horses   the horses were brought
denisov was angry with the cossack because the saddle girths were too slack  reproved him  and mounted
petya put his foot in the stirrup
his horse by habit made as if to nip his leg  but petya leaped quickly into the saddle unconscious of his own weight and  turning to look at the hussars starting in the darkness behind him  rode up to denisov
 vasili dmitrich  entrust me with some commission  please  
for god's sake      said he
denisov seemed to have forgotten petya's very existence
he turned to glance at him
 i ask one thing of you   he said sternly   to obey me and not shove yourself forward anywhere   he did not say another word to petya but rode in silence all the way
when they had come to the edge of the forest it was noticeably growing light over the field
denisov talked in whispers with the esaul and the cossacks rode past petya and denisov
when they had all ridden by  denisov touched his horse and rode down the hill
slipping onto their haunches and sliding  the horses descended with their riders into the ravine
petya rode beside denisov  the pulsation of his body constantly increasing
it was getting lighter and lighter  but the mist still hid distant objects
having reached the valley  denisov looked back and nodded to a cossack beside him
 the signal   said he
the cossack raised his arm and a shot rang out
in an instant the tramp of horses galloping forward was heard  shouts came from various sides  and then more shots
at the first sound of trampling hoofs and shouting  petya lashed his horse and loosening his rein galloped forward  not heeding denisov who shouted at him
it seemed to petya that at the moment the shot was fired it suddenly became as bright as noon
he galloped to the bridge
cossacks were galloping along the road in front of him
on the bridge he collided with a cossack who had fallen behind  but he galloped on
in front of him soldiers  probably frenchmen  were running from right to left across the road
one of them fell in the mud under his horse's feet
cossacks were crowding about a hut  busy with something
from the midst of that crowd terrible screams arose petya galloped up  and the first thing he saw was the pale face and trembling jaw of a frenchman  clutching the handle of a lance that had been aimed at him
 hurrah   
lads   
ours   shouted petya  and giving rein to his excited horse he galloped forward along the village street
he could hear shooting ahead of him
cossacks  hussars  and ragged russian prisoners  who had come running from both sides of the road  were shouting something loudly and incoherently
a gallant looking frenchman  in a blue overcoat  capless  and with a frowning red face  had been defending himself against the hussars when petya galloped up the frenchman had already fallen
 too late again   flashed through petya's mind and he galloped on to the place from which the rapid firing could be heard
the shots came from the yard of the landowner's house he had visited the night before with dolokhov
the french were making a stand there behind a wattle fence in a garden thickly overgrown with bushes and were firing at the cossacks who crowded at the gateway
through the smoke  as he approached the gate  petya saw dolokhov  whose face was of a pale greenish tint  shouting to his men
 go round  wait for the infantry   he exclaimed as petya rode up to him
 wait   
hurrah ah ah   shouted petya  and without pausing a moment galloped to the place whence came the sounds of firing and where the smoke was thickest
a volley was heard  and some bullets whistled past  while others plashed against something
the cossacks and dolokhov galloped after petya into the gateway of the courtyard
in the dense wavering smoke some of the french threw down their arms and ran out of the bushes to meet the cossacks  while others ran down the hill toward the pond petya was galloping along the courtyard  but instead of holding the reins he waved both his arms about rapidly and strangely  slipping farther and farther to one side in his saddle his horse  having galloped up to a campfire that was smoldering in the morning light  stopped suddenly  and petya fell heavily on to the wet ground
the cossacks saw that his arms and legs jerked rapidly though his head was quite motionless a bullet had pierced his skull
after speaking to the senior french officer  who came out of the house with a white handkerchief tied to his sword and announced that they surrendered  dolokhov dismounted and went up to petya  who lay motionless with outstretched arms  done for   he said with a frown  and went to the gate to meet denisov who was riding toward him  killed   cried denisov  recognizing from a distance the unmistakably lifeless attitude very familiar to him in which petya's body was lying
 done for   repeated dolokhov as if the utterance of these words afforded him pleasure  and he went quickly up to the prisoners  who were surrounded by cossacks who had hurried up
 we won't take them   he called out to denisov
denisov did not reply  he rode up to petya  dismounted  and with trembling hands turned toward himself the bloodstained  mud bespattered face which had already gone white  i am used to something sweet
raisins  fine ones  
take them all   he recalled petya's words
and the cossacks looked round in surprise at the sound  like the yelp of a dog  with which denisov turned away  walked to the wattle fence  and seized hold of it
among the russian prisoners rescued by denisov and dolokhov was pierre bezukhov
during the whole of their march from moscow no fresh orders had been issued by the french authorities concerning the party of prisoners among whom was pierre
on the twenty second of october that party was no longer with the same troops and baggage trains with which it had left moscow
half the wagons laden with hardtack that had traveled the first stages with them had been captured by cossacks  the other half had gone on ahead
not one of those dismounted cavalrymen who had marched in front of the prisoners was left  they had all disappeared
the artillery the prisoners had seen in front of them during the first days was now replaced by marshal junot's enormous baggage train  convoyed by westphalians
behind the prisoners came a cavalry baggage train
from vyazma onwards the french army  which had till then moved in three columns  went on as a single group
the symptoms of disorder that pierre had noticed at their first halting place after leaving moscow had now reached the utmost limit the road along which they moved was bordered on both sides by dead horses  ragged men who had fallen behind from various regiments continually changed about  now joining the moving column  now again lagging behind it
several times during the march false alarms had been given and the soldiers of the escort had raised their muskets  fired  and run headlong  crushing one another  but had afterwards reassembled and abused each other for their causeless panic these three groups traveling together the cavalry stores  the convoy of prisoners  and junot's baggage train still constituted a separate and united whole  though each of the groups was rapidly melting away
of the artillery baggage train which had consisted of a hundred and twenty wagons  not more than sixty now remained  the rest had been captured or left behind
some of junot's wagons also had been captured or abandoned
three wagons had been raided and robbed by stragglers from davout's corps
from the talk of the germans pierre learned that a larger guard had been allotted to that baggage train than to the prisoners  and that one of their comrades  a german soldier  had been shot by the marshal's own order because a silver spoon belonging to the marshal had been found in his possession the group of prisoners had melted away most of all
of the three hundred and thirty men who had set out from moscow fewer than a hundred now remained
the prisoners were more burdensome to the escort than even the cavalry saddles or junot's baggage
they understood that the saddles and junot's spoon might be of some use  but that cold and hungry soldiers should have to stand and guard equally cold and hungry russians who froze and lagged behind on the road  in which case the order was to shoot them  was not merely incomprehensible but revolting
and the escort  as if afraid  in the grievous condition they themselves were in  of giving way to the pity they felt for the prisoners and so rendering their own plight still worse  treated them with particular moroseness and severity at dorogobuzh while the soldiers of the convoy  after locking the prisoners in a stable  had gone off to pillage their own stores  several of the soldier prisoners tunneled under the wall and ran away  but were recaptured by the french and shot
the arrangement adopted when they started  that the officer prisoners should be kept separate from the rest  had long since been abandoned
all who could walk went together  and after the third stage pierre had rejoined karataev and the gray blue bandy legged dog that had chosen karataev for its master
on the third day after leaving moscow karataev again fell ill with the fever he had suffered from in the hospital in moscow  and as he grew gradually weaker pierre kept away from him
pierre did not know why  but since karataev had begun to grow weaker it had cost him an effort to go near him
when he did so and heard the subdued moaning with which karataev generally lay down at the halting places  and when he smelled the odor emanating from him which was now stronger than before  pierre moved farther away and did not think about him
while imprisoned in the shed pierre had learned not with his intellect but with his whole being  by life itself  that man is created for happiness  that happiness is within him  in the satisfaction of simple human needs  and that all unhappiness arises not from privation but from superfluity
and now during these last three weeks of the march he had learned still another new  consolatory truth that nothing in this world is terrible
he had learned that as there is no condition in which man can be happy and entirely free  so there is no condition in which he need be unhappy and lack freedom
he learned that suffering and freedom have their limits and that those limits are very near together  that the person in a bed of roses with one crumpled petal suffered as keenly as he now  sleeping on the bare damp earth with one side growing chilled while the other was warming  and that when he had put on tight dancing shoes he had suffered just as he did now when he walked with bare feet that were covered with sores his footgear having long since fallen to pieces
he discovered that when he had married his wife of his own free will as it had seemed to him he had been no more free than now when they locked him up at night in a stable
of all that he himself subsequently termed his sufferings  but which at the time he scarcely felt  the worst was the state of his bare  raw  and scab covered feet  the horseflesh was appetizing and nourishing  the saltpeter flavor of the gunpowder they used instead of salt was even pleasant  there was no great cold  it was always warm walking in the daytime  and at night there were the campfires  the lice that devoured him warmed his body   the one thing that was at first hard to bear was his feet
after the second day's march pierre  having examined his feet by the campfire  thought it would be impossible to walk on them  but when everybody got up he went along  limping  and  when he had warmed up  walked without feeling the pain  though at night his feet were more terrible to look at than before
however  he did not look at them now  but thought of other things
only now did pierre realize the full strength of life in man and the saving power he has of transferring his attention from one thing to another  which is like the safety valve of a boiler that allows superfluous steam to blow off when the pressure exceeds a certain limit
he did not see and did not hear how they shot the prisoners who lagged behind  though more than a hundred perished in that way
he did not think of karataev who grew weaker every day and evidently would soon have to share that fate
still less did pierre think about himself the harder his position became and the more terrible the future  the more independent of that position in which he found himself were the joyful and comforting thoughts  memories  and imaginings that came to him at midday on the twenty second of october pierre was going uphill along the muddy  slippery road  looking at his feet and at the roughness of the way
occasionally he glanced at the familiar crowd around him and then again at his feet
the former and the latter were alike familiar and his own
the blue  gray bandy legged dog ran merrily along the side of the road  sometimes in proof of its agility and self satisfaction lifting one hind leg and hopping along on three  and then again going on all four and rushing to bark at the crows that sat on the carrion
the dog was merrier and sleeker than it had been in moscow
all around lay the flesh of different animals from men to horses  in various stages of decomposition  and as the wolves were kept off by the passing men the dog could eat all it wanted
it had been raining since morning and had seemed as if at any moment it might cease and the sky clear  but after a short break it began raining harder than before
the saturated road no longer absorbed the water  which ran along the ruts in streams pierre walked along  looking from side to side  counting his steps in threes  and reckoning them off on his fingers
mentally addressing the rain  he repeated   now then  now then  go on  pelt harder   it seemed to him that he was thinking of nothing  but far down and deep within him his soul was occupied with something important and comforting
this something was a most subtle spiritual deduction from a conversation with karataev the day before
at their yesterday's halting place  feeling chilly by a dying campfire  pierre had got up and gone to the next one  which was burning better
there platon karataev was sitting covered up head and all with his greatcoat as if it were a vestment  telling the soldiers in his effective and pleasant though now feeble voice a story pierre knew
it was already past midnight  the hour when karataev was usually free of his fever and particularly lively
when pierre reached the fire and heard platon's voice enfeebled by illness  and saw his pathetic face brightly lit up by the blaze  he felt a painful prick at his heart
his feeling of pity for this man frightened him and he wished to go away  but there was no other fire  and pierre sat down  trying not to look at platon
 well  how are you   he asked
 how am i  if we grumble at sickness  god won't grant us death   replied platon  and at once resumed the story he had begun
 and so  brother   he continued  with a smile on his pale emaciated face and a particularly happy light in his eyes   you see  brother     pierre had long been familiar with that story
karataev had told it to him alone some half dozen times and always with a specially joyful emotion
but well as he knew it  pierre now listened to that tale as to something new  and the quiet rapture karataev evidently felt as he told it communicated itself also to pierre
the story was of an old merchant who lived a good and god fearing life with his family  and who went once to the nizhni fair with a companion a rich merchant
having put up at an inn they both went to sleep  and next morning his companion was found robbed and with his throat cut
a bloodstained knife was found under the old merchant's pillow
he was tried  knouted  and his nostrils having been torn off   all in due form  as karataev put it  he was sent to hard labor in siberia
 and so  brother   it was at this point that pierre came up    ten years or more passed by
the old man was living as a convict  submitting as he should and doing no wrong
only he prayed to god for death
well  one night the convicts were gathered just as we are  with the old man among them
and they began telling what each was suffering for  and how they had sinned against god
one told how he had taken a life  another had taken two  a third had set a house on fire  while another had simply been a vagrant and had done nothing
so they asked the old man  'what are you being punished for  daddy ' 'i  my dear brothers ' said he  'am being punished for my own and other men's sins
but i have not killed anyone or taken anything that was not mine  but have only helped my poorer brothers
i was a merchant  my dear brothers  and had much property
'and he went on to tell them all about it in due order
'i don't grieve for myself ' he says  'god  it seems  has chastened me only i am sorry for my old wife and the children ' and the old man began to weep
now it happened that in the group was the very man who had killed the other merchant
'where did it happen  daddy ' he said
'when  and in what month ' he asked all about it and his heart began to ache
so he comes up to the old man like this  and falls down at his feet  'you are perishing because of me  daddy ' he says
'it's quite true  lads  that this man ' he says  'is being tortured innocently and for nothing  i ' he says  'did that deed  and i put the knife under your head while you were asleep
forgive me  daddy ' he says  'for christ's sake '  karataev paused  smiling joyously as he gazed into the fire  and he drew the logs together
 and the old man said  'god will forgive you  we are all sinners in his sight
i suffer for my own sins ' and he wept bitter tears
well  and what do you think  dear friends   karataev continued  his face brightening more and more with a rapturous smile as if what he now had to tell contained the chief charm and the whole meaning of his story   what do you think  dear fellows  that murderer confessed to the authorities
'i have taken six lives ' he says  he was a great sinner   'but what i am most sorry for is this old man
don't let him suffer because of me ' so he confessed and it was all written down and the papers sent off in due form
the place was a long way off  and while they were judging  what with one thing and another  filling in the papers all in due form  the authorities i mean time passed
the affair reached the tsar
after a while the tsar's decree came  to set the merchant free and give him a compensation that had been awarded
the paper arrived and they began to look for the old man
'where is the old man who has been suffering innocently and in vain  a paper has come from the tsar ' so they began looking for him   here karataev's lower jaw trembled   but god had already forgiven him he was dead  that's how it was  dear fellows   karataev concluded and sat for a long time silent  gazing before him with a smile
and pierre's soul was dimly but joyfully filled not by the story itself but by its mysterious significance  by the rapturous joy that lit up karataev's face as he told it  and the mystic significance of that joy
 a vos places   * suddenly cried a voice
*  to your places   a pleasant feeling of excitement and an expectation of something joyful and solemn was aroused among the soldiers of the convoy and the prisoners
from all sides came shouts of command  and from the left came smartly dressed cavalrymen on good horses  passing the prisoners at a trot
the expression on all faces showed the tension people feel at the approach of those in authority
the prisoners thronged together and were pushed off the road
the convoy formed up
 the emperor  the emperor  the marshal  the duke   and hardly had the sleek cavalry passed  before a carriage drawn by six gray horses rattled by
pierre caught a glimpse of a man in a three cornered hat with a tranquil look on his handsome  plump  white face
it was one of the marshals
his eye fell on pierre's large and striking figure  and in the expression with which he frowned and looked away pierre thought he detected sympathy and a desire to conceal that sympathy
the general in charge of the stores galloped after the carriage with a red and frightened face  whipping up his skinny horse
several officers formed a group and some soldiers crowded round them
their faces all looked excited and worried
 what did he say  what did he say   pierre heard them ask
while the marshal was passing  the prisoners had huddled together in a crowd  and pierre saw karataev whom he had not yet seen that morning
he sat in his short overcoat leaning against a birch tree
on his face  besides the look of joyful emotion it had worn yesterday while telling the tale of the merchant who suffered innocently  there was now an expression of quiet solemnity
karataev looked at pierre with his kindly round eyes now filled with tears  evidently wishing him to come near that he might say something to him
but pierre was not sufficiently sure of himself he made as if he did not notice that look and moved hastily away
when the prisoners again went forward pierre looked round
karataev was still sitting at the side of the road under the birch tree and two frenchmen were talking over his head
pierre did not look round again but went limping up the hill
from behind  where karataev had been sitting  came the sound of a shot
pierre heard it plainly  but at that moment he remembered that he had not yet finished reckoning up how many stages still remained to smolensk a calculation he had begun before the marshal went by
and he again started reckoning
two french soldiers ran past pierre  one of whom carried a lowered and smoking gun
they both looked pale  and in the expression on their faces one of them glanced timidly at pierre there was something resembling what he had seen on the face of the young soldier at the execution
pierre looked at the soldier and remembered that  two days before  that man had burned his shirt while drying it at the fire and how they had laughed at him
behind him  where karataev had been sitting  the dog began to howl
 what a stupid beast  why is it howling   thought pierre
his comrades  the prisoner soldiers walking beside him  avoided looking back at the place where the shot had been fired and the dog was howling  just as pierre did  but there was a set look on all their faces the stores  the prisoners  and the marshal's baggage train stopped at the village of shamshevo the men crowded together round the campfires
pierre went up to the fire  ate some roast horseflesh  lay down with his back to the fire  and immediately fell asleep
he again slept as he had done at mozhaysk after the battle of borodino
again real events mingled with dreams and again someone  he or another  gave expression to his thoughts  and even to the same thoughts that had been expressed in his dream at mozhaysk  life is everything
life is god
everything changes and moves and that movement is god
and while there is life there is joy in consciousness of the divine
to love life is to love god
harder and more blessed than all else is to love this life in one's sufferings  in innocent sufferings    karataev   came to pierre's mind
and suddenly he saw vividly before him a long forgotten  kindly old man who had given him geography lessons in switzerland
 wait a bit   said the old man  and showed pierre a globe
this globe was alive a vibrating ball without fixed dimensions
its whole surface consisted of drops closely pressed together  and all these drops moved and changed places  sometimes several of them merging into one  sometimes one dividing into many
each drop tried to spread out and occupy as much space as possible  but others striving to do the same compressed it  sometimes destroyed it  and sometimes merged with it
 that is life   said the old teacher
 how simple and clear it is   thought pierre
 how is it i did not know it before    god is in the midst  and each drop tries to expand so as to reflect him to the greatest extent
and it grows  merges  disappears from the surface  sinks to the depths  and again emerges
there now  karataev has spread out and disappeared
do you understand  my child   said the teacher
 do you understand  damn you   shouted a voice  and pierre woke up
he lifted himself and sat up a frenchman who had just pushed a russian soldier away was squatting by the fire  engaged in roasting a piece of meat stuck on a ramrod his sleeves were rolled up and his sinewy  hairy  red hands with their short fingers deftly turned the ramrod his brown morose face with frowning brows was clearly visible by the glow of the charcoal
 it's all the same to him   he muttered  turning quickly to a soldier who stood behind him
 brigand  get away   and twisting the ramrod he looked gloomily at pierre  who turned away and gazed into the darkness a prisoner  the russian soldier the frenchman had pushed away  was sitting near the fire patting something with his hand
looking more closely pierre recognized the blue gray dog  sitting beside the soldier  wagging its tail
 ah  he's come   said pierre
 and plat   he began  but did not finish
suddenly and simultaneously a crowd of memories awoke in his fancy of the look platon had given him as he sat under the tree  of the shot heard from that spot  of the dog's howl  of the guilty faces of the two frenchmen as they ran past him  of the lowered and smoking gun  and of karataev's absence at this halt and he was on the point of realizing that karataev had been killed  but just at that instant  he knew not why  the recollection came to his mind of a summer evening he had spent with a beautiful polish lady on the veranda of his house in kiev
and without linking up the events of the day or drawing a conclusion from them  pierre closed his eyes  seeing a vision of the country in summertime mingled with memories of bathing and of the liquid  vibrating globe  and he sank into water so that it closed over his head
before sunrise he was awakened by shouts and loud and rapid firing
french soldiers were running past him
 the cossacks   one of them shouted  and a moment later a crowd of russians surrounded pierre
for a long time he could not understand what was happening to him
all around he heard his comrades sobbing with joy  brothers  dear fellows  darlings   old soldiers exclaimed  weeping  as they embraced cossacks and hussars
the hussars and cossacks crowded round the prisoners  one offered them clothes  another boots  and a third bread
pierre sobbed as he sat among them and could not utter a word
he hugged the first soldier who approached him  and kissed him  weeping
dolokhov stood at the gate of the ruined house  letting a crowd of disarmed frenchmen pass by
the french  excited by all that had happened  were talking loudly among themselves  but as they passed dolokhov who gently switched his boots with his whip and watched them with cold glassy eyes that boded no good  they became silent on the opposite side stood dolokhov's cossack  counting the prisoners and marking off each hundred with a chalk line on the gate
 how many   dolokhov asked the cossack
 the second hundred   replied the cossack
 filez  filez   * dolokhov kept saying  having adopted this expression from the french  and when his eyes met those of the prisoners they flashed with a cruel light
*  get along  get along   denisov  bareheaded and with a gloomy face  walked behind some cossacks who were carrying the body of petya rostov to a hole that had been dug in the garden
after the twenty eighth of october when the frosts began  the flight of the french assumed a still more tragic character  with men freezing  or roasting themselves to death at the campfires  while carriages with people dressed in furs continued to drive past  carrying away the property that had been stolen by the emperor  kings  and dukes  but the process of the flight and disintegration of the french army went on essentially as before from moscow to vyazma the french army of seventy three thousand men not reckoning the guards  who did nothing during the whole war but pillage  was reduced to thirty six thousand  though not more than five thousand had fallen in battle
from this beginning the succeeding terms of the progression could be determined mathematically the french army melted away and perished at the same rate from moscow to vyazma  from vyazma to smolensk  from smolensk to the berezina  and from the berezina to vilna independently of the greater or lesser intensity of the cold  the pursuit  the barring of the way  or any other particular conditions
beyond vyazma the french army instead of moving in three columns huddled together into one mass  and so went on to the end
berthier wrote to his emperor  we know how far commanding officers allow themselves to diverge from the truth in describing the condition of an army  and this is what he said  i deem it my duty to report to your majesty the condition of the various corps i have had occasion to observe during different stages of the last two or three days' march they are almost disbanded
scarcely a quarter of the soldiers remain with the standards of their regiments  the others go off by themselves in different directions hoping to find food and escape discipline in general they regard smolensk as the place where they hope to recover
during the last few days many of the men have been seen to throw away their cartridges and their arms in such a state of affairs  whatever your ultimate plans may be  the interest of your majesty's service demands that the army should be rallied at smolensk and should first of all be freed from ineffectives  such as dismounted cavalry  unnecessary baggage  and artillery material that is no longer in proportion to the present forces
the soldiers  who are worn out with hunger and fatigue  need these supplies as well as a few days' rest
many have died these last days on the road or at the bivouacs
this state of things is continually becoming worse and makes one fear that unless a prompt remedy is applied the troops will no longer be under control in case of an engagement
november 9  twenty miles from smolensk
after staggering into smolensk which seemed to them a promised land  the french  searching for food  killed one another  sacked their own stores  and when everything had been plundered fled farther
they all went without knowing whither or why they were going
still less did that genius  napoleon  know it  for no one issued any orders to him
but still he and those about him retained their old habits  wrote commands  letters  reports  and orders of the day  called one another sire  mon cousin  prince d'eckmuhl  roi de naples  and so on
but these orders and reports were only on paper  nothing in them was acted upon for they could not be carried out  and though they entitled one another majesties  highnesses  or cousins  they all felt that they were miserable wretches who had done much evil for which they had now to pay and though they pretended to be concerned about the army  each was thinking only of himself and of how to get away quickly and save himself the movements of the russian and french armies during the campaign from moscow back to the niemen were like those in a game of russian blindman's bluff  in which two players are blindfolded and one of them occasionally rings a little bell to inform the catcher of his whereabouts
first he rings his bell fearlessly  but when he gets into a tight place he runs away as quietly as he can  and often thinking to escape runs straight into his opponent's arms at first while they were still moving along the kaluga road  napoleon's armies made their presence known  but later when they reached the smolensk road they ran holding the clapper of their bell tight and often thinking they were escaping ran right into the russians
owing to the rapidity of the french flight and the russian pursuit and the consequent exhaustion of the horses  the chief means of approximately ascertaining the enemy's position by cavalry scouting was not available
besides  as a result of the frequent and rapid change of position by each army  even what information was obtained could not be delivered in time
if news was received one day that the enemy had been in a certain position the day before  by the third day when something could have been done  that army was already two days' march farther on and in quite another position
one army fled and the other pursued
beyond smolensk there were several different roads available for the french  and one would have thought that during their stay of four days they might have learned where the enemy was  might have arranged some more advantageous plan and undertaken something new
but after a four days' halt the mob  with no maneuvers or plans  again began running along the beaten track  neither to the right nor to the left but along the old the worst road  through krasnoe and orsha
expecting the enemy from behind and not in front  the french separated in their flight and spread out over a distance of twenty four hours
in front of them all fled the emperor  then the kings  then the dukes
the russian army  expecting napoleon to take the road to the right beyond the dnieper which was the only reasonable thing for him to do themselves turned to the right and came out onto the highroad at krasnoe and here as in a game of blindman's buff the french ran into our vanguard
seeing their enemy unexpectedly the french fell into confusion and stopped short from the sudden fright  but then they resumed their flight  abandoning their comrades who were farther behind then for three days separate portions of the french army first murat's  the vice king's   then davout's  and then ney's ran  as it were  the gauntlet of the russian army
they abandoned one another  abandoned all their heavy baggage  their artillery  and half their men  and fled  getting past the russians by night by making semicircles to the right
ney  who came last  had been busying himself blowing up the walls of smolensk which were in nobody's way  because despite the unfortunate plight of the french or because of it  they wished to punish the floor against which they had hurt themselves ney  who had had a corps of ten thousand men  reached napoleon at orsha with only one thousand men left  having abandoned all the rest and all his cannon  and having crossed the dnieper at night by stealth at a wooded spot
from orsha they fled farther along the road to vilna  still playing at blindman's buff with the pursuing army
at the berezina they again became disorganized  many were drowned and many surrendered  but those who got across the river fled farther
their supreme chief donned a fur coat and  having seated himself in a sleigh  galloped on alone  abandoning his companions the others who could do so drove away too  leaving those who could not to surrender or die
this campaign consisted in a flight of the french during which they did all they could to destroy themselves from the time they turned onto the kaluga road to the day their leader fled from the army  none of the movements of the crowd had any sense
so one might have thought that regarding this period of the campaign the historians  who attributed the actions of the mass to the will of one man  would have found it impossible to make the story of the retreat fit about this campaign  and everywhere are described napoleon's arrangements  the maneuvers  and his profound plans which guided the army  as well as the military genius shown by his marshals
the retreat from malo yaroslavets when he had a free road into a wellsupplied district and the parallel road was open to him along which kutuzov afterwards pursued him this unnecessary retreat along a devastated road is explained to us as being due to profound considerations
similarly profound considerations are given for his retreat from smolensk to orsha
then his heroism at krasnoe is described  where he is reported to have been prepared to accept battle and take personal command  and to have walked about with a birch stick and said   j'ai assez fait l'empereur  il est temps de faire le general   * but nevertheless immediately ran away again  abandoning to its fate the scattered fragments of the army he left behind
*  i have acted the emperor long enough  it is time to act the general   then we are told of the greatness of soul of the marshals  especially of ney a greatness of soul consisting in this  that he made his way by night around through the forest and across the dnieper and escaped to orsha  abandoning standards  artillery  and nine tenths of his men
and lastly  the final departure of the great emperor from his heroic army is presented to us by the historians as something great and characteristic of genius
even that final running away  described in ordinary language as the lowest depth of baseness which every child is taught to be ashamed of even that act finds justification in the historians' language
when it is impossible to stretch the very elastic threads of historical ratiocination any farther  when actions are clearly contrary to all that humanity calls right or even just  the historians produce a saving conception of  greatness    greatness   it seems  excludes the standards of right and wrong for the  great  man nothing is wrong  there is no atrocity for which a  great  man can be blamed  c'est grand   * say the historians  and there no longer exists either good or evil but only  grand  and  not grand   grand is good  not grand is bad
grand is the characteristic  in their conception  of some special animals called  heroes   and napoleon  escaping home in a warm fur coat and leaving to perish those who were not merely his comrades but were  in his opinion  men he had brought there  feels que c'est grand  * 2  and his soul is tranquil *  it is great   *  2  that it is great
 du sublime  he saw something sublime in himself  au ridicule il n'y a qu'un pas   * said he and the whole world for fifty years has been repeating   sublime  grand  napoleon le grand   du sublime au ridicule il n'y a qu'un pas
*  from the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step   and it occurs to no one that to admit a greatness not commensurable with the standard of right and wrong is merely to admit one's own nothingness and immeasurable meanness
for us with the standard of good and evil given us by christ  no human actions are incommensurable
and there is no greatness where simplicity  goodness  and truth are absent
what russian  reading the account of the last part of the campaign of 1812  has not experienced an uncomfortable feeling of regret  dissatisfaction  and perplexity  who has not asked himself how it is that the french were not all captured or destroyed when our three armies surrounded them in superior numbers  when the disordered french  hungry and freezing  surrendered in crowds  and when  as the historians relate  the aim of the russians was to stop the french  to cut them off  and capture them all  how was it that the russian army  which when numerically weaker than the french had given battle at borodino  did not achieve its purpose when it had surrounded the french on three sides and when its aim was to capture them  can the french be so enormously superior to us that when we had surrounded them with superior forces we could not beat them  how could that happen  history  or what is called by that name  replying to these questions says that this occurred because kutuzov and tormasov and chichagov  and this man and that man  did not execute such and such maneuvers   but why did they not execute those maneuvers  and why if they were guilty of not carrying out a prearranged plan were they not tried and punished  but even if we admitted that kutuzov  chichagov  and others were the cause of the russian failures  it is still incomprehensible why  the position of the russian army being what it was at krasnoe and at the berezina  in both cases we had superior forces   the french army with its marshals  kings  and emperor was not captured  if that was what the russians aimed at
the explanation of this strange fact given by russian military historians  to the effect that kutuzov hindered an attack  is unfounded  for we know that he could not restrain the troops from attacking at vyazma and tarutino
why was the russian army which with inferior forces had withstood the enemy in full strength at borodino defeated at krasnoe and the berezina by the disorganized crowds of the french when it was numerically superior  if the aim of the russians consisted in cutting off and capturing napoleon and his marshals and that aim was not merely frustrated but all attempts to attain it were most shamefully baffled then this last period of the campaign is quite rightly considered by the french to be a series of victories  and quite wrongly considered victorious by russian historians
the russian military historians in so far as they submit to claims of logic must admit that conclusion  and in spite of their lyrical rhapsodies about valor  devotion  and so forth  must reluctantly admit that the french retreat from moscow was a series of victories for napoleon and defeats for kutuzov but putting national vanity entirely aside one feels that such a conclusion involves a contradiction  since the series of french victories brought the french complete destruction  while the series of russian defeats led to the total destruction of their enemy and the liberation of their country
the source of this contradiction lies in the fact that the historians studying the events from the letters of the sovereigns and the generals  from memoirs  reports  projects  and so forth  have attributed to this last period of the war of 1812 an aim that never existed  namely that of cutting off and capturing napoleon with his marshals and his army
there never was or could have been such an aim  for it would have been senseless and its attainment quite impossible
it would have been senseless  first because napoleon's disorganized army was flying from russia with all possible speed  that is to say  was doing just what every russian desired
so what was the use of performing various operations on the french who were running away as fast as they possibly could  secondly  it would have been senseless to block the passage of men whose whole energy was directed to flight
thirdly  it would have been senseless to sacrifice one's own troops in order to destroy the french army  which without external interference was destroying itself at such a rate that  though its path was not blocked  it could not carry across the frontier more than it actually did in december  namely a hundredth part of the original army
fourthly  it would have been senseless to wish to take captive the emperor  kings  and dukes whose capture would have been in the highest degree embarrassing for the russians  as the most adroit diplomatists of the time  joseph de maistre and others  recognized
still more senseless would have been the wish to capture army corps of the french  when our own army had melted away to half before reaching krasnoe and a whole division would have been needed to convoy the corps of prisoners  and when our men were not always getting full rations and the prisoners already taken were perishing of hunger
all the profound plans about cutting off and capturing napoleon and his army were like the plan of a market gardener who  when driving out of his garden a cow that had trampled down the beds he had planted  should run to the gate and hit the cow on the head
the only thing to be said in excuse of that gardener would be that he was very angry
but not even that could be said for those who drew up this project  for it was not they who had suffered from the trampled beds
but besides the fact that cutting off napoleon with his army would have been senseless  it was impossible
it was impossible first because as experience shows that a three mile movement of columns on a battlefield never coincides with the plans the probability of chichagov  kutuzov  and wittgenstein effecting a junction on time at an appointed place was so remote as to be tantamount to impossibility  as in fact thought kutuzov  who when he received the plan remarked that diversions planned over great distances do not yield the desired results
secondly it was impossible  because to paralyze the momentum with which napoleon's army was retiring  incomparably greater forces than the russians possessed would have been required
thirdly it was impossible  because the military term  to cut off  has no meaning
one can cut off a slice of bread  but not an army
to cut off an army  to bar its road is quite impossible  for there is always plenty of room to avoid capture and there is the night when nothing can be seen  as the military scientists might convince themselves by the example of krasnoe and of the berezina it is only possible to capture prisoners if they agree to be captured  just as it is only possible to catch a swallow if it settles on one's hand
men can only be taken prisoners if they surrender according to the rules of strategy and tactics  as the germans did
but the french troops quite rightly did not consider that this suited them  since death by hunger and cold awaited them in flight or captivity alike
fourthly and chiefly it was impossible  because never since the world began has a war been fought under such conditions as those that obtained in 1812  and the russian army in its pursuit of the french strained its strength to the utmost and could not have done more without destroying itself
during the movement of the russian army from tarutino to krasnoe it lost fifty thousand sick or stragglers  that is a number equal to the population of a large provincial town
half the men fell out of the army without a battle
and it is of this period of the campaign when the army lacked boots and sheepskin coats  was short of provisions and without vodka  and was camping out at night for months in the snow with fifteen degrees of frost  when there were only seven or eight hours of daylight and the rest was night in which the influence of discipline cannot be maintained  when men were taken into that region of death where discipline fails  not for a few hours only as in a battle  but for months  where they were every moment fighting death from hunger and cold  when half the army perished in a single month it is of this period of the campaign that the historians tell us how miloradovich should have made a flank march to such and such a place  tormasov to another place  and chichagov should have crossed  more than knee deep in snow  to somewhere else  and how so and so  routed  and  cut off  the french and so on and so on
the russians  half of whom died  did all that could and should have been done to attain an end worthy of the nation  and they are not to blame because other russians  sitting in warm rooms  proposed that they should do what was impossible all that strange contradiction now difficult to understand between the facts and the historical accounts only arises because the historians dealing with the matter have written the history of the beautiful words and sentiments of various generals  and not the history of the events
to them the words of miloradovich seem very interesting  and so do their surmises and the rewards this or that general received  but the question of those fifty thousand men who were left in hospitals and in graves does not even interest them  for it does not come within the range of their investigation
yet one need only discard the study of the reports and general plans and consider the movement of those hundreds of thousands of men who took a direct part in the events  and all the questions that seemed insoluble easily and simply receive an immediate and certain solution
the aim of cutting off napoleon and his army never existed except in the imaginations of a dozen people
it could not exist because it was senseless and unattainable
the people had a single aim  to free their land from invasion
that aim was attained in the first place of itself  as the french ran away  and so it was only necessary not to stop their flight
secondly it was attained by the guerrilla warfare which was destroying the french  and thirdly by the fact that a large russian army was following the french  ready to use its strength in case their movement stopped
the russian army had to act like a whip to a running animal
and the experienced driver knew it was better to hold the whip raised as a menace than to strike the running animal on the head
