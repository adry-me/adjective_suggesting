marley s ghost marley was dead  to begin with
there is no doubt whatever about that
the register of his burial was signed by the clergyman  the clerk  the undertaker  and the chief mourner
scrooge signed it
and scrooge s name was good upon  change  for anything he chose to put his hand to
old marley was as dead as a door nail
mind  i don t mean to say that i know  of my own knowledge  what there is particularly dead about a door nail
i might have been inclined  myself  to regard a coffin nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade
but the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile  and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it  or the country s done for
you will therefore permit me to repeat  emphatically  that marley was as dead as a door nail
scrooge knew he was dead  of course he did
how could it be otherwise  scrooge and he were partners for i don t know how many years
scrooge was his sole executor  his sole administrator  his sole assign  his sole residuary legatee  his sole friend  and sole mourner
and even scrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event  but that he was an excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral  and solemnised it with an undoubted bargain
the mention of marley s funeral brings me back to the point i started from
there is no doubt that marley was dead
this must be distinctly understood  or nothing wonderful can come of the story i am going to relate
if we were not perfectly convinced that hamlet s father died before the play began  there would be nothing more remarkable in his taking a stroll at night  in an easterly wind  upon his own ramparts  than there would be in any other middle aged gentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy spot say saint paul s churchyard for instance literally to astonish his son s weak mind
scrooge never painted out old marley s name
there it stood  years afterwards  above the warehouse door  scrooge and marley
the firm was known as scrooge and marley
sometimes people new to the business called scrooge scrooge  and sometimes marley  but he answered to both names
it was all the same to him
oh  but he was a tight fisted hand at the grindstone  scrooge  a squeezing  wrenching  grasping  scraping  clutching  covetous  old sinner  hard and sharp as flint  from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire  secret  and self contained  and solitary as an oyster
the cold within him froze his old features  nipped his pointed nose  shrivelled his cheek  stiffened his gait  made his eyes red  his thin lips blue  and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice
a frosty rime was on his head  and on his eyebrows  and his wiry chin
he carried his own low temperature always about with him  he iced his office in the dog days  and didn t thaw it one degree at christmas
external heat and cold had little influence on scrooge
no warmth could warm  no wintry weather chill him
no wind that blew was bitterer than he  no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose  no pelting rain less open to entreaty
foul weather didn t know where to have him
the heaviest rain  and snow  and hail  and sleet  could boast of the advantage over him in only one respect
they often  came down  handsomely  and scrooge never did
nobody ever stopped him in the street to say  with gladsome looks   my dear scrooge  how are you  when will you come to see me   no beggars implored him to bestow a trifle  no children asked him what it was o clock  no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to such and such a place  of scrooge
even the blind men s dogs appeared to know him  and when they saw him coming on  would tug their owners into doorways and up courts  and then would wag their tails as though they said   no eye at all is better than an evil eye  dark master   charles dickens 9 but what did scrooge care  it was the very thing he liked
to edge his way along the crowded paths of life  warning all human sympathy to keep its distance  was what the knowing ones call  nuts  to scrooge
once upon a time of all the good days in the year  on christmas eve old scrooge sat busy in his counting house
it was cold  bleak  biting weather  foggy withal  and he could hear the people in the court outside  go wheezing up and down  beating their hands upon their breasts  and stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them
the city clocks had only just gone three  but it was quite dark already it had not been light all day and candles were flaring in the windows of the neighbouring offices  like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air
the fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole  and was so dense without  that although the court was of the narrowest  the houses opposite were mere phantoms to see the dingy cloud come drooping down  obscuring everything  one might have thought that nature lived hard by  and was brewing on a large scale
the door of scrooge s counting house was open that he might keep his eye upon his clerk  who in a dismal little cell beyond  a sort of tank  was copying letters
scrooge had a very small fire  but the clerk s fire was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal
but he couldn t replenish it  for scrooge kept the coal box in his own room  and so surely as the clerk came in with the shovel  the master predicted that it would be necessary for them to part
wherefore the clerk put on his white comforter  and tried to warm himself at the candle  in which effort  not being a man of a strong imagination  he failed  a merry christmas  uncle  god save you   cried a cheerful voice
it was the voice of scrooge s nephew  who came upon him so quickly that this was the first intimation he had of his approach
 bah   said scrooge   humbug   he had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost  this nephew of scrooge s  that he was all in a glow  his face was ruddy and handsome  his eyes sparkled  and his breath smoked again 10  christmas a humbug  uncle   said scrooge s nephew
 you don t mean that  i am sure    i do   said scrooge
 merry christmas  what right have you to be merry  what reason have you to be merry  you re poor enough    come  then   returned the nephew gaily
 what right have you to be dismal  what reason have you to be morose  you re rich enough   scrooge having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment  said   bah   again  and followed it up with  humbug    don t be cross  uncle   said the nephew
 what else can i be   returned the uncle   when i live in such a world of fools as this  merry christmas  out upon merry christmas  what s christmas time to you but a time for paying bills without money  a time for finding yourself a year older  but not an hour richer  a time for balancing your books and having every item in  em through a round dozen of months presented dead against you  if i could work my will   said scrooge indignantly   every idiot who goes about with  merry christmas  on his lips  should be boiled with his own pudding  and buried with a stake of holly through his heart
he should    uncle   pleaded the nephew
 nephew   returned the uncle  sternly   keep christmas in your own way  and let me keep it in mine    keep it   repeated scrooge s nephew
 but you don t keep it    let me leave it alone  then   said scrooge
 much good may it do you  much good it has ever done you    there are many things from which i might have derived good  by which i have not profited  i dare say   returned the nephew
 christmas among the rest
but i am sure i have always thought of christmas time  when it has come round apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and origin  if anything belonging to it can be apart from that as a good time  a kind  forgiving  charitable  pleasant time  the only time i know of  in the long calendar of the year  when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut up hearts freely  and to think of people below them as if they really were fellow passengers to the grave  and not another race of creatures charles dickens 11 bound on other journeys
and therefore  uncle  though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket  i believe that it has done me good  and will do me good  and i say  god bless it   the clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded
becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety  he poked the fire  and extinguished the last frail spark for ever
 let me hear another sound from you   said scrooge   and you ll keep your christmas by losing your situation  you re quite a powerful speaker  sir   he added  turning to his nephew
 i wonder you don t go into parliament    don t be angry  uncle
come  dine with us to morrow   scrooge said that he would see him yes  indeed he did
he went the whole length of the expression  and said that he would see him in that extremity first
 but why   cried scrooge s nephew
 why    why did you get married   said scrooge
 because i fell in love    because you fell in love   growled scrooge  as if that were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry christmas
 good afternoon    nay  uncle  but you never came to see me before that happened
why give it as a reason for not coming now    good afternoon   said scrooge
 i want nothing from you  i ask nothing of you  why cannot we be friends    good afternoon   said scrooge
 i am sorry  with all my heart  to find you so resolute
we have never had any quarrel  to which i have been a party
but i have made the trial in homage to christmas  and i ll keep my christmas humour to the last
so a merry christmas  uncle    good afternoon   said scrooge
 and a happy new year    good afternoon   said scrooge
his nephew left the room without an angry word  notwithstanding
he stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings 12 of the season on the clerk  who  cold as he was  was warmer than scrooge  for he returned them cordially
 there s another fellow   muttered scrooge  who overheard him   my clerk  with fifteen shillings a week  and a wife and family  talking about a merry christmas
i ll retire to bedlam   this lunatic  in letting scrooge s nephew out  had let two other people in
they were portly gentlemen  pleasant to behold  and now stood  with their hats off  in scrooge s office
they had books and papers in their hands  and bowed to him
 scrooge and marley s  i believe   said one of the gentlemen  referring to his list
 have i the pleasure of addressing mr scrooge  or mr marley    mr marley has been dead these seven years   scrooge replied
 he died seven years ago  this very night    we have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving partner   said the gentleman  presenting his credentials
it certainly was  for they had been two kindred spirits
at the ominous word  liberality   scrooge frowned  and shook his head  and handed the credentials back
 at this festive season of the year  mr scrooge   said the gentleman  taking up a pen   it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the poor and destitute  who suffer greatly at the present time
many thousands are in want of common necessaries  hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts  sir    are there no prisons   asked scrooge
 plenty of prisons   said the gentleman  laying down the pen again
 and the union workhouses   demanded scrooge
 are they still in operation    they are
still   returned the gentleman   i wish i could say they were not    the treadmill and the poor law are in full vigour  then   said scrooge
 both very busy  sir   charles dickens 13  oh  i was afraid  from what you said at first  that something had occurred to stop them in their useful course   said scrooge
 i m very glad to hear it    under the impression that they scarcely furnish christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude   returned the gentleman   a few of us are endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the poor some meat and drink  and means of warmth
we choose this time  because it is a time  of all others  when want is keenly felt  and abundance rejoices
what shall i put you down for    nothing   scrooge replied
 you wish to be anonymous    i wish to be left alone   said scrooge
 since you ask me what i wish  gentlemen  that is my answer
i don t make merry myself at christmas and i can t afford to make idle people merry
i help to support the establishments i have mentioned they cost enough  and those who are badly off must go there    many can t go there  and many would rather die    if they would rather die   said scrooge   they had better do it  and decrease the surplus population
besides excuse me i don t know that    but you might know it   observed the gentleman
 it s not my business   scrooge returned
 it s enough for a man to understand his own business  and not to interfere with other people s
mine occupies me constantly
good afternoon  gentlemen   seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point  the gentlemen withdrew
scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion of himself  and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so  that people ran about with flaring links  proffering their services to go before horses in carriages  and conduct them on their way
the ancient tower of a church  whose gruff old bell was always peeping slily down at scrooge out of a gothic window in the wall  became invisible  and struck the hours and quarters in the clouds  with tremulous vibrations afterwards as if its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there
the cold became intense
in the main street  at the corner of the court  14 some labourers were repairing the gas pipes  and had lighted a great fire in a brazier  round which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered  warming their hands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture
the water plug being left in solitude  its overflowings sullenly congealed  and turned to misanthropic ice
the brightness of the shops where holly sprigs and berries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows  made pale faces ruddy as they passed
poulterers  and grocers  trades became a splendid joke  a glorious pageant  with which it was next to impossible to believe that such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do
the lord mayor  in the stronghold of the mighty mansion house  gave orders to his fifty cooks and butlers to keep christmas as a lord mayor s household should  and even the little tailor  whom he had fined five shillings on the previous monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets  stirred up to morrow s pudding in his garret  while his lean wife and the baby sallied out to buy the beef
foggier yet  and colder
piercing  searching  biting cold
if the good saint dunstan had but nipped the evil spirit s nose with a touch of such weather as that  instead of using his familiar weapons  then indeed he would have roared to lusty purpose
the owner of one scant young nose  gnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs  stooped down at scrooge s keyhole to regale him  god bless you  merry gentleman  may nothing you dismay   scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action  that the singer fled in terror  leaving the keyhole to the fog and even more congenial frost
at length the hour of shutting up the counting house arrived
with an ill will scrooge dismounted from his stool  and tacitly admitted the fact to the expectant clerk in the tank  who instantly snuffed his candle out  and put on his hat
 you ll want all day to morrow  i suppose   said scrooge
charles dickens 15  if quite convenient  sir    it s not convenient   said scrooge   and it s not fair
if i was to stop half a crown for it  you d think yourself ill used  i ll be bound   the clerk smiled faintly
 and yet   said scrooge   you don t think me ill used  when i pay a day s wages for no work   the clerk observed that it was only once a year
 a poor excuse for picking a man s pocket every twenty fifth of december   said scrooge  buttoning his great coat to the chin
 but i suppose you must have the whole day
be here all the earlier next morning   the clerk promised that he would  and scrooge walked out with a growl
the office was closed in a twinkling  and the clerk  with the long ends of his white comforter dangling below his waist  for he boasted no great coat   went down a slide on cornhill  at the end of a lane of boys  twenty times  in honour of its being christmas eve  and then ran home to camden town as hard as he could pelt  to play at blindman s buff
scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern  and having read all the newspapers  and beguiled the rest of the evening with his banker s book  went home to bed
he lived in chambers which had once belonged to his deceased partner
they were a gloomy suite of rooms  in a lowering pile of building up a yard  where it had so little business to be  that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run there when it was a young house  playing at hide and seek with other houses  and forgotten the way out again it was old enough now  and dreary enough  for nobody lived in it but scrooge  the other rooms being all let out as offices the yard was so dark that even scrooge  who knew its every stone  was fain to grope with his hands
the fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway of the house  that it seemed as if the genius of the weather sat in mournful meditation on the threshold
now  it is a fact  that there was nothing at all particular about the knocker on the door  except that it was very large
it is also a fact  that scrooge had seen it  night and morning  during his whole residence in that place  also that scrooge had as little of what is called fancy about 16 him as any man in the city of london  even including which is a bold word the corporation  aldermen  and livery
let it also be borne in mind that scrooge had not bestowed one thought on marley  since his last mention of his seven years  dead partner that afternoon
and then let any man explain to me  if he can  how it happened that scrooge  having his key in the lock of the door  saw in the knocker  without its undergoing any intermediate process of change not a knocker  but marley s face
marley s face
it was not in impenetrable shadow as the other objects in the yard were  but had a dismal light about it  like a bad lobster in a dark cellar
it was not angry or ferocious  but looked at scrooge as marley used to look  with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly forehead
the hair was curiously stirred  as if by breath or hot air  and  though the eyes were wide open  they were perfectly motionless
that  and its livid colour  made it horrible  but its horror seemed to be in spite of the face and beyond its control  rather than a part of its own expression
as scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon  it was a knocker again
to say that he was not startled  or that his blood was not conscious of a terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy  would be untrue
but he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished  turned it sturdily  walked in  and lighted his candle
he did pause  with a moment s irresolution  before he shut the door  and he did look cautiously behind it first  as if he half expected to be terrified with the sight of marley s pigtail sticking out into the hall
but there was nothing on the back of the door  except the screws and nuts that held the knocker on  so he said  pooh  pooh   and closed it with a bang
the sound resounded through the house like thunder
every room above  and every cask in the wine merchant s cellars below  appeared to have a separate peal of echoes of its own
scrooge was not a man to be frightened by echoes
he fastened the door  and walked across the hall  and up the stairs  slowly too  trimming his candle as he went
charles dickens 17 you may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight of stairs  or through a bad young act of parliament  but i mean to say you might have got a hearse up that staircase  and taken it broadwise  with the splinter bar towards the wall and the door towards the balustrades  and done it easy
there was plenty of width for that  and room to spare  which is perhaps the reason why scrooge thought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom
half a dozen gas lamps out of the street wouldn t have lighted the entry too well  so you may suppose that it was pretty dark with scrooge s dip
up scrooge went  not caring a button for that
darkness is cheap  and scrooge liked it
but before he shut his heavy door  he walked through his rooms to see that all was right he had just enough recollection of the face to desire to do that
sitting room  bed room  lumber room
all as they should be
nobody under the table  nobody under the sofa  a small fire in the grate  spoon and basin ready  and the little saucepan of gruel  scrooge had a cold in his head  upon the hob
nobody under the bed  nobody in the closet  nobody in his dressing gown  which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against the wall
lumber room as usual
old fireguard  old shoes  two fish baskets  washing stand on three legs  and a poker
quite satisfied  he closed his door  and locked himself in  double locked himself in  which was not his custom thus secured against surprise  he took off his cravat  put on his dressing gown and slippers  and his nightcap  and sat down before the fire to take his gruel
it was a very low fire indeed  nothing on such a bitter night
he was obliged to sit close to it  and brood over it  before he could extract the least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel
the fireplace was an old one  built by some dutch merchant long ago  and paved all round with quaint dutch tiles  designed to illustrate the scriptures
there were cains and abels  pharaoh s daughters  queens of sheba  angelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like feather beds  abrahams  belshazzars  apostles putting off to sea in butter boats  hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts  and yet that 18 face of marley  seven years dead  came like the ancient prophet s rod  and swallowed up the whole if each smooth tile had been a blank at first  with power to shape some picture on its surface from the disjointed fragments of his thoughts  there would have been a copy of old marley s head on every one
 humbug   said scrooge  and walked across the room
after several turns  he sat down again
as he threw his head back in the chair  his glance happened to rest upon a bell  a disused bell  that hung in the room  and communicated for some purpose now forgotten with a chamber in the highest story of the building
it was with great astonishment  and with a strange  inexplicable dread  that as he looked  he saw this bell begin to swing
it swung so softly in the outset that it scarcely made a sound  but soon it rang out loudly  and so did every bell in the house
this might have lasted half a minute  or a minute  but it seemed an hour
the bells ceased as they had begun  together
they were succeeded by a clanking noise  deep down below  as if some person were dragging a heavy chain over the casks in the wine merchant s cellar
scrooge then remembered to have heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as dragging chains
the cellar door flew open with a booming sound  and then he heard the noise much louder  on the floors below  then coming up the stairs  then coming straight towards his door
 it s humbug still   said scrooge
 i won t believe it   his colour changed though  when  without a pause  it came on through the heavy door  and passed into the room before his eyes
upon its coming in  the dying flame leaped up  as though it cried   i know him  marley s ghost   and fell again
the same face  the very same
marley in his pigtail  usual waistcoat  tights and boots  the tassels on the latter bristling  like his pigtail  and his coat skirts  and the hair upon his head
the chain he drew was clasped about his middle
it was long  and wound about him like a tail  and it was made  for scrooge observed it closely  of cashboxes  keys  padlocks  ledgers  deeds  and heavy purses wrought in steel
his body was transparent  so that scrooge  observing him  and looking through his waistcoat  could see the two buttons on his coat behind
scrooge had often heard it said that marley had no bowels  but he had never believed it until now
no  nor did he believe it even now
though he looked the phantom through and through  and saw it standing before him  though he felt the chilling influence of its death cold eyes  and marked the very texture of the folded kerchief bound about its head and chin  which wrapper he had not observed before  he was still incredulous  and fought against his senses
 how now   said scrooge  caustic and cold as ever
 what do you want with me    much   marley s voice  no doubt about it
 who are you    ask me who i was    who were you then   said scrooge  raising his voice
 you re particular  for a shade   he was going to say  to a shade   but substituted this  as more appropriate
 in life i was your partner  jacob marley    can you can you sit down   asked scrooge  looking doubtfully at him
 i can    do it  then   scrooge asked the question  because he didn t know whether a ghost so transparent might find himself in a condition to take a chair  and felt that in the event of its being impossible  it might involve the necessity of an embarrassing explanation but the ghost sat down on the opposite side of the fireplace  as if he were quite used to it
 you don t believe in me   observed the ghost
 i don t   said scrooge
 what evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your senses    i don t know   said scrooge
 why do you doubt your senses    because   said scrooge   a little thing affects them
a slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats
you may be an undigested bit of beef  a blot of mustard  a crumb of cheese  a charles dickens 21 fragment of an underdone potato
there s more of gravy than of grave about you  whatever you are   scrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes  nor did he feel  in his heart  by any means waggish then
the truth is  that he tried to be smart  as a means of distracting his own attention  and keeping down his terror  for the spectre s voice disturbed the very marrow in his bones
to sit  staring at those fixed glazed eyes  in silence for a moment  would play  scrooge felt  the very deuce with him
there was something very awful  too  in the spectre s being provided with an infernal atmosphere of its own
scrooge could not feel it himself  but this was clearly the case  for though the ghost sat perfectly motionless  its hair  and skirts  and tassels  were still agitated as by the hot vapour from an oven  you see this toothpick   said scrooge  returning quickly to the charge  for the reason just assigned  and wishing  though it were only for a second  to divert the vision s stony gaze from himself  i do   replied the ghost
 you are not looking at it   said scrooge
 but i see it   said the ghost   notwithstanding    well   returned scrooge   i have but to swallow this  and be for the rest of my days persecuted by a legion of goblins  all of my own creation
humbug  i tell you  humbug   at this the spirit raised a frightful cry  and shook its chain with such a dismal and appalling noise  that scrooge held on tight to his chair  to save himself from falling in a swoon but how much greater was his horror  when the phantom taking off the bandage round its head  as if it were too warm to wear in doors  its lower jaw dropped down upon its breast  scrooge fell upon his knees  and clasped his hands before his face
 mercy   he said
 dreadful apparition  why do you trouble me    man of the worldly mind   replied the ghost   do you believe in me or not   22  i do   said scrooge
 i must
but why do spirits walk the earth  and why do they come to me    it is required of every man   the ghost returned   that the spirit within him should walk abroad among his fellowmen  and travel far and wide  and if that spirit goes not forth in life  it is condemned to do so after death
it is doomed to wander through the world oh  woe is me  and witness what it cannot share  but might have shared on earth  and turned to happiness   again the spectre raised a cry  and shook its chain and wrung its shadowy hands
 you are fettered   said scrooge  trembling
 tell me why    i wear the chain i forged in life   replied the ghost
 i made it link by link  and yard by yard  i girded it on of my own free will  and of my own free will i wore it
is its pattern strange to you   scrooge trembled more and more
 or would you know   pursued the ghost   the weight and length of the strong coil you bear yourself  it was full as heavy and as long as this  seven christmas eves ago
you have laboured on it  since
it is a ponderous chain   scrooge glanced about him on the floor  in the expectation of finding himself surrounded by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron cable  but he could see nothing  jacob   he said  imploringly
 old jacob marley  tell me more
speak comfort to me  jacob    i have none to give   the ghost replied
 it comes from other regions  ebenezer scrooge  and is conveyed by other ministers  to other kinds of men
nor can i tell you what i would
a very little more is all permitted to me
i cannot rest  i cannot stay  i cannot linger anywhere
my spirit never walked beyond our counting house mark me  in life my spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our money changing hole  and weary journeys lie before me   it was a habit with scrooge  whenever he became thoughtful  to put his hands in his breeches pockets
pondering on what the ghost had said  he did so now  but without lifting up his eyes  or getting off his knees
charles dickens 23  you must have been very slow about it  jacob   scrooge observed  in a business like manner  though with humility and deference
 slow   the ghost repeated
 seven years dead   mused scrooge
 and travelling all the time    the whole time   said the ghost
 no rest  no peace
incessant torture of remorse    you travel fast   said scrooge
 on the wings of the wind   replied the ghost
 you might have got over a great quantity of ground in seven years   said scrooge
the ghost  on hearing this  set up another cry  and clanked its chain so hideously in the dead silence of the night  that the ward would have been justified in indicting it for a nuisance
 oh  captive  bound  and double ironed   cried the phantom   not to know  that ages of incessant labour by immortal creatures  for this earth must pass into eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is all developed
not to know that any christian spirit working kindly in its little sphere  whatever it may be  will find its mortal life too short for its vast means of usefulness
not to know that no space of regret can make amends for one life s opportunity misused  yet such was i  oh  such was i    but you were always a good man of business  jacob   faltered scrooge  who now began to apply this to himself  business   cried the ghost  wringing its hands again
 mankind was my business
the common welfare was my business  charity  mercy  forbearance  and benevolence  were  all  my business
the dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business   it held up its chain at arm s length  as if that were the cause of all its unavailing grief  and flung it heavily upon the ground again
 at this time of the rolling year   the spectre said   i suffer most
why did i walk through crowds of fellow beings with my eyes turned down  and never raise them to that blessed star which led the wise 24 men to a poor abode  were there no poor homes to which its light would have conducted me   scrooge was very much dismayed to hear the spectre going on at this rate  and began to quake exceedingly
 hear me   cried the ghost
 my time is nearly gone    i will   said scrooge
 but don t be hard upon me  don t be flowery  jacob  pray    how it is that i appear before you in a shape that you can see  i may not tell
i have sat invisible beside you many and many a day   it was not an agreeable idea
scrooge shivered  and wiped the perspiration from his brow
 that is no light part of my penance   pursued the ghost
 i am here to night to warn you  that you have yet a chance and hope of escaping my fate
a chance and hope of my procuring  ebenezer    you were always a good friend to me   said scrooge
 thank ee    you will be haunted   resumed the ghost   by three spirits   scrooge s countenance fell almost as low as the ghost s had done
 is that the chance and hope you mentioned  jacob   he demanded  in a faltering voice
 it is    i i think i d rather not   said scrooge
 without their visits   said the ghost   you cannot hope to shun the path i tread
expect the first to morrow  when the bell tolls one    couldn t i take  em all at once  and have it over  jacob   hinted scrooge
 expect the second on the next night at the same hour
the third upon the next night when the last stroke of twelve has ceased to vibrate
look to see me no more  and look that  for your own sake  you remember what has passed between us   when it had said these words  the spectre took its wrapper from the table  and bound it round its head  as before
scrooge knew this  by the smart sound its teeth made  when the jaws were brought together by the bandage
he ventured to raise his eyes again  and charles dickens 25 found his supernatural visitor confronting him in an erect attitude  with its chain wound over and about its arm
the apparition walked backward from him  and at every step it took  the window raised itself a little  so that when the spectre reached it  it was wide open
it beckoned scrooge to approach  which he did
when they were within two paces of each other  marley s ghost held up its hand  warning him to come no nearer
scrooge stopped
not so much in obedience  as in surprise and fear  for on the raising of the hand  he became sensible of confused noises in the air  incoherent sounds of lamentation and regret  wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and self accusatory
the spectre  after listening for a moment  joined in the mournful dirge  and floated out upon the bleak  dark night
26 scrooge followed to the window  desperate in his curiosity
he looked out
the air was filled with phantoms  wandering hither and thither in restless haste  and moaning as they went every one of them wore chains like marley s ghost  some few  they might be guilty governments  were linked together  none were free
many had been personally known to scrooge in their lives
he had been quite familiar with one old ghost  in a white waistcoat  with a monstrous iron safe attached to its ankle  who cried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched woman with an infant  whom it saw below  upon a doorstep the misery with them all was  clearly  that they sought to interfere  for good  in human matters  and had lost the power for ever
whether these creatures faded into mist  or mist enshrouded them  he could not tell
but they and their spirit voices faded together  and the night became as it had been when he walked home
scrooge closed the window  and examined the door by which the ghost had entered
it was double locked  as he had locked it with his own hands  and the bolts were undisturbed
he tried to say  humbug   but stopped at the first syllable
and being  from the emotion he had undergone  or the fatigues of the day  or his glimpse of the invisible world  or the dull conversation of the ghost  or the lateness of the hour  much in need of repose  went straight to bed  without undressing  and fell asleep upon the instant
27 the first of the three spirits when scrooge awoke  it was so dark  that looking out of bed  he could scarcely distinguish the transparent window from the opaque walls of his chamber
he was endeavouring to pierce the darkness with his ferret eyes  when the chimes of a neighbouring church struck the four quarters
so he listened for the hour
to his great astonishment the heavy bell went on from six to seven  and from seven to eight  and regularly up to twelve  then stopped
twelve  it was past two when he went to bed
the clock was wrong
an icicle must have got into the works
twelve  he touched the spring of his repeater  to correct this most preposterous clock
its rapid little pulse beat twelve  and stopped
 why  it isn t possible   said scrooge   that i can have slept through a whole day and far into another night
it isn t possible that anything has happened to the sun  and this is twelve at noon   the idea being an alarming one  he scrambled out of bed  and groped his way to the window
he was obliged to rub the frost off with the sleeve of his dressing gown before he could see anything  and could see very little then
all he could make out was  that it was still very foggy and extremely cold  and that there was no noise of people running to and fro  and making a great stir  as there unquestionably would have been if night had beaten off bright day  and taken possession of the world
this was a great relief  because  three days after sight of this first of exchange pay to mr ebenezer scrooge or his order   and so forth  would have become a mere united states  security if there were no days to count by
28 scrooge went to bed again  and thought  and thought  and thought it over and over and over  and could make nothing of it
the more he thought  the more perplexed he was  and the more he endeavoured not to think  the more he thought
marley s ghost bothered him exceedingly
every time he resolved within himself  after mature inquiry  that it was all a dream  his mind flew back again  like a strong spring released  to its first position  and presented the same problem to be worked all through   was it a dream or not   scrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three quarters more  when he remembered  on a sudden  that the ghost had warned him of a visitation when the bell tolled one he resolved to lie awake until the hour was passed  and  considering that he could no more go to sleep than go to heaven  this was perhaps the wisest resolution in his power
the quarter was so long  that he was more than once convinced he must have sunk into a doze unconsciously  and missed the clock
at length it broke upon his listening ear
 ding  dong    a quarter past   said scrooge  counting
 ding  dong    half past   said scrooge
 ding  dong    a quarter to it   said scrooge
 ding  dong    the hour itself   said scrooge  triumphantly   and nothing else   he spoke before the hour bell sounded  which it now did with a deep  dull  hollow  melancholy one
light flashed up in the room upon the instant  and the curtains of his bed were drawn
the curtains of his bed were drawn aside  i tell you  by a hand
not the curtains at his feet  nor the curtains at his back  but those to which his face was addressed
the curtains of his bed were drawn aside  and scrooge  starting up into a half recumbent attitude  found himself face to face with the unearthly visitor who drew them  as charles dickens 29 close to it as i am now to you  and i am standing in the spirit at your elbow it was a strange figure like a child  yet not so like a child as like an old man  viewed through some supernatural medium  which gave him the appearance of having receded from the view  and being diminished to a child s proportions
its hair  which hung about its neck and down its back  was white as if with age  and yet the face had not a wrinkle in it  and the tenderest bloom was on the skin
the arms were very long and muscular  the hands the same  as if its hold were of uncommon strength its legs and feet  most delicately formed  were  like those upper members  bare
it wore a tunic of the purest white  and round its waist was bound a lustrous belt  the sheen of which was beautiful
it held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand  and  in singular contradiction of that wintry emblem  had its dress trimmed with summer flowers
but the strangest thing about it was  that from the crown of its head there sprung a bright clear jet of light  by which all this was visible  and which was doubtless the occasion of its using  in its duller moments  a great extinguisher for a cap  which it now held under its arm
even this  though  when scrooge looked at it with increasing steadiness  was not its strangest quality
for as its belt sparkled and glittered now in one part and now in another  and what was light one instant  at another time was dark  so the figure itself fluctuated in its distinctness  being now a thing with one arm  now with one leg  now with twenty legs  now a pair of legs without a head  now a head without a body  of which dissolving parts  no outline would be visible in the dense gloom wherein they melted away
and in the very wonder of this  it would be itself again  distinct and clear as ever
 are you the spirit  sir  whose coming was foretold to me   asked scrooge
 i am   the voice was soft and gentle
singularly low  as if instead of being so close beside him  it were at a distance
 who  and what are you   scrooge demanded
 i am the ghost of christmas past    long past   inquired scrooge  observant of its dwarfish stature
30  no
your past   perhaps  scrooge could not have told anybody why  if anybody could have asked him  but he had a special desire to see the spirit in his cap  and begged him to be covered
 what   exclaimed the ghost   would you so soon put out  with worldly hands  the light i give  is it not enough that you are one of those whose passions made this cap  and force me through whole trains of years to wear it low upon my brow   scrooge reverently disclaimed all intention to offend or any knowledge of having wilfully  bonneted  the spirit at any period of his life
he then made bold to inquire what business brought him there
 your welfare   said the ghost
scrooge expressed himself much obliged  but could not help thinking that a night of unbroken rest would have been more conducive to that end the spirit must have heard him thinking  for it said immediately   your reclamation  then
take heed   it put out its strong hand as it spoke  and clasped him gently by the arm
 rise  and walk with me   it would have been in vain for scrooge to plead that the weather and the hour were not adapted to pedestrian purposes  that bed was warm  and the thermometer a long way below freezing  that he was clad but lightly in his slippers  dressing gown  and nightcap  and that he had a cold upon him at that time
the grasp  though gentle as a woman s hand  was not to be resisted
he rose  but finding that the spirit made towards the window  clasped his robe in supplication
 i am a mortal   scrooge remonstrated   and liable to fall    bear but a touch of my hand there   said the spirit  laying it upon his heart   and you shall be upheld in more than this   as the words were spoken  they passed through the wall  and stood upon an open country road  with fields on either hand
the city had entirely vanished
not a vestige of it was to be seen
the darkness and the mist had vanished with it  for it was a clear  cold  winter day  with snow upon the ground
charles dickens 31  good heaven   said scrooge  clasping his hands together  as he looked about him
 i was bred in this place
i was a boy here   the spirit gazed upon him mildly
its gentle touch  though it had been light and instantaneous  appeared still present to the old man s sense of feeling
he was conscious of a thousand odours floating in the air  each one connected with a thousand thoughts  and hopes  and joys  and cares long  long  forgotten   your lip is trembling   said the ghost
 and what is that upon your cheek   scrooge muttered  with an unusual catching in his voice  that it was a pimple  and begged the ghost to lead him where he would
 you recollect the way   inquired the spirit
 remember it   cried scrooge with fervour   i could walk it blindfold    strange to have forgotten it for so many years   observed the ghost
 let us go on   they walked along the road  scrooge recognising every gate  and post  and tree  until a little market town appeared in the distance  with its bridge  its church  and winding river
some shaggy ponies now were seen trotting towards them with boys upon their backs  who called to other boys in country gigs and carts  driven by farmers
all these boys were in great spirits  and shouted to each other  until the broad fields were so full of merry music  that the crisp air laughed to hear it   these are but shadows of the things that have been   said the ghost
 they have no consciousness of us   the jocund travellers came on  and as they came  scrooge knew and named them every one
why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them  why did his cold eye glisten  and his heart leap up as they went past  why was he filled with gladness when he heard them give each other merry christmas  as they parted at cross roads and bye ways  for their several homes  what was merry christmas to scrooge  out upon merry christmas  what good had it ever done to him   the school is not quite deserted   said the ghost
 a solitary child  neglected by his friends  is left there still   32 scrooge said he knew it
and he sobbed
they left the high road  by a well remembered lane  and soon approached a mansion of dull red brick  with a little weathercocksurmounted cupola  on the roof  and a bell hanging in it
it was a large house  but one of broken fortunes  for the spacious offices were little used  their walls were damp and mossy  their windows broken  and their gates decayed
fowls clucked and strutted in the stables  and the coach houses and sheds were over run with grass
nor was it more retentive of its ancient state  within  for entering the dreary hall  and glancing through the open doors of many rooms  they found them poorly furnished  cold  and vast there was an earthy savour in the air  a chilly bareness in the place  which associated itself somehow with too much getting up by candle light  and not too much to eat
they went  the ghost and scrooge  across the hall  to a door at the back of the house
it opened before them  and disclosed a long  bare  melancholy room  made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and desks at one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire  and scrooge sat down upon a form  and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he used to be
not a latent echo in the house  not a squeak and scuffle from the mice behind the panelling  not a drip from the half thawed waterspout in the dull yard behind  not a sigh among the leafless boughs of one despondent poplar  not the idle swinging of an empty store house door  no  not a clicking in the fire  but fell upon the heart of scrooge with a softening influence  and gave a freer passage to his tears
the spirit touched him on the arm  and pointed to his younger self  intent upon his reading
suddenly a man  in foreign garments  wonderfully real and distinct to look at  stood outside the window  with an axe stuck in his belt  and leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood
 why  it s ali baba   scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy
 it s dear old honest ali baba  yes  yes  i know  one christmas time  when yonder solitary child was left here all alone  he did come  for the first time  just like that
poor boy  and valentine   said scrooge   and his wild brother  orson  there they go  and what s his name  who was put down in his drawers  asleep  at the gate of damascus  don t you charles dickens 33 see him  and the sultan s groom turned upside down by the genii  there he is upon his head  serve him right
i m glad of it
what business had he to be married to the princess   to hear scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature on such subjects  in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and crying  and to see his heightened and excited face  would have been a surprise to his business friends in the city  indeed
 there s the parrot   cried scrooge
 green body and yellow tail  with a thing like a lettuce growing out of the top of his head  there he is  poor robin crusoe  he called him  when he came home again after sailing round the island
 poor robin crusoe  where have you been  robin crusoe   the man thought he was dreaming  but he wasn t
it was the parrot  you know
there goes friday  running for his life to the little creek  halloa  hoop  halloo   then  with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual character  he said  in pity for his former self   poor boy   and cried again
 i wish   scrooge muttered  putting his hand in his pocket  and looking about him  after drying his eyes with his cuff   but it s too late now    what is the matter   asked the spirit
 nothing   said scrooge
 nothing
there was a boy singing a christmas carol at my door last night
i should like to have given him something  that s all   the ghost smiled thoughtfully  and waved its hand  saying as it did so   let us see another christmas   scrooge s former self grew larger at the words  and the room became a little darker and more dirty
the panels shrunk  the windows cracked  fragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling  and the naked laths were shown instead  but how all this was brought about  scrooge knew no more than you do
he only knew that it was quite correct  that everything had happened so  that there he was  alone again  when all the other boys had gone home for the jolly holidays
he was not reading now  but walking up and down despairingly
scrooge looked at the ghost  and with a mournful shaking of his head  glanced anxiously towards the door
34 it opened  and a little girl  much younger than the boy  came darting in  and putting her arms about his neck  and often kissing him  addressed him as her  dear  dear brother    i have come to bring you home  dear brother   said the child  clapping her tiny hands  and bending down to laugh  to bring you home  home  home    home  little fan   returned the boy
 yes   said the child  brimful of glee
 home  for good and all
home  for ever and ever
father is so much kinder than he used to be  that home s like heaven  he spoke so gently to me one dear night when i was going to bed  that i was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come home  and he said yes  you should  and sent me in a coach to bring you
and you re to be a man   said the child  opening her eyes   and are never to come back here  but first  we re to be together all the christmas long  and have the merriest time in all the world    you are quite a woman  little fan   exclaimed the boy
she clapped her hands and laughed  and tried to touch his head  but being too little  laughed again  and stood on tiptoe to embrace him
then she began to drag him  in her childish eagerness  towards the door  and he  nothing loth to go  accompanied her
a terrible voice in the hall cried   bring down master scrooge s box  there   and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster himself  who glared on master scrooge with a ferocious condescension  and threw him into a dreadful state of mind by shaking hands with him he then conveyed him and his sister into the veriest old well of a shivering best parlour that ever was seen  where the maps upon the wall  and the celestial and terrestrial globes in the windows  were waxy with cold
here he produced a decanter of curiously light wine  and a block of curiously heavy cake  and administered instalments of those dainties to the young people  at the same time  sending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of  something  to the postboy  who answered that he thanked the gentleman  but if it was the same tap as he had tasted before  he had rather not
master scrooge s trunk being by this time tied on to the top of the chaise  the children bade the schoolmaster good bye right willingly  and getting into it  drove gaily charles dickens 35 down the garden sweep  the quick wheels dashing the hoar frost and snow from off the dark leaves of the evergreens like spray
 always a delicate creature  whom a breath might have withered   said the ghost
 but she had a large heart    so she had   cried scrooge
 you re right
i will not gainsay it  spirit
god forbid    she died a woman   said the ghost   and had  as i think  children    one child   scrooge returned
 true   said the ghost
 your nephew   scrooge seemed uneasy in his mind  and answered briefly   yes   although they had but that moment left the school behind them  they were now in the busy thoroughfares of a city  where shadowy passengers passed and repassed  where shadowy carts and coaches battled for the way  and all the strife and tumult of a real city were
it was made plain enough  by the dressing of the shops  that here too it was christmas time again  but it was evening  and the streets were lighted up
the ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door  and asked scrooge if he knew it
 know it   said scrooge
 was i apprenticed here   they went in
at sight of an old gentleman in a welsh wig  sitting behind such a high desk  that if he had been two inches taller he must have knocked his head against the ceiling  scrooge cried in great excitement   why  it s old fezziwig  bless his heart  it s fezziwig alive again   old fezziwig laid down his pen  and looked up at the clock  which pointed to the hour of seven
he rubbed his hands  adjusted his capacious waistcoat  laughed all over himself  from his shoes to his organ of benevolence  and called out in a comfortable  oily  rich  fat  jovial voice   yo ho  there  ebenezer  dick   scrooge s former self  now grown a young man  came briskly in  accompanied by his fellow  prentice 36  dick wilkins  to be sure   said scrooge to the ghost
 bless me  yes
there he is
he was very much attached to me  was dick
poor dick  dear  dear    yo ho  my boys   said fezziwig
 no more work to night
christmas eve  dick
christmas  ebenezer  let s have the shutters up   cried old fezziwig  with a sharp clap of his hands   before a man can say jack robinson   you wouldn t believe how those two fellows went at it  they charged into the street with the shutters one  two  three had  em up in their places four  five  six barred  em and pinned  em seven  eight  nine and came back before you could have got to twelve  panting like race horses
 hilli ho   cried old fezziwig  skipping down from the high desk  with wonderful agility
 clear away  my lads  and let s have lots of room here  hilli ho  dick  chirrup  ebenezer   clear away  there was nothing they wouldn t have cleared away  or couldn t have cleared away  with old fezziwig looking on
it was done in a minute
every movable was packed off  as if it were dismissed from public life for evermore  the floor was swept and watered  the lamps were trimmed  fuel was heaped upon the fire  and the warehouse was as snug  and warm  and dry  and bright a ballroom  as you would desire to see upon a winter s night
in came a fiddler with a music book  and went up to the lofty desk  and made an orchestra of it  and tuned like fifty stomach aches
in came mrs fezziwig  one vast substantial smile in came the three miss fezziwigs  beaming and lovable
in came the six young followers whose hearts they broke
in came all the young men and women employed in the business
in came the housemaid  with her cousin  the baker
in came the cook  with her brother s particular friend  the milkman
in came the boy from over the way  who was suspected of not having board enough from his master  trying to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one  who was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress in they all came  one after another  some shyly  some boldly  some gracefully  some awkwardly  some pushing  some pulling  in they all came  anyhow and everyhow
away they all went  twenty couple at once  hands half round and back charles dickens 37 again the other way  down the middle and up again  round and round in various stages of affectionate grouping  old top couple always turning up in the wrong place  new top couple starting off again  as soon as they got there  all top couples at last  and not a bottom one to help them  when this result was brought about  old fezziwig  clapping his hands to stop the dance  cried out   well done   and the fiddler plunged his hot face into a pot of porter  especially provided for that purpose
but scorning rest  upon his reappearance  he instantly began again  though there were no dancers yet  as if the other fiddler had been carried home  exhausted  on a shutter  and he were a bran new man resolved to beat him out of sight  or perish
there were more dances  and there were forfeits  and more dances  and there was cake  and there was negus  and there was a great piece of cold roast  and there was a great piece of cold boiled  and there were mince pies  and plenty of beer
but the great effect of the evening came after the roast and boiled  when the fiddler  an artful dog  mind  the sort of man who knew his business better than you or i could have told it him   struck up  sir roger de coverley   then old fezziwig stood out to dance with mrs fezziwig top couple  too  with a good stiff piece of work cut out for them  three or four and twenty pair of partners  people who were not to be trifled with  people who would dance  and had no notion of walking
but if they had been twice as many ah  four times old fezziwig would have been a match for them  and so would mrs fezziwig as to her  she was worthy to be his partner in every sense of the term
if that s not high praise  tell me higher  and i ll use it
a positive light appeared to issue from fezziwig s calves
they shone in every part of the dance like moons
you couldn t have predicted  at any given time  what would have become of them next
and when old fezziwig and mrs fezziwig had gone all through the dance  advance and retire  both hands to your partner  bow and curtsey  corkscrew  thread the needle  and back again to your place  fezziwig  cut  cut so deftly  that he appeared to wink with his legs  and came upon his feet again without a stagger when the clock struck eleven  this domestic ball broke up
mr and mrs fezziwig took their stations  one on either side of the door  and shaking hands with every person individually as he or she went out  wished him or her a merry christmas when everybody had retired but the two  prentices  they did the same to them  and thus the cheerful voices died away  and the lads were left to their beds  which were under a counter in the back shop
during the whole of this time  scrooge had acted like a man out of his wits
his heart and soul were in the scene  and with his former self
he corroborated everything  remembered everything  enjoyed everything  and underwent the strangest agitation
it was not until now  when the bright faces of his former self and dick were turned from them  that he remembered the ghost  and became conscious that it was looking full upon him  while the light upon its head burnt very clear
 a small matter   said the ghost   to make these silly folks so full of gratitude    small   echoed scrooge
the spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices  who were pouring out their hearts in praise of fezziwig  and when he had done so  said   why  is it not  he has spent but a few pounds of your mortal money  three or four perhaps
is that so much that he deserves this praise    it isn t that   said scrooge  heated by the remark  and speaking unconsciously like his former  not his latter  self
 it isn t that  spirit
he has the power to render us happy or unhappy  to make our service light or burdensome  a pleasure or a toil
say that his power lies in words and looks  in things so slight and insignificant that it is impossible to add and count  em up  what then  the happiness he gives  is quite as great as if it cost a fortune   he felt the spirit s glance  and stopped
 what is the matter   asked the ghost
 nothing particular   said scrooge
 something  i think   the ghost insisted
40  no   said scrooge   no
i should like to be able to say a word or two to my clerk just now
that s all   his former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance to the wish  and scrooge and the ghost again stood side by side in the open air
 my time grows short   observed the spirit
 quick   this was not addressed to scrooge  or to any one whom he could see  but it produced an immediate effect
for again scrooge saw himself he was older now  a man in the prime of life
his face had not the harsh and rigid lines of later years  but it had begun to wear the signs of care and avarice
there was an eager  greedy  restless motion in the eye  which showed the passion that had taken root  and where the shadow of the growing tree would fall
he was not alone  but sat by the side of a fair young girl in a mourning dress  in whose eyes there were tears  which sparkled in the light that shone out of the ghost of christmas past
 it matters little   she said  softly
 to you  very little
another idol has displaced me  and if it can cheer and comfort you in time to come  as i would have tried to do  i have no just cause to grieve    what idol has displaced you   he rejoined
 a golden one    this is the even handed dealing of the world   he said
 there is nothing on which it is so hard as poverty  and there is nothing it professes to condemn with such severity as the pursuit of wealth    you fear the world too much   she answered  gently
 all your other hopes have merged into the hope of being beyond the chance of its sordid reproach
i have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by one  until the master passion  gain  engrosses you
have i not    what then   he retorted
 even if i have grown so much wiser  what then  i am not changed towards you   she shook her head
 am i    our contract is an old one
it was made when we were both poor and content to be so  until  in good season  we could improve our worldly fortune by our patient industry
you are changed
when it was made  you were another man   charles dickens 41  i was a boy   he said impatiently
 your own feeling tells you that you were not what you are   she returned
 i am
that which promised happiness when we were one in heart  is fraught with misery now that we are two
how often and how keenly i have thought of this  i will not say
it is enough that i have thought of it  and can release you    have i ever sought release    in words
no
never    in what  then    in a changed nature  in an altered spirit  in another atmosphere of life  another hope as its great end
in everything that made my love of any worth or value in your sight
if this had never been between us   said the girl  looking mildly  but with steadiness  upon him   tell me  would you seek me out and try to win me now  ah  no   he seemed to yield to the justice of this supposition  in spite of himself but he said with a struggle   you think not    i would gladly think otherwise if i could   she answered   heaven knows  when i have learned a truth like this  i know how strong and irresistible it must be
but if you were free to day  tomorrow  yesterday  can even i believe that you would choose a dowerless girl you who  in your very confidence with her  weigh everything by gain  or  choosing her  if for a moment you were false enough to your one guiding principle to do so  do i not know that your repentance and regret would surely follow  i do  and i release you
with a full heart  for the love of him you once were   he was about to speak  but with her head turned from him  she resumed
 you may the memory of what is past half makes me hope you will have pain in this
a very  very brief time  and you will dismiss the recollection of it  gladly  as an unprofitable dream  from which it happened well that you awoke
may you be happy in the life you have chosen   she left him  and they parted
 spirit   said scrooge   show me no more  conduct me home
why do you delight to torture me    one shadow more   exclaimed the ghost
42  no more   cried scrooge
 no more
i don t wish to see it
show me no more   but the relentless ghost pinioned him in both his arms  and forced him to observe what happened next they were in another scene and place  a room  not very large or handsome  but full of comfort
near to the winter fire sat a beautiful young girl  so like that last that scrooge believed it was the same  until he saw her  now a comely matron  sitting opposite her daughter
the noise in this room was perfectly tumultuous  for there were more children there  than scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count  and  unlike the celebrated herd in the poem  they were not forty children conducting themselves like one  but every child was conducting itself like forty the consequences were uproarious beyond belief  but no one seemed to care  on the contrary  the mother and daughter laughed heartily  and enjoyed it very much  and the latter  soon beginning to mingle in the sports  got pillaged by the young brigands most ruthlessly
what would i not have given to be one of them  though i never could have been so rude  no  no  i wouldn t for the wealth of all the world have crushed that braided hair  and torn it down  and for the precious little shoe  i wouldn t have plucked it off  god bless my soul  to save my life
as to measuring her waist in sport  as they did  bold young brood  i couldn t have done it  i should have expected my arm to have grown round it for a punishment  and never come straight again
and yet i should have dearly liked  i own  to have touched her lips  to have questioned her  that she might have opened them  to have looked upon the lashes of her downcast eyes  and never raised a blush  to have let loose waves of hair  an inch of which would be a keepsake beyond price  in short  i should have liked  i do confess  to have had the lightest licence of a child  and yet to have been man enough to know its value
but now a knocking at the door was heard  and such a rush immediately ensued that she with laughing face and plundered dress was borne towards it the centre of a flushed and boisterous group  just in time to greet the father  who came home attended by a man laden with christmas toys and presents
then the shouting and the struggling  and the onslaught that was made on the defenceless porter  charles dickens 43 the scaling him with chairs for ladders to dive into his pockets  despoil him of brown paper parcels  hold on tight by his cravat  hug him round his neck  pommel his back  and kick his legs in irrepressible affection  the shouts of wonder and delight with which the development of every package was received  the terrible announcement that the baby had been taken in the act of putting a doll s frying pan into his mouth  and was more than suspected of having swallowed a fictitious turkey  glued on a wooden platter  the immense relief of finding this a false alarm  the joy  and gratitude  and ecstasy  they are all indescribable alike
it is enough that by degrees the children and their emotions got out of the parlour  and by one stair at a time  up to the top of the house  where they went to bed  and so subsided
and now scrooge looked on more attentively than ever  when the master of the house  having his daughter leaning fondly on him  sat down with her and her mother at his own fireside  and when he thought that such another creature  quite as graceful and as full of promise  might have called him father  and been a spring time in the haggard winter of his life  his sight grew very dim indeed
 belle   said the husband  turning to his wife with a smile   i saw an old friend of yours this afternoon    who was it    guess    how can i  tut  don t i know   she added in the same breath  laughing as he laughed
 mr scrooge    mr scrooge it was
i passed his office window  and as it was not shut up  and he had a candle inside  i could scarcely help seeing him
his partner lies upon the point of death  i hear  and there he sat alone
quite alone in the world  i do believe    spirit   said scrooge in a broken voice   remove me from this place    i told you these were shadows of the things that have been   said the ghost
 that they are what they are  do not blame me    remove me   scrooge exclaimed   i cannot bear it   44 he turned upon the ghost  and seeing that it looked upon him with a face  in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces it had shown him  wrestled with it
 leave me  take me back
haunt me no longer   in the struggle  if that can be called a struggle in which the ghost with no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort of its adversary  scrooge observed that its light was burning high and bright  and dimly connecting that with its influence over him  he seized the extinguisher cap  and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its head
the spirit dropped beneath it  so that the extinguisher covered its whole form  but though scrooge pressed it down with all his force  he could not hide the light  which streamed from under it  in an unbroken flood upon the ground
he was conscious of being exhausted  and overcome by an irresistible drowsiness  and  further  of being in his own bed room
he gave the cap a parting squeeze  in which his hand relaxed  and had barely time to reel to bed  before he sank into a heavy sleep
the second of the three spirits awaking in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore  and sitting up in bed to get his thoughts together  scrooge had no occasion to be told that the bell was again upon the stroke of one
he felt that he was restored to consciousness in the right nick of time  for the especial purpose of holding a conference with the second messenger despatched to him through jacob marley s intervention
but  finding that he turned uncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this new spectre would draw back  he put them every one aside with his own hands  and lying down again  established a sharp look out all round the bed
for  he wished to challenge the spirit on the moment of its appearance  and did not wish to be taken by surprise  and made nervous
gentlemen of the free and easy sort  who plume themselves on being acquainted with a move or two  and being usually equal to the time of day  express the wide range of their capacity for adventure by observing that they are good for anything from pitch and toss to manslaughter  between which opposite extremes  no doubt  there lies a tolerably wide and comprehensive range of subjects without venturing for scrooge quite as hardily as this  i don t mind calling on you to believe that he was ready for a good broad field of strange appearances  and that nothing between a baby and rhinoceros would have astonished him very much
now  being prepared for almost anything  he was not by any means prepared for nothing  and  consequently  when the bell struck one  and no shape appeared  he was taken with a violent fit of 46 trembling
five minutes  ten minutes  a quarter of an hour went by  yet nothing came
all this time  he lay upon his bed  the very core and centre of a blaze of ruddy light  which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the hour  and which  being only light  was more alarming than a dozen ghosts  as he was powerless to make out what it meant  or would be at  and was sometimes apprehensive that he might be at that very moment an interesting case of spontaneous combustion  without having the consolation of knowing it
at last  however  he began to think as you or i would have thought at first  for it is always the person not in the predicament who knows what ought to have been done in it  and would unquestionably have done it too at last  i say  he began to think that the source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining room  from whence  on further tracing it  it seemed to shine
this idea taking full possession of his mind  he got up softly and shuffled in his slippers to the door
the moment scrooge s hand was on the lock  a strange voice called him by his name  and bade him enter
he obeyed
it was his own room
there was no doubt about that
but it had undergone a surprising transformation
the walls and ceiling were so hung with living green  that it looked a perfect grove  from every part of which  bright gleaming berries glistened
the crisp leaves of holly  mistletoe  and ivy reflected back the light  as if so many little mirrors had been scattered there  and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney  as that dull petrification of a hearth had never known in scrooge s time  or marley s  or for many and many a winter season gone
heaped up on the floor  to form a kind of throne  were turkeys  geese  game  poultry  brawn  great joints of meat  sucking pigs  long wreaths of sausages  mince pies  plum puddings  barrels of oysters  red hot chestnuts  cherry cheeked apples  juicy oranges  luscious pears  immense twelfth cakes  and seething bowls of punch  that made the chamber dim with their delicious steam
in easy state upon this couch  there sat a jolly giant  glorious to see  who bore a glowing torch  in shape not unlike plenty s horn  and held it up  high up  to shed its light on scrooge  as he came peeping round the door
 come in   exclaimed the ghost
 come in  and know me better  man   scrooge entered timidly  and hung his head before this spirit
he was not the dogged scrooge he had been  and though the spirit s eyes were clear and kind  he did not like to meet them
 i am the ghost of christmas present   said the spirit
 look upon me   scrooge reverently did so
it was clothed in one simple green robe  or mantle  bordered with white fur
this garment hung so loosely on the figure  that its capacious breast was bare  as if disdaining to be warded or concealed by any artifice
its feet  observable beneath the ample folds of the garment  were also bare  and on its head it wore no other covering than a holly wreath  set here and there with shining icicles
its dark brown curls were long and free  free as its genial face  its sparkling eye  its open hand  its cheery voice  its unconstrained demeanour  and its joyful air
girded round its middle was an antique scabbard  but no sword was in it  and the ancient sheath was eaten up with rust
 you have never seen the like of me before   exclaimed the spirit
 never   scrooge made answer to it
 have never walked forth with the younger members of my family  meaning  for i am very young  my elder brothers born in these later years   pursued the phantom
 i don t think i have   said scrooge
 i am afraid i have not
have you had many brothers  spirit    more than eighteen hundred   said the ghost
 a tremendous family to provide for   muttered scrooge
the ghost of christmas present rose
 spirit   said scrooge submissively   conduct me where you will
i went forth last night on compulsion  and i learnt a lesson which is working now
to night  if you have aught to teach me  let me profit by it    touch my robe   scrooge did as he was told  and held it fast
holly  mistletoe  red berries  ivy  turkeys  geese  game  poultry  brawn  meat  pigs  sausages  oysters  pies  puddings  fruit  and punch  all vanished instantly
so did the room  the fire  the ruddy glow  the charles dickens 49 hour of night  and they stood in the city streets on christmas morning  where  for the weather was severe  the people made a rough  but brisk and not unpleasant kind of music  in scraping the snow from the pavement in front of their dwellings  and from the tops of their houses  whence it was mad delight to the boys to see it come plumping down into the road below  and splitting into artificial little snow storms the house fronts looked black enough  and the windows blacker  contrasting with the smooth white sheet of snow upon the roofs  and with the dirtier snow upon the ground  which last deposit had been ploughed up in deep furrows by the heavy wheels of carts and waggons  furrows that crossed and re crossed each other hundreds of times where the great streets branched off  and made intricate channels  hard to trace in the thick yellow mud and icy water
the sky was gloomy  and the shortest streets were choked up with a dingy mist  half thawed  half frozen  whose heavier particles descended in a shower of sooty atoms  as if all the chimneys in great britain had  by one consent  caught fire  and were blazing away to their dear hearts  content there was nothing very cheerful in the climate or the town  and yet was there an air of cheerfulness abroad that the clearest summer air and brightest summer sun might have endeavoured to diffuse in vain
for  the people who were shovelling away on the housetops were jovial and full of glee  calling out to one another from the parapets  and now and then exchanging a facetious snowball better natured missile far than many a wordy jest laughing heartily if it went right and not less heartily if it went wrong
the poulterers  shops were still half open  and the fruiterers  were radiant in their glory
there were great  round  pot bellied baskets of chestnuts  shaped like the waistcoats of jolly old gentlemen  lolling at the doors  and tumbling out into the street in their apoplectic opulence
there were ruddy  brown faced  broad girthed spanish onions  shining in the fatness of their growth like spanish friars  and winking from their shelves in wanton slyness at the girls as they went by  and glanced demurely at the hung up mistletoe
there were pears and apples  clustered high in blooming pyramids  there were bunches of grapes  made  in the 50 shopkeepers  benevolence to dangle from conspicuous hooks  that people s mouths might water gratis as they passed  there were piles of filberts  mossy and brown  recalling  in their fragrance  ancient walks among the woods  and pleasant shufflings ankle deep through withered leaves  there were norfolk biffins  squat and swarthy  setting off the yellow of the oranges and lemons  and  in the great compactness of their juicy persons  urgently entreating and beseeching to be carried home in paper bags and eaten after dinner
the very gold and silver fish  set forth among these choice fruits in a bowl  though members of a dull and stagnant blooded race  appeared to know that there was something going on  and  to a fish  went gasping round and round their little world in slow and passionless excitement
the grocers   oh  the grocers   nearly closed  with perhaps two shutters down  or one  but through those gaps such glimpses  it was not alone that the scales descending on the counter made a merry sound  or that the twine and roller parted company so briskly  or that the canisters were rattled up and down like juggling tricks  or even that the blended scents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose  or even that the raisins were so plentiful and rare  the almonds so extremely white  the sticks of cinnamon so long and straight  the other spices so delicious  the candied fruits so caked and spotted with molten sugar as to make the coldest lookers on feel faint and subsequently bilious
nor was it that the figs were moist and pulpy  or that the french plums blushed in modest tartness from their highlydecorated boxes  or that everything was good to eat and in its christmas dress  but the customers were all so hurried and so eager in the hopeful promise of the day  that they tumbled up against each other at the door  crashing their wicker baskets wildly  and left their purchases upon the counter  and came running back to fetch them  and committed hundreds of the like mistakes  in the best humour possible  while the grocer and his people were so frank and fresh that the polished hearts with which they fastened their aprons behind might have been their own  worn outside for general inspection  and for christmas daws to peck at if they chose charles dickens 51 but soon the steeples called good people all  to church and chapel  and away they came  flocking through the streets in their best clothes  and with their gayest faces and at the same time there emerged from scores of bye streets  lanes  and nameless turnings  innumerable people  carrying their dinners to the bakers  shops
the sight of these poor revellers appeared to interest the spirit very much  for he stood with scrooge beside him in a baker s doorway  and taking off the covers as their bearers passed  sprinkled incense on their dinners from his torch
and it was a very uncommon kind of torch  for once or twice when there were angry words between some dinner carriers who had jostled each other  he shed a few drops of water on them from it  and their good humour was restored directly
for they said  it was a shame to quarrel upon christmas day
and so it was  god love it  so it was  in time the bells ceased  and the bakers were shut up  and yet there was a genial shadowing forth of all these dinners and the progress of their cooking  in the thawed blotch of wet above each baker s oven  where the pavement smoked as if its stones were cooking too
 is there a peculiar flavour in what you sprinkle from your torch   asked scrooge
 there is
my own    would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day   asked scrooge
 to any kindly given
to a poor one most    why to a poor one most   asked scrooge
 because it needs it most    spirit   said scrooge  after a moment s thought   i wonder you  of all the beings in the many worlds about us  should desire to cramp these people s opportunities of innocent enjoyment    i   cried the spirit
 you would deprive them of their means of dining every seventh day  often the only day on which they can be said to dine at all   said scrooge
 wouldn t you    i   cried the spirit
52  you seek to close these places on the seventh day   said scrooge
 and it comes to the same thing    i seek   exclaimed the spirit
 forgive me if i am wrong
it has been done in your name  or at least in that of your family   said scrooge
 there are some upon this earth of yours   returned the spirit   who lay claim to know us  and who do their deeds of passion  pride  ill will  hatred  envy  bigotry  and selfishness in our name  who are as strange to us and all our kith and kin  as if they had never lived
remember that  and charge their doings on themselves  not us   scrooge promised that he would  and they went on  invisible  as they had been before  into the suburbs of the town it was a remarkable quality of the ghost  which scrooge had observed at the baker s   that notwithstanding his gigantic size  he could accommodate himself to any place with ease  and that he stood beneath a low roof quite as gracefully and like a supernatural creature  as it was possible he could have done in any lofty hall and perhaps it was the pleasure the good spirit had in showing off this power of his  or else it was his own kind  generous  hearty nature  and his sympathy with all poor men  that led him straight to scrooge s clerk s  for there he went  and took scrooge with him  holding to his robe  and on the threshold of the door the spirit smiled  and stopped to bless bob cratchit s dwelling with the sprinkling of his torch
think of that  bob had but fifteen  bob  a week himself  he pocketed on saturdays but fifteen copies of his christian name  and yet the ghost of christmas present blessed his four roomed house  then up rose mrs cratchit  cratchit s wife  dressed out but poorly in a twice turned gown  but brave in ribbons  which are cheap and make a goodly show for sixpence  and she laid the cloth  assisted by belinda cratchit  second of her daughters  also brave in ribbons  while master peter cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes  and getting the corners of his monstrous shirt collar  bob s private property  conferred upon his son and heir in honour of the day  into his mouth  rejoiced to find himself so gallantly attired  and yearned to show his linen in the fashionable parks and now two smaller cratchits  boy and girl  came tearing in  screaming that charles dickens 53 outside the baker s they had smelt the goose  and known it for their own  and basking in luxurious thoughts of sage and onion  these young cratchits danced about the table  and exalted master peter cratchit to the skies  while he  not proud  although his collars nearly choked him  blew the fire  until the slow potatoes bubbling up  knocked loudly at the saucepan lid to be let out and peeled  what has ever got your precious father then   said mrs cratchit  and your brother  tiny tim  and martha warn t as late last christmas day by half an hour    here s martha  mother   said a girl  appearing as she spoke  here s martha  mother   cried the two young cratchits
 hurrah  there s such a goose  martha    why  bless your heart alive  my dear  how late you are   said mrs cratchit  kissing her a dozen times  and taking off her shawl and bonnet for her with officious zeal  we d a deal of work to finish up last night   replied the girl   and had to clear away this morning  mother    well  never mind so long as you are come   said mrs cratchit  sit ye down before the fire  my dear  and have a warm  lord bless ye    no  no  there s father coming   cried the two young cratchits  who were everywhere at once
 hide  martha  hide   so martha hid herself  and in came little bob  the father  with at least three feet of comforter exclusive of the fringe  hanging down before him  and his threadbare clothes darned up and brushed  to look seasonable  and tiny tim upon his shoulder
alas for tiny tim  he bore a little crutch  and had his limbs supported by an iron frame   why  where s our martha   cried bob cratchit  looking round
 not coming   said mrs cratchit  not coming   said bob  with a sudden declension in his high spirits  for he had been tim s blood horse all the way from church  and had come home rampant
 not coming upon christmas day   martha didn t like to see him disappointed  if it were only in joke  so she came out prematurely from behind the closet door  and ran into his arms  while the two young cratchits hustled tiny tim  54 and bore him off into the wash house  that he might hear the pudding singing in the copper  and how did little tim behave   asked mrs cratchit  when she had rallied bob on his credulity  and bob had hugged his daughter to his heart s content  as good as gold   said bob   and better
somehow he gets thoughtful  sitting by himself so much  and thinks the strangest things you ever heard he told me  coming home  that he hoped the people saw him in the church  because he was a cripple  and it might be pleasant to them to remember upon christmas day  who made lame beggars walk  and blind men see   bob s voice was tremulous when he told them this  and trembled more when he said that tiny tim was growing strong and hearty
his active little crutch was heard upon the floor  and back came tiny tim before another word was spoken  escorted by his brother and sister to his stool before the fire  and while bob  turning up his cuffs as if  poor fellow  they were capable of being made more shabby compounded some hot mixture in a jug with gin and lemons  and stirred it round and round and put it on the hob to simmer  master peter  and the two ubiquitous young cratchits went to fetch the goose  with which they soon returned in high procession such a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose the rarest of all birds  a feathered phenomenon  to which a black swan was a matter of course and in truth it was something very like it in that house
mrs cratchit made the gravy  ready beforehand in a little saucepan  hissing hot  master peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour  miss belinda sweetened up the apple sauce  martha dusted the hot plates  bob took tiny tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table  the two young cratchits set chairs for everybody  not forgetting themselves  and mounting guard upon their posts  crammed spoons into their mouths  lest they should shriek for goose before their turn came to be helped at last the dishes were set on  and grace was said it was succeeded by a breathless pause  as mrs cratchit  looking slowly all along the carving knife  prepared to plunge it in the breast  but when she did  and when the long expected gush of stuffing issued forth  one murmur of delight arose all round charles dickens 55 the board  and even tiny tim  excited by the two young cratchits  beat on the table with the handle of his knife  and feebly cried hurrah  there never was such a goose bob said he didn t believe there ever was such a goose cooked
its tenderness and flavour  size and cheapness  were the themes of universal admiration
eked out by apple sauce and mashed potatoes  it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family  indeed  as mrs cratchit said with great delight  surveying one small atom of a bone upon the dish   they hadn t ate it all at last  yet every one had had enough  and the youngest cratchits in particular  were steeped in sage and onion to the eyebrows  but now  the plates being changed by miss belinda  mrs cratchit left the room alone too nervous to bear witnesses to take the pudding up and bring it in suppose it should not be done enough  suppose it should break in turning out  suppose somebody should have got over the wall of the back yard  and stolen it  while they were merry with the goose a supposition at which the two young cratchits became livid  all sorts of horrors were supposed hallo  a great deal of steam  the pudding was out of the copper
a smell like a washing day  that was the cloth
a smell like an eating house and a pastrycook s next door to each other  with a laundress s next door to that  that was the pudding  in half a minute mrs cratchit entered flushed  but smiling proudly with the pudding  like a speckled cannon ball  so hard and firm  blazing in half of half a quartern of ignited brandy  and bedight with christmas holly stuck into the top oh  a wonderful pudding  bob cratchit said  and calmly too  that he regarded it as the greatest success achieved by mrs cratchit since their marriage mrs cratchit said that now the weight was off her mind  she would confess she had had her doubts about the quantity of flour everybody had something to say about it  but nobody said or thought it was at all a small pudding for a large family
it would have been flat heresy to do so
any cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a thing
at last the dinner was all done  the cloth was cleared  the hearth swept  and the fire made up
the compound in the jug being tasted  56 and considered perfect  apples and oranges were put upon the table  and a shovel full of chestnuts on the fire
then all the cratchit family drew round the hearth  in what bob cratchit called a circle  meaning half a one  and at bob cratchit s elbow stood the family display of glass
two tumblers  and a custard cup without a handle
these held the hot stuff from the jug  however  as well as golden goblets would have done  and bob served it out with beaming looks  while the chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked noisily
then bob proposed   a merry christmas to us all  my dears
god bless us   which all the family re echoed
 god bless us every one   said tiny tim  the last of all
he sat very close to his father s side upon his little stool
bob held his withered little hand in his  as if he loved the child  and wished to keep him by his side  and dreaded that he might be taken from him
 spirit   said scrooge  with an interest he had never felt before   tell me if tiny tim will live    i see a vacant seat   replied the ghost   in the poor chimneycorner  and a crutch without an owner  carefully preserved
if these shadows remain unaltered by the future  the child will die    no  no   said scrooge
 oh  no  kind spirit  say he will be spared    if these shadows remain unaltered by the future  none other of my race   returned the ghost   will find him here
what then  if he be like to die  he had better do it  and decrease the surplus population   scrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by the spirit  and was overcome with penitence and grief
 man   said the ghost   if man you be in heart  not adamant  forbear that wicked cant until you have discovered what the surplus is  and where it is
will you decide what men shall live  what men shall die  it may be  that in the sight of heaven  you are more worthless and less fit to live than millions like this poor man s child
oh god  to hear the insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life among his hungry brothers in the dust   charles dickens 57 scrooge bent before the ghost s rebuke  and trembling cast his eyes upon the ground
but he raised them speedily  on hearing his own name
 mr scrooge   said bob   i ll give you mr scrooge  the founder of the feast    the founder of the feast indeed   cried mrs cratchit  reddening  i wish i had him here
i d give him a piece of my mind to feast upon  and i hope he d have a good appetite for it    my dear   said bob   the children  christmas day    it should be christmas day  i am sure   said she   on which one drinks the health of such an odious  stingy  hard  unfeeling man as mr scrooge
you know he is  robert  nobody knows it better than you do  poor fellow    my dear   was bob s mild answer   christmas day    i ll drink his health for your sake and the day s   said mrs cratchit   not for his long life to him  a merry christmas and a happy new year  he ll be very merry and very happy  i have no doubt   the children drank the toast after her
it was the first of their proceedings which had no heartiness
tiny tim drank it last of all  but he didn t care twopence for it
scrooge was the ogre of the family
the mention of his name cast a dark shadow on the party  which was not dispelled for full five minutes
after it had passed away  they were ten times merrier than before  from the mere relief of scrooge the baleful being done with
bob cratchit told them how he had a situation in his eye for master peter  which would bring in  if obtained  full five and sixpence weekly
the two young cratchits laughed tremendously at the idea of peter s being a man of business  and peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from between his collars  as if he were deliberating what particular investments he should favour when he came into the receipt of that bewildering income martha  who was a poor apprentice at a milliner s  then told them what kind of work she had to do  and how many hours she worked at a stretch  and how she meant to lie abed to morrow morning for a good long rest  to morrow being a holiday she passed at home also how she had seen a countess 58 and a lord some days before  and how the lord  was much about as tall as peter   at which peter pulled up his collars so high that you couldn t have seen his head if you had been there
all this time the chestnuts and the jug went round and round  and by and bye they had a song  about a lost child travelling in the snow  from tiny tim  who had a plaintive little voice  and sang it very well indeed
there was nothing of high mark in this
they were not a handsome family  they were not well dressed  their shoes were far from being water proof  their clothes were scanty  and peter might have known  and very likely did  the inside of a pawnbroker s
but  they were happy  grateful  pleased with one another  and contented with the time  and when they faded  and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings of the spirit s torch at parting  scrooge had his eye upon them  and especially on tiny tim  until the last
by this time it was getting dark  and snowing pretty heavily  and as scrooge and the spirit went along the streets  the brightness of the roaring fires in kitchens  parlours  and all sorts of rooms  was wonderful here  the flickering of the blaze showed preparations for a cosy dinner  with hot plates baking through and through before the fire  and deep red curtains  ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness
there all the children of the house were running out into the snow to meet their married sisters  brothers  cousins  uncles  aunts  and be the first to greet them
here  again  were shadows on the window blind of guests assembling  and there a group of handsome girls  all hooded and fur booted  and all chattering at once  tripped lightly off to some near neighbour s house  where  woe upon the single man who saw them enter artful witches  well they knew it  in a glow  but  if you had judged from the numbers of people on their way to friendly gatherings  you might have thought that no one was at home to give them welcome when they got there  instead of every house expecting company  and piling up its fires half chimney high
blessings on it  how the ghost exulted  how it bared its breadth of breast  and opened its capacious palm  and floated on  outpouring  with a generous hand  its bright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach  the very lamplighter  who ran on before  dotting the charles dickens 59 dusky street with specks of light  and who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere  laughed out loudly as the spirit passed  though little kenned the lamplighter that he had any company but christmas  and now  without a word of warning from the ghost  they stood upon a bleak and desert moor  where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast about  as though it were the burial place of giants  and water spread itself wheresoever it listed  or would have done so  but for the frost that held it prisoner  and nothing grew but moss and furze  and coarse rank grass
down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery red  which glared upon the desolation for an instant  like a sullen eye  and frowning lower  lower  lower yet  was lost in the thick gloom of darkest night
 what place is this   asked scrooge
 a place where miners live  who labour in the bowels of the earth   returned the spirit
 but they know me
see   a light shone from the window of a hut  and swiftly they advanced towards it
passing through the wall of mud and stone  they found a cheerful company assembled round a glowing fire
an old  old man and woman  with their children and their children s children  and another generation beyond that  all decked out gaily in their holiday attire
the old man  in a voice that seldom rose above the howling of the wind upon the barren waste  was singing them a christmas song it had been a very old song when he was a boy  and from time to time they all joined in the chorus
so surely as they raised their voices  the old man got quite blithe and loud  and so surely as they stopped  his vigour sank again
the spirit did not tarry here  but bade scrooge hold his robe  and passing on above the moor  sped whither  not to sea  to sea
to scrooge s horror  looking back  he saw the last of the land  a frightful range of rocks  behind them  and his ears were deafened by the thundering of water  as it rolled and roared  and raged among the dreadful caverns it had worn  and fiercely tried to undermine the earth
built upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks  some league or so from shore  on which the waters chafed and dashed  the wild year through  there stood a solitary lighthouse
great heaps of sea weed clung to its 60 base  and storm birds born of the wind one might suppose  as seaweed of the water rose and fell about it  like the waves they skimmed
but even here  two men who watched the light had made a fire  that through the loophole in the thick stone wall shed out a ray of brightness on the awful sea
joining their horny hands over the rough table at which they sat  they wished each other merry christmas in their can of grog  and one of them  the elder  too  with his face all damaged and scarred with hard weather  as the figure head of an old ship might be  struck up a sturdy song that was like a gale in itself
again the ghost sped on  above the black and heaving sea on  on until  being far away  as he told scrooge  from any shore  they lighted on a ship
they stood beside the helmsman at the wheel  the look out in the bow  the officers who had the watch  dark  ghostly figures in their several stations  but every man among them hummed a christmas tune  or had a christmas thought  or spoke below his breath to his companion of some bygone christmas day  with homeward hopes belonging to it and every man on board  waking or sleeping  good or bad  had had a kinder word for another on that day than on any day in the year  and had shared to some extent in its festivities  and had remembered those he cared for at a distance  and had known that they delighted to remember him
it was a great surprise to scrooge  while listening to the moaning of the wind  and thinking what a solemn thing it was to move on through the lonely darkness over an unknown abyss  whose depths were secrets as profound as death  it was a great surprise to scrooge  while thus engaged  to hear a hearty laugh
it was a much greater surprise to scrooge to recognise it as his own nephew s and to find himself in a bright  dry  gleaming room  with the spirit standing smiling by his side  and looking at that same nephew with approving affability   ha  ha   laughed scrooge s nephew  ha  ha  ha   if you should happen  by any unlikely chance  to know a man more blest in a laugh than scrooge s nephew  all i can say is  i should like to know him too
introduce him to me  and i ll cultivate his acquaintance
charles dickens 61 it is a fair  even handed  noble adjustment of things  that while there is infection in disease and sorrow  there is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humour
when scrooge s nephew laughed in this way  holding his sides  rolling his head  and twisting his face into the most extravagant contortions  scrooge s niece  by marriage  laughed as heartily as he
and their assembled friends being not a bit behindhand  roared out lustily
 ha  ha  ha  ha  ha  ha    he said that christmas was a humbug  as i live   cried scrooge s nephew
 he believed it too    more shame for him  fred   said scrooge s niece  indignantly
bless those women  they never do anything by halves
they are always in earnest
she was very pretty  exceedingly pretty
with a dimpled  surprised looking  capital face  a ripe little mouth  that seemed made to be kissed as no doubt it was  all kinds of good little dots about her chin  that melted into one another when she laughed  and the sunniest pair of eyes you ever saw in any little creature s head
altogether she was what you would have called provoking  you know  but satisfactory  too
oh  perfectly satisfactory
 he s a comical old fellow   said scrooge s nephew   that s the truth  and not so pleasant as he might be
however  his offences carry their own punishment  and i have nothing to say against him    i m sure he is very rich  fred   hinted scrooge s niece
 at least you always tell me so    what of that  my dear   said scrooge s nephew
 his wealth is of no use to him
he don t do any good with it
he don t make himself comfortable with it he hasn t the satisfaction of thinking  ha  ha  ha  that he is ever going to benefit us with it    i have no patience with him   observed scrooge s niece
scrooge s niece s sisters  and all the other ladies  expressed the same opinion
 oh  i have   said scrooge s nephew
 i am sorry for him  i couldn t be angry with him if i tried
who suffers by his ill whims  himself  always here  he takes it into his head to dislike us  and he 62 won t come and dine with us
what s the consequence  he don t lose much of a dinner    indeed  i think he loses a very good dinner   interrupted scrooge s niece
everybody else said the same  and they must be allowed to have been competent judges  because they had just had dinner  and  with the dessert upon the table  were clustered round the fire  by lamplight
 well  i m very glad to hear it   said scrooge s nephew   because i haven t great faith in these young housekeepers
what do you say  topper   topper had clearly got his eye upon one of scrooge s niece s sisters  for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast  who had no right to express an opinion on the subject whereat scrooge s niece s sister the plump one with the lace tucker  not the one with the roses blushed
 do go on  fred   said scrooge s niece  clapping her hands
 he never finishes what he begins to say  he is such a ridiculous fellow   scrooge s nephew revelled in another laugh  and as it was impossible to keep the infection off  though the plump sister tried hard to do it with aromatic vinegar  his example was unanimously followed
 i was only going to say   said scrooge s nephew   that the consequence of his taking a dislike to us  and not making merry with us  is  as i think  that he loses some pleasant moments  which could do him no harm
i am sure he loses pleasanter companions than he can find in his own thoughts  either in his mouldy old office  or his dusty chambers
i mean to give him the same chance every year  whether he likes it or not  for i pity him
he may rail at christmas till he dies  but he can t help thinking better of it i defy him if he finds me going there  in good temper  year after year  and saying uncle scrooge  how are you  if it only puts him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds  that s something  and i think i shook him yesterday   it was their turn to laugh now at the notion of his shaking scrooge
but being thoroughly good natured  and not much caring what they laughed at  so that they laughed at any rate  he encouraged them in their merriment  and passed the bottle joyously
charles dickens 63 after tea  they had some music
for they were a musical family  and knew what they were about  when they sung a glee or catch  i can assure you  especially topper  who could growl away in the bass like a good one  and never swell the large veins in his forehead  or get red in the face over it
scrooge s niece played well upon the harp  and played among other tunes a simple little air  a mere nothing  you might learn to whistle it in two minutes   which had been familiar to the child who fetched scrooge from the boarding school  as he had been reminded by the ghost of christmas past when this strain of music sounded  all the things that ghost had shown him  came upon his mind  he softened more and more  and thought that if he could have listened to it often  years ago  he might have cultivated the kindnesses of life for his own happiness with his own hands  without resorting to the sexton s spade that buried jacob marley
but they didn t devote the whole evening to music
after a while they played at forfeits  for it is good to be children sometimes  and never better than at christmas  when its mighty founder was a child himself stop  there was first a game at blind man s buff
of course there was
and i no more believe topper was really blind than i believe he had eyes in his boots
my opinion is  that it was a done thing between him and scrooge s nephew  and that the ghost of christmas present knew it
the way he went after that plump sister in the lace tucker  was an outrage on the credulity of human nature
knocking down the fire irons  tumbling over the chairs  bumping against the piano  smothering himself among the curtains  wherever she went  there went he  he always knew where the plump sister was he wouldn t catch anybody else
if you had fallen up against him  as some of them did   on purpose  he would have made a feint of endeavouring to seize you  which would have been an affront to your understanding  and would instantly have sidled off in the direction of the plump sister
she often cried out that it wasn t fair  and it really was not
but when at last  he caught her  when  in spite of all her silken rustlings  and her rapid flutterings past him  he got her into a corner whence there was no escape  then his conduct was the most execrable
for his pretending not to know her  his pretending that it was necessary to touch her head dress  and further to assure himself 64 of her identity by pressing a certain ring upon her finger  and a certain chain about her neck  was vile  monstrous  no doubt she told him her opinion of it  when  another blind man being in office  they were so very confidential together  behind the curtains scrooge s niece was not one of the blind man s buff party  but was made comfortable with a large chair and a footstool  in a snug corner  where the ghost and scrooge were close behind her
but she joined in the forfeits  and loved her love to admiration with all the letters of the alphabet
likewise at the game of how  when  and where  she was very great  and to the secret joy of scrooge s nephew  beat her sisters hollow  though they were sharp girls too  as topper could have told you
there might have been twenty people there  young and old  but they all played  and so did scrooge  for wholly forgetting in the interest he had in what was going on  that his voice made no sound in their ears  he sometimes came out with his guess quite loud  and very often guessed quite right  too  for the sharpest needle  best whitechapel  warranted not to cut in the eye  was not sharper than scrooge  blunt as he took it in his head to be
the ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood  and looked upon him with such favour  that he begged like a boy to be allowed to stay until the guests departed
but this the spirit said could not be done
 here is a new game   said scrooge
 one half hour  spirit  only one   it was a game called yes and no  where scrooge s nephew had to think of something  and the rest must find out what  he only answering to their questions yes or no  as the case was
the brisk fire of questioning to which he was exposed  elicited from him that he was thinking of an animal  a live animal  rather a disagreeable animal  a savage animal  an animal that growled and grunted sometimes  and talked sometimes  and lived in london  and walked about the streets  and wasn t made a show of  and wasn t led by anybody  and didn t live in a menagerie  and was never killed in a market  and was not a horse  or an ass  or a cow  or a bull  or a tiger  or a dog  or a pig  or a cat  or a bear
at every fresh question that was put to him  this nephew burst into a fresh roar of laughter  and was so inexpressibly charles dickens 65 tickled  that he was obliged to get up off the sofa and stamp
at last the plump sister  falling into a similar state  cried out   i have found it out  i know what it is  fred  i know what it is    what is it   cried fred
 it s your uncle scro o o o oge   which it certainly was
admiration was the universal sentiment  though some objected that the reply to  is it a bear   ought to have been  yes   inasmuch as an answer in the negative was sufficient to have diverted their thoughts from mr scrooge  supposing they had ever had any tendency that way
 he has given us plenty of merriment  i am sure   said fred   and it would be ungrateful not to drink his health
here is a glass of mulled wine ready to our hand at the moment  and i say   uncle scrooge      well  uncle scrooge   they cried
 a merry christmas and a happy new year to the old man  whatever he is   said scrooge s nephew
 he wouldn t take it from me  but may he have it  nevertheless
uncle scrooge   uncle scrooge had imperceptibly become so gay and light of heart  that he would have pledged the unconscious company in return  and thanked them in an inaudible speech  if the ghost had given him time
but the whole scene passed off in the breath of the last word spoken by his nephew  and he and the spirit were again upon their travels
much they saw  and far they went  and many homes they visited  but always with a happy end
the spirit stood beside sick beds  and they were cheerful  on foreign lands  and they were close at home  by struggling men  and they were patient in their greater hope  by poverty  and it was rich
in almshouse  hospital  and jail  in misery s every refuge  where vain man in his little brief authority had not made fast the door  and barred the spirit out  he left his blessing  and taught scrooge his precepts it was a long night  if it were only a night  but scrooge had his doubts of this  because the christmas holidays appeared to be condensed into the space of time they passed together
it was strange  too  that while scrooge remained unaltered in his outward form  the 66 ghost grew older  clearly older
scrooge had observed this change  but never spoke of it  until they left a children s twelfth night party  when  looking at the spirit as they stood together in an open place  he noticed that its hair was grey
 are spirits  lives so short   asked scrooge
 my life upon this globe  is very brief   replied the ghost
 it ends to night    to night   cried scrooge
 to night at midnight
hark  the time is drawing near   the chimes were ringing the three quarters past eleven at that moment
 forgive me if i am not justified in what i ask   said scrooge  looking intently at the spirit s robe   but i see something strange  and not belonging to yourself  protruding from your skirts
is it a foot or a claw    it might be a claw  for the flesh there is upon it   was the spirit s sorrowful reply
 look here   from the foldings of its robe  it brought two children  wretched  abject  frightful  hideous  miserable they knelt down at its feet  and clung upon the outside of its garment
 oh  man  look here
look  look  down here   exclaimed the ghost
they were a boy and girl
yellow  meagre  ragged  scowling  wolfish  but prostrate  too  in their humility
where graceful youth should have filled their features out  and touched them with its freshest tints  a stale and shrivelled hand  like that of age  had pinched  and twisted them  and pulled them into shreds
where angels might have sat enthroned  devils lurked  and glared out menacing
no change  no degradation  no perversion of humanity  in any grade  through all the mysteries of wonderful creation  has monsters half so horrible and dread
scrooge started back  appalled
having them shown to him in this way  he tried to say they were fine children  but the words choked themselves  rather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude  spirit  are they yours   scrooge could say no more
 they are man s   said the spirit  looking down upon them
 and they cling to me  appealing from their fathers
this boy is ignorance
this girl is want
beware them both  and all of their degree  but most of all beware this boy  for on his brow i see that written which is doom  unless the writing be erased
deny it   cried the spirit  stretching out its hand towards the city  slander those who tell it ye  admit it for your factious purposes  and make it worse
and abide the end    have they no refuge or resource   cried scrooge
 are there no prisons   said the spirit  turning on him for the last time with his own words
 are there no workhouses   68 the bell struck twelve
scrooge looked about him for the ghost  and saw it not
as the last stroke ceased to vibrate  he remembered the prediction of old jacob marley  and lifting up his eyes  beheld a solemn phantom  draped and hooded  coming  like a mist along the ground  towards him
69 the last of the spirits the phantom slowly  gravely  silently approached
when it came near him  scrooge bent down upon his knee  for in the very air through which this spirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery
it was shrouded in a deep black garment  which concealed its head  its face  its form  and left nothing of it visible save one outstretched hand but for this it would have been difficult to detach its figure from the night  and separate it from the darkness by which it was surrounded
he felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him  and that its mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread
he knew no more  for the spirit neither spoke nor moved
 i am in the presence of the ghost of christmas yet to come   said scrooge
the spirit answered not  but pointed onward with its hand
 you are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened  but will happen in the time before us   scrooge pursued
 is that so  spirit   the upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its folds  as if the spirit had inclined its head
that was the only answer he received
although well used to ghostly company by this time  scrooge feared the silent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him  and he found that he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it
70 the spirit paused a moment  as observing his condition  and giving him time to recover
but scrooge was all the worse for this
it thrilled him with a vague uncertain horror  to know that behind the dusky shroud  there were ghostly eyes intently fixed upon him  while he  though he stretched his own to the utmost  could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great heap of black  ghost of the future   he exclaimed   i fear you more than any spectre i have seen
but as i know your purpose is to do me good  and as i hope to live to be another man from what i was  i am prepared to bear you company  and do it with a thankful heart
will you not speak to me   it gave him no reply
the hand was pointed straight before them
 lead on   said scrooge
 lead on  the night is waning fast  and it is precious time to me  i know
lead on  spirit   the phantom moved away as it had come towards him
scrooge followed in the shadow of its dress  which bore him up  he thought  and carried him along
they scarcely seemed to enter the city  for the city rather seemed to spring up about them  and encompass them of its own act
but there they were  in the heart of it  on  change  amongst the merchants  who hurried up and down  and chinked the money in their pockets  and conversed in groups  and looked at their watches  and trifled thoughtfully with their great gold seals  and so forth  as scrooge had seen them often
the spirit stopped beside one little knot of business men
observing that the hand was pointed to them  scrooge advanced to listen to their talk
 no   said a great fat man with a monstrous chin   i don t know much about it  either way
i only know he s dead    when did he die   inquired another
 last night  i believe    why  what was the matter with him   asked a third  taking a vast quantity of snuff out of a very large snuff box
 i thought he d never die    god knows   said the first  with a yawn
charles dickens 71  what has he done with his money   asked a red faced gentleman with a pendulous excrescence on the end of his nose  that shook like the gills of a turkey cock
 i haven t heard   said the man with the large chin  yawning again
 left it to his company  perhaps
he hasn t left it to me
that s all i know   this pleasantry was received with a general laugh
 it s likely to be a very cheap funeral   said the same speaker   for upon my life i don t know of anybody to go to it
suppose we make up a party and volunteer    i don t mind going if a lunch is provided   observed the gentleman with the excrescence on his nose
 but i must be fed  if i make one   another laugh
 well  i am the most disinterested among you  after all   said the first speaker   for i never wear black gloves  and i never eat lunch
but i ll offer to go  if anybody else will
when i come to think of it  i m not at all sure that i wasn t his most particular friend  for we used to stop and speak whenever we met
bye  bye   speakers and listeners strolled away  and mixed with other groups
scrooge knew the men  and looked towards the spirit for an explanation
the phantom glided on into a street
its finger pointed to two persons meeting
scrooge listened again  thinking that the explanation might lie here
he knew these men  also  perfectly
they were men of business  very wealthy  and of great importance
he had made a point always of standing well in their esteem  in a business point of view  that is  strictly in a business point of view
 how are you   said one
 how are you   returned the other
 well   said the first
 old scratch has got his own at last  hey    so i am told   returned the second
 cold  isn t it    seasonable for christmas time
you re not a skater  i suppose    no
no
something else to think of
good morning   72 not another word
that was their meeting  their conversation  and their parting
scrooge was at first inclined to be surprised that the spirit should attach importance to conversations apparently so trivial  but feeling assured that they must have some hidden purpose  he set himself to consider what it was likely to be they could scarcely be supposed to have any bearing on the death of jacob  his old partner  for that was past  and this ghost s province was the future
nor could he think of any one immediately connected with himself  to whom he could apply them but nothing doubting that to whomsoever they applied they had some latent moral for his own improvement  he resolved to treasure up every word he heard  and everything he saw  and especially to observe the shadow of himself when it appeared for he had an expectation that the conduct of his future self would give him the clue he missed  and would render the solution of these riddles easy
he looked about in that very place for his own image  but another man stood in his accustomed corner  and though the clock pointed to his usual time of day for being there  he saw no likeness of himself among the multitudes that poured in through the porch it gave him little surprise  however  for he had been revolving in his mind a change of life  and thought and hoped he saw his new born resolutions carried out in this
quiet and dark  beside him stood the phantom  with its outstretched hand when he roused himself from his thoughtful quest  he fancied from the turn of the hand  and its situation in reference to himself  that the unseen eyes were looking at him keenly it made him shudder  and feel very cold
they left the busy scene  and went into an obscure part of the town  where scrooge had never penetrated before  although he recognised its situation  and its bad repute
the ways were foul and narrow  the shops and houses wretched  the people half naked  drunken  slipshod  ugly alleys and archways  like so many cesspools  disgorged their offences of smell  and dirt  and life  upon the straggling streets  and the whole quarter reeked with crime  with filth  and misery
charles dickens 73 far in this den of infamous resort  there was a low browed  beetling shop  below a pent house roof  where iron  old rags  bottles  bones  and greasy offal  were bought
upon the floor within  were piled up heaps of rusty keys  nails  chains  hinges  files  scales  weights  and refuse iron of all kinds
secrets that few would like to scrutinise were bred and hidden in mountains of unseemly rags  masses of corrupted fat  and sepulchres of bones
sitting in among the wares he dealt in  by a charcoal stove  made of old bricks  was a greyhaired rascal  nearly seventy years of age  who had screened himself from the cold air without  by a frousy curtaining of miscellaneous tatters  hung upon a line  and smoked his pipe in all the luxury of calm retirement scrooge and the phantom came into the presence of this man  just as a woman with a heavy bundle slunk into the shop
but she had scarcely entered  when another woman  similarly laden  came in too  and she was closely followed by a man in faded black  who was no less startled by the sight of them  than they had been upon the recognition of each other
after a short period of blank astonishment  in which the old man with the pipe had joined them  they all three burst into a laugh
 let the charwoman alone to be the first   cried she who had entered first
 let the laundress alone to be the second  and let the undertaker s man alone to be the third
look here  old joe  here s a chance  if we haven t all three met here without meaning it    you couldn t have met in a better place   said old joe  removing his pipe from his mouth
 come into the parlour
you were made free of it long ago  you know  and the other two an t strangers
stop till i shut the door of the shop
ah  how it skreeks  there an t such a rusty bit of metal in the place as its own hinges  i believe  and i m sure there s no such old bones here  as mine
ha  ha  we re all suitable to our calling  we re well matched
come into the parlour
come into the parlour   the parlour was the space behind the screen of rags
the old man raked the fire together with an old stair rod  and having trimmed his smoky lamp  for it was night   with the stem of his pipe  put it in his mouth again
74 while he did this  the woman who had already spoken threw her bundle on the floor  and sat down in a flaunting manner on a stool  crossing her elbows on her knees  and looking with a bold defiance at the other two
 what odds then  what odds  mrs dilber   said the woman  every person has a right to take care of themselves he always did    that s true  indeed   said the laundress
 no man more so    why then  don t stand staring as if you was afraid  woman  who s the wiser  we re not going to pick holes in each other s coats  i suppose    no  indeed   said mrs dilber and the man together  we should hope not    very well  then   cried the woman
 that s enough
who s the worse for the loss of a few things like these  not a dead man  i suppose    no  indeed   said mrs dilber  laughing  if he wanted to keep  em after he was dead  a wicked old screw   pursued the woman   why wasn t he natural in his lifetime  if he had been  he d have had somebody to look after him when he was struck with death  instead of lying gasping out his last there  alone by himself    it s the truest word that ever was spoke   said mrs dilber  it s a judgment on him    i wish it was a little heavier judgment   replied the woman   and it should have been  you may depend upon it  if i could have laid my hands on anything else open that bundle  old joe  and let me know the value of it
speak out plain
i m not afraid to be the first  nor afraid for them to see it
we knew pretty well that we were helping ourselves  before we met here  i believe
it s no sin
open the bundle  joe   but the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this  and the man in faded black  mounting the breach first  produced his plunder
it was not extensive
a seal or two  a pencil case  a pair of sleevebuttons  and a brooch of no great value  were all
they were severally examined and appraised by old joe  who chalked the sums he was charles dickens 75 disposed to give for each  upon the wall  and added them up into a total when he found there was nothing more to come  that s your account   said joe   and i wouldn t give another sixpence  if i was to be boiled for not doing it
who s next   mrs dilber was next sheets and towels  a little wearing apparel  two old fashioned silver teaspoons  a pair of sugar tongs  and a few boots
her account was stated on the wall in the same manner
 i always give too much to ladies
it s a weakness of mine  and that s the way i ruin myself   said old joe
 that s your account
if you asked me for another penny  and made it an open question  i d repent of being so liberal and knock off half a crown    and now undo my bundle  joe   said the first woman
joe went down on his knees for the greater convenience of opening it  and having unfastened a great many knots  dragged out a large and heavy roll of some dark stuff
 what do you call this   said joe
 bed curtains    ah   returned the woman  laughing and leaning forward on her crossed arms  bed curtains    you don t mean to say you took  em down  rings and all  with him lying there   said joe
 yes i do   replied the woman
 why not    you were born to make your fortune   said joe   and you ll certainly do it    i certainly shan t hold my hand  when i can get anything in it by reaching it out  for the sake of such a man as he was  i promise you  joe   returned the woman coolly
 don t drop that oil upon the blankets  now    his blankets   asked joe
 whose else s do you think   replied the woman
 he isn t likely to take cold without  em  i dare say    i hope he didn t die of anything catching  eh   said old joe  stopping in his work  and looking up
 don t you be afraid of that   returned the woman
 i an t so fond of his company that i d loiter about him for such things  if he did
ah  you may look through that shirt till your eyes ache  but you 76 won t find a hole in it  nor a threadbare place
it s the best he had  and a fine one too
they d have wasted it  if it hadn t been for me    what do you call wasting of it   asked old joe
 putting it on him to be buried in  to be sure   replied the woman with a laugh
 somebody was fool enough to do it  but i took it off again
if calico an t good enough for such a purpose  it isn t good enough for anything
it s quite as becoming to the body
he can t look uglier than he did in that one   scrooge listened to this dialogue in horror
as they sat grouped about their spoil  in the scanty light afforded by the old man s lamp  he viewed them with a detestation and disgust  which could hardly have been greater  though they had been obscene demons  marketing the corpse itself
 ha  ha   laughed the same woman  when old joe  producing a flannel bag with money in it  told out their several gains upon the ground
 this is the end of it  you see  he frightened every one away from him when he was alive  to profit us when he was dead  ha  ha  ha    spirit   said scrooge  shuddering from head to foot
 i see  i see
the case of this unhappy man might be my own
my life tends that way  now
merciful heaven  what is this   he recoiled in terror  for the scene had changed  and now he almost touched a bed  a bare  uncurtained bed  on which  beneath a ragged sheet  there lay a something covered up  which  though it was dumb  announced itself in awful language
the room was very dark  too dark to be observed with any accuracy  though scrooge glanced round it in obedience to a secret impulse  anxious to know what kind of room it was
a pale light  rising in the outer air  fell straight upon the bed  and on it  plundered and bereft  unwatched  unwept  uncared for  was the body of this man
scrooge glanced towards the phantom
its steady hand was pointed to the head
the cover was so carelessly adjusted that the slightest raising of it  the motion of a finger upon scrooge s part  would have disclosed the face
he thought of it  felt how easy it would be to do  and longed to do it  but had no more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss the spectre at his side
charles dickens 77 oh cold  cold  rigid  dreadful death  set up thine altar here  and dress it with such terrors as thou hast at thy command  for this is thy dominion  but of the loved  revered  and honoured head  thou canst not turn one hair to thy dread purposes  or make one feature odious
it is not that the hand is heavy and will fall down when released  it is not that the heart and pulse are still  but that the hand was open  generous  and true  the heart brave  warm  and tender  and the pulse a man s
strike  shadow  strike  and see his good deeds springing from the wound  to sow the world with life immortal  no voice pronounced these words in scrooge s ears  and yet he heard them when he looked upon the bed
he thought  if this man could be raised up now  what would be his foremost thoughts  avarice  hard dealing  griping cares  they have brought him to a rich end  truly  he lay  in the dark empty house  with not a man  a woman  or a child  to say that he was kind to me in this or that  and for the memory of one kind word i will be kind to him
a cat was tearing at the door  and there was a sound of gnawing rats beneath the hearth stone
what they wanted in the room of death  and why they were so restless and disturbed  scrooge did not dare to think
 spirit   he said   this is a fearful place
in leaving it  i shall not leave its lesson  trust me
let us go   still the ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the head
 i understand you   scrooge returned   and i would do it  if i could
but i have not the power  spirit
i have not the power   again it seemed to look upon him
 if there is any person in the town  who feels emotion caused by this man s death   said scrooge quite agonised   show that person to me  spirit  i beseech you   the phantom spread its dark robe before him for a moment  like a wing  and withdrawing it  revealed a room by daylight  where a mother and her children were
she was expecting some one  and with anxious eagerness  for she walked up and down the room  started at every sound  looked out from the window  glanced at the clock  tried  but in vain  to work with 78 her needle  and could hardly bear the voices of the children in their play
at length the long expected knock was heard
she hurried to the door  and met her husband  a man whose face was careworn and depressed  though he was young
there was a remarkable expression in it now  a kind of serious delight of which he felt ashamed  and which he struggled to repress
he sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for him by the fire  and when she asked him faintly what news  which was not until after a long silence   he appeared embarrassed how to answer
 is it good   she said   or bad   to help him
 bad   he answered
 we are quite ruined    no
there is hope yet  caroline    if he relents   she said  amazed   there is  nothing is past hope  if such a miracle has happened    he is past relenting   said her husband
 he is dead   she was a mild and patient creature if her face spoke truth  but she was thankful in her soul to hear it  and she said so  with clasped hands
she prayed forgiveness the next moment  and was sorry  but the first was the emotion of her heart
 what the half drunken woman whom i told you of last night  said to me  when i tried to see him and obtain a week s delay  and what i thought was a mere excuse to avoid me  turns out to have been quite true
he was not only very ill  but dying  then    to whom will our debt be transferred    i don t know
but before that time we shall be ready with the money  and even though we were not  it would be a bad fortune indeed to find so merciless a creditor in his successor
we may sleep to night with light hearts  caroline   yes
soften it as they would  their hearts were lighter
the children s faces  hushed and clustered round to hear what they so little understood  were brighter  and it was a happier house for this man s death  the only emotion that the ghost could show him  caused by the event  was one of pleasure
charles dickens 79  let me see some tenderness connected with a death   said scrooge   or that dark chamber  spirit  which we left just now  will be for ever present to me   the ghost conducted him through several streets familiar to his feet  and as they went along  scrooge looked here and there to find himself  but nowhere was he to be seen they entered poor bob cratchit s house  the dwelling he had visited before  and found the mother and the children seated round the fire
quiet
very quiet
the noisy little cratchits were as still as statues in one corner  and sat looking up at peter  who had a book before him
the mother and her daughters were engaged in sewing
but surely they were very quiet     and he took a child  and set him in the midst of them     where had scrooge heard those words  he had not dreamed them
the boy must have read them out  as he and the spirit crossed the threshold
why did he not go on  the mother laid her work upon the table  and put her hand up to her face
 the colour hurts my eyes   she said
the colour  ah  poor tiny tim   they re better now again   said cratchit s wife
 it makes them weak by candle light  and i wouldn t show weak eyes to your father when he comes home  for the world
it must be near his time    past it rather   peter answered  shutting up his book
 but i think he has walked a little slower than he used  these few last evenings  mother   they were very quiet again
at last she said  and in a steady  cheerful voice  that only faltered once   i have known him walk with i have known him walk with tiny tim upon his shoulder  very fast indeed    and so have i   cried peter
 often    and so have i   exclaimed another
so had all
 but he was very light to carry   she resumed  intent upon her work   and his father loved him so  that it was no trouble  no trouble
and there is your father at the door   80 she hurried out to meet him  and little bob in his comforter he had need of it  poor fellow came in
his tea was ready for him on the hob  and they all tried who should help him to it most
then the two young cratchits got upon his knees and laid  each child a little cheek  against his face  as if they said   don t mind it  father
don t be grieved   bob was very cheerful with them  and spoke pleasantly to all the family
he looked at the work upon the table  and praised the industry and speed of mrs cratchit and the girls they would be done long before sunday  he said
 sunday  you went to day  then  robert   said his wife
 yes  my dear   returned bob
 i wish you could have gone
it would have done you good to see how green a place it is
but you ll see it often
i promised him that i would walk there on a sunday
my little  little child   cried bob
 my little child   he broke down all at once
he couldn t help it
if he could have helped it  he and his child would have been farther apart perhaps than they were
he left the room  and went up stairs into the room above  which was lighted cheerfully  and hung with christmas
there was a chair set close beside the child  and there were signs of some one having been there  lately
poor bob sat down in it  and when he had thought a little and composed himself  he kissed the little face he was reconciled to what had happened  and went down again quite happy
they drew about the fire  and talked  the girls and mother working still
bob told them of the extraordinary kindness of mr scrooge s nephew  whom he had scarcely seen but once  and who  meeting him in the street that day  and seeing that he looked a little   just a little down you know   said bob  inquired what had happened to distress him
 on which   said bob   for he is the pleasantestspoken gentleman you ever heard  i told him
 i am heartily sorry for it  mr cratchit   he said   and heartily sorry for your good wife   by the bye  how he ever knew that  i don t know    knew what  my dear    why  that you were a good wife   replied bob
 everybody knows that   said peter
charles dickens 81  very well observed  my boy   cried bob
 i hope they do
 heartily sorry   he said   for your good wife
if i can be of service to you in any way   he said  giving me his card   that s where i live
pray come to me   now  it wasn t   cried bob   for the sake of anything he might be able to do for us  so much as for his kind way  that this was quite delightful
it really seemed as if he had known our tiny tim  and felt with us    i m sure he s a good soul   said mrs cratchit  you would be surer of it  my dear   returned bob   if you saw and spoke to him
i shouldn t be at all surprised mark what i say   if he got peter a better situation    only hear that  peter   said mrs cratchit  and then   cried one of the girls   peter will be keeping company with some one  and setting up for himself    get along with you   retorted peter  grinning  it s just as likely as not   said bob   one of these days  though there s plenty of time for that  my dear
but however and whenever we part from one another  i am sure we shall none of us forget poor tiny tim shall we or this first parting that there was among us    never  father   cried they all
 and i know   said bob   i know  my dears  that when we recollect how patient and how mild he was  although he was a little  little child  we shall not quarrel easily among ourselves  and forget poor tiny tim in doing it    no  never  father   they all cried again
 i am very happy   said little bob   i am very happy   mrs cratchit kissed him  his daughters kissed him  the two young cratchits kissed him  and peter and himself shook hands spirit of tiny tim  thy childish essence was from god   spectre   said scrooge   something informs me that our parting moment is at hand i know it  but i know not how tell me what man that was whom we saw lying dead   the ghost of christmas yet to come conveyed him  as before though at a different time  he thought  indeed  there seemed no order in these latter visions  save that they were in the future into the resorts of business men  but showed him not himself indeed  the 82 spirit did not stay for anything  but went straight on  as to the end just now desired  until besought by scrooge to tarry for a moment
 this court   said scrooge   through which we hurry now  is where my place of occupation is  and has been for a length of time
i see the house
let me behold what i shall be  in days to come   the spirit stopped  the hand was pointed elsewhere
 the house is yonder   scrooge exclaimed
 why do you point away   the inexorable finger underwent no change
scrooge hastened to the window of his office  and looked in
it was an office still  but not his
the furniture was not the same  and the figure in the chair was not himself the phantom pointed as before
he joined it once again  and wondering why and whither he had gone  accompanied it until they reached an iron gate
he paused to look round before entering
a churchyard
here  then  the wretched man whose name he had now to learn  lay underneath the ground it was a worthy place
walled in by houses  overrun by grass and weeds  the growth of vegetation s death  not life  choked up with too much burying  fat with repleted appetite
a worthy place  the spirit stood among the graves  and pointed down to one
he advanced towards it trembling
the phantom was exactly as it had been  but he dreaded that he saw new meaning in its solemn shape
 before i draw nearer to that stone to which you point   said scrooge   answer me one question
are these the shadows of the things that will be  or are they shadows of things that may be  only   still the ghost pointed downward to the grave by which it stood
 men s courses will foreshadow certain ends  to which  if persevered in  they must lead   said scrooge
 but if the courses be departed from  the ends will change
say it is thus with what you show me   the spirit was immovable as ever
scrooge crept towards it  trembling as he went  and following the finger  read upon the stone of the neglected grave his own name  ebenezer scrooge
 am i that man who lay upon the bed   he cried  upon his knees
the finger pointed from the grave to him  and back again
 no  spirit  oh no  no   the finger still was there
 spirit   he cried  tight clutching at its robe   hear me  i am not the man i was
i will not be the man i must have been but for this intercourse
why show me this  if i am past all hope   for the first time the hand appeared to shake
 good spirit   he pursued  as down upon the ground he fell before it   your nature intercedes for me  and pities me
assure me that i yet may change these shadows you have shown me  by an altered life   the kind hand trembled
 i will honour christmas in my heart  and try to keep it all the year
i will live in the past  the present  and the future
the spirits of all three shall strive within me
i will not shut out the lessons that they teach
oh  tell me i may sponge away the writing on this stone   in his agony  he caught the spectral hand
it sought to free itself  but he was strong in his entreaty  and detained it
the spirit  stronger yet  repulsed him
holding up his hands in a last prayer to have his fate reversed  he saw an alteration in the phantom s hood and dress
it shrunk  collapsed  and dwindled down into a bedpost
85 the end of it yes  and the bedpost was his own
the bed was his own  the room was his own
best and happiest of all  the time before him was his own  to make amends in   i will live in the past  the present  and the future   scrooge repeated  as he scrambled out of bed
 the spirits of all three shall strive within me
oh jacob marley  heaven  and the christmas time be praised for this  i say it on my knees  old jacob  on my knees   he was so fluttered and so glowing with his good intentions  that his broken voice would scarcely answer to his call
he had been sobbing violently in his conflict with the spirit  and his face was wet with tears
 they are not torn down   cried scrooge  folding one of his bedcurtains in his arms   they are not torn down  rings and all they are here i am here the shadows of the things that would have been  may be dispelled
they will be
i know they will   his hands were busy with his garments all this time  turning them inside out  putting them on upside down  tearing them  mislaying them  making them parties to every kind of extravagance
 i don t know what to do   cried scrooge  laughing and crying in the same breath  and making a perfect laocoön of himself with his stockings  i am as light as a feather  i am as happy as an angel  i am as merry as a schoolboy
i am as giddy as a drunken man
a merry christmas to everybody  a happy new year to all the world
hallo here  whoop  hallo   86 he had frisked into the sitting room  and was now standing there  perfectly winded
 there s the saucepan that the gruel was in   cried scrooge  starting off again  and going round the fireplace
 there s the door  by which the ghost of jacob marley entered  there s the corner where the ghost of christmas present  sat  there s the window where i saw the wandering spirits  it s all right  it s all true  it all happened
ha ha ha   really  for a man who had been out of practice for so many years  it was a splendid laugh  a most illustrious laugh
the father of a long  long line of brilliant laughs   i don t know what day of the month it is   said scrooge
 i don t know how long i ve been among the spirits
i don t know anything
i m quite a baby
never mind
i don t care
i d rather be a baby
hallo  whoop  hallo here   he was checked in his transports by the churches ringing out the lustiest peals he had ever heard
clash  clang  hammer  ding  dong  bell
bell  dong  ding  hammer  clang  clash  oh  glorious  glorious  running to the window  he opened it  and put out his head
no fog  no mist  clear  bright  jovial  stirring  cold  cold  piping for the blood to dance to  golden sunlight  heavenly sky  sweet fresh air  merry bells
oh  glorious  glorious   what s to day   cried scrooge  calling downward to a boy in sunday clothes  who perhaps had loitered in to look about him
 eh   returned the boy  with all his might of wonder
 what s to day  my fine fellow   said scrooge
 to day   replied the boy
 why  christmas day    it s christmas day   said scrooge to himself  i haven t missed it
the spirits have done it all in one night
they can do anything they like
of course they can
of course they can
hallo  my fine fellow    hallo   returned the boy
 do you know the poulterer s  in the next street but one  at the corner   scrooge inquired
 i should hope i did   replied the lad
charles dickens 87  an intelligent boy   said scrooge
 a remarkable boy  do you know whether they ve sold the prize turkey that was hanging up there  not the little prize turkey  the big one    what  the one as big as me   returned the boy
 what a delightful boy   said scrooge
 it s a pleasure to talk to him
yes  my buck    it s hanging there now   replied the boy
 is it   said scrooge
 go and buy it    walk er   exclaimed the boy
 no  no   said scrooge   i am in earnest
go and buy it  and tell  em to bring it here  that i may give them the direction where to take it
come back with the man  and i ll give you a shilling
come back with him in less than five minutes and i ll give you half a crown   the boy was off like a shot
he must have had a steady hand at a trigger who could have got a shot off half so fast
 i ll send it to bob cratchit s   whispered scrooge  rubbing his hands  and splitting with a laugh
 he sha n t know who sends it
it s twice the size of tiny tim
joe miller never made such a joke as sending it to bob s will be   the hand in which he wrote the address was not a steady one  but write it he did  somehow  and went down stairs to open the street door  ready for the coming of the poulterer s man
as he stood there  waiting his arrival  the knocker caught his eye
 i shall love it  as long as i live   cried scrooge  patting it with his hand
 i scarcely ever looked at it before
what an honest expression it has in its face  it s a wonderful knocker  here s the turkey  hallo  whoop  how are you  merry christmas   it was a turkey  he never could have stood upon his legs  that bird
he would have snapped  em short off in a minute  like sticks of sealing wax
 why  it s impossible to carry that to camden town   said scrooge
 you must have a cab   the chuckle with which he said this  and the chuckle with which he paid for the turkey  and the chuckle with which he paid for the cab  and the chuckle with which he recompensed the boy  were only 88 to be exceeded by the chuckle with which he sat down breathless in his chair again  and chuckled till he cried
shaving was not an easy task  for his hand continued to shake very much  and shaving requires attention  even when you don t dance while you are at it
but if he had cut the end of his nose off  he would have put a piece of sticking plaister over it  and been quite satisfied
he dressed himself  all in his best   and at last got out into the streets the people were by this time pouring forth  as he had seen them with the ghost of christmas present  and walking with his hands behind him  scrooge regarded every one with a delighted smile
he looked so irresistibly pleasant  in a word  that three or four goodhumoured fellows said   good morning  sir  a merry christmas to you   and scrooge said often afterwards  that of all the blithe sounds he had ever heard  those were the blithest in his ears
he had not gone far  when coming on towards him he beheld the portly gentleman  who had walked into his counting house the day before  and said   scrooge and marley s  i believe   it sent a pang across his heart to think how this old gentleman would look upon him when they met  but he knew what path lay straight before him  and he took it
 my dear sir   said scrooge  quickening his pace  and taking the old gentleman by both his hands
 how do you do  i hope you succeeded yesterday
it was very kind of you
a merry christmas to you  sir    mr scrooge    yes   said scrooge
 that is my name  and i fear it may not be pleasant to you
allow me to ask your pardon
and will you have the goodness  here scrooge whispered in his ear
 lord bless me   cried the gentleman  as if his breath were taken away
 my dear mr scrooge  are you serious    if you please   said scrooge
 not a farthing less
a great many back payments are included in it  i assure you
will you do me that favour    my dear sir   said the other  shaking hands with him
 i don t know what to say to such munifi   charles dickens 89  don t say anything  please   retorted scrooge
 come and see me
will you come and see me    i will   cried the old gentleman
and it was clear he meant to do it
 thank ee   said scrooge
 i am much obliged to you
i thank you fifty times
bless you   he went to church  and walked about the streets  and watched the people hurrying to and fro  and patted children on the head  and questioned beggars  and looked down into the kitchens of houses  and up to the windows  and found that everything could yield him pleasure
he had never dreamed that any walk that anything could give him so much happiness
in the afternoon he turned his steps towards his nephew s house
he passed the door a dozen times  before he had the courage to go up and knock
but he made a dash  and did it   is your master at home  my dear   said scrooge to the girl
nice girl  very
 yes  sir    where is he  my love   said scrooge
 he s in the dining room  sir  along with mistress
i ll show you up stairs  if you please    thank ee
he knows me   said scrooge  with his hand already on the dining room lock
 i ll go in here  my dear   he turned it gently  and sidled his face in  round the door
they were looking at the table  which was spread out in great array   for these young housekeepers are always nervous on such points  and like to see that everything is right
 fred   said scrooge
dear heart alive  how his niece by marriage started  scrooge had forgotten  for the moment  about her sitting in the corner with the footstool  or he wouldn t have done it  on any account
 why bless my soul   cried fred   who s that    it s i
your uncle scrooge
i have come to dinner
will you let me in  fred   let him in  it is a mercy he didn t shake his arm off
he was at home in five minutes
nothing could be heartier
his niece looked just 90 the same
so did topper when he came
so did the plump sister when she came
so did every one when they came
wonderful party  wonderful games  wonderful unanimity  won der ful happiness  but he was early at the office next morning
oh  he was early there
if he could only be there first  and catch bob cratchit coming late  that was the thing he had set his heart upon
and he did it  yes  he did  the clock struck nine
no bob
a quarter past
no bob
he was full eighteen minutes and a half behind his time
scrooge sat with his door wide open  that he might see him come into the tank
his hat was off  before he opened the door  his comforter too
he was on his stool in a jiffy  driving away with his pen  as if he were trying to overtake nine o clock
 hallo   growled scrooge  in his accustomed voice  as near as he could feign it
 what do you mean by coming here at this time of day    i am very sorry  sir   said bob
 i am behind my time    you are   repeated scrooge
 yes
i think you are
step this way  sir  if you please    it s only once a year  sir   pleaded bob  appearing from the tank
 it shall not be repeated
i was making rather merry yesterday  sir    now  i ll tell you what  my friend   said scrooge   i am not going to stand this sort of thing any longer
and therefore   he continued  leaping from his stool  and giving bob such a dig in the waistcoat that he staggered back into the tank again   and therefore i am about to raise your salary   bob trembled  and got a little nearer to the ruler
he had a momentary idea of knocking scrooge down with it  holding him  and calling to the people in the court for help and a strait waistcoat
 a merry christmas  bob   said scrooge  with an earnestness that could not be mistaken  as he clapped him on the back
 a merrier christmas  bob  my good fellow  than i have given you for many a year  i ll raise your salary  and endeavour to assist your struggling family  and we will discuss your affairs this very afternoon  over a charles dickens 91 christmas bowl of smoking bishop  bob  make up the fires  and buy another coal scuttle before you dot another i  bob cratchit   scrooge was better than his word
he did it all  and infinitely more  and to tiny tim  who did not die  he was a second father
he became as good a friend  as good a master  and as good a man  as the good old city knew  or any other good old city  town  or borough  in the good old world
some people laughed to see the alteration in him  but he let them laugh  and little heeded them  for he was wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this globe  for good  at which some people did not have their fill of laughter in the outset  and knowing that such as these would be blind anyway  he thought it quite 92 as well that they should wrinkle up their eyes in grins  as have the malady in less attractive forms his own heart laughed  and that was quite enough for him
he had no further intercourse with spirits  but lived upon the total abstinence principle  ever afterwards  and it was always said of him  that he knew how to keep christmas well  if any man alive possessed the knowledge
may that be truly said of us  and all of us  and so  as tiny tim observed  god bless us  every one
