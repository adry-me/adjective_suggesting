happy families are all alike  every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way
everything was in confusion in the oblonskys  house
the wife had discovered that the husband was carrying on an intrigue with a french girl  who had been a governess in their family  and she had announced to her husband that she could not go on living in the same house with him
this position of affairs had now lasted three days  and not only the husband and wife themselves  but all the members of their family and household  were painfully conscious of it every person in the house felt that there was so sense in their living together  and that the stray people brought together by chance in any inn had more in common with one another than they  the members of the family and household of the oblonskys
the wife did not leave her own room  the husband had not been at home for three days
the children ran wild all over the house  the english governess quarreled with the housekeeper  and wrote to a friend asking her to look out for a new situation for her  the man cook had walked off the day before just at dinner time  the kitchen maid  and the coachman had given warning
anna karenina 4 of 1759 three days after the quarrel  prince stepan arkadyevitch oblonsky stiva  as he was called in the fashionable world  woke up at his usual hour  that is  at eight o clock in the morning  not in his wife s bedroom  but on the leather covered sofa in his study
he turned over his stout  well cared for person on the springy sofa  as though he would sink into a long sleep again  he vigorously embraced the pillow on the other side and buried his face in it  but all at once he jumped up  sat up on the sofa  and opened his eyes
 yes  yes  how was it now   he thought  going over his dream
 now  how was it  to be sure  alabin was giving a dinner at darmstadt  no  not darmstadt  but something american yes  but then  darmstadt was in america yes  alabin was giving a dinner on glass tables  and the tables sang  il mio tesoro not il mio tesoro though  but something better  and there were some sort of little decanters on the table  and they were women  too   he remembered
stepan arkadyevitch s eyes twinkled gaily  and he pondered with a smile
 yes  it was nice  very nice
there was a great deal more that was delightful  only there s no putting it into words  or even expressing it in one s thoughts awake   and noticing a gleam of light peeping in anna karenina 5 of 1759 beside one of the serge curtains  he cheerfully dropped his feet over the edge of the sofa  and felt about with them for his slippers  a present on his last birthday  worked for him by his wife on gold colored morocco
and  as he had done every day for the last nine years  he stretched out his hand  without getting up  towards the place where his dressing gown always hung in his bedroom and thereupon he suddenly remembered that he was not sleeping in his wife s room  but in his study  and why  the smile vanished from his face  he knitted his brows
 ah  ah  ah  oo      he muttered  recalling everything that had happened
and again every detail of his quarrel with his wife was present to his imagination  all the hopelessness of his position  and worst of all  his own fault
 yes  she won t forgive me  and she can t forgive me
and the most awful thing about it is that it s all my fault  all my fault  though i m not to blame
that s the point of the whole situation   he reflected
 oh  oh  oh   he kept repeating in despair  as he remembered the acutely painful sensations caused him by this quarrel
most unpleasant of all was the first minute when  on coming  happy and good humored  from the theater  with a huge pear in his hand for his wife  he had not found his wife in the drawing room  to his surprise had not found anna karenina 6 of 1759 her in the study either  and saw her at last in her bedroom with the unlucky letter that revealed everything in her hand
she  his dolly  forever fussing and worrying over household details  and limited in her ideas  as he considered  was sitting perfectly still with the letter in her hand  looking at him with an expression of horror  despair  and indignation
 what s this  this   she asked  pointing to the letter
and at this recollection  stepan arkadyevitch  as is so often the case  was not so much annoyed at the fact itself as at the way in which he had met his wife s words
there happened to him at that instant what does happen to people when they are unexpectedly caught in something very disgraceful
he did not succeed in adapting his face to the position in which he was placed towards his wife by the discovery of his fault
instead of being hurt  denying  defending himself  begging forgiveness  instead of remaining indifferent even  anything would have been better than what he did do  his face utterly involuntarily  reflex spinal action  reflected stepan arkadyevitch  who was fond of physiology   utterly involuntarily assumed its habitual  good humored  and therefore idiotic smile anna karenina 7 of 1759 this idiotic smile he could not forgive himself catching sight of that smile  dolly shuddered as though at physical pain  broke out with her characteristic heat into a flood of cruel words  and rushed out of the room
since then she had refused to see her husband
 it s that idiotic smile that s to blame for it all   thought stepan arkadyevitch
 but what s to be done  what s to be done   he said to himself in despair  and found no answer anna karenina 8 of 1759 stepan arkadyevitch was a truthful man in his relations with himself he was incapable of deceiving himself and persuading himself that he repented of his conduct he could not at this date repent of the fact that he  a handsome  susceptible man of thirty four  was not in love with his wife  the mother of five living and two dead children  and only a year younger than himself all he repented of was that he had not succeeded better in hiding it from his wife
but he felt all the difficulty of his position and was sorry for his wife  his children  and himself possibly he might have managed to conceal his sins better from his wife if he had anticipated that the knowledge of them would have had such an effect on her
he had never clearly thought out the subject  but he had vaguely conceived that his wife must long ago have suspected him of being unfaithful to her  and shut her eyes to the fact
he had even supposed that she  a worn out woman no longer young or good looking  and in no way remarkable or interesting  merely a good mother  ought from a sense of fairness to take an indulgent view
it had turned out quite the other way
anna karenina 9 of 1759  oh  it s awful  oh dear  oh dear  awful   stepan arkadyevitch kept repeating to himself  and he could think of nothing to be done  and how well things were going up till now  how well we got on  she was contented and happy in her children  i never interfered with her in anything  i let her manage the children and the house just as she liked
it s true it s bad her having been a governess in our house
that s bad  there s something common  vulgar  in flirting with one s governess
but what a governess    he vividly recalled the roguish black eyes of mlle
roland and her smile    but after all  while she was in the house  i kept myself in hand
and the worst of it all is that she s already   it seems as if ill luck would have it so  oh  oh  but what  what is to be done   there was no solution  but that universal solution which life gives to all questions  even the most complex and insoluble that answer is  one must live in the needs of the day that is  forget oneself
to forget himself in sleep was impossible now  at least till nighttime  he could not go back now to the music sung by the decanterwomen  so he must forget himself in the dream of daily life anna karenina 10 of 1759  then we shall see   stepan arkadyevitch said to himself  and getting up he put on a gray dressing gown lined with blue silk  tied the tassels in a knot  and  drawing a deep breath of air into his broad  bare chest  he walked to the window with his usual confident step  turning out his feet that carried his full frame so easily he pulled up the blind and rang the bell loudly
it was at once answered by the appearance of an old friend  his valet  matvey  carrying his clothes  his boots  and a telegram
matvey was followed by the barber with all the necessaries for shaving
 are there any papers form the office   asked stepan arkadyevitch  taking the telegram and seating himself at the looking glass  on the table   replied matvey  glancing with inquiring sympathy at his master  and  after a short pause  he added with a sly smile   they ve sent from the carriage jobbers   stepan arkadyevitch made no reply  he merely glanced at matvey in the looking glass
in the glance  in which their eyes met in the looking glass  it was clear that they understood one another
stepan arkadyevitch s eyes asked   why do you tell me that  don t you know   matvey put his hands in his jacket pockets  thrust out one leg  and gazed silently  good humoredly  with a faint smile  at his master
anna karenina 11 of 1759  i told them to come on sunday  and till then not to trouble you or themselves for nothing   he said he had obviously prepared the sentence beforehand
stepan arkadyevitch saw matvey wanted to make a joke and attract attention to himself tearing open the telegram  he read it through  guessing at the words  misspelt as they always are in telegrams  and his face brightened  matvey  my sister anna arkadyevna will be here tomorrow   he said  checking for a minute the sleek  plump hand of the barber  cutting a pink path through his long  curly whiskers
 thank god   said matvey  showing by this response that he  like his master  realized the significance of this arrival that is  that anna arkadyevna  the sister he was so fond of  might bring about a reconciliation between husband and wife
 alone  or with her husband   inquired matvey
stepan arkadyevitch could not answer  as the barber was at work on his upper lip  and he raised one finger
matvey nodded at the looking glass
 alone
is the room to be got ready upstairs    inform darya alexandrovna  where she orders   anna karenina 12 of 1759  darya alexandrovna   matvey repeated  as though in doubt
 yes  inform her
here  take the telegram  give it to her  and then do what she tells you    you want to try it on   matvey understood  but he only said   yes sir   stepan arkadyevitch was already washed and combed and ready to be dressed  when matvey  stepping deliberately in his creaky boots  came back into the room with the telegram in his hand
the barber had gone
 darya alexandrovna told me to inform you that she is going away
let him do that is you as he likes   he said  laughing only with his eyes  and putting his hands in his pockets  he watched his master with his head on one side
stepan arkadyevitch was silent a minute
then a goodhumored and rather pitiful smile showed itself on his handsome face
 eh  matvey   he said  shaking his head
 it s all right  sir  she will come round   said matvey
 come round    yes  sir    do you think so  who s there   asked stepan arkadyevitch  hearing the rustle of a woman s dress at the door
anna karenina 13 of 1759  it s i   said a firm  pleasant  woman s voice  and the stern  pockmarked face of matrona philimonovna  the nurse  was thrust in at the doorway
 well  what is it  matrona   queried stepan arkadyevitch  going up to her at the door
although stepan arkadyevitch was completely in the wrong as regards his wife  and was conscious of this himself  almost every one in the house  even the nurse  darya alexandrovna s chief ally  was on his side  well  what now   he asked disconsolately
 go to her  sir  own your fault again
maybe god will aid you
she is suffering so  it s sad to hee her  and besides  everything in the house is topsy turvy
you must have pity  sir  on the children
beg her forgiveness  sir
there s no help for it  one must take the consequences     but she won t see me    you do your part
god is merciful  pray to god  sir  pray to god    come  that ll do  you can go   said stepan arkadyevitch  blushing suddenly
 well now  do dress me   he turned to matvey and threw off his dressinggown decisively
matvey was already holding up the shirt like a horse s collar  and  blowing off some invisible speck  he slipped it anna karenina 14 of 1759 with obvious pleasure over the well groomed body of his master
anna karenina 15 of 1759 when he was dressed  stepan arkadyevitch sprinkled some scent on himself  pulled down his shirt cuffs  distributed into his pockets his cigarettes  pocketbook  matches  and watch with its double chain and seals  and shaking out his handkerchief  feeling himself clean  fragrant  healthy  and physically at ease  in spite of his unhappiness  he walked with a slight swing on each leg into the dining room  where coffee was already waiting for him  and beside the coffee  letters and papers from the office he read the letters
one was very unpleasant  from a merchant who was buying a forest on his wife s property
to sell this forest was absolutely essential  but at present  until he was reconciled with his wife  the subject could not be discussed
the most unpleasant thing of all was that his pecuniary interests should in this way enter into the question of his reconciliation with his wife
and the idea that he might be let on by his interests  that he might seek a reconciliation with his wife on account of the sale of the forest that idea hurt him
anna karenina 16 of 1759 when he had finished his letters  stepan arkadyevitch moved the office papers close to him  rapidly looked through two pieces of business  made a few notes with a big pencil  and pushing away the papers  turned to his coffee
as he sipped his coffee  he opened a still damp morning paper  and began reading it
stepan arkadyevitch took in and read a liberal paper  not an extreme one  but one advocating the views held by the majority
and in spite of the fact that science  art  and politics had no special interest for him  he firmly held those views on all these subjects which were held by the majority and by his paper  and he only changed them when the majority changed them or  more strictly speaking  he did not change them  but they imperceptibly changed of themselves within him stepan arkadyevitch had not chosen his political opinions or his views  these political opinions and views had come to him of themselves  just as he did not choose the shapes of his hat and coat  but simply took those that were being worn and for him  living in a certain society owing to the need  ordinarily developed at years of discretion  for some degree of mental activity to have views was just as indispensable as to have a hat
if there was a reason for his preferring liberal to conservative anna karenina 17 of 1759 views  which were held also by many of his circle  it arose not from his considering liberalism more rational  but from its being in closer accordance with his manner of life
the liberal party said that in russia everything is wrong  and certainly stepan arkadyevitch had many debts and was decidedly short of money
the liberal party said that marriage is an institution quite out of date  and that it needs reconstruction  and family life certainly afforded stepan arkadyevitch little gratification  and forced him into lying and hypocrisy  which was so repulsive to his nature
the liberal party said  or rather allowed it to be understood  that religion is only a curb to keep in check the barbarous classes of the people  and stepan arkadyevitch could not get through even a short service without his legs aching from standing up  and could never make out what was the object of all the terrible and highflown language about another world when life might be so very amusing in this world
and with all this  stepan arkadyevitch  who liked a joke  was fond of puzzling a plain man by saying that if he prided himself on his origin  he ought not to stop at rurik and disown the first founder of his family the monkey and so liberalism had become a habit of stepan arkadyevitch s  and he liked his newspaper  as he did his cigar after dinner  for the slight anna karenina 18 of 1759 fog it diffused in his brain
he read the leading article  in which it was maintained that it was quite senseless in our day to raise an outcry that radicalism was threatening to swallow up all conservative elements  and that the government ought to take measures to crush the revolutionary hydra  that  on the contrary   in our opinion the danger lies not in that fantastic revolutionary hydra  but in the obstinacy of traditionalism clogging progress   etc   etc he read another article  too  a financial one  which alluded to bentham and mill  and dropped some innuendoes reflecting on the ministry
with his characteristic quickwittedness he caught the drift of each innuendo  divined whence it came  at whom and on what ground it was aimed  and that afforded him  as it always did  a certain satisfaction
but today that satisfaction was embittered by matrona philimonovna s advice and the unsatisfactory state of the household
he read  too  that count beist was rumored to have left for wiesbaden  and that one need have no more gray hair  and of the sale of a light carriage  and of a young person seeking a situation  but these items of information did not give him  as usual  a quiet  ironical gratification having finished the paper  a second cup of coffee and a roll and butter  he got up  shaking the crumbs of the roll off his waistcoat  and  anna karenina 19 of 1759 squaring his broad chest  he smiled joyously  not because there was anything particularly agreeable in his mind the joyous smile was evoked by a good digestion
but this joyous smile at once recalled everything to him  and he grew thoughtful
two childish voices  stepan arkadyevitch recognized the voices of grisha  his youngest boy  and tanya  his eldest girl  were heard outside the door
they were carrying something  and dropped it
 i told you not to sit passengers on the roof   said the little girl in english   there  pick them up    everything s in confusion   thought stepan arkadyevitch   there are the children running about by themselves   and going to the door  he called them they threw down the box  that represented a train  and came in to their father
the little girl  her father s favorite  ran up boldly  embraced him  and hung laughingly on his neck  enjoying as she always did the smell of scent that came from his whiskers
at last the little girl kissed his face  which was flushed from his stooping posture and beaming with tenderness  loosed her hands  and was about to run away again  but her father held her back
anna karenina 20 of 1759  how is mamma   he asked  passing his hand over his daughter s smooth  soft little neck
 good morning   he said  smiling to the boy  who had come up to greet him
he was conscious that he loved the boy less  and always tried to be fair  but the boy felt it  and did not respond with a smile to his father s chilly smile
 mamma  she is up   answered the girl
stepan arkadyevitch sighed
 that means that she s not slept again all night   he thought
 well  is she cheerful   the little girl knew that there was a quarrel between her father and mother  and that her mother could not be cheerful  and that her father must be aware of this  and that he was pretending when he asked about it so lightly
and she blushed for her father
he at once perceived it  and blushed too
 i don t know   she said
 she did not say we must do our lessons  but she said we were to go for a walk with miss hoole to grandmamma s    well  go  tanya  my darling
oh  wait a minute  though   he said  still holding her and stroking her soft little hand
anna karenina 21 of 1759 he took off the matelpiece  where he had put it yesterday  a little box of sweets  and gave her two  picking out her favorites  a chocolate and a fondant
 for grisha   said the little girl  pointing to the chocolate
 yes  yes   and still stroking her little shoulder  he kissed her on the roots of here hair and neck  and let her go
 the carriage is ready   said matvey   but there s some one to see you with a petition    been here long   asked stepan arkadyevitch
 half an hour    how many times have i told you to tell me at once    one must let you drink your coffee in peace  at least   said matvey  in the affectionately gruff tone with which it was impossible to be angry
 well  show the person up at once   said oblonsky  frowning with vexation
the petitioner  the widow of a staff captain kalinin  came with a request impossible and unreasonable  but stepan arkadyevitch  as he generally did  made her sit down  heard her to the end attentively without interrupting her  and gave her detailed advice as to how and to whom to apply  and even wrote her  in his large  anna karenina 22 of 1759 sprawling  good and legible hand  a confident and fluent little note to a personage who might be of use to her
having got rid of the staff captain s widow  stepan arkadyevitch took his hat and stopped to recollect whether he had forgotten anything
it appeared that he had forgotten nothing except what he wanted to forget  his wife
 ah  yes   he bowed his head  and his handsome face assumed a harassed expression
 to go  or not to go   he said to himself  and an inner voice told him he must not go  that nothing could come of it but falsity  that to amend  to set right their relations was impossible  because it was impossible to make her attractive again and able to inspire love  or to make him an old man  not susceptible to love except deceit and lying nothing could come of it now  and deceit and lying were opposed to his nature
 it must be some time  though  it can t go on like this   he said  trying to give himself courage he squared his chest  took out a cigarette  took two whiffs at it  flung it into a mother of pearl ashtray  and with rapid steps walked through the drawing room  and opened the other door into his wife s bedroom
anna karenina 23 of 1759 darya alexandrovna  in a dressing jacket  and with her now scanty  once luxuriant and beautiful hair fastened up with hairpins on the nape of her neck  with a sunken  thin face and large  startled eyes  which looked prominent from the thinness of her face  was standing among a litter of all sorts of things scattered all over the room  before an open bureau  from which she was taking something
hearing her husband s steps  she stopped  looking towards the door  and trying assiduously to give her features a severe and contemptuous expression
she felt she was afraid of him  and afraid of the coming interview
she was just attempting to do what she had attempted to do ten times already in these last three days to sort out the children s things and her own  so as to take them to her mother s  and again she could not bring herself to do this  but now again  as each time before  she kept saying to herself   that things cannot go on like this  that she must take some step  to punish him  put him to shame  avenge on him some little part at least of the suffering he had caused her
she still continued to tell herself that she should leave him  but she was conscious that this was impossible  it was anna karenina 24 of 1759 impossible because she could not get out of the habit of regarding him as her husband and loving him
besides this  she realized that if even here in her own house she could hardly manage to look after her five children properly  they would be still worse off where she was going with them all
as it was  even in the course of these three days  the youngest was unwell from being given unwholesome soup  and the others had almost gone without their dinner the day before
she was conscious that it was impossible to go away  but  cheating herself  she went on all the same sorting out her things and pretending she was going
seeing her husband  she dropped her hands into the drawer of the bureau as though looking for something  and only looked round at him when he had come quite up to her
but her face  to which she tried to give a severe and resolute expression  betrayed bewilderment and suffering
 dolly   he said in a subdued and timid voice
he bent his head towards his shoulder and tried to look pitiful and humble  but for all that he was radiant with freshness and health
in a rapid glance she scanned his figure that beamed with health and freshness
 yes  he is happy and content   she thought   while i   
and that disgusting good nature  which every one likes him for and praises i hate anna karenina 25 of 1759 that good nature of his   she thought
her mouth stiffened  the muscles of the cheek contracted on the right side of her pale  nervous face
 what do you want   she said in a rapid  deep  unnatural voice
 dolly   he repeated  with a quiver in his voice
 anna is coming today    well  what is that to me  i can t see her   she cried
 but you must  really  dolly     go away  go away  go away   she shrieked  not looking at him  as though this shriek were called up by physical pain
stepan arkadyevitch could be calm when he thought of his wife  he could hope that she would come round  as matvey expressed it  and could quietly go on reading his paper and drinking his coffee  but when he saw her tortured  suffering face  heard the tone of her voice  submissive to fate and full of despair  there was a catch in his breath and a lump in his throat  and his eyes began to shine with tears
 my god  what have i done  dolly  for god s sake    
you know      he could not go on  there was a sob in his throat
she shut the bureau with a slam  and glanced at him
anna karenina 26 of 1759  dolly  what can i say    
one thing  forgive   remember  cannot nine years of my life atone for an instant     she dropped her eyes and listened  expecting what he would say  as it were beseeching him in some way or other to make her believe differently
  instant of passion   he said  and would have gone on  but at that word  as at a pang of physical pain  her lips stiffened again  and again the muscles of her right cheek worked
 go away  go out of the room   she shrieked still more shrilly   and don t talk to me of your passion and your loathsomeness   she tried to go out  but tottered  and clung to the back of a chair to support herself
his face relaxed  his lips swelled  his eyes were swimming with tears
 dolly   he said  sobbing now   for mercy s sake  think of the children  they are not to blame  i am to blame  and punish me  make me expiate my fault
anything i can do  i am ready to do anything  i am to blame  no words can express how much i am to blame  but  dolly  forgive me   she sat down
he listened to her hard  heavy breathing  and he was unutterably sorry for her
she tried several times to begin to speak  but could not
he waited
anna karenina 27 of 1759  you remember the children  stiva  to play with them  but i remember them  and know that this means their ruin   she said obviously one of the phrases she had more than once repeated to herself in the course of the last few days
she had called him  stiva   and he glanced at her with gratitude  and moved to take her hand  but she drew back from him with aversion
 i think of the children  and for that reason i would do anything in the world to save them  but i don t myself know how to save them
by taking them away from their father  or by leaving them with a vicious father yes  a vicious father   
tell me  after what   has happened  can we live together  is that possible  tell me  eh  is it possible   she repeated  raising her voice   after my husband  the father of my children  enters into a love affair with his own children s governess    but what could i do  what could i do   he kept saying in a pitiful voice  not knowing what he was saying  as his head sank lower and lower
 you are loathsome to me  repulsive   she shrieked  getting more and more heated
 your tears mean nothing  you have never loved me  you have neither heart nor honorable feeling  you are hateful to me  disgusting  a anna karenina 28 of 1759 stranger yes  a complete stranger   with pain and wrath she uttered the word so terrible to herself stranger
he looked at her  and the fury expressed in her face alarmed and amazed him
he did not understand how his pity for her exasperated her
she saw in him sympathy for her  but not love
 no  she hates me
she will not forgive me   he thought
 it is awful  awful   he said
at that moment in the next room a child began to cry  probably it had fallen down
darya alexandrovna listened  and her face suddenly softened
she seemed to be pulling herself together for a few seconds  as though she did not know where she was  and what she was doing  and getting up rapidly  she moved towards the door
 well  she loves my child   he thought  noticing the change of her face at the child s cry   my child  how can she hate me    dolly  one word more   he said  following her
 if you come near me  i will call in the servants  the children  they may all know you are a scoundrel  i am going away at once  and you may live here with your mistress   and she went out  slamming the door
anna karenina 29 of 1759 stepan arkadyevitch sighed  wiped his face  and with a subdued tread walked out of the room
 matvey says she will come round  but how  i don t see the least chance of it
ah  oh  how horrible it is  and how vulgarly she shouted   he said to himself  remembering her shriek and the words  scoundrel  and  mistress    and very likely the maids were listening  horribly vulgar  horrible   stepan arkadyevitch stood a few seconds alone  wiped his face  squared his chest  and walked out of the room it was friday  and in the dining room the german watchmaker was winding up the clock
stepan arkadyevitch remembered his joke about this punctual  bald watchmaker   that the german was wound up for a whole lifetime himself  to wind up watches   and he smiled stepan arkadyevitch was fond of a joke   and maybe she will come round  that s a good expression   come round    he thought
 i must repeat that    matvey   he shouted
 arrange everything with darya in the sitting room for anna arkadyevna   he said to matvey when he came in
 yes  sir   stepan arkadyevitch put on his fur coat and went out onto the steps
 you won t dine at home   said matvey  seeing him off
anna karenina 30 of 1759  that s as it happens
but here s for the housekeeping   he said  taking ten roubles from his pocketbook
 that ll be enough    enough or not enough  we must make it do   said matvey  slamming the carriage door and stepping back onto the steps
darya alexandrovna meanwhile having pacified the child  and knowing from the sound of the carriage that he had gone off  went back again to her bedroom
it was her solitary refuge from the household cares which crowded upon her directly she went out from it
even now  in the short time she had been in the nursery  the english governess and matrona philimonovna had succeeded in putting several questions to her  which did not admit of delay  and which only she could answer   what were the children to put on for their walk  should they have any milk  should not a new cook be sent for    ah  let me alone  let me alone   she said  and going back to her bedroom she sat down in the same place as she had sat when talking to her husband  clasping tightly her thin hands with the rings that slipped down on her bony fingers  and fell to going over in her memory all the conversation
 he has gone  but has he broken it off with her   she thought
 can it be he sees her  why didn t i ask anna karenina 31 of 1759 him  no  no  reconciliation is impossible
even if we remain in the same house  we are strangers strangers forever  she repeated again with special significance the word so dreadful to her
 and how i loved him  my god  how i loved him    
how i loved him  and now don t i love him  don t i love him more than before  the most horrible thing is   she began  but did not finish her thought  because matrona philimonovna put her head in at the door
 let us send for my brother   she said   he can get a dinner anyway  or we shall have the children getting nothing to eat till six again  like yesterday    very well  i will come directly and see about it
but did you send for some new milk   and darya alexandrovna plunged into the duties of the day  and drowned her grief in them for a time
anna karenina 32 of 1759 stepan arkadyevitch had learned easily at school  thanks to his excellent abilities  but he had been idle and mischievous  and therefore was one of the lowest in his class
but in spite of his habitually dissipated mode of life  his inferior grade in the service  and his comparative youth  he occupied the honorable and lucrative position of president of one of the government boards at moscow
this post he had received through his sister anna s husband  alexey alexandrovitch karenin  who held one of the most important positions in the ministry to whose department the moscow office belonged
but if karenin had not got his brother  in law this berth  then through a hundred other personages  brothers  sisters  cousins  uncles  and aunts stiva oblonsky would have received this post  or some other similar one  together with the salary of six thousand absolutely needful for them  as his affairs  in spite of his wife s considerable property  were in an embarrassed condition
half moscow and petersburg were friends and relations of stepan arkadyevitch
he was born in the midst of those who had been and are the powerful ones of this world
anna karenina 33 of 1759 one third of the men in the government  the older men  had been friends of his father s  and had known him in petticoats  another third were his intimate chums  and the remainder were friendly acquaintances consequently the distributors of earthly blessings in the shape of places  rents  shares  and such  were all his friends  and could not overlook one of their own set  and oblonsky had no need to make any special exertion to get a lucrative post
he had only not to refuse things  not to show jealousy  not to be quarrelsome or take offense  all of which from his characteristic good nature he never did
it would have struck him as absurd if he had been told that he would not get a position with the salary he required  especially as he expected nothing out of the way  he only wanted what the men of his own age and standing did get  and he was no worse qualified for performing duties of the kind than any other man
stepan arkadyevitch was not merely liked by all who knew him for his good humor  but for his bright disposition  and his unquestionable honesty
in him  in his handsome  radiant figure  his sparkling eyes  black hair and eyebrows  and the white and red of his face  there was something which produced a physical effect of kindliness and good humor on the people who met him
 aha  stiva  anna karenina 34 of 1759 oblonsky  here he is   was almost always said with a smile of delight on meeting him
even though it happened at times that after a conversation with him it seemed that nothing particularly delightful had happened  the next day  and the next  every one was just as delighted at meeting him again
after filling for three years the post of president of one of the government boards at moscow  stepan arkadyevitch had won the respect  as well as the liking  of his fellow officials  subordinates  and superiors  and all who had had business with him
the principal qualities in stepan arkadyevitch which had gained him this universal respect in the service consisted  in the first place  of his extreme indulgence for others  founded on a consciousness of his own shortcomings  secondly  of his perfect liberalism not the liberalism he read of in the papers  but the liberalism that was in his blood  in virtue of which he treated all men perfectly equally and exactly the same  whatever their fortune or calling might be  and thirdly  the most important point his complete indifference to the business in which he was engaged  in consequence of which he was never carried away  and never made mistakes
anna karenina 35 of 1759 on reaching the offices of the board  stepan arkadyevitch  escorted by a deferential porter with a portfolio  went into his little private room  put on his uniform  and went into the boardroom
the clerks and copyists all rose  greeting him with good humored deference
stepan arkadyevitch moved quickly  as ever  to his place  shook hands with his colleagues  and sat down
he made a joke or two  and talked just as much as was consistent with due decorum  and began work
no one knew better than stepan arkadyevitch how to hit on the exact line between freedom  simplicity  and official stiffness necessary for the agreeable conduct of business
a secretary  with the good humored deference common to every one in stepan arkadyevitch s office  came up with papers  and began to speak in the familiar and easy tone which had been introduced by stepan arkadyevitch
 we have succeeded in getting the information from the government department of penza
here  would you care       you ve got them at last   said stepan arkadyevitch  laying his finger on the paper
 now  gentlemen     and the sitting of the board began
 if they knew   he thought  bending his head with a significant air as he listened to the report   what a guilty anna karenina 36 of 1759 little boy their president was half an hour ago   and his eyes were laughing during the reading of the report
till two o clock the sitting would go on without a break  and at two o clock there would be an interval and luncheon
it was not yet two  when the large glass doors of the boardroom suddenly opened and someone came in
all the officials sitting on the further side under the portrait of the tsar and the eagle  delighted at any distraction  looked round at the door  but the doorkeeper standing at the door at once drove out the intruder  and closed the glass door after him
when the case had been read through  stepan arkadyevitch got up and stretched  and by way of tribute to the liberalism of the times took out a cigarette in the boardroom and went into his private room two of the members of the board  the old veteran in the service  nikitin  and the kammerjunker grinevitch  went in with him
 we shall have time to finish after lunch   said stepan arkadyevitch
 to be sure we shall   said nikitin
 a pretty sharp fellow this fomin must be   said grinevitch of one of the persons taking part in the case they were examining
anna karenina 37 of 1759 stepan arkadyevitch frowned at grinevitch s words  giving him thereby to understand that it was improper to pass judgment prematurely  and made him no reply
 who was that came in   he asked the doorkeeper
 someone  your excellency  crept in without permission directly my back was turned
he was asking for you
i told him  when the members come out  then     where is he    maybe he s gone into the passage  but here he comes anyway
that is he   said the doorkeeper  pointing to a strongly built  broadshouldered man with a curly beard  who  without taking off his sheepskin cap  was running lightly and rapidly up the worn steps of the stone staircase b one of the members going down a lean official with a portfolio stood out of his way and looked disapprovingly at the legs of the stranger  then glanced inquiringly at oblonsky
stepan arkadyevitch was standing at the top of the stairs
his good naturedly beaming face above the embroidered collar of his uniform beamed more than ever when he recognized the man coming up
 why  it s actually you  levin  at last   he said with a friendly mocking smile  scanning levin as he approached
 how is it you have deigned to look me up in this den   anna karenina 38 of 1759 said stepan arkadyevitch  and not content with shaking hands  he kissed his friend
 have you been here long    i have just come  and very much wanted to see you   said levin  looking shyly and at the same time angry and uneasily around
 well  let s go into my room   said stepan arkadyevitch  who knew his friend s sensitive and irritable shyness  and  taking his arm  he drew him along  as though guiding him through dangers
stepan arkadyevitch was on familiar terms with almost all his acquaintances  and called almost all of them by their christian names  old men of sixty  boys of twenty  actors  ministers  merchants  and adjutant generals  so that many of his intimate chums were to be found at the extreme ends of the social ladder  and would have been very much surprised to learn that they had  through the medium of oblonsky  something in common he was the familiar friend of everyone with whom he took a glass of champagne  and he took a glass of champagne with everyone  and when in consequence he met any of his disreputable chums  as he used in joke to call many of his friends  in the presence of his subordinates  he well knew how  with his characteristic tact  to diminish the disagreeable impression made on them levin was not a anna karenina 39 of 1759 disreputable chum  but oblonsky  with his ready tact  felt that levin fancied he might not care to show his intimacy with him before his subordinates  and so he made haste to take him off into his room
levin was almost of the same age as oblonsky  their intimacy did not rest merely on champagne
levin had been the friend and companion of his early youth
they were fond of one another in spite of the difference of their characters and tastes  as friends are fond of one another who have been together in early youth
but in spite of this  each of them as is often the way with men who have selected careers of different kinds though in discussion he would even justify the other s career  in his heart despised it
it seemed to each of them that the life he led himself was the only real life  and the life led by his friend was a mere phantasm oblonsky could not restrain a slight mocking smile at the sight of levin
how often he had seen him come up to moscow from the country where he was doing something  but what precisely stepan arkadyevitch could never quite make out  and indeed he took no interest in the matter
levin arrived in moscow always excited and in a hurry  rather ill at ease and irritated by his own want of ease  and for the most part with a perfectly new  unexpected view of things
stepan anna karenina 40 of 1759 arkadyevitch laughed at this  and liked it
in the same way levin in his heart despised the town mode of life of his friend  and his official duties  which he laughed at  and regarded as trifling
but the difference was that oblonsky  as he was doing the same as every one did  laughed complacently and good humoredly  while levin laughed without complacency and sometimes angrily
 we have long been expecting you   said stepan arkadyevitch  going into his room and letting levin s hand go as though to show that here all danger was over
 i am very  very glad to see you   he went on
 well  how are you  eh  when did you come   levin was silent  looking at the unknown faces of oblonsky s two companions  and especially at the hand of the elegant grinevitch  which had such long white fingers  such long yellow filbert shaped nails  and such huge shining studs on the shirt cuff  that apparently they absorbed all his attention  and allowed him no freedom of thought
oblonsky noticed this at once  and smiled
 ah  to be sure  let me introduce you   he said
 my colleagues  philip ivanitch nikitin  mihail stanislavitch grinevitch  and turning to levin  a district councilor  a modern district councilman  a gymnast who lifts thirteen stone with one hand  a cattle breeder and sportsman  and anna karenina 41 of 1759 my friend  konstantin dmitrievitch levin  the brother of sergey ivonovitch koznishev    delighted   said the veteran
 i have the honor of knowing your brother  sergey ivanovitch   said grinevitch  holding out his slender hand with its long nails
levin frowned  shook hands coldly  and at once turned to oblonsky
though he had a great respect for his halfbrother  an author well known to all russia  he could not endure it when people treated him not as konstantin levin  but as the brother of the celebrated koznishev
 no  i am no longer a district councilor
i have quarreled with them all  and don t go to the meetings any more   he said  turning to oblonsky
 you ve been quick about it   said oblonsky with a smile
 but how  why    it s a long story
i will tell you some time   said levin  but he began telling him at once
 well  to put it shortly  i was convinced that nothing was really done by the district councils  or ever could be   he began  as though some one had just insulted him
 on one side it s a plaything  they play at being a parliament  and i m neither young enough nor old enough to find amusement in playthings  and on the other side   he stammered   it s a means for the coterie anna karenina 42 of 1759 of the district to make money
formerly they had wardships  courts of justice  now they have the district council not in the form of bribes  but in the form of unearned salary   he said  as hotly as though someone of those present had opposed his opinion
 aha  you re in a new phase again  i see a conservative   said stepan arkadyevitch
 however  we can go into that later    yes  later
but i wanted to see you   said levin  looking with hatred at grinevitch s hand
stepan arkadyevitch gave a scarcely perceptible smile
 how was it you used to say you would never wear european dress again   he said  scanning his new suit  obviously cut by a french tailor
 ah  i see  a new phase   levin suddenly blushed  not as grown men blush  slightly  without being themselves aware of it  but as boys blush  feeling that they are ridiculous through their shyness  and consequently ashamed of it and blushing still more  almost to the point of tears and it was so strange to see this sensible  manly face in such a childish plight  that oblonsky left off looking at him
 oh  where shall we meet  you know i want very much to talk to you   said levin
oblonsky seemed to ponder
anna karenina 43 of 1759  i ll tell you what  let s go to gurin s to lunch  and there we can talk
i am free till three    no   answered levin  after an instant s thought   i have got to go on somewhere else    all right  then  let s dine together    dine together  but i have nothing very particular  only a few words to say  and a question i want to ask you  and we can have a talk afterwards    well  say the few words  then  at once  and we ll gossip after dinner    well  it s this   said levin   but it s of no importance  though   his face all at once took an expression of anger from the effort he was making to surmount his shyness
 what are the shtcherbatskys doing  everything as it used to be   he said
stepan arkadyevitch  who had long known that levin was in love with his sister in law  kitty  gave a hardly perceptible smile  and his eyes sparkled merrily
 you said a few words  but i can t answer in a few words  because   
excuse me a minute    a secretary came in  with respectful familiarity and the modest consciousness  characteristic of every secretary  of superiority to his chief in the knowledge of their business  anna karenina 44 of 1759 he went up to oblonsky with some papers  and began  under pretense of asking a question  to explain some objection
stepan arkadyevitch  without hearing him out  laid his hand genially on the secretary s sleeve
 no  you do as i told you   he said  softening his words with a smile  and with a brief explanation of his view of the matter he turned away from the papers  and said   so do it that way  if you please  zahar nikititch   the secretary retired in confusion
during the consultation with the secretary levin had completely recovered from his embarrassment
he was standing with his elbows on the back of a chair  and on his face was a look of ironical attention
 i don t understand it  i don t understand it   he said
 what don t you understand   said oblonsky  smiling as brightly as ever  and picking up a cigarette
he expected some queer outburst from levin
 i don t understand what you are doing   said levin  shrugging his shoulders
 how can you do it seriously    why not    why  because there s nothing in it    you think so  but we re overwhelmed with work    on paper
but  there  you ve a gift for it   added levin
anna karenina 45 of 1759  that s to say  you think there s a lack of something in me    perhaps so   said levin
 but all the same i admire your grandeur  and am proud that i ve a friend in such a great person
you ve not answered my question  though   he went on  with a desperate effort looking oblonsky straight in the face
 oh  that s all very well
you wait a bit  and you ll come to this yourself
it s very nice for you to have over six thousand acres in the karazinsky district  and such muscles  and the freshness of a girl of twelve  still you ll be one of us one day
yes  as to your question  there is no change  but it s a pity you ve been away so long    oh  why so   levin queried  panic stricken
 oh  nothing   responded oblonsky
 we ll talk it over
but what s brought you up to town    oh  we ll talk about that  too  later on   said levin  reddening again up to his ears
 all right
i see   said stepan arkadyevitch
 i should ask you to come to us  you know  but my wife s not quite the thing
but i tell you what  if you want to see them  they re sure now to be at the zoological gardens from four to five
kitty skates
you drive along there  and i ll anna karenina 46 of 1759 come and fetch you  and we ll go and dine somewhere together    capital so good bye till then    now mind  you ll forget  i know you  or rush off home to the country   stepan arkadyevitch called out laughing
 no  truly   and levin went out of the room  only when he was in the doorway remembering that he had forgotten to take leave of oblonsky s colleagues
 that gentleman must be a man of great energy   said grinevitch  when levin had gone away
 yes  my dear boy   said stepan arkadyevitch  nodding his head   he s a lucky fellow  over six thousand acres in the karazinsky district  everything before him  and what youth and vigor  not like some of us    you have a great deal to complain of  haven t you  stepan arkadyevitch    ah  yes  i m in a poor way  a bad way   said stepan arkadyevitch with a heavy sigh
anna karenina 47 of 1759 when oblonsky asked levin what had brought him to town  levin blushed  and was furious with himself for blushing  because he could not answer   i have come to make your sister in law an offer   though that was precisely what he had come for the families of the levins and the shtcherbatskys were old  noble moscow families  and had always been on intimate and friendly terms this intimacy had grown still closer during levin s student days
he had both prepared for the university with the young prince shtcherbatsky  the brother of kitty and dolly  and had entered at the same time with him
in those days levin used often to be in the shtcherbatskys  house  and he was in love with the shtcherbatsky household
strange as it may appear  it was with the household  the family  that konstantin levin was in love  especially with the feminine half of the household
levin did not remember his own mother  and his only sister was older than he was  so that it was in the shtcherbatskys  house that he saw for the first time that inner life of an old  noble  cultivated  and honorable family of which he had been deprived by the death of his anna karenina 48 of 1759 father and mother
all the members of that family  especially the feminine half  were pictured by him  as it were  wrapped about with a mysterious poetical veil  and he not only perceived no defects whatever in them  but under the poetical veil that shrouded them he assumed the existence of the loftiest sentiments and every possible perfection
why it was the three young ladies had one day to speak french  and the next english  why it was that at certain hours they played by turns on the piano  the sounds of which were audible in their brother s room above  where the students used to work  why they were visited by those professors of french literature  of music  of drawing  of dancing  why at certain hours all the three young ladies  with mademoiselle linon  drove in the coach to the tversky boulevard  dressed in their satin cloaks  dolly in a long one  natalia in a half long one  and kitty in one so short that her shapely legs in tightly drawn red stockings were visible to all beholders  why it was they had to walk about the tversky boulevard escorted by a footman with a gold cockade in his hat all this and much more that was done in their mysterious world he did not understand  but he was sure that everything that was done there was very good  and he was in love precisely with the mystery of the proceedings
anna karenina 49 of 1759 in his student days he had all but been in love with the eldest  dolly  but she was soon married to oblonsky
then he began being in love with the second
he felt  as it were  that he had to be in love with one of the sisters  only he could not quite make out which
but natalia  too  had hardly made her appearance in the world when she married the diplomat lvov
kitty was still a child when levin left the university
young shtcherbatsky went into the navy  was drowned in the baltic  and levin s relations with the shtcherbatskys  in spite of his friendship with oblonsky  became less intimate
but when early in the winter of this year levin came to moscow  after a year in the country  and saw the shtcherbatskys  he realized which of the three sisters he was indeed destined to love
one would have thought that nothing could be simpler than for him  a man of good family  rather rich than poor  and thirty two years old  to make the young princess shtcherbatskaya an offer of marriage  in all likelihood he would at once have been looked upon as a good match
but levin was in love  and so it seemed to him that kitty was so perfect in every respect that she was a creature far above everything earthly  and that he was a creature so low and so earthly that it could not even be conceived anna karenina 50 of 1759 that other people and she herself could regard him as worthy of her
after spending two months in moscow in a state of enchantment  seeing kitty almost every day in society  into which he went so as to meet her  he abruptly decided that it could not be  and went back to the country
levin s conviction that it could not be was founded on the idea that in the eyes of her family he was a disadvantageous and worthless match for the charming kitty  and that kitty herself could not love him
in her family s eyes he had no ordinary  definite career and position in society  while his contemporaries by this time  when he was thirty two  were already  one a colonel  and another a professor  another director of a bank and railways  or president of a board like oblonsky
but he  he knew very well how he must appear to others  was a country gentleman  occupied in breeding cattle  shooting game  and building barns  in other words  a fellow of no ability  who had not turned out well  and who was doing just what  according to the ideas of the world  is done by people fit for nothing else
the mysterious  enchanting kitty herself could not love such an ugly person as he conceived himself to be  and  above all  such an ordinary  in no way striking anna karenina 51 of 1759 person moreover  his attitude to kitty in the past the attitude of a grown up person to a child  arising from his friendship with her brother seemed to him yet another obstacle to love
an ugly  good natured man  as he considered himself  might  he supposed  be liked as a friend  but to be loved with such a love as that with which he loved kitty  one would need to be a handsome and  still more  a distinguished man he had heard that women often did care for ugly and ordinary men  but he did not believe it  for he judged by himself  and he could not himself have loved any but beautiful  mysterious  and exceptional women but after spending two months alone in the country  he was convinced that this was not one of those passions of which he had had experience in his early youth  that this feeling gave him not an instant s rest  that he could not live without deciding the question  would she or would she not be his wife  and that his despair had arisen only from his own imaginings  that he had no sort of proof that he would be rejected
and he had now come to moscow with a firm determination to make an offer  and get married if he were accepted
or   he could not conceive what would become of him if he were rejected
anna karenina 52 of 1759 on arriving in moscow by a morning train  levin had put up at the house of his elder half brother  koznishev
after changing his clothes he went down to his brother s study  intending to talk to him at once about the object of his visit  and to ask his advice  but his brother was not alone
with him there was a well known professor of philosophy  who had come from harkov expressly to clear up a difference that had arisen between them on a very important philosophical question
the professor was carrying on a hot crusade against materialists
sergey koznishev had been following this crusade with interest  and after reading the professor s last article  he had written him a letter stating his objections
he accused the professor of making too great concessions to the materialists
and the professor had promptly appeared to argue the matter out
the point in discussion was the question then in vogue  is there a line to be drawn between psychological and physiological phenomena in man  and if so  where  sergey ivanovitch met his brother with the smile of chilly friendliness he always had for everyone  and anna karenina 53 of 1759 introducing him to the professor  went on with the conversation
a little man in spectacles  with a narrow forehead  tore himself from the discussion for an instant to greet levin  and then went on talking without paying any further attention to him levin sat down to wait till the professor should go  but he soon began to get interested in the subject under discussion
levin had come across the magazine articles about which they were disputing  and had read them  interested in them as a development of the first principles of science  familiar to him as a natural science student at the university
but he had never connected these scientific deductions as to the origin of man as an animal  as to reflex action  biology  and sociology  with those questions as to the meaning of life and death to himself  which had of late been more and more often in his mind as he listened to his brother s argument with the professor  he noticed that they connected these scientific questions with those spiritual problems  that at times they almost touched on the latter  but every time they were close upon what seemed to him the chief point  they promptly beat a hasty retreat  and plunged again into a sea of subtle distinctions  reservations  quotations  allusions  anna karenina 54 of 1759 and appeals to authorities  and it was with difficulty that he understood what they were talking about  i cannot admit it   said sergey ivanovitch  with his habitual clearness  precision of expression  and elegance of phrase
 i cannot in any case agree with keiss that my whole conception of the external world has been derived from perceptions
the most fundamental idea  the idea of existence  has not been received by me through sensation  indeed  there is no special sense organ for the transmission of such an idea    yes  but they wurt  and knaust  and pripasov  would answer that your consciousness of existence is derived from the conjunction of all your sensations  that that consciousness of existence is the result of your sensations
wurt  indeed  says plainly that  assuming there are no sensations  it follows that there is no idea of existence    i maintain the contrary   began sergey ivanovitch
but here it seemed to levin that just as they were close upon the real point of the matter  they were again retreating  and he made up his mind to put a question to the professor
anna karenina 55 of 1759  according to that  if my senses are annihilated  if my body is dead  i can have no existence of any sort   he queried
the professor  in annoyance  and  as it were  mental suffering at the interruption  looked round at the strange inquirer  more like a bargeman than a philosopher  and turned his eyes upon sergey ivanovitch  as though to ask  what s one to say to him  but sergey ivanovitch  who had been talking with far less heat and one sidedness than the professor  and who had sufficient breadth of mind to answer the professor  and at the same time to comprehend the simple and natural point of view from which the question was put  smiled and said   that question we have no right to answer as yet    we have not the requisite data   chimed in the professor  and he went back to his argument
 no   he said   i would point out the fact that if  as pripasov directly asserts  perception is based on sensation  then we are bound to distinguish sharply between these two conceptions   levin listened no more  and simply waited for the professor to go
anna karenina 56 of 1759 when the professor had gone  sergey ivanovitch turned to his brother
 delighted that you ve come
for some time  is it  how s your farming getting on   levin knew that his elder brother took little interest in farming  and only put the question in deference to him  and so he only told him about the sale of his wheat and money matters
levin had meant to tell his brother of his determination to get married  and to ask his advice  he had indeed firmly resolved to do so
but after seeing his brother  listening to his conversation with the professor  hearing afterwards the unconsciously patronizing tone in which his brother questioned him about agricultural matters  their mother s property had not been divided  and levin took charge of both their shares   levin felt that he could not for some reason begin to talk to him of his intention of marrying
he felt that his brother would not look at it as he would have wished him to
anna karenina 57 of 1759  well  how is your district council doing   asked sergey ivanovitch  who was greatly interested in these local boards and attached great importance to them
 i really don t know    what  why  surely you re a member of the board    no  i m not a member now  i ve resigned   answered levin   and i no longer attend the meetings    what a pity   commented sergey ivanovitch  frowning
levin in self defense began to describe what took place in the meetings in his district
 that s how it always is   sergey ivanovitch interrupted him
 we russians are always like that
perhaps it s our strong point  really  the faculty of seeing our own shortcomings  but we overdo it  we comfort ourselves with irony which we always have on the tip of our tongues
all i say is  give such rights as our local selfgovernment to any other european people why  the germans or the english would have worked their way to freedom from them  while we simply turn them into ridicule    but how can it be helped   said levin penitently
 it was my last effort
and i did try with all my soul
i can t
i m no good at it   anna karenina 58 of 1759  it s not that you re no good at it   said sergey ivanovitch   it is that you don t look at it as you should    perhaps not   levin answered dejectedly
 oh  do you know brother nikolay s turned up again   this brother nikolay was the elder brother of konstantin levin  and half brother of sergey ivanovitch  a man utterly ruined  who had dissipated the greater part of his fortune  was living in the strangest and lowest company  and had quarreled with his brothers
 what did you say   levin cried with horror
 how do you know    prokofy saw him in the street    here in moscow  where is he  do you know   levin got up from his chair  as though on the point of starting off at once
 i am sorry i told you   said sergey ivanovitch  shaking his head at his younger brother s excitement
 i sent to find out where he is living  and sent him his iou to trubin  which i paid
this is the answer he sent me   and sergey ivanovitch took a note from under a paper weight and handed it to his brother
levin read in the queer  familiar handwriting   i humbly beg you to leave me in peace
that s the only favor i ask of my gracious brothers  nikolay levin   anna karenina 59 of 1759 levin read it  and without raising his head stood with the note in his hands opposite sergey ivanovitch
there was a struggle in his heart between the desire to forget his unhappy brother for the time  and the consciousness that it would be base to do so
 he obviously wants to offend me   pursued sergey ivanovitch   but he cannot offend me  and i should have wished with all my heart to assist him  but i know it s impossible to do that    yes  yes   repeated levin
 i understand and appreciate your attitude to him  but i shall go and see him    if you want to  do  but i shouldn t advise it   said sergey ivanovitch
 as regards myself  i have no fear of your doing so  he will not make you quarrel with me  but for your own sake  i should say you would do better not to go
you can t do him any good  still  do as you please    very likely i can t do any good  but i feel especially at such a moment but that s another thing i feel i could not be at peace    well  that i don t understand   said sergey ivanovitch
 one thing i do understand   he added   it s a lesson in humility
i have come to look very differently and more charitably on what is called infamous since brother nikolay has become what he is   you know what he did    anna karenina 60 of 1759  oh  it s awful  awful   repeated levin
after obtaining his brother s address from sergey ivanovitch s footman  levin was on the point of setting off at once to see him  but on second thought he decided to put off his visit till the evening
the first thing to do to set his heart at rest was to accomplish what he had come to moscow for
from his brother s levin went to oblonsky s office  and on getting news of the shtcherbatskys from him  he drove to the place where he had been told he might find kitty
anna karenina 61 of 1759 at four o clock  conscious of his throbbing heart  levin stepped out of a hired sledge at the zoological gardens  and turned along the path to the frozen mounds and the skating ground  knowing that he would certainly find her there  as he had seen the shtcherbatskys  carriage at the entrance
it was a bright  frosty day
rows of carriages  sledges  drivers  and policemen were standing in the approach
crowds of well dressed people  with hats bright in the sun  swarmed about the entrance and along the well swept little paths between the little houses adorned with carving in the russian style
the old curly birches of the gardens  all their twigs laden with snow  looked as though freshly decked in sacred vestments
he walked along the path towards the skating ground  and kept saying to himself  you mustn t be excited  you must be calm what s the matter with you  what do you want  be quiet  stupid   he conjured his heart
and the more he tried to compose himself  the more breathless he found himself an acquaintance met him and called him by his name  but levin did not even recognize him
he anna karenina 62 of 1759 went towards the mounds  whence came the clank of the chains of sledges as they slipped down or were dragged up  the rumble of the sliding sledges  and the sounds of merry voices
he walked on a few steps  and the skating ground lay open before his eyes  and at once  amidst all the skaters  he knew her
he knew she was there by the rapture and the terror that seized on his heart
she was standing talking to a lady at the opposite end of the ground
there was apparently nothing striking either in her dress or her attitude
but for levin she was as easy to find in that crowd as a rose among nettles
everything was made bright by her
she was the smile that shed light on all round her
 is it possible i can go over there on the ice  go up to her   he thought
the place where she stood seemed to him a holy shrine  unapproachable  and there was one moment when he was almost retreating  so overwhelmed was he with terror
he had to make an effort to master himself  and to remind himself that people of all sorts were moving about her  and that he too might come there to skate he walked down  for a long while avoiding looking at her as at the sun  but seeing her  as one does the sun  without looking
on that day of the week and at that time of day people of one set  all acquainted with one another  used to meet anna karenina 63 of 1759 on the ice
there were crack skaters there  showing off their skill  and learners clinging to chairs with timid  awkward movements  boys  and elderly people skating with hygienic motives
they seemed to levin an elect band of blissful beings because they were here  near her
all the skaters  it seemed  with perfect self possession  skated towards her  skated by her  even spoke to her  and were happy  quite apart from her  enjoying the capital ice and the fine weather
nikolay shtcherbatsky  kitty s cousin  in a short jacket and tight trousers  was sitting on a garden seat with his skates on
seeing levin  he shouted to him   ah  the first skater in russia  been here long  firstrate ice do put your skates on    i haven t got my skates   levin answered  marveling at this boldness and ease in her presence  and not for one second losing sight of her  though he did not look at her
he felt as though the sun were coming near him
she was in a corner  and turning out her slender feet in their high boots with obvious timidity  she skated towards him
a boy in russian dress  desperately waving his arms and bowed down to the ground  overtook her she skated a little uncertainly  taking her hands out of the little muff that hung on a cord  she held them ready for emergency  anna karenina 64 of 1759 and looking towards levin  whom she had recognized  she smiled at him  and at her own fears
when she had got round the turn  she gave herself a push off with one foot  and skated straight up to shtcherbatsky
clutching at his arm  she nodded smiling to levin
she was more splendid that he had imagined her
when he thought of her  he could call up a vivid picture of her to himself  especially the charm of that little fair head  so freely set on the shapely girlish shoulders  and so full of childish brightness and good humor the childishness of her expression  together with the delicate beauty of her figure  made up her special charm  and that he fully realized
but what always struck him in her as something unlooked for  was the expression of her eyes  soft  serene  and truthful  and above all  her smile  which always transported levin to an enchanted world  where he felt himself softened and tender  as he remembered himself in some days of his early childhood  have you been here long   she said  giving him her hand
 thank you   she added  as he picked up the handkerchief that had fallen out of her muff
 i  i ve not long   yesterday   i mean today   i arrived   answered levin  in his emotion not at once understanding her question
 i was meaning to come and see you   he anna karenina 65 of 1759 said  and then  recollecting with what intention he was trying to see her  he was promptly overcome with confusion and blushed
 i didn t know you could skate  and skate so well   she looked at him earnestly  as though wishing to make out the cause of his confusion
 your praise is worth having
the tradition is kept up here that you are the best of skaters   she said  with her little black gloved hand brushing a grain of hoarfrost off her muff
 yes  i used once to skate with passion  i wanted to reach perfection    you do everything with passion  i think   she said smiling
 i should so like to see how you skate
put on skates  and let us skate together    skate together  can that be possible   thought levin  gazing at her
 i ll put them on directly   he said
and he went off to get skates
 it s a long while since we ve seen you here  sir   said the attendant  supporting his foot  and screwing on the heel of the skate
 except you  there s none of the gentlemen first rate skaters
will that be all right   said he  tightening the strap
anna karenina 66 of 1759  oh  yes  yes  make haste  please   answered levin  with difficulty restraining the smile of rapture which would overspread his face
 yes   he thought   this now is life  this is happiness  together  she said  let us skate together  speak to her now  but that s just why i m afraid to speak because i m happy now  happy in hope  anyway   
and then    
but i must  i must  i must  away with weakness   levin rose to his feet  took off his overcoat  and scurrying over the rough ice round the hut  came out on the smooth ice and skated without effort  as it were  by simple exercise of will  increasing and slackening speed and turning his course
he approached with timidity  but again her smile reassured him
she gave him her hand  and they set off side by side  going faster and faster  and the more rapidly they moved the more tightly she grasped his hand
 with you i should soon learn  i somehow feel confidence in you   she said to him
 and i have confidence in myself when you are leaning on me   he said  but was at once panic stricken at what he had said  and blushed
and indeed  no sooner had he uttered these words  when all at once  like the sun going behind a cloud  her face lost all its friendliness  and levin anna karenina 67 of 1759 detected the familiar change in her expression that denoted the working of thought  a crease showed on her smooth brow
 is there anything troubling you  though i ve no right to ask such a question   he added hurriedly
 oh  why so    
no  i have nothing to trouble me   she responded coldly  and she added immediately   you haven t seen mlle
linon  have you    not yet    go and speak to her  she likes you so much    what s wrong  i have offended her
lord help me   thought levin  and he flew towards the old frenchwoman with the gray ringlets  who was sitting on a bench
smiling and showing her false teeth  she greeted him as an old friend
 yes  you see we re growing up   she said to him  glancing towards kitty   and growing old
tiny bear has grown big now   pursued the frenchwoman  laughing  and she reminded him of his joke about the three young ladies whom he had compared to the three bears in the english nursery tale
 do you remember that s what you used to call them   he remembered absolutely nothing  but she had been laughing at the joke for ten years now  and was fond of it
anna karenina 68 of 1759  now  go and skate  go and skate
our kitty has learned to skate nicely  hasn t she   when levin darted up to kitty her face was no longer stern  her eyes looked at him with the same sincerity and friendliness  but levin fancied that in her friendliness there was a certain note of deliberate composure
and he felt depressed
after talking a little of her old governess and her peculiarities  she questioned him about his life
 surely you must be dull in the country in the winter  aren t you   she said
 no  i m not dull  i am very busy   he said  feeling that she was holding him in check by her composed tone  which he would not have the force to break through  just as it had been at the beginning of the winter
 are you going to stay in town long   kitty questioned him
 i don t know   he answered  not thinking of what he was saying
the thought that if he were held in check by her tone of quiet friendliness he would end by going back again without deciding anything came into his mind  and he resolved to make a struggle against it
 how is it you don t know    i don t know
it depends upon you   he said  and was immediately horror stricken at his own words
anna karenina 69 of 1759 whether it was that she had heard his words  or that she did not want to hear them  she made a sort of stumble  twice struck out  and hurriedly skated away from him
she skated up to mlle
linon  said something to her  and went towards the pavilion where the ladies took off their skates
 my god  what have i done  merciful god  help me  guide me   said levin  praying inwardly  and at the same time  feeling a need of violent exercise  he skated about describing inner and outer circles
at that moment one of the young men  the best of the skaters of the day  came out of the coffee house in his skates  with a cigarette in his mouth
taking a run  he dashed down the steps in his skates  crashing and bounding up and down
he flew down  and without even changing the position of his hands  skated away over the ice
 ah  that s a new trick   said levin  and he promptly ran up to the top to do this new trick
 don t break you neck  it needs practice   nikolay shtcherbatsky shouted after him
levin went to the steps  took a run from above as best he cold  and dashed down  preserving his balance in this unwonted movement with his hands
on the last step he stumbled  but barely touching the ice with his hand  with a violent effort recovered himself  and skated off  laughing anna karenina 70 of 1759  how splendid  how nice he is   kitty was thinking at that time  as she came out of the pavilion with mlle
linon  and looked towards him with a smile of quiet affection  as though he were a favorite brother
 and can it be my fault  can i have done anything wrong  they talk of flirtation
i know it s not he that i love  but still i am happy with him  and he s so jolly
only  why did he say that      she mused
catching sight of kitty going away  and her mother meeting her at the steps  levin  flushed from his rapid exercise  stood still and pondered a minute
he took off his skates  and overtook the mother and daughter at the entrance of the gardens
 delighted to see you   said princess shtcherbatskaya
 on thursdays we are home  as always    today  then    we shall be pleased to see you   the princess said stiffly
this stiffness hurt kitty  and she could not resist the desire to smooth over her mother s coldness
she turned her head  and with a smile said   good bye till this evening   at that moment stepan arkadyevitch  his hat cocked on one side  with beaming face and eyes  strode into the garden like a conquering hero
but as he approached his anna karenina 71 of 1759 mother in law  he responded in a mournful and crestfallen tone to her inquiries about dolly s health
after a little subdued and dejected conversation with his mother inlaw  he threw out his chest again  and put his arm in levin s
 well  shall we set off   he asked
 i ve been thinking about you all this time  and i m very  very glad you ve come   he said  looking him in the face with a significant air
 yes  come along   answered levin in ecstasy  hearing unceasingly the sound of that voice saying   good bye till this evening   and seeing the smile with which it was said
 to the england or the hermitage    i don t mind which    all right  then  the england   said stepan arkadyevitch  selecting that restaurant because he owed more there than at the hermitage  and consequently considered it mean to avoid it
 have you got a sledge  that s first rate  for i sent my carriage home   the friends hardly spoke all the way
levin was wondering what that change in kitty s expression had meant  and alternately assuring himself that there was hope  and falling into despair  seeing clearly that his hopes were insane  and yet all the while he felt himself quite anna karenina 72 of 1759 another man  utterly unlike what he had been before her smile and those words   good bye till this evening   stepan arkadyevitch was absorbed during the drive in composing the menu of the dinner  you like trout  don t you   he said to levin as they were arriving
 eh   responded levin
 turbot  yes  i m awfully fond of turbot   anna karenina 73 of 1759 when levin went into the restaurant with oblonsky  he could not help noticing a certain peculiarity of expression  as it were  a restrained radiance  about the face and whole figure of stepan arkadyevitch
oblonsky took off his overcoat  and with his hat over one ear walked into the dining room  giving directions to the tatar waiters  who were clustered about him in evening coats  bearing napkins
bowing to right and left to the people he met  and here as everywhere joyously greeting acquaintances  he went up to the sideboard for a preliminary appetizer of fish and vodka  and said to the painted frenchwoman decked in ribbons  lace  and ringlets  behind the counter  something so amusing that even that frenchwoman was moved to genuine laughter
levin for his part refrained from taking any vodka simply because he felt such a loathing of that frenchwoman  all made up  it seemed  of false hair  poudre de riz  and vinaigre de toilette
he made haste to move away from her  as from a dirty place
his whole soul was filled with memories of kitty  and there was a smile of triumph and happiness shining in his eyes
anna karenina 74 of 1759  this way  your excellency  please
your excellency won t be disturbed here   said a particularly pertinacious  white headed old tatar with immense hips and coattails gaping widely behind
 walk in  your excellency   he said to levin  by way of showing his respect to stepan arkadyevitch  being attentive to his guest as well
instantly flinging a fresh cloth over the round table under the bronze chandelier  though it already had a table cloth on it  he pushed up velvet chairs  and came to a standstill before stepan arkadyevitch with a napkin and a bill of fare in his hands  awaiting his commands
 if you prefer it  your excellency  a private room will be free directly  prince golistin with a lady
fresh oysters have come in    ah  oysters   stepan arkadyevitch became thoughtful
 how if we were to change our program  levin   he said keeping his finger on the bill of fare
and his face expressed serious hesitation
 are the oysters good  mind now    they re flensburg  your excellency
we ve no ostend    flensburg will do  but are they fresh    only arrived yesterday   anna karenina 75 of 1759  well  then  how if we were to begin with oysters  and so change the whole program  eh    it s all the same to me
i should like cabbage soup and porridge better than anything  but of course there s nothing like that here    porridge a la russe  your honor would like   said the tatar  bending down to levin  like a nurse speaking to a child
 no  joking apart  whatever you choose is sure to be good
i ve been skating  and i m hungry
and don t imagine   he added  detecting a look of dissatisfaction on oblonsky s face   that i shan t appreciate your choice
i am fond of good things    i should hope so  after all  it s one of the pleasures of life   said stepan arkadyevitch
 well  then  my friend  you give us two or better say three dozen oysters  clear soup with vegetables     printaniere   prompted the tatar
but stepan arkadyevitch apparently did not care to allow him the satisfaction of giving the french names of the dishes
 with vegetables in it  you know
then turbot with thick sauce  then   roast beef  and mind it s good
yes  and capons  perhaps  and then sweets   anna karenina 76 of 1759 the tatar  recollecting that it was stepan arkadyevitch s way not to call the dishes by the names in the french bill of fare  did not repeat them after him  but could not resist rehearsing the whole menus to himself according to the bill   soupe printaniere  turbot  sauce beaumarchais  poulard a l estragon  macedoine de fruits   etc    and then instantly  as though worked by springs  laying down one bound bill of fare  he took up another  the list of wines  and submitted it to stepan arkadyevitch  what shall we drink    what you like  only not too much champagne   said levin
 what  to start with  you re right though  i dare say
do you like the white seal    cachet blanc   prompted the tatar
 very well  then  give us that brand with the oysters  and then we ll see    yes  sir
and what table wine    you can give us nuits
oh  no  better the classic chablis    yes  sir
and your cheese  your excellency    oh  yes  parmesan
or would you like another   anna karenina 77 of 1759  no  it s all the same to me   said levin  unable to suppress a smile
and the tatar ran off with flying coattails  and in five minutes darted in with a dish of opened oysters on mother of pearl shells  and a bottle between his fingers
stepan arkadyevitch crushed the starchy napkin  tucked it into his waistcoat  and settling his arms comfortably  started on the oysters  not bad   he said  stripping the oysters from the pearly shell with a silver fork  and swallowing them one after another
 not bad   he repeated  turning his dewy  brilliant eyes from levin to the tatar
levin ate the oysters indeed  though white bread and cheese would have pleased him better
but he was admiring oblonsky
even the tatar  uncorking the bottle and pouring the sparkling wine into the delicate glasses  glanced at stepan arkadyevitch  and settled his white cravat with a perceptible smile of satisfaction
 you don t care much for oysters  do you   said stepan arkadyevitch  emptying his wine glass   or you re worried about something
eh   he wanted levin to be in good spirits
but it was not that levin was not in good spirits  he was ill at ease
with what he had in his soul  he felt sore and uncomfortable in anna karenina 78 of 1759 the restaurant  in the midst of private rooms where men were dining with ladies  in all this fuss and bustle  the surroundings of bronzes  looking glasses  gas  and waiters all of it was offensive to him he was afraid of sullying what his soul was brimful of
 i  yes  i am  but besides  all this bothers me   he said
 you can t conceive how queer it all seems to a country person like me  as queer as that gentleman s nails i saw at your place     yes  i saw how much interested you were in poor grinevitch s nails   said stepan arkadyevitch  laughing  it s too much for me   responded levin
 do try  now  and put yourself in my place  take the point of view of a country person
we in the country try to bring our hands into such a state as will be most convenient for working with
so we cut our nails  sometimes we turn up our sleeves
and here people purposely let their nails grow as long as they will  and link on small saucers by way of studs  so that they can do nothing with their hands   stepan arkadyevitch smiled gaily
 oh  yes  that s just a sign that he has no need to do coarse work
his work is with the mind     maybe
but still it s queer to me  just as at this moment it seems queer to me that we country folks try to anna karenina 79 of 1759 get our meals over as soon as we can  so as to be ready for our work  while here are we trying to drag out our meal as long as possible  and with that object eating oysters     why  of course   objected stepan arkadyevitch  but that s just the aim of civilization to make everything a source of enjoyment    well  if that s its aim  i d rather be a savage    and so you are a savage
all you levins are savages   levin sighed
he remembered his brother nikolay  and felt ashamed and sore  and he scowled  but oblonsky began speaking of a subject which at once drew his attention
 oh  i say  are you going tonight to our people  the shtcherbatskys   i mean   he said  his eyes sparkling significantly as he pushed away the empty rough shells  and drew the cheese towards him
 yes  i shall certainly go   replied levin   though i fancied the princess was not very warm in her invitation    what nonsense  that s her manner   
come  boy  the soup    
that s her manner grande dame   said stepan arkadyevitch
 i m coming  too  but i have to go to the countess bonina s rehearsal
come  isn t it true that you re a savage  how do you explain the sudden way in which you vanished from moscow  the shtcherbatskys anna karenina 80 of 1759 were continually asking me about you  as though i ought to know
the only thing i know is that you always do what no one else does    yes   said levin  slowly and with emotion   you re right
i am a savage
only  my savageness is not in having gone away  but in coming now
now i have come     oh  what a lucky fellow you are   broke in stepan arkadyevitch  looking into levin s eyes
 why    i know a gallant steed by tokens sure  and by his eyes i know a youth in love   declaimed stepan arkadyevitch
 everything is before you    why  is it over for you already    no  not over exactly  but the future is yours  and the present is mine  and the present well  it s not all that it might be    how so    oh  things go wrong
but i don t want to talk of myself  and besides i can t explain it all   said stepan arkadyevitch
 well  why have you come to moscow  then    
hi  take away   he called to the tatar
 you guess   responded levin  his eyes like deep wells of light fixed on stepan arkadyevitch
anna karenina 81 of 1759  i guess  but i can t be the first to talk about it
you can see by that whether i guess right or wrong   said stepan arkadyevitch  gazing at levin with a subtle smile
 well  and what have you to say to me   said levin in a quivering voice  feeling that all the muscles of his face were quivering too
 how do you look at the question   stepan arkadyevitch slowly emptied his glass of chablis  never taking his eyes off levin
 i   said stepan arkadyevitch   there s nothing i desire so much as that nothing  it would be the best thing that could be    but you re not making a mistake  you know what we re speaking of   said levin  piercing him with his eyes
 you think it s possible    i think it s possible
why not possible    no  do you really think it s possible  no  tell me all you think  oh  but if   if refusal s in store for me   
indeed i feel sure     why should you think that   said stepan arkadyevitch  smiling at his excitement
 it seems so to me sometimes that will be awful for me  and for her too    oh  well  anyway there s nothing awful in it for a girl
every girl s proud of an offer   anna karenina 82 of 1759  yes  every girl  but not she   stepan arkadyevitch smiled
he so well knew that feeling of levin s  that for him all the girls in the world were divided into two classes  one class all the girls in the world except her  and those girls with all sorts of human weaknesses  and very ordinary girls  the other class she alone  having no weaknesses of any sort and higher than all humanity
 stay  take some sauce   he said  holding back levin s hand as it pushed away the sauce
levin obediently helped himself to sauce  but would not let stepan arkadyevitch go on with his dinner  no  stop a minute  stop a minute   he said
 you must understand that it s a question of life and death for me
i have never spoken to any one of this
and there s no one i could speak of it to  except you
you know we re utterly unlike each other  different tastes and views and everything  but i know you re fond of me and understand me  and that s why i like you awfully
but for god s sake  be quite straightforward with me    i tell you what i think   said stepan arkadyevitch  smiling
 but i ll say more  my wife is a wonderful woman     stepan arkadyevitch sighed  remembering his position with his wife  and  after a moment s silence  anna karenina 83 of 1759 resumed  she has a gift of foreseeing things
she sees right through people  but that s not all  she knows what will come to pass  especially in the way of marriages
she foretold  for instance  that princess shahovskaya would marry brenteln
no one would believe it  but it came to pass
and she s on your side    how do you mean    it s not only that she likes you she says that kitty is certain to be your wife   at these words levin s face suddenly lighted up with a smile  a smile not far from tears of emotion
 she says that   cried levin
 i always said she was exquisite  your wife
there  that s enough  enough said about it   he said  getting up from his seat
 all right  but do sit down   but levin could not sit down
he walked with his firm tread twice up and down the little cage of a room  blinked his eyelids that his tears might not fall  and only then sat down to the table
 you must understand   said he   it s not love
i ve been in love  but it s not that
it s not my feeling  but a sort of force outside me has taken possession of me
i went away  you see  because i made up my mind that it could never be  you understand  as a happiness that does not come on anna karenina 84 of 1759 earth  but i ve struggled with myself  i see there s no living without it
and it must be settled    what did you go away for    ah  stop a minute  ah  the thoughts that come crowding on one  the questions one must ask oneself  listen
you can t imagine what you ve done for me by what you said
i m so happy that i ve become positively hateful  i ve forgotten everything
i heard today that my brother nikolay   you know  he s here   i had even forgotten him
it seems to me that he s happy too it s a sort of madness
but one thing s awful   
here  you ve been married  you know the feeling   it s awful that we  old with a past  
not of love  but of sins   are brought all at once so near to a creature pure and innocent  it s loathsome  and that s why one can t help feeling oneself unworthy    oh  well  you ve not many sins on your conscience    alas  all the same   said levin   when with loathing i go over my life  i shudder and curse and bitterly regret it   
yes    what would you have  the world s made so   said stepan arkadyevitch
 the one comfort is like that prayer  which i always liked   forgive me not according to my unworthiness  but anna karenina 85 of 1759 according to thy lovingkindness   that s the only way she can forgive me   anna karenina 86 of 1759 levin emptied his glass  and they were silent for a while
 there s one other thing i ought to tell you
do you know vronsky   stepan arkadyevitch asked levin
 no  i don t
why do you ask    give us another bottle   stepan arkadyevitch directed the tatar  who was filling up their glasses and fidgeting round them just when he was not wanted
 why you ought to know vronsky is that he s one of your rivals    who s vronsky   said levin  and his face was suddenly transformed from the look of childlike ecstasy which oblonsky had just been admiring to an angry and unpleasant expression
 vronsky is one of the sons of count kirill ivanovitch vronsky  and one of the finest specimens of the gilded youth of petersburg
i made his acquaintance in tver when i was there on official business  and he came there for the levy of recruits
fearfully rich  handsome  great connections  an aide de camp  and with all that a very nice  good natured fellow
but he s more than simply a anna karenina 87 of 1759 good natured fellow  as i ve found out here he s a cultivated man  too  and very intelligent  he s a man who ll make his mark   levin scowled and was dumb
 well  he turned up here soon after you d gone  and as i can see  he s over head and ears in love with kitty  and you know that her mother     excuse me  but i know nothing   said levin  frowning gloomily
and immediately he recollected his brother nikolay and how hateful he was to have been able to forget him
 you wait a bit  wait a bit   said stepan arkadyevitch  smiling and touching his hand
 i ve told you what i know  and i repeat that in this delicate and tender matter  as far as one can conjecture  i believe the chances are in your favor   levin dropped back in his chair  his face was pale
 but i would advise you to settle the thing as soon as may be   pursued oblonsky  filling up his glass
 no  thanks  i can t drink any more   said levin  pushing away his glass
 i shall be drunk   
come  tell me how are you getting on   he went on  obviously anxious to change the conversation
anna karenina 88 of 1759  one word more  in any case i advise you to settle the question soon
tonight i don t advise you to speak   said stepan arkadyevitch
 go round tomorrow morning  make an offer in due form  and god bless you     oh  do you still think of coming to me for some shooting  come next spring  do   said levin
now his whole soul was full of remorse that he had begun this conversation with stepan arkadyevitch
a feeling such as his was prefaced by talk of the rivalry of some petersburg officer  of the suppositions and the counsels of stepan arkadyevitch
stepan arkadyevitch smiled
he knew what was passing in levin s soul
 i ll come some day   he said
 but women  my boy  they re the pivot everything turns upon
things are in a bad way with me  very bad
and it s all through women
tell me frankly now   he pursued  picking up a cigar and keeping one hand on his glass   give me your advice    why  what is it    i ll tell you
suppose you re married  you love your wife  but you re fascinated by another woman     excuse me  but i m absolutely unable to comprehend how   just as i can t comprehend how i could now  after my dinner  go straight to a baker s shop and steal a roll   anna karenina 89 of 1759 stepan arkadyevitch s eyes sparkled more than usual
 why not  a roll will sometimes smell so good one can t resist it    himmlisch ist s  wenn ich bezwungen meine irdische begier  aber doch wenn s nich gelungen hatt  ich auch recht huebsch plaisir   as he said this  stepan arkadyevitch smiled subtly
levin  too  could not help smiling
 yes  but joking apart   resumed stepan arkadyevitch   you must understand that the woman is a sweet  gentle loving creature  poor and lonely  and has sacrificed everything
now  when the thing s done  don t you see  can one possibly cast her off  even supposing one parts from her  so as not to break up one s family life  still  can one help feeling for her  setting her on her feet  softening her lot    well  you must excuse me there
you know to me all women are divided into two classes   at least no   truer to say  there are women and there are   i ve never seen exquisite fallen beings  and i never shall see them  but such creatures as that painted frenchwoman at the counter with anna karenina 90 of 1759 the ringlets are vermin to my mind  and all fallen women are the same    but the magdalen    ah  drop that  christ would never have said those words if he had known how they would be abused
of all the gospel those words are the only ones remembered
however  i m not saying so much what i think  as what i feel
i have a loathing for fallen women
you re afraid of spiders  and i of these vermin
most likely you ve not made a study of spiders and don t know their character  and so it is with me    it s very well for you to talk like that  it s very much like that gentleman in dickens who used to fling all difficult questions over his right shoulder
but to deny the facts is no answer
what s to be done you tell me that  what s to be done  your wife gets older  while you re full of life
before you ve time to look round  you feel that you can t love your wife with love  however much you may esteem her
and then all at once love turns up  and you re done for  done for   stepan arkadyevitch said with weary despair
levin half smiled
 yes  you re done for   resumed oblonsky
 but what s to be done   anna karenina 91 of 1759  don t steal rolls   stepan arkadyevitch laughed outright
 oh  moralist  but you must understand  there are two women  one insists only on her rights  and those rights are your love  which you can t give her  and the other sacrifices everything for you and asks for nothing
what are you to do  how are you to act  there s a fearful tragedy in it    if you care for my profession of faith as regards that  i ll tell you that i don t believe there was any tragedy about it
and this is why
to my mind  love   both the sorts of love  which you remember plato defines in his banquet  served as the test of men
some men only understand one sort  and some only the other
and those who only know the non platonic love have no need to talk of tragedy
in such love there can be no sort of tragedy
 i m much obliged for the gratification  my humble respects  that s all the tragedy
and in platonic love there can be no tragedy  because in that love all is clear and pure  because    at that instant levin recollected his own sins and the inner conflict he had lived through
and he added unexpectedly  anna karenina 92 of 1759  but perhaps you are right
very likely   i don t know  i don t know    it s this  don t you see   said stepan arkadyevitch   you re very much all of a piece
that s your strong point and your failing
you have a character that s all of a piece  and you want the whole of life to be of a piece too but that s not how it is
you despise public official work because you want the reality to be invariably corresponding all the while with the aim and that s not how it is
you want a man s work  too  always to have a defined aim  and love and family life always to be undivided and that s not how it is
all the variety  all the charm  all the beauty of life is made up of light and shadow   levin sighed and made no reply
he was thinking of his own affairs  and did not hear oblonsky
and suddenly both of them felt that though they were friends  though they had been dining and drinking together  which should have drawn them closer  yet each was thinking only of his own affairs  and they had nothing to do with one another
oblonsky had more than once experienced this extreme sense of aloofness  instead of intimacy  coming on after dinner  and he knew what to do in such cases
anna karenina 93 of 1759  bill   he called  and he went into the next room where he promptly came across and aide de camp of his acquaintance and dropped into conversation with him about an actress and her protector
and at once in the conversation with the aide de camp oblonsky had a sense of relaxation and relief after the conversation with levin  which always put him to too great a mental and spiritual strain
when the tatar appeared with a bill for twenty six roubles and odd kopecks  besides a tip for himself  levin  who would another time have been horrified  like any one from the country  at his share of fourteen roubles  did not notice it  paid  and set off homewards to dress and go to the shtcherbatskys  there to decide his fate anna karenina 94 of 1759 the young princess kitty shtcherbatskaya was eighteen
it was the first winter that she had been out in the world
her success in society had been greater than that of either of her elder sisters  and greater even than her mother had anticipated
to say nothing of the young men who danced at the moscow balls being almost all in love with kitty  two serious suitors had already this first winter made their appearance  levin  and immediately after his departure  count vronsky
levin s appearance at the beginning of the winter  his frequent visits  and evident love for kitty  had led to the first serious conversations between kitty s parents as to her future  and to disputes between them
the prince was on levin s side  he said he wished for nothing better for kitty
the princess for her part  going round the question in the manner peculiar to women  maintained that kitty was too young  that levin had done nothing to prove that he had serious intentions  that kitty felt no great attraction to him  and other side issues  but she did not state the principal point  which was that she looked for a better match for her daughter  and that levin was not to her anna karenina 95 of 1759 liking  and she did not understand him
when levin had abruptly departed  the princess was delighted  and said to her husband triumphantly   you see i was right   when vronsky appeared on the scene  she was still more delighted  confirmed in her opinion that kitty was to make not simply a good  but a brilliant match
in the mother s eyes there could be no comparison between vronsky and levin
she disliked in levin his strange and uncompromising opinions and his shyness in society  founded  as she supposed  on his pride and his queer sort of life  as she considered it  absorbed in cattle and peasants
she did not very much like it that he  who was in love with her daughter  had kept coming to the house for six weeks  as though he were waiting for something  inspecting  as though he were afraid he might be doing them too great an honor by making an offer  and did not realize that a man  who continually visits at a house where there is a young unmarried girl  is bound to make his intentions clear
and suddenly  without doing so  he disappeared
 it s as well he s not attractive enough for kitty to have fallen in love with him   thought the mother
vronsky satisfied all the mother s desires
very wealthy  clever  of aristocratic family  on the highroad to a brilliant anna karenina 96 of 1759 career in the army and at court  and a fascinating man
nothing better could be wished for
vronsky openly flirted with kitty at balls  danced with her  and came continually to the house  consequently there could be no doubt of the seriousness of his intentions
but  in spite of that  the mother had spent the whole of that winter in a state of terrible anxiety and agitation
princess shtcherbatskaya had herself been married thirty years ago  her aunt arranging the match
her husband  about whom everything was well known before hand  had come  looked at his future bride  and been looked at
the match making aunt had ascertained and communicated their mutual impression
that impression had been favorable
afterwards  on a day fixed beforehand  the expected offer was made to her parents  and accepted
all had passed very simply and easily
so it seemed  at least  to the princess
but over her own daughters she had felt how far from simple and easy is the business  apparently so commonplace  of marrying off one s daughters
the panics that had been lived through  the thoughts that had been brooded over  the money that had been wasted  and the disputes with her husband over marrying the two elder girls  darya and natalia  now  since the youngest had anna karenina 97 of 1759 come out  she was going through the same terrors  the same doubts  and still more violent quarrels with her husband than she had over the elder girls
the old prince  like all fathers indeed  was exceedingly punctilious on the score of the honor and reputation of his daughters
he was irrationally jealous over his daughters  especially over kitty  who was his favorite
at every turn he had scenes with the princess for compromising her daughter
the princess had grown accustomed to this already with her other daughters  but now she felt that there was more ground for the prince s touchiness
she saw that of late years much was changed in the manners of society  that a mother s duties had become still more difficult
she saw that girls of kitty s age formed some sort of clubs  went to some sort of lectures  mixed freely in men s society  drove about the streets alone  many of them did not curtsey  and  what was the most important thing  all the girls were firmly convinced that to choose their husbands was their own affair  and not their parents 
 marriages aren t made nowadays as they used to be   was thought and said by all these young girls  and even by their elders
but how marriages were made now  the princess could not learn from any one
the french fashion of the parents arranging their children s future was not accepted  it was anna karenina 98 of 1759 condemned
the english fashion of the complete independence of girls was also not accepted  and not possible in russian society
the russian fashion of matchmaking by the offices if intermediate persons was for some reason considered unseemly  it was ridiculed by every one  and by the princess herself
but how girls were to be married  and how parents were to marry them  no one knew
everyone with whom the princess had chanced to discuss the matter said the same thing   mercy on us  it s high time in our day to cast off all that old fashioned business
it s the young people have to marry  and not their parents  and so we ought to leave the young people to arrange it as they choose   it was very easy for anyone to say that who had no daughters  but the princess realized that in the process of getting to know each other  her daughter might fall in love  and fall in love with someone who did not care to marry her or who was quite unfit to be her husband
and  however much it was instilled into the princess that in our times young people ought to arrange their lives for themselves  she was unable to believe it  just as she would have been unable to believe that  at any time whatever  the most suitable playthings for children five years old ought to be loaded pistols and so anna karenina 99 of 1759 the princess was more uneasy over kitty than she had been over her elder sisters
now she was afraid that vronsky might confine himself to simply flirting with her daughter she saw that her daughter was in love with him  but tried to comfort herself with the thought that he was an honorable man  and would not do this
but at the same time she knew how easy it is  with the freedom of manners of today  to turn a girl s head  and how lightly men generally regard such a crime
the week before  kitty had told her mother of a conversation she had with vronsky during a mazurka
this conversation had partly reassured the princess  but perfectly at ease she could not be
vronsky had told kitty that both he and his brother were so used to obeying their mother that they never made up their minds to any important undertaking without consulting her
 and just now  i am impatiently awaiting my mother s arrival from petersburg  as peculiarly fortunate   he told her
kitty had repeated this without attaching any significance to the words
but her mother saw them in a different light
she knew that the old lady was expected from day to day  that she would be pleased at her son s choice  and she felt it strange that he should not make his offer through fear of vexing his mother
however  she was anna karenina 100 of 1759 so anxious for the marriage itself  and still more for relief from her fears  that she believed it was so
bitter as it was for the princess to see the unhappiness of her eldest daughter  dolly  on the point of leaving her husband  her anxiety over the decision of her youngest daughter s fate engrossed all her feelings
today  with levin s reappearance  a fresh source of anxiety arose
she was afraid that her daughter  who had at one time  as she fancied  a feeling for levin  might  from extreme sense of honor  refuse vronsky  and that levin s arrival might generally complicate and delay the affair so near being concluded
 why  has be been here long   the princess asked about levin  as they returned home
 he came today  mamma    there s one thing i want to say     began the princess  and from her serious and alert face  kitty guessed what it would be
 mamma   she said  flushing hotly and turning quickly to her   please  please don t say anything about that
i know  i know all about it   she wished for what her mother wished for  but the motives of her mother s wishes wounded her
 i only want to say that to raise hopes    anna karenina 101 of 1759  mamma  darling  for goodness  sake  don t talk about it
it s so horrible to talk about it    i won t   said her mother  seeing the tears in her daughter s eyes   but one thing  my love  you promised me you would have no secrets from me
you won t    never  mamma  none   answered kitty  flushing a little  and looking her mother straight in the face   but there s no use in my telling you anything  and i   i   if i wanted to  i don t know what to say or how   i don t know     no  she could not tell an untruth with those eyes   thought the mother  smiling at her agitation and happiness
the princess smiled that what was taking place just now in her soul seemed to the poor child so immense and so important
anna karenina 102 of 1759 after dinner  and till the beginning of the evening  kitty was feeling a sensation akin to the sensation of a young man before a battle
her heat throbbed violently  and her thoughts would not rest on anything
she felt that this evening  when they would both meet for the first time  would be a turning point in her life
and she was continually picturing them to herself  at one moment each separately  and then both together
when she mused on the past  she dwelt with pleasure  with tenderness  on the memories of her relations with levin
the memories of childhood and of levin s friendship with her dead brother gave a special poetic charm to her relations with him
his love for her  of which she felt certain  was flattering and delightful to her  and it was pleasant for her to think of levin
in her memories of vronsky there always entered a certain element of awkwardness  though he was in the highest degree wellbred and at ease  as though there were some false note  not in vronsky  he was very simple and nice  but in herself  while with levin she felt perfectly simple and clear
but  on the other hand  directly she thought of the anna karenina 103 of 1759 future with vronsky  there arose before her a perspective of brilliant happiness  with levin the future seemed misty
when she went upstairs to dress  and looked into the looking glass  she noticed with joy that it was one of her good days  and that she was in complete possession of all her forces  she needed this so for what lay before her  she was conscious of external composure and free grace in her movements
at half past seven she had only just gone down into the drawing room  when the footman announced   konstantin dmitrievitch levin   the princess was still in her room  and the prince had not come in
 so it is to be   thought kitty  and all the blood seemed to rush to her heart
she was horrified at her paleness  as she glanced into the looking glass
at that moment she knew beyond doubt that he had come early on purpose to find her alone and to make her an offer
and only then for the first time the whole thing presented itself in a new  different aspect  only then she realized that the question did not affect her only  with whom she would be happy  and whom she loved but that she would have that moment to wound a man whom she liked
and to wound him cruelly
what for  because he  dear fellow  loved her  was in love with anna karenina 104 of 1759 her
but there was no help for it  so it must be  so it would have to be
 my god  shall i myself really have to say it to him   she thought
 can i tell him i don t love him  that will be a lie
what am i to say to him  that i love someone else  no  that s impossible
i m going away  i m going away   she had reached the door  when she heard his step
 no  it s not honest
what have i to be afraid of  i have done nothing wrong
what is to be  will be  i ll tell the truth
and with him one can t be ill at ease
here he is   she said to herself  seeing his powerful  shy figure  with his shining eyes fixed on her
she looked straight into his face  as thought imploring him to spare her  and gave her hand
 it s not time yet  i think i m too early   he said glancing round the empty drawing room
when he saw that his expectations were realized  that there was nothing to prevent him from speaking  his face became gloomy
 oh  no   said kitty  and sat down at the table
 but this was just what i wanted  to find you alone   be began  not sitting down  and not looking at her  so as not to lose courage
 mamma will be down directly
she was very much tired   
yesterday    anna karenina 105 of 1759 she talked on  not knowing what her lips were uttering  and not taking her supplicating and caressing eyes off him
he glanced at her  she blushed  and ceased speaking
 i told you i did not know whether i should be here long   that it depended on you    she dropped her head lower and lower  not knowing herself what answer she should make to what was coming
 that it depended on you   he repeated
 i meant to say   i meant to say   i came for this   to be my wife   he brought out  not knowing what he was saying  but feeling that the most terrible thing was said  he stopped short and looked at her  
she was breathing heavily  not looking at him
she was feeling ecstasy
her soul was flooded with happiness
she had never anticipated that the utterance of love would produce such a powerful effect on her
but it lasted only an instant
she remembered vronsky
she lifted her clear  truthful eyes  and seeing his desperate face  she answered hastily   that cannot be   forgive me   a moment ago  and how close she had been to him  of what importance in his life  and how aloof and remote from him she had become now  anna karenina 106 of 1759  it was bound to be so   he said  not looking at her
he bowed  and was meaning to retreat
anna karenina 107 of 1759 but at that very moment the princess came in
there was a look of horror on her face when she saw them alone  and their disturbed faces
levin bowed to her  and said nothing
kitty did not speak nor lift her eyes
 thank god  she has refused him   thought the mother  and her face lighted up with the habitual smile with which she greeted her guests on thursdays
she sat down and began questioning levin about his life in the country
he sat down again  waiting for other visitors to arrive  in order to retreat unnoticed
five minutes later there came in a friend of kitty s  married the preceding winter  countess nordston
she was a thin  sallow  sickly  and nervous woman  with brilliant black eyes
she was fond of kitty  and her affection for her showed itself  as the affection of married women for girls always does  in the desire to make a match for kitty after her own ideal of married happiness  she wanted her to marry vronsky
levin she had often met at the shtcherbatskys  early in the winter  and she had always disliked him
her invariable and favorite pursuit  when they met  consisted in making fun of him
anna karenina 108 of 1759  i do like it when he looks down at me from the height of his grandeur  or breaks off his learned conversation with me because i m a fool  or is condescending to me
i like that so  to see him condescending  i am so glad he can t bear me   she used to say of him
she was right  for levin actually could not bear her  and despised her for what she was proud of and regarded as a fine characteristic her nervousness  her delicate contempt and indifference for everything coarse and earthly
the countess nordston and levin got into that relation with one another not seldom seen in society  when two persons  who remain externally on friendly terms  despise each other to such a degree that they cannot even take each other seriously  and cannot even be offended by each other the countess nordston pounced upon levin at once
 ah  konstantin dmitrievitch  so you ve come back to our corrupt babylon   she said  giving him her tiny  yellow hand  and recalling what he had chanced to say early in the winter  that moscow was a babylon
 come  is babylon reformed  or have you degenerated   she added  glancing with a simper at kitty
anna karenina 109 of 1759  it s very flattering for me  countess  that you remember my words so well   responded levin  who had succeeded in recovering his composure  and at once from habit dropped into his tone of joking hostility to the countess nordston
 they must certainly make a great impression on you    oh  i should think so  i always note them all down
well  kitty  have you been skating again   
and she began talking to kitty
awkward as it was for levin to withdraw now  it would still have been easier for him to perpetrate this awkwardness than to remain all the evening and see kitty  who glanced at him now and then and avoided his eyes
he was on the point of getting up  when the princess  noticing that he was silent  addressed him
 shall you be long in moscow  you re busy with the district council  though  aren t you  and can t be away for long    no  princess  i m no longer a member of the council   he said
 i have come up for a few days    there s something the matter with him   thought countess nordston  glancing at his stern  serious face
 he isn t in his old argumentative mood
but i ll draw him anna karenina 110 of 1759 out
i do love making a fool of him before kitty  and i ll do it    konstantin dmitrievitch   she said to him   do explain to me  please  what s the meaning of it
you know all about such things
at home in our village of kaluga all the peasants and all the women have drunk up all they possessed  and now they can t pay us any rent
what s the meaning of that  you always praise the peasants so   at that instant another lady came into the room  and levin got up
 excuse me  countess  but i really know nothing about it  and can t tell you anything   he said  and looked round at the officer who came in behind the lady
 that must be vronsky   thought levin  and  to be sure of it  glanced at kitty
she had already had time to look at vronsky  and looked round at levin
and simply from the look in her eyes  that grew unconsciously brighter  levin knew that she loved that man  knew it as surely as if she had told him so in words
but what sort of a man was he  now  whether for good or for ill  levin could not choose but remain  he must find out what the man was like whom she loved
there are people who  on meeting a successful rival  no matter in what  are at once disposed to turn their backs on anna karenina 111 of 1759 everything good in him  and to see only what is bad
there are people  on the other hand  who desire above all to find in that lucky rival the qualities by which he has outstripped them  and seek with a throbbing ache at heart only what is good
levin belonged to the second class
but he had no difficulty in finding what was good and attractive in vronsky
it was apparent at the first glance
vronsky was a squarely built  dark man  not very tall  with a good humored  handsome  and exceedingly calm and resolute face
everything about his face and figure  from his short cropped black hair and freshly shaven chin down to his loosely fitting  brand new uniform  was simple and at the same time elegant
making way for the lady who had come in  vronsky went up to the princess and then to kitty
as he approached her  his beautiful eyes shone with a specially tender light  and with a faint  happy  and modestly triumphant smile  so it seemed to levin   bowing carefully and respectfully over her  he held out his small broad hand to her
greeting and saying a few words to everyone  he sat down without once glancing at levin  who had never taken his eyes off him
anna karenina 112 of 1759  let me introduce you   said the princess  indicating levin
 konstantin dmitrievitch levin  count alexey kirillovitch vronsky   vronsky got up and  looking cordially at levin  shook hands with him
 i believe i was to have dined with you this winter   he said  smiling his simple and open smile   but you had unexpectedly left for the country    konstantin dmitrievitch despises and hates town and us townspeople   said countess nordston
 my words must make a deep impression on you  since you remember them so well   said levin  and suddenly conscious that he had said just the same thing before  he reddened
vronsky looked at levin and countess nordston  and smiled
 are you always in the country   he inquired
 i should think it must be dull in the winter    it s not dull if one has work to do  besides  one s not dull by oneself   levin replied abruptly
 i am fond of the country   said vronsky  noticing  and affecting not to notice  levin s tone
 but i hope  count  you would not consent to live in the country always   said countess nordston
anna karenina 113 of 1759  i don t know  i have never tried for long
i experience a queer feeling once   he went on
 i never longed so for the country  russian country  with bast shoes and peasants  as when i was spending a winter with my mother in nice
nice itself is dull enough  you know
and indeed  naples and sorrento are only pleasant for a short time
and it s just there that russia comes back to me most vividly  and especially the country
it s as though    he talked on  addressing both kitty and levin  turning his serene  friendly eyes from one to the other  and saying obviously just what came into his head
noticing that countess nordston wanted to say something  he stopped short without finishing what he had begun  and listened attentively to her
the conversation did not flag for an instant  so that the princess  who always kept in reserve  in case a subject should be lacking  two heavy guns the relative advantages of classical and of modern education  and universal military service had not to move out either of them  while countess nordston had not a chance of chaffing levin
levin wanted to  and could not  take part in the general conversation  saying to himself every instant  anna karenina 114 of 1759  now go   he still did not go  as though waiting for something the conversation fell upon table turning and spirits  and countess nordston  who believed in spiritualism  began to describe the marvels she had seen
 ah  countess  you really must take me  for pity s sake do take me to see them  i have never seen anything extraordinary  though i am always on the lookout for it everywhere   said vronsky  smiling
 very well  next saturday   answered countess nordston
 but you  konstantin dmitrievitch  do you believe in it   she asked levin
 why do you ask me  you know what i shall say    but i want to hear your opinion    my opinion   answered levin   is only that this tableturning simply proves that educated society so called is no higher than the peasants
they believe in the evil eye  and in witchcraft and omens  while we     oh  then you don t believe in it    i can t believe in it  countess    but if i ve seen it myself    the peasant women too tell us they have seen goblins    then you think i tell a lie   anna karenina 115 of 1759 and she laughed a mirthless laugh
 oh  no  masha  konstantin dmitrievitch said he could not believe in it   said kitty  blushing for levin  and levin saw this  and  still more exasperated  would have answered  but vronsky with his bright frank smile rushed to the support of the conversation  which was threatening to become disagreeable
 you do not admit the conceivability at all   he queried
 but why not  we admit the existence of electricity  of which we know nothing
why should there not be some new force  still unknown to us  which     when electricity was discovered   levin interrupted hurriedly   it was only the phenomenon that was discovered  and it was unknown from what it proceeded and what were its effects  and ages passed before its applications were conceived
but the spiritualists have begun with tables writing for them  and spirits appearing to them  and have only later started saying that it is an unknown force   vronsky listened attentively to levin  as he always did listen  obviously interested in his words
 yes  but the spiritualists say we don t know at present what this force is  but there is a force  and these are the conditions in which it acts
let the scientific men find out anna karenina 116 of 1759 what the force consists in
not  i don t see why there should not be a new force  if it     why  because with electricity   levin interrupted again   every time you rub tar against wool  a recognized phenomenon is manifested  but in this case it does not happen every time  and so it follows it is not a natural phenomenon   feeling probably that the conversation was taking a tone too serious for a drawing room  vronsky made no rejoinder  but by way of trying to change the conversation  he smiled brightly  and turned to the ladies
 do let us try at once  countess   he said  but levin would finish saying what he thought
 i think   he went on   that this attempt of the spiritualists to explain their marvels as some sort of new natural force is most futile
they boldly talk of spiritual force  and then try to subject it to material experiment   every one was waiting for him to finish  and he felt it
 and i think you would be a first rate medium   said countess nordston   there s something enthusiastic in you   levin opened his mouth  was about to say something  reddened  and said nothing
anna karenina 117 of 1759  do let us try table turning at once  please   said vronsky
 princess  will you allow it   and vronsky stood up  looking for a little table
kitty got up to fetch a table  and as she passed  her eyes met levin s she felt for him with her whole heart  the more because she was pitying him for suffering of which she was herself the cause
 if you can forgive me  forgive me   said her eyes   i am so happy    i hate them all  and you  and myself   his eyes responded  and he took up his hat
but he was not destined to escape
just as they were arranging themselves round the table  and levin was on the point of retiring  the old prince came in  and after greeting the ladies  addressed levin  ah   he began joyously
 been here long  my boy  i didn t even know you were in town
very glad to see you   the old prince embraced levin  and talking to him did not observe vronsky  who had risen  and was serenely waiting till the prince should turn to him
kitty felt how distasteful her father s warmth was to levin after what had happened
she saw  too  how coldly her father responded at last to vronsky s bow  and how vronsky looked with amiable perplexity at her father  as though trying and failing to understand how and why anna karenina 118 of 1759 anyone could be hostilely disposed towards him  and she flushed
 prince  let us have konstantin dmitrievitch   said countess nordston   we want to try an experiment    what experiment  table turning  well  you must excuse me  ladies and gentlemen  but to my mind it is better fun to play the ring game   said the old prince  looking at vronsky  and guessing that it had been his suggestion
 there s some sense in that  anyway   vronsky looked wonderingly at the prince with his resolute eyes  and  with a faint smile  began immediately talking to countess nordston of the great ball that was to come off next week
 i hope you will be there   he said to kitty
as soon as the old prince turned away from him  levin went out unnoticed  and the last impression he carried away with him of that evening was the smiling  happy face of kitty answering vronsky s inquiry about the ball
anna karenina 119 of 1759 at the end of the evening kitty told her mother of her conversation with levin  and in spite of all the pity she felt for levin  she was glad at the thought that she had received an offer
she had no doubt that she had acted rightly
but after she had gone to bed  for a long while she could not sleep
one impression pursued her relentlessly
it was levin s face  with his scowling brows  and his kind eyes looking out in dark dejection below them  as he stood listening to her father  and glancing at her and at vronsky
and she felt so sorry for him that tears came into her eyes
but immediately she thought of the man for whom she had given him up
she vividly recalled his manly  resolute face  his noble self possession  and the good nature conspicuous in everything towards everyone
she remembered the love for her of the man she loved  and once more all was gladness in her soul  and she lay on the pillow  smiling with happiness
 i m sorry  i m sorry  but what could i do  it s not my fault   she said to herself  but an inner voice told her something else
whether she felt remorse at having won levin s love  or at having refused him  she did not know
but her happiness was anna karenina 120 of 1759 poisoned by doubts
 lord  have pity on us  lord  have pity on us  lord  have pity on us   she repeated to herself  till she fell asleep
meanwhile there took place below  in the prince s little library  one of the scenes so often repeated between the parents on account of their favorite daughter
 what  i ll tell you what   shouted the prince  waving his arms  and at once wrapping his squirrel lined dressinggown round him again  that you ve no pride  no dignity  that you re disgracing  ruining your daughter by this vulgar  stupid match making    but  really  for mercy s sake  prince  what have i done   said the princess  almost crying
she  pleased and happy after her conversation with her daughter  had gone to the prince to say good night as usual  and though she had no intention of telling him of levin s offer and kitty s refusal  still she hinted to her husband that she fancied things were practically settled with vronsky  and that he would declare himself so soon as his mother arrived and thereupon  at those words  the prince had all at once flown into a passion  and began to use unseemly language
 what have you done  i ll tell you what
first of all  you re trying to catch an eligible gentleman  and all anna karenina 121 of 1759 moscow will be talking of it  and with good reason
if you have evening parties  invite everyone  don t pick out the possible suitors
invite all the young bucks
engage a piano player  and let them dance  and not as you do things nowadays  hunting up good matches
it makes me sick  sick to see it  and you ve gone on till you ve turned the poor wench s head
levin s a thousand times the better man
as for this little petersburg swell  they re turned out by machinery  all on one pattern  and all precious rubbish
but if he were a prince of the blood  my daughter need not run after anyone    but what have i done    why  you ve     the prince was crying wrathfully
 i know if one were to listen to you   interrupted the princess   we should never marry our daughter
if it s to be so  we d better go into the country    well  and we had better    but do wait a minute
do i try and catch them  i don t try to catch them in the least
a young man  and a very nice one  has fallen in love with her  and she  i fancy     oh  yes  you fancy  and how if she really is in love  and he s no more thinking of marriage than i am   
oh  that i should live to see it  ah  spiritualism  ah  nice  ah  anna karenina 122 of 1759 the ball   and the prince  imagining that he was mimicking his wife  made a mincing curtsey at each word
 and this is how we re preparing wretchedness for kitty  and she s really got the notion into her head     but what makes you suppose so    i don t suppose  i know we have eyes for such things  though women folk haven t
i see a man who has serious intentions  that s levin  and i see a peacock  like this feather head  who s only amusing himself    oh  well  when once you get an idea into your head      well  you ll remember my words  but too late  just as with dolly    well  well  we won t talk of it   the princess stopped him  recollecting her unlucky dolly  by all means  and good night   and signing each other with the cross  the husband and wife parted with a kiss  feeling that they each remained of their own opinion
the princess had at first been quite certain that that evening had settled kitty s future  and theat there could be no doubt of vronsky s intentions  but her husband s words had disturbed her
and returning to her own room  in terror before the unknown future  she  too  like kitty  anna karenina 123 of 1759 repeated several times in her heart   lord  have pity  lord  have pity  lord  have pity   anna karenina 124 of 1759 vronsky had never had a real home life
his mother had been in her youth a brilliant society woman  who had had during her married life  and still more afterwards  many love affairs notorious in the whole fashionable world
his father he scarcely remembered  and he had been educated in the corps of pages
leaving the school very young as a brilliant officer  he had at once got into the circle of wealthy petersburg army men
although he did go more or less into petersburg society  his love affairs had always hitherto been outside it
in moscow he had for the first time felt  after his luxurious and coarse life at petersburg  all the charm of intimacy with a sweet and innocent girl of his own rank  who cared for him
it never even entered his head that there could be any harm in his relations with kitty
at balls he danced principally with her
he was a constant visitor at their house
he talked to her as people commonly do talk in society all sorts of nonsense  but nonsense to which he could not help attaching a special meaning in her case
although he said nothing to her that he could not have said before everybody  he felt that she anna karenina 125 of 1759 was becoming more and more dependent upon him  and the more he felt this  the better he liked it  and the tenderer was his feeling for her
he did not know that his mode of behavior in relation to kitty had a definite character  that it is courting young girls with no intention of marriage  and that such courting is one of the evil actions common among brilliant young men such as he was
it seemed to him that he was the first who had discovered this pleasure  and he was enjoying his discovery
if he could have heard what her parents were saying that evening  if he could have put himself at the point ov view of the family and have heard that kitty would be unhappy if he did not marry her  he would have been greatly astonished  and would not have believed it he could not believe that what gave such great and delicate pleasure to him  and above all to her  could be wrong
still less could he have believed that he ought to marry
marriage had never presented itself to him as a possibility
he not only disliked family life  but a family  and especially a husband was  in accordance with the views general in the bachelor world in which he lived  conceived as something alien  repellant  and  above all  ridiculous
anna karenina 126 of 1759 but though vronsky had not the least suspicion what the parents were saying  he felt on coming away from the shtcherbatskys  that the secret spiritual bond which existed between him and kitty had grown so much stronger that evening that some step must be taken
but what step could and ought to be taken he could not imagine
 what is so exquisite   he thought  as he returned from the shtcherbatskys   carrying away with him  as he always did  a delicious feeling of purity and freshness  arising partly from the fact that he had not been smoking for a whole evening  and with it a new feeling of tenderness at her love for him  what is so exquisite is that not a word has been said by me or by her  but we understand each other so well in this unseen language of looks and tones  that this evening more clearly than ever she told me she loves me
and how secretly  simply  and most of all  how trustfully  i feel myself better  purer
i feel that i have a heart  and that there is a great deal of good in me
those sweet  loving eyes  when she said  indeed i do      well  what then  oh  nothing
it s good for me  and good for her   and he began wondering where to finish the evening
he passed in review of the places he might go to
 club  a game of bezique  champagne with ignatov  no  anna karenina 127 of 1759 i m not going
chateau des fleurs  there i shall find oblonsky  songs  the cancan
no  i m sick of it
that s why i like the shtcherbatskys   that i m growing better
i ll go home   he went straight to his room at dussot s hotel  ordered supper  and then undressed  and as soon as his head touched the pillow  fell into a sound sleep
anna karenina 128 of 1759 next day at eleven o clock in the morning vronsky drove to the station of the petersburg railway to meet his mother  and the first person he came across on the great flight of steps was oblonsky  who was expecting his sister by the same train
 ah  your excellency   cried oblonsky   whom are you meeting    my mother   vronsky responded  smiling  as everyone did who met oblonsky
he shook hands with him  and together they ascended the steps
 she is to be here from petersburg today    i was looking out for you till two o clock last night
where did you go after the shtcherbatskys     home   answered vronsky
 i must own i felt so well content yesterday after the shtcherbatskys  that i didn t care to go anywhere    i know a gallant steed by tokens sure  and by his eyes i know a youth in love   declaimed stepan arkadyevitch  just as he had done before to levin
anna karenina 129 of 1759 vronsky smiled with a look that seemed to say that he did not deny it  but he promptly changed the subject
  x2018 and whom are you meeting   he asked
 i  i ve come to meet a pretty woman   said oblonsky
 you don t say so    honi soit qui mal y pense  my sister anna    ah  that s madame karenina   said vronsky
 you know her  no doubt    i think i do
or perhaps not   i really am not sure   vronsky answered heedlessly  with a vague recollection of something stiff and tedious evoked by the name karenina
 but alexey alexandrovitch  my celebrated brother inlaw  you surely must know
all the world knows him    i know him by reputation and by sight
i know that he s clever  learned  religious somewhat   
but you know that s not   not in my line   said vronsky in english
 yes  he s a very remarkable man  rather a conservative  but a splendid man   observed stepan arkadyevitch   a splendid man    oh  well  so much the better for him   said vronsky smiling
 oh  you ve come   he said  addressing a tall old footman of his mother s  standing at the door   come here   anna karenina 130 of 1759 besides the charm oblonsky had in general for everyone  vronsky had felt of late specially drawn to him by the fact that in his imagination he was associated with kitty
 well  what do you say  shall we give a supper on sunday for the diva   he said to him with a smile  taking his arm
 of course
i m collecting subscriptions
oh  did yo make the acquaintance of my friend levin   asked stepan arkadyevitch
 yes  but he left rather early    he s a capital fellow   pursued oblonsky
 isn t he    i don t know why it is   responded vronsky   in all moscow people present company of course excepted   he put in jestingly   there s something uncompromising
they are all on the defensive  lose their tempers  as though they all want to make one feel something     yes  that s true  it is so   said stepan arkadyevitch  laughing good humoredly
 will the train soon be in   vronsky asked a railway official
 the train s signaled   answered the man
the approach of the train was more and more evident by the preparatory bustle in the station  the rush of porters  anna karenina 131 of 1759 the movement of policemen and attendants  and people meeting the train
through the frosty vapor could be seen workmen in short sheepskins and soft felt boots crossing the rails of the curving line
the hiss of the boiler could be heard on the distant rails  and the rumble of something heavy
 no   said stepan arkadyevitch  who felt a great inclination to tell vronsky of levin s intentions in regard to kitty
 no  you ve not got a true impression of levin
he s a very nervous man  and is sometimes out of humor  it s true  but then he is often very nice
he s such a true  honest nature  and a heart of gold
but yesterday there were special reasons   pursued stepan arkadyevitch  with a meaning smile  totally oblivious of the genuine sympathy he had felt the day before for his friend  and feeling the same sympathy now  only for vronsky
 yes  there were reasons why he could not help being either particularly happy or particularly unhappy   vronsky stood still and asked directly   how so  do you mean he made your belle soeur an offer yesterday    maybe   said stepan arkadyevitch
 i fancied something of the sort yesterday
yes  if he went away early  and was out of humor too  it must mean it   
he s been so long in love  and i m very sorry for him   anna karenina 132 of 1759  so that s it  i should imagine  though  she might reckon on a better match   said vronsky  drawing himself up and walking about again   though i don t know him  of course   he added  yes  that is a hateful position  that s why most fellows prefer to have to do with klaras
if you don t succeed with them it only proves that you ve not enough cash  but in this case one s dignity s at stake
but here s the train   the engine had already whistled in the distance
a few instants later the platform was quivering  and with puffs of steam hanging low in the air from the frost  the engine rolled up  with the lever of the middle wheel rhythmically moving up and down  and the stooping figure of the engine driver covered with frost
behind the tender  setting the platform more and more slowly swaying  came the luggage van with a dog whining in it
at last the passenger carriages rolled in  oscillating before coming to a standstill
a smart guard jumped out  giving a whistle  and after him one by one the impatient passengers began to get down  an officer of the guards  holding himself erect  and looking severely about him  a nimble little merchant with a satchel  smiling gaily  a peasant with a sack over his shoulder anna karenina 133 of 1759 vronsky  standing beside oblonsky  watched the carriages and the passengers  totally oblivious of his mother
what he had just heard about kitty excited and delighted him
unconsciously he arched his chest  and his eyes flashed
he felt himself a conqueror  countess vronskaya is in that compartment   said the smart guard  going up to vronsky
the guard s words roused him  and forced him to think of his mother and his approaching meeting with her
he did not in his heart respect his mother  and without acknowledging it to himself  he did not love her  though in accordance with the ideas of the set in which he lived  and with his own education  he could not have conceived of any behavior to his mother not in the highest degree respectful and obedient  and the more externally obedient and respectful his behavior  the less in his heart he respected and loved her anna karenina 134 of 1759 vronsky followed the guard to the carriage  and at the door of the compartment he stopped short to make room for a lady who was getting out
with the insight of a man of the world  from one glance at this lady s appearance vronsky classified her as belonging to the best society
he begged pardon  and was getting into the carriage  but felt he must glance at her once more  not that she was very beautiful  not on account of the elegance and modest grace which were apparent in her whole figure  but because in the expression of her charming face  as she passed close by him  there was something peculiarly caressing and soft
as he looked round  she too turned her head
her shining gray eyes  that looked dark from the thick lashes  rested with friendly attention on his face  as though she were recognizing him  and then promptly turned away to the passing crowd  as though seeking someone
in that brief look vronsky had time to notice the suppressed eagerness which played over her face  and flitted between the brilliant eyes and the faint smile that curved her red lips
it was as though her nature were so brimming over with anna karenina 135 of 1759 something that against her will it showed itself now in the flash of her eyes  and now in her smile
deliberately she shrouded the light in her eyes  but it shone against her will in the faintly perceptible smile
vronsky stepped into the carriage
his mother  a driedup old lady with black eyes and ringlets  screwed up her eyes  scanning her son  and smiled slightly with her thin lips
getting up from the seat and handing her maid a bag  she gave her little wrinkled hand to her son to kiss  and lifting his head from her hand  kissed him on the cheek
 you got my telegram  quite well  thank god    you had a good journey   said her son  sitting down beside her  and involuntarily listening to a woman s voice outside the door
he knew it was the voice of the lady he had met at the door
 all the same i don t agree with you   said the lady s voice
 it s the petersburg view  madame    not petersburg  but simply feminine   she responded
 well  well  allow me to kiss your hand    good bye  ivan petrovitch
and could you see if my brother is here  and send him to me   said the lady in the doorway  and stepped back again into the compartment
anna karenina 136 of 1759  well  have you found your brother   said countess vronskaya  addressing the lady
vronsky understood now that this was madame karenina
 your brother is here   he said  standing up
 excuse me  i did not know you  and  indeed  our acquaintance was so slight   said vronsky  bowing   that no doubt you do not remember me    oh  no   said she   i should have known you because your mother and i have been talking  i think  of nothing but you all the way   as she spoke she let the eagerness that would insist on coming out show itself in her smile
 and still no sign of my brother    do call him  alexey   said the old countess
vronsky stepped out onto the platform and shouted   oblonsky  here   madame karenina  however  did not wait for her brother  but catching sight of him she stepped out with her light  resolute step
and as soon as her brother had reached her  with a gesture that struck vronsky by its decision and its grace  she flung her left arm around his neck  drew him rapidly to her  and kissed him warmly
vronsky gazed  never taking his eyes from her  and smiled  he could not have said why
but recollecting that his anna karenina 137 of 1759 mother was waiting for him  he went back again into the carriage
 she s very sweet  isn t she   said the countess of madame karenina
 her husband put her with me  and i was delighted to have her
we ve been talking all the way
and so you  i hear   vous filez le parfait amour
tant mieux  mon cher  tant mieux    i don t know what you are referring to  maman   he answered coldly
 come  maman  let us go   madame karenina entered the carriage again to say good bye to the countess
 well  countess  you have met your son  and i my brother   she said
 and all my gossip is exhausted
i should have nothing more to tell you    oh  no   said the countess  taking her hand
 i could go all around the world with you and never be dull
you are one of those delightful women in whose company it s sweet to be silent as well as to talk
now please don t fret over your son  you can t expect never to be parted   madame karenina stood quite still  holding herself very erect  and her eyes were smiling
 anna arkadyevna   the countess said in explanation to her son   has a little son eight years old  i believe  and she anna karenina 138 of 1759 has never been parted from him before  and she keeps fretting over leaving him    yes  the countess and i have been talking all the time  i of my son and she of hers   said madame karenina  and again a smile lighted up her face  a caressing smile intended for him
 i am afraid that you must have been dreadfully bored   he said  promptly catching the ball of coquetry she had flung him
but apparently she did not care to pursue the conversation in that strain  and she turned to the old countess
 thank you so much
the time has passed so quickly
good bye  countess    good bye  my love   answered the countess
 let me have a kiss of your pretty face
i speak plainly  at my age  and i tell you simply that i ve lost my heart to you   stereotyped as the phrase was  madame karenina obviously believed it and was delighted by it
she flushed  bent down slightly  and put her cheek to the countess s lips  drew herself up again  and with the same smile fluttering between her lips and her eyes  she gave her hand to vronsky
he pressed the little hand she gave him  and was delighted  as though at something special  by the energetic squeeze with which she freely and vigorously anna karenina 139 of 1759 shook his hand
she went out with the rapid step which bore her rather fully developed figure with such strange lightness
 very charming   said the countess
that was just what her son was thinking
his eyes followed her till her graceful figure was out of sight  and then the smile remained on his face
he saw out of the window how she went up to her brother  put her arm in his  and began telling him something eagerly  obviously something that had nothing to do with him  vronsky  and at that he felt annoyed
 well  maman  are you perfectly well   he repeated  turning to his mother
 everything has been delightful
alexander has been very good  and marie has grown very pretty
she s very interesting   and she began telling him again of what interested her most the christening of her grandson  for which she had been staying in petersburg  and the special favor shown her elder son by the tsar
 here s lavrenty   said vronsky  looking out of the window   now we can go  if you like   anna karenina 140 of 1759 the old butler who had traveled with the countess  came to the carriage to announce that everything was ready  and the countess got up to go
 come  there s not such a crowd now   said vronsky
the maid took a handbag and the lap dog  the butler and a porter the other baggage
vronsky gave his mother his arm  but just as they were getting out of the carriage several men ran suddenly by with panic stricken faces
the station master  too  ran by in his extraordinary colored cap
obviously something unusual had happened
the crowd who had left the train were running back again
 what   
what   
where   
flung himself    crushed      was heard among the crowd
stepan arkadyevitch  with his sister on his arm  turned back
they too looked scared  and stopped at the carriage door to avoid the crowd
the ladies go in  while vronsky and stepan arkadyevitch followed the crowd to find out details of the disaster
a guard  either dunk or too much muffled up in the bitter frost  had not heard the train moving back  and had been crushed
anna karenina 141 of 1759 before vronsky and oblonsky came back the ladies heard the facts from the butler
oblonsky and vronsky had both seen the mutilated corpse
oblonsky was evidently upset
he frowned and seemed ready to cry
 ah  how awful  ah  anna  if you had seen it  ah  how awful   he said
vronsky did not speak  his handsome face was serious  but perfectly composed
 oh  if you had seen it  countess   said stepan arkadyevitch
 and his wife was there   
it was awful to see her    
she flung herself on the body
they say he was the only support of an immense family
how awful    couldn t one do anything for her   said madame karenina in an agitated whisper
vronsky glanced at her  and immediately got out of the carriage
 i ll be back directly  maman   he remarked  turning round in the doorway
when he came back a few minutes later  stepan arkadyevitch was already in conversation with the countess about the new singer  while the countess was impatiently looking towards the door  waiting for her son
anna karenina 142 of 1759  now let us be off   said vronsky  coming in
they went out together
vronsky was in front with his mother
behind walked madame karenina with her brother
just as they were going out of the station the station master overtook vronsky
 you gave my assistant two hundred roubles
would you kindly explain for whose benefit you intend them    for the widow   said vronsky  shrugging his shoulders
 i should have thought there was no need to ask    you gave that   cried oblonsky  behind  and  pressing his sister s hand  he added   very nice  very nice  isn t he a splendid fellow  good bye  countess   and he and his sister stood still  looking for her maid
when they went out the vronsky s carriage had already driven away
people coming in were still talking of what happened
 what a horrible death   said a gentleman  passing by
 they say he was cut in two pieces    on the contrary  i think it s the easiest  instantaneous   observed another
 how is it they don t take proper precautions   said a third
anna karenina 143 of 1759 madame karenina seated herself in the carriage  and stepan arkadyevitch saw with surprise that her lips were quivering  and she was with difficulty restraining her tears
 what is it  anna   he asked  when they had driven a few hundred yards
 it s an omen of evil   she said
 what nonsense   said stepan arkadyevitch
 you ve come  that s the chief thing
you can t conceive how i m resting my hopes on you    have you known vronsky long   she asked
 yes
you know we re hoping he will marry kitty    yes   said anna softly
 come now  let us talk of you   she added  tossing her head  as though she would physically shake off something superfluous oppressing her
 let us talk of your affairs
i got your letter  and here i am    yes  all my hopes are in you   said stepan arkadyevitch
 well  tell me all about it   and stepan arkadyevitch began to tell his story
on reaching home oblonsky helped his sister out  sighed  pressed her hand  and set off to his office
anna karenina 144 of 1759 when anna went into the room  dolly was sitting in the little drawing room with a white headed fat little boy  already like his father  giving him a lesson in french reading
as the boy read  he kept twisting and trying to tear off a button that was nearly off his jacket
his mother had several times taken his hand from it  but the fat little hand went back to the button again
his mother pulled the button off and put it in her pocket
 keep your hands still  grisha   she said  and she took up her work  a coverlet she had long been making
she always set to work on it at depressed moments  and now she knitted at it nervously  twitching her fingers and counting the stitches
though she had sent word the day before to her husband that it was nothing to her whether his sister came or not  she had made everything ready for her arrival  and was expecting her sister in law with emotion
dolly was crushed by her sorrow  utterly swallowed up by it
still she did not forget that anna  her sister in law  was the wife of one of the most important personages in petersburg  and was a petersburg grande dame
and  anna karenina 145 of 1759 thanks to this circumstance  she did not carry out her threat to her husband that is to say  she remembered that her sister in law was coming  and  after all  anna is in no wise to blame   thought dolly
 i know nothing of her except the very best  and i have seen nothing but kindness and affection from her towards myself   it was true that as far as she could recall her impressions at petersburg at the karenins   she did not like their household itself  there was something artificial in the whole framework of their family life
 but why should i not receive her  if only she doesn t take it into her head to console me   thought dolly
 all consolation and counsel and christian forgiveness  all that i have thought over a thousand times  and it s all no use   all these days dolly had been alone with her children
she did not want to talk of her sorrow  but with that sorrow in her heart she could not talk of outside matters
she knew that in one way or another she would tell anna everything  and she was alternately glad at the thought of speaking freely  and angry at the necessity of speaking of her humiliation with her  his sister  and of hearing her ready made phrases of good advice and comfort
she had been on the lookout for her  glancing at her watch every minute  and  as so often happens  let slip just that minute when her visitor arrived  so that she did not hear the bell
anna karenina 146 of 1759 catching a sound of skirts and light steps at the door  she looked round  and her care worn face unconsciously expressed not gladness  but wonder
she got up and embraced her sister in law
 what  here already   she said as she kissed her
 dolly  how glad i am to see you    i am glad  too   said dolly  faintly smiling  and trying by the expression of anna s face to find out whether she knew
 most likely she knows   she thought  noticing the sympathy in anna s face
 well  come along  i ll take you to your room   she went on  trying to defer as long as possible the moment of confidences
 is this grisha  heavens  how he s grown   said anna  and kissing him  never taking her eyes off dolly  she stood still and flushed a little
 no  please  let us stay here   she took off her kerchief and her hat  and catching it in a lock of her black hair  which was a mass of curls  she tossed her head and shook her hair down
 you are radiant with health and happiness   said dolly  almost with envy
 i    
yes   said anna
 merciful heavens  tanya  you re the same age as my seryozha   she added  addressing the little girl as she ran in
she took her in her anna karenina 147 of 1759 arms and kissed her  delightful child  delightful  show me them all   she mentioned them  not only remembering the names  but the years  months  characters  illnesses of all the children  and dolly could not but appreciate that
 very well  we will go to them   she said
 it s a pity vassya s asleep   after seeing the children  they sat down  alone now  in the drawing room  to coffee
anna took the tray  and then pushed it away from her
 dolly   she said   he has told me   dolly looked coldly at anna  she was waiting now for phrases of conventional sympathy  but anna said nothing of the sort
 dolly  dear   she said   i don t want to speak for him to you  nor to try to comfort you  that s impossible
but  darling  i m simply sorry  sorry from my heart for you   under the thick lashes of her shining eyes tears suddenly glittered
she moved nearer to her sister in law and took her hand in her vigorous little hand
dolly did not shrink away  but her face did not lose its frigid expression
she said   to comfort me s impossible
everything s lost after what has happened  everything s over   anna karenina 148 of 1759 and directly she had said this  her face suddenly softened
anna lifted the wasted  thin hand of dolly  kissed it and said   but  dolly  what s to be done  what s to be done  how is it best to act in this awful position that s what you must think of    all s over  and there s nothing more   said dolly
 and the worst of all is  you see  that i can t cast him off  there are the children  i am tied
and i can t live with him  it s a torture to me to see him    dolly  darling  he has spoken to me  but i want to hear it from you  tell me about it   dolly looked at her inquiringly
sympathy and love unfeigned were visible on anna s face
 very well   she said all at once
 but i will tell you it from the beginning
you know how i was married
with the education mamma gave us i was more than innocent  i was stupid
i knew nothing
i know they say men tell their wives of their former lives  but stiva  she corrected herself  stepan arkadyevitch told me nothing
you ll hardly believe it  but till now i imagined that i was the only woman he had known
so i lived eight years
you must understand that i was so far from suspecting anna karenina 149 of 1759 infidelity  i regarded it as impossible  and then  try to imagine it with such ideas  to find out suddenly all the horror  all the loathsomeness   
you must try and understand me
to be fully convinced of one s happiness  and all at once     continued dolly  holding back her sobs   to get a letter   his letter to his mistress  my governess
no  it s too awful   she hastily pulled out her handkerchief and hid her face in it
 i can understand being carried away by feeling   she went on after a brief silence   but deliberately  slyly deceiving me   and with whom   
to go on being my husband together with her   it s awful  you can t understand     oh  yes  i understand  i understand  dolly  dearest  i do understand   said anna  pressing her hand
 and do you imagine he realizes all the awfulness of my position   dolly resumed
 not the slightest  he s happy and contented    oh  no   anna interposed quickly
 he s to be pitied  he s weighed down by remorse     is he capable of remorse   dolly interrupted  gazing intently into her sister in law s face
 yes
i know him
i could not look at him without feeling sorry for him
we both know him
he s goodhearted  but he s proud  and now he s so humiliated
what anna karenina 150 of 1759 touched me most      and here anna guessed what would touch dolly most   he s tortured by two things  that he s ashamed for the children s sake  and that  loving you yes  yes  loving you beyond everything on earth   she hurriedly interrupted dolly  who would have answered   he has hurt you  pierced you to the heart
 no  no  she cannot forgive me   he keeps saying   dolly looked dreamily away beyond her sister in law as she listened to her words
 yes  i can see that his position is awful  it s worse for the guilty than the innocent   she said   if he feels that all the misery comes from his fault
but how am i to forgive him  how am i to be his wife again after her  for me to live with him now would be torture  just because i love my past love for him    and sobs cut short her words
but as though of set design  each time she was softened she began to speak again of what exasperated her
 she s young  you see  she s pretty   she went on
 do you know  anna  my youth and my beauty are gone  taken by whom  by him and his children
i have worked for him  and all i had has gone in his service  and now of course any fresh  vulgar creature has more charm for him
anna karenina 151 of 1759 no doubt they talked of me together  or  worse still  they were silent
do you understand   again her eyes glowed with hatred
 and after that he will tell me   
what  can i believe him  never  no  everything is over  everything that once made my comfort  the reward of my work  and my sufferings   
would you believe it  i was teaching grisha just now  once this was a joy to me  now it is a torture
what have i to strive and toil for  why are the children here  what s so awful is that all at once my heart s turned  and instead of love and tenderness  i have nothing but hatred for him  yes  hatred
i could kill him    darling dolly  i understand  but don t torture yourself
you are so distressed  so overwrought  that you look at many things mistakenly   dolly grew calmer  and for two minutes both were silent
 what s to be done  think for me  anna  help me
i have thought over everything  and i see nothing   anna could think of nothing  but her heart responded instantly to each word  to each change of expression of her sister in law
 one thing i would say   began anna
 i am his sister  i know his character  that faculty of forgetting everything  anna karenina 152 of 1759 everything   she waved her hand before her forehead    that faculty for being completely carried away  but for completely repenting too
he cannot believe it  he cannot comprehend now how he can have acted as he did    no  he understands  he understood   dolly broke in
 but i   you are forgetting me   does it make it easier for me    wait a minute
when he told me  i will own i did not realize all the awfulness of your position
i saw nothing but him  and that the family was broken up
i felt sorry for him  but after talking to you  i see it  as a woman  quite differently
i see your agony  and i can t tell you how sorry i am for you  but  dolly  darling  i fully realize your sufferings  only there is one thing i don t know  i don t know   i don t know how much love there is still in your heart for him
that you know whether there is enough for you to be able to forgive him
if there is  forgive him    no   dolly was beginning  but anna cut her short  kissing her hand once more
 i know more of the world than you do   she said
 i know how met like stiva look at it
you speak of his talking of you with her
that never happened
such men are unfaithful  but their home and wife are sacred to them
somehow or other these women are still looked on with anna karenina 153 of 1759 contempt by them  and do not touch on their feeling for their family
they draw a sort of line that can t be crossed between them and their families
i don t understand it  but it is so    yes  but he has kissed her     dolly  hush  darling
i saw stiva when he was in love with you
i remember the time when he came to me and cried  talking of you  and all the poetry and loftiness of his feeling for you  and i know that the longer he has lived with you the loftier you have been in his eyes
you know we have sometimes laughed at him for putting in at every word   dolly s a marvelous woman   you have always been a divinity for him  and you are that still  and this has not been an infidelity of the heart     but if it is repeated    it cannot be  as i understand it     yes  but could you forgive it    i don t know  i can t judge   
yes  i can   said anna  thinking a moment  and grasping the position in her thought and weighing it in her inner balance  she added   yes  i can  i can  i can
yes  i could forgive it
i could not be the same  no  but i could forgive it  and forgive it as though it had never been  never been at all    anna karenina 154 of 1759  oh  of course   dolly interposed quickly  as though saying what she had more than once thought   else it would not be forgiveness
if one forgives  it must be completely  completely
come  let us go  i ll take you to your room   she said  getting up  and on the way she embraced anna
 my dear  how glad i am you came
it has made things better  ever so much better   anna karenina 155 of 1759 the whole of that day anna spent at home  that s to say at the oblonskys   and received no one  though some of her acquaintances had already heard of her arrival  and came to call  the same day
anna spent the whole morning with dolly and the children
she merely sent a brief note to her brother to tell him that he must not fail to dine at home
 come  god is merciful   she wrote
oblonsky did dine at home  the conversation was general  and his wife  speaking to him  addressed him as  stiva   as she had not done before
in the relations of the husband and wife the same estrangement still remained  but there was no talk now of separation  and stepan arkadyevitch saw the possibility of explanation and reconciliation
immediately after dinner kitty came in
she knew anna arkadyevna  but only very slightly  and she came now to her sister s with some trepidation  at the prospect of meeting this fashionable petersburg lady  whom everyone spoke so highly of
but she made a favorable impression on anna arkadyevna she saw that at once
anna was unmistakably admiring her loveliness and her anna karenina 156 of 1759 youth  before kitty knew where she was she found herself not merely under anna s sway  but in love with her  as young girls do fall in love with older and married women
anna was not like a fashionable lady  nor the mother of a boy of eight years old
in the elasticity of her movements  the freshness and the unflagging eagerness which persisted in her face  and broke out in her smile and her glance  she would rather have passed for a girl of twenty  had it not been for a serious and at times mournful look in her eyes  which struck and attracted kitty
kitty felt that anna was perfectly simple and was concealing nothing  but that she had another higher world of interests inaccessible to her  complex and poetic
after dinner  when dolly went away to her own room  anna rose quickly and went up to her brother  who was just lighting a cigar
 stiva   she said to him  winking gaily  crossing him and glancing towards the door   go  and god help you   he threw down the cigar  understanding her  and departed through the doorway
when stepan arkadyevitch had disappeared  she went back to the sofa where she had been sitting  surrounded by the children
either because the children saw that their mother was fond of this aunt  or that they felt a special anna karenina 157 of 1759 charm in her themselves  the two elder ones  and the younger following their lead  as children so often do  had clung about their new aunt since before dinner  and would not leave her side and it had become a sort of game among them to sit a close as possible to their aunt  to touch her  hold her little hand  kiss it  play with her ring  or even touch the flounce of her skirt
 come  come  as we were sitting before   said anna arkadyevna  sitting down in her place
and again grisha poked his little face under her arm  and nestled with his head on her gown  beaming with pride and happiness
 and when is your next ball   she asked kitty
 next week  and a splendid ball
one of those balls where one always enjoys oneself    why  are there balls where one always enjoys oneself   anna said  with tender irony
 it s strange  but there are
at the bobrishtchevs  one always enjoys oneself  and at the nikitins  too  while at the mezhkovs  it s always dull
haven t you noticed it    no  my dear  for me there are no balls now where one enjoys oneself   said anna  and kitty detected in her eyes that mysterious world which was not open to her
 for me there are some less dull and tiresome   anna karenina 158 of 1759  how can you be dull at a ball    why should not i be dull at a ball   inquired anna
kitty perceived that anna knew what answer would follow
 because you always look nicer than anyone   anna had the faculty of blushing
she blushed a little  and said   in the first place it s never so  and secondly  if it were  what difference would it make to me    are you coming to this ball   asked kitty
 i imagine it won t be possible to avoid going
here  take it   she said to tanya  who was bulling the looselyfitting ring off her white  slender tipped finger
 i shall be so glad if you go
i should so like to see you at a ball    anyway  if i do go  i shall comfort myself with the thought that it s a pleasure to you   grisha  don t pull my hair
it s untidy enough without that   she said  putting up a straying lock  which grisha had been playing with
 i imagine you at the ball in lilac    and why in lilac precisely   asked anna  smiling
 now  children  run along  run along
do you hear  miss hoole is calling you to tea   she said  tearing the children form her  and sending them off to the dining room
anna karenina 159 of 1759  i know why you press me to come to the ball
you expect a great deal of this ball  and you want everyone to be there to take part in it    how do you know  yes    oh  what a happy time you are at   pursued anna
 i remember  and i know that blue haze like the mist on the mountains in switzerland
that mist which covers everything in that blissful time when childhood is just ending  and out of that vast circle  happy and gay  there is a path growing narrower and narrower  and it is delightful and alarming to enter the ballroom  bright and splendid as it is   
who has not been through it   kitty smiled without speaking
 but how did she go through it  how i should like to know all her love story   thought kitty  recalling the unromantic appearance of alexey alexandrovitch  her husband
 i know something
stiva told me  and i congratulate you
i liked him so much   anna continued
 i met vronsky at the railway station    oh  was he there   asked kitty  blushing
 what was it stiva told you    stiva gossiped about it all
and i should be so glad   i traveled yesterday with vronsky s mother   she went on  anna karenina 160 of 1759  and his mother talked without a pause of him  he s her favorite
i know mothers are partial  but     what did his mother tell you    oh  a great deal  and i know that he s her favorite  still one can see how chivalrous he is   
well  for instance  she told me that he had wanted to give up all his property to his brother  that he had done something extraordinary when he was quite a child  saved a woman out of the water
he s a hero  in fact   said anna  smiling and recollecting the two hundred roubles he had given at the station
but she did not tell kitty about the two hundred roubles
for some reason it was disagreeable to her to think of it
she felt that there was something that had to do with her in it  and something that ought not to have been
 she pressed me very much to go and see her   anna went on   and i shall be glad to go to see her tomorrow
stiva is staying a long while in dolly s room  thank god   anna added  changing the subject  and getting up  kitty fancied  displeased with something
 no  i m first  no  i   screamed the children  who had finished tea  running up to their aunt anna
anna karenina 161 of 1759  all together   said anna  and she ran laughing to meet them  and embraced and swung round all the throng of swarming children  shrieking with delight
anna karenina 162 of 1759 dolly came out of her room to the tea of the grown up people
stepan arkadyevitch did not come out
he must have left his wife s room by the other door
 i am afraid you ll be cold upstairs   observed dolly  addressing anna   i want to move you downstairs  and we shall be nearer    oh  please  don t trouble about me   answered anna  looking intently into dolly s face  trying to make out whether there had been a reconciliation or not
 it will be lighter for you here   answered her sister inlaw
 i assure you that i sleep everywhere  and always like a marmot    what s the question   inquired stepan arkadyevitch  coming out of his room and addressing his wife
from his tone both kitty and anna knew that a reconciliation had taken place
 i want to move anna downstairs  but we must hang up blinds
no one knows how to do it  i must see to it myself   answered dolly addressing him
anna karenina 163 of 1759  god knows whether they are fully reconciled   thought anna  hearing her tone  cold and composed
 oh  nonsense  dolly  always making difficulties   answered her husband
 come  i ll do it all  if you like     yes  they must be reconciled   thought anna
 i know how you do everything   answered dolly
 you tell matvey to do what can t be done  and go away yourself  leaving him to make a muddle of everything   and her habitual  mocking smile curved the corners of dolly s lips as she spoke
 full  full reconciliation  full   thought anna   thank god   and rejoicing that she was the cause of it  she went up to dolly and kissed her
 not at all
why do you always look down on me and matvey   said stepan arkadyevitch  smiling hardly perceptibly  and addressing his wife
the whole evening dolly was  as always  a little mocking in her tone to her husband  while stepan arkadyevitch was happy and cheerful  but not so as to seem as though  having been forgiven  he had forgotten his offense
at half past nine o clock a particularly joyful and pleasant family conversation over the tea table at the oblonskys  was broken up by an apparently simple anna karenina 164 of 1759 incident
but this simple incident for some reason struck everyone as strange
talking about common acquaintances in petersburg  anna got up quickly
 she is in my album   she said   and  by the way  i ll show you by seryozha   she added  with a mother s smile of pride
towards ten o clock  when she usually said good night to her son  and often before going to a ball put him to bed herself  she felt depressed at being so far from him  and whatever she was talking about  she kept coming back in thought to her curly headed seryozha
she longed to look at his photograph and talk of him
seizing the first pretext  she got up  and with her light  resolute step went for her album
the stairs up to her room came out on the landing of the great warm main staircase
just as she was leaving the drawing room  a ring was heard in the hall
 who can that be   said dolly  it s early for me to be fetched  and for anyone else it s late   observed kitty  sure to be someone with papers for me   put in stepan arkadyevitch
when anna was passing the top of the staircase  a servant was running up to announce the visitor  while the visitor himself was standing under a lamp anna anna karenina 165 of 1759 glancing down at once recognized vronsky  and a strange feeling of pleasure and at the same time of dread of something stirred in her heart
he was standing still  not taking off his coat  pulling something out of his pocket
at the instant when she was just facing the stairs  he raised his eyes  caught sight of her  and into the expression of his face there passed a shade of embarrassment and dismay
with a slight inclination of her head she passed  hearing behind her stepan arkadyevitch s loud voice calling him to come up  and the quiet  soft  and composed voice of vronsky refusing
when anna returned with the album  he was already gone  and stepan arkadyevitch was telling them that he had called to inquire about the dinner they were giving next day to a celebrity who had just arrived
 and nothing would induce him to come up
what a queer fellow he is   added stepan arkadyevitch
kitty blushed
she thought that she was the only person who knew why he had come  and why he would not come up
 he has been at home   she thought   and didn t find me  and thought i should be here  but he did not come up because he thought it late  and anna s here   all of them looked at each other  saying nothing  and began to look at anna s album
anna karenina 166 of 1759 there was nothing either exceptional or strange in a man s calling at half past nine on a friend to inquire details of a proposed dinner party and not coming in  but it seemed strange to all of them
above all  it seemed strange and not right to anna
anna karenina 167 of 1759 the ball was only just beginning as kitty and her mother walked up the great staircase  flooded with light  and lined with flowers and footmen in powder and red coats
from the rooms came a constant  steady hum  as from a hive  and the rustle of movement  and while on the landing between trees they gave last touches to their hair and dresses before the mirror  they heard from the ballroom the careful  distinct notes of the fiddles of the orchestra beginning the first waltz a little old man in civilian dress  arranging his gray curls before another mirror  and diffusing an odor of scent  stumbled against them on the stairs  and stood aside  evidently admiring kitty  whom he did not know
a beardless youth  one of those society youths whom the old prince shtcherbatsky called  young bucks   in an exceedingly open waistcoat  straightening his white tie as he went  bowed to them  and after running by  came back to ask kitty for a quadrille
as the first quadrille had already been given to vronsky  she had to promise this youth the second
an officer  buttoning his glove  stood aside in the doorway  and stroking his mustache  admired rosy kitty
anna karenina 168 of 1759 although her dress  her coiffure  and all the preparations for the ball had cost kitty great trouble and consideration  at this moment she walked into the ballroom in her elaborate tulle dress over a pink slip as easily and simply as though all the rosettes and lace  all the minute details of her attire  had not cost her or her family a moment s attention  as though she had been born in that tulle and lace  with her hair done up high on her head  and a rose and two leaves on the top of it
when  just before entering the ballroom  the princess  her mother  tried to turn right side out of the ribbon of her sash  kitty had drawn back a little
she felt that everything must be right of itself  and graceful  and nothing could need setting straight
it was one of kitty s best days
her dress was not uncomfortable anywhere  her lace berthe did not droop anywhere  her rosettes were not crushed nor torn off  her pink slippers with high  hollowed out heels did not pinch  but gladdened her feet  and the thick rolls of fair chignon kept up on her head as if they were her own hair
all the three buttons buttoned up without tearing on the long glove that covered her hand without concealing its lines
the black velvet of her locket nestled with special softness round her neck
that velvet was delicious  at home  anna karenina 169 of 1759 looking at her neck in the looking glass  kitty had felt that that velvet was speaking
about all the rest there might be a doubt  but the velvet was delicious
kitty smiled here too  at the ball  when she glanced at it in the glass
her bare shoulders and arms gave kitty a sense of chill marble  a feeling she particularly liked her eyes sparkled  and her rosy lips could not keep from smiling from the consciousness of her own attractiveness
she had scarcely entered the ballroom and reached the throng of ladies  all tulle  ribbons  lace  and flowers  waiting to be asked to dance kitty was never one of that throng when she was asked for a waltz  and asked by the best partner  the first star in the hierarchy of the ballroom  a renowned director of dances  a married man  handsome and wellbuilt  yegorushka korsunsky
he had only just left the countess bonina  with whom he had danced the first half of the waltz  and  scanning his kingdom that is to say  a few couples who had started dancing he caught sight of kitty  entering  and flew up to her with that peculiar  easy amble which is confined to directors of balls
without even asking her if she cared to dance  he put out his arm to encircle her slender waist
she looked round for someone to give her fan to  and their hostess  smiling to her  took it
anna karenina 170 of 1759  how nice you ve come in good time   he said to her  embracing her waist   such a bad habit to be late   bending her left hand  she laid it on his shoulder  and her little feet in their pink slippers began swiftly  lightly  and rhythmically moving over the slippery floor in time to the music
 it s a rest to waltz with you   he said to her  as they fell into the first slow steps of the waltz
 it s exquisite such lightness  precision   he said to her the same thing he said to almost all his partners whom he knew well
she smiled at his praise  and continued to look about the room over his shoulder
she was not like a girl at her first ball  for whom all faces in the ballroom melt into one vision of fairyland
and she was not a girl who had gone the stale round of balls till every face in the ballroom was familiar and tiresome
but she was in the middle stage between these two  she was excited  and at the same time she had sufficient self possession to be able to observe
in the left corner of the ballroom she saw the cream of society gathered together
there incredibly naked was the beauty lidi  korsunsky s wife  there was the lady of the house  there shone the bald head of krivin  always to be found where the best people were
in that direction gazed the young men  not venturing to approach
there  anna karenina 171 of 1759 too  she descried stiva  and there she saw the exquisite figure and head of anna in a black velvet gown
and he was there
kitty had not seen him since the evening she refused levin
with her long sighted eyes  she knew him at once  and was even aware that he was looking at her
 another turn  eh  you re not tired   said korsunsky  a little out of breath
 no  thank you    where shall i take you    madame karenina s here  i think   take me to her    wherever you command   and korsunsky began waltzing with measured steps straight towards the group in the left corner  continually saying   pardon  mesdames  pardon  pardon  mesdames   and steering his course through the sea of lace  tulle  and ribbon  and not disarranging a feather  he turned his partner sharply round  so that her slim ankles  in light transparent stockings  were exposed to view  and her train floated out in fan shape and covered krivin s knees
korsunky bowed  set straight his open shirt front  and gave her his arm to conduct her to anna arkadyevna
kitty  flushed  took her train from krivin s knees  and  a little giddy  looked round  seeking anna
anna was not in lilac  as kitty had so urgently wished  but in a black  low cut  anna karenina 172 of 1759 velvet gown  showing her full throat and shoulders  that looked as though carved in old ivory  and her rounded arms  with tiny  slender wrists the whole gown was trimmed with venetian guipure
on her head  among her black hair her own  with no false additions was a little wreath of pansies  and a bouquet of the same in the black ribbon of her sash among white lace
her coiffure was not striking
all that was noticeable was the little wilful tendrils of her curly hair that would always break free about her neck and temples
round her well cut  strong neck was a thread of pearls
kitty had been seeing anna every day  she adored her  and had pictured her invariably in lilac
but now seeing her in black  she felt that she had not fully seen her charm
she saw her now as someone quite new and surprising to her
now she understood that anna could not have been in lilac  and that her charm was just that she always stood out against her attire  that her dress could never be noticeable on her
and her black dress  with its sumptuous lace  was not noticeable on her  it was only the frame  and all that was seen was she simple  natural  elegant  and at the same time gay and eager
she was standing holding herself  as always  very erect  and when kitty drew near the group she was speaking to anna karenina 173 of 1759 the master of the house  her head slightly turned towards him
 no  i don t throw stones   she was saying  in answer to something   though i can t understand it   she went on  shrugging her shoulders  and she turned at once with a soft smile of protection towards kitty
with a flying  feminine glance she scanned her attire  and made a movement of her head  hardly perceptible  but understood by kitty  signifying approval of her dress and her looks
 you came into the room dancing   she added
 this is one of my most faithful supporters   said korsunsky  bowing to anna arkadyevna  whom he had not yet seen
 the princess helps to make balls happy and successful
anna arkadyevna  a waltz   he said  bending down to her
 why  have yo met   inquired their host
 is there anyone we have not met  my wife and i are like white wolves everyone knows us   answered korsunsky
 a waltz  anna arkadyevna    i don t dance when it s possible not to dance   she said
 but tonight it s impossible   answered korsunsky
at that instant vronsky came up
anna karenina 174 of 1759  well  since it s impossible tonight  let us start   she said  not noticing vronsky s bow  and she hastily put her hand on korsunsky s shoulder
 what is she vexed with him about   thought kitty  discerning that anna had intentionally not responded to vronsky s bow
vronsky went up to kitty reminding her of the first quadrille  and expressing his regret that he had not seen her all this time
kitty gazed in admiration at anna waltzing  and listened to him
she expected him to ask her for a waltz  but he did not  and she glanced wonderingly at him
he flushed slightly  and hurriedly asked her to waltz  but he had only just put his arm round her waist and taken the first step when the music suddenly stopped
kitty looked into his face  which was so close to her own  and long afterwards for several years after that look  full of love  to which he made no response  cut her to the heart with an agony of shame
 pardon  pardon  waltz  waltz   shouted korsunsky from the other side of the room  and seizing the first young lady he came across he began dancing himself anna karenina 175 of 1759 vronsky and kitty waltzed several times round the room
after the first waltz kitty went to her mother  and she had hardly time to say a few words to countess nordston when vronsky came up again for the first quadrille
during the quadrille nothing of any significance was said  there was disjointed talk between them of the korsunskys  husband and wife  whom he described very amusingly  as delightful children at forty  and of the future town theater  and only once the conversation touched her to the quick  when he asker her about levin  whether he was here  and added that he liked him so much
but kitty did not expect much from the quadrille
she looked forward with a thrill at her heart to the mazurka
she fancied that in the mazurka everything must be decided
the fact that he did not during the quadrille ask her for the mazurka did not trouble her
she felt sure she would dance the mazurka with him as she had done at former balls  and refused five young men  saying she was engaged for the mazurka
the whole ball up to the last quadrille was for kitty an enchanted vision of delightful colors  sounds  and motions
she only sat down when she felt too anna karenina 176 of 1759 tired and begged for a rest
but as she was dancing the last quadrille with one of the tiresome young men whom she could not refuse  she chanced to be vis a vis with vronsky and anna
she had not been near anna again since the beginning of the evening  and now again she saw her suddenly quite new and surprising
she saw in her the signs of that excitement of success she knew so well in herself  she saw that she was intoxicated with the delighted admiration she was exciting
she knew that feeling and knew its signs  and saw them in anna  saw the quivering  flashing light in her eyes  and the smile of happiness and excitement unconsciously playing on her lips  and the deliberate grace  precision  and lightness of her movements
 who   she asked herself
 all or one   and not assisting the harassed young man she was dancing with in the conversation  the thread of which he had lost and could not pick up again  she obeyed with external liveliness the peremptory shouts of korsunsky starting them all into the grand round  and then into the chaine  and at the same time she kept watch with a growing pang at her heart
 no  it s not the admiration of the crowd has intoxicated her  but the adoration of one
and that one  can it be he   every time he spoke to anna the joyous light flashed into anna karenina 177 of 1759 her eyes  and the smile of happiness curved her red lips
she seemed to make an effort to control herself  to try not to show these signs of delight  but they came out on her face of themselves  but what of him   kitty looked at him and was filled with terror
what was pictured so clearly to kitty in the mirror of anna s face she saw in him
what had become of his always self possessed resolute manner  and the carelessly serene expression of his face  now every time he turned to her  he bent his head  as though he would have fallen at her feet  and in his eyes there was nothing but humble submission and dread
 i would not offend you   his eyes seemed every time to be saying   but i want to save myself  and i don t know how   on his face was a look such as kitty have never seen before
they were speaking of common acquaintances  keeping up the most trivial conversation  but to kitty it seemed that every word they said was determining their fate and hers
and strange it was that they were actually talking of how absurd ivan ivanovitch was with his french  and how the eletsky girl might have made a better match  yet these words had all the while consequence for them  and they were feeling just as kitty did
the whole ball  the whole world  everything seemed lost in fog in kitty s soul
nothing but the stern discipline of her anna karenina 178 of 1759 bringing up supported her and forced her to do what was expected of her  that is  to dance  to answer questions  to talk  even to smile
but before the mazurka  when they were beginning to rearrange the chairs and a few couples moved out of the smaller rooms into the big room  a moment of despair and horror came for kitty she had refused five partners  and now she was not dancing the mazurka
she had not even a hope of being asked for it  because she was so successful in society that the idea would never occur to anyone that she had remained disengaged till now
she would have to tell her mother she felt ill and go home  but she had not the strength to do this
she felt crushed
she went to the furthest end of the little drawing room and sank into a low chair
her light  transparent skirts rose like a cloud about her slender waist  one bare  thin  soft  girlish arm  hanging listlessly  was lost in the folds of her pink tunic  in the other she held her fan  and with rapid  short strokes fanned her burning face
but while she looked like a butterfly  clinging to a blade of grass  and just about to open its rainbow wings for fresh flight  her heart ached with a horrible despair
 but perhaps i am wrong  perhaps it was not so   and again she recalled all she had seen
anna karenina 179 of 1759  kitty  what is it   said countess nordston  stepping noiselessly over the carpet towards her
 i don t understand it   kitty s lower lip began to quiver  she got up quickly
 kitty  you re not dancing the mazurka    no  no   said kitty in a voice shaking with tears
 he asked her for the mazurka before me   said countess nordston  knowing kitty would understand who were  he  and  her    she said   why  aren t you going to dance it with princess shtcherbatskaya      oh  i don t care   answered kitty
no one but she herself understood her position  no one knew that she had just refused the man whom perhaps she loved  and refused him because she had put her faith in another
countess nordston found korsunsky  with whom she was to dance the mazurka  and told him to ask kitty
kitty danced in the first couple  and luckily for her she had not to talk  because korsunsky was all the time running about directing the figure
vronsky and anna sat almost opposite her
she saw them with her long sighted eyes  and saw them  too  close by  when they met in the figures  and the more she saw of them the more convinced was she that her unhappiness was complete
she saw that anna karenina 180 of 1759 they felt themselves alone in that crowded room and on vronsky s face  always so firm and independent  she saw that look that had struck her  of bewilderment and humble submissiveness  like the expression of an intelligent dog when it has done wrong
anna smiled  and her smile was reflected by him
she grew thoughtful  and he became serious
some supernatural force drew kitty s eyes to anna s face
she was fascinating in her simple black dress  fascinating were her round arms with their bracelets  fascinating was her firm neck with its thread of pearls  fascinating the straying curls of her loose hair  fascinating the graceful  light movements of her little feet and hands  fascinating was that lovely face in its eagerness  but there was something terrible and cruel in her fascination kitty admired her more than ever  and more and more acute was her suffering
kitty felt overwhelmed  and her face showed it
when vronsky saw her  coming across her in the mazurka  he did not at once recognize her  she was so changed
 delightful ball   he said to her  for the sake of saying something
 yes   she answered
anna karenina 181 of 1759 in the middle of the mazurka  repeating a complicated figure  newly invented by korsunsky  anna came forward into the center of the circle  chose two gentlemen  and summoned a lady and kitty
kitty gazed at her in dismay as she went up
anna looked at her with drooping eyelids  and smiled  pressing her had
but  noticing that kitty only responded to her smile by a look of despair and amazement  she turned away from her  and began gaily talking to the other lady
 yes  there is something uncanny  devilish and fascinating in her   kitty said to herself
anna did not mean to stay to supper  but the master of the house began to press her to do so
 nonsense  anna arkadyevna   said korsunsky  drawing her bare arm under the sleeve of his dress coat   i ve such an idea for a cotillion  un bijou   and he moved gradually on  trying to draw her along with him
their hose smiled approvingly
 no  i am not going to stay   answered anna  smiling  but in spite of her smile  both korsunsky and the master of the house saw from her resolute tone that she would not stay
 no  why  as it is  i have danced mor at your ball in moscow that i have all the winter in petersburg   said anna karenina 182 of 1759 anna  looking round at vronsky  who stood near her
 i must rest a little before my journey    are you certainly going tomorrow then   asked vronsky
 yes  i suppose so   answered anna  as it were wondering at the boldness of his question  but the irrepressible  quivering brilliance of her eyes and her smile set him on fire as she said it
anna arkadyevna did not stay to supper  but went home
anna karenina 183 of 1759  yes  there is something in be hatful  repulsive   thought levin  as he came away from the shtcherbatskys   and walked in the direction of his brother s lodgings
 and i don t get on with other people
pride  they say
no  i have no pride
if i had any pride  i should not have put myself in such a position   and he pictured to himself vronsky  happy  good natured  clever  and self possessed  certainly never placed in the awful position in which he had been that evening  yes  she was bound to choose him
so it had to be  and i cannot complain of anyone or anything
i am myself to blame
what right had i to imagine she would care to join her life to mine  whom am i and what am i  a nobody  not wanted by any one  nor of use to anybody   and he recalled his brother nikolay  and dwelt with pleasure on the thought of him
 isn t he right that everything in the world is base and loathsome  and are we fair in our judgment of brother nikolay  of course  from the point of view of prokofy  seeing him in a torn cloak and tipsy  he s a despicable person
but i know him differently
i know his soul  and know that we are like him
and i  instead of going to seek anna karenina 184 of 1759 him out  went out to dinner  and came here   levin walked up to a lamppost  read his brother s address  which was in his pocketbook  and called a sledge
all the long way to his brother s  levin vividly recalled all the facts familiar to him of his brother nikolay s life
he remembered how his brother  while at the university  and for a year afterwards  had  in spite of the jeers of his companions  lived like a monk  strictly observing all religious rites  services  and fasts  and avoiding every sort of pleasure  especially women
and afterwards  how he had all at once broken out  he had associated with the most horrible people  and rushed into the most senseless debauchery
he remembered later the scandal over a boy  whom he had taken from the country to bring up  and  in a fit of rage  had so violently beaten that proceedings were brought against him for unlawfully wounding
then he recalled the scandal with a sharper  to whom he had lost money  and given a promissory note  and against whom he had himself lodged a complaint  asserting that he had cheated him  this was the money sergey ivanovitch had paid   then he remembered how he had spent a night in the lockup for disorderly conduct in the street
he remembered the shameful proceedings he had tried to get up against his brother sergey ivanovitch  accusing him of anna karenina 185 of 1759 not having paid him his share of his mother s fortune  and the last scandal  when he had gone to a western province in an official capacity  and there had got into trouble for assaulting a village elder   
it was all horribly disgusting  yet to levin it appeared not at all in the same disgusting light as it inevitably would to those who did not know nikolay  did not know all his story  did not know his heart
levin remembered that when nikolay had been in the devout stage  the period of fasts and monks and church services  when he was seeking in religion a support and a curb for his passionate temperament  everyone  far from encouraging him  had jeered at him  and he  too  with the others
they had teased him  called him noah and monk  and  when he had broken out  no one had helped him  but everyone had turned away from him with horror and disgust
levin felt that  in spite of all the ugliness of his life  his brother nikolay  in his soul  in the very depths of his soul  was no more in the wrong than the people who despised him
he was not to blame for having been born with his unbridled temperament and his somehow limited intelligence
but he had always wanted to be good
 i will tell him everything  without reserve  and i will make him anna karenina 186 of 1759 speak without reserve  too  and i ll show him that i love him  and so understand him   levin resolved to himself  as  towards eleven o clock  he reached the hotel of which he had the address  at the top  12 and 13   the porter answered levin s inquiry
 at home    sure to be at home   the door of no
12 was half open  and there came out into the streak of light thick fumes of cheap  poor tobacco  and the sound of a voice  unknown to levin  but he knew at once that his brother was there  he heard his cough
as he went in the door  the unknown voice was saying   it all depends with how much judgment and knowledge the thing s done   konstantin levin looked in at the door  and saw that the speaker was a young man with an immense shock of hair  wearing a russian jerkin  and that a pockmarked woman in a woolen gown  without collar or cuffs  was sitting on the sofa
his brother was not to be seen
konstantin felt a sharp pang at his heart at the thought of the strange company in which his brother spent his life
no one had heard him  and konstantin  taking off his anna karenina 187 of 1759 galoshes  listened to what the gentleman in the jerkin was saying
he was speaking of some enterprise
 well  the devil flay them  the privileged classes   his brother s voice responded  with a cough
 masha  get us some supper and some wine if there s any left  or else go and get some   the woman rose  came out from behind the screen  and saw konstantin
 there s some gentleman  nikolay dmitrievitch   she said
 whom do you want   said the voice of nikolay levin  angrily
 it s i   answered konstantin levin  coming forward into the light
 who s i   nikolay s voice said again  still more angrily
he could be heard getting up hurriedly  stumbling against something  and levin saw  facing him in the doorway  the big  scared eyes  and the huge  thin  stooping figure of his brother  so familiar  and yet astonishing in it weirdness and sickliness
he was even thinner than three years before  when konstantin levin had seen him last
he was wearing a short coat  and his hands and big bones seemed huger than ever
his hair had grown thinner  the same straight anna karenina 188 of 1759 mustaches hid his lips  the same eyes gazed strangely and naively at his visitor
 ah  kostya   he exclaimed suddenly  recognizing his brother  and his eyes lit up with joy
but the same second he looked round at the young man  and gave the nervous jerk of his head and neck that konstantin knew so well  as if his neckband hurt him  and a quite different expression  wild  suffering  and cruel  rested on his emaciated fact
 i wrote to you and sergey ivanovitch both that i don t know you and don t want to know you
what is it you want   he was not at all the same as konstantin had been fancying him
the worst and most tiresome part of his character  what made all relations with him so difficult  had been forgotten by konstantin levin when he thought of him  and now  when he saw his face  and especially that nervous twitching of his head  he remembered it all
 i didn t want to see you for anything   he answered timidly
 i ve simply come to see you   his brother s timidity obviously softened nikolay
his lips twitched
 oh  so that s it   he said
 well  come in  sit down
like some supper  masha  bring supper for three
no  stop a minute
do you know who this is   he said  addressing anna karenina 189 of 1759 his brother  and indicating the gentleman in the jerkin   this is mr kritsky  my friend from kiev  a very remarkable man
he s persecuted by the police  of course  because he s not a scoundrel   and he looked round in the way he always did at everyone in the room
seeing that the woman standing in the doorway was moving to go  he shouted to her   wait a minute  i said   and with the inability to express himself  the incoherence that konstantin knew so well  he began  with another look round at everyone  to tell his brother kritsky s story  how he had been expelled from the university for starting a benefit society for the poor students and sunday schools  and how he had afterwards been a teacher in a peasant school  and how he had been driven out of that too  and had afterwards been condemned for something  you re of the kiev university   said konstantin levin to kritsky  to break the awkward silence that followed
 yes  i was of kiev   kritsky replied angrily  his face darkening
 and this woman   nikolay levin interrupted him  pointing to her   is the partner of my life  marya nikolaevna
i took her out of a bad house   and he jerked his neck saying this   but i love her and respect her  and anna karenina 190 of 1759 any one who wants to know me   he added  raising his voice and knitting his brows   i beg to love her and respect her
she s just the same as my wife  just the same
so now you know whom you ve to do with
and if you think you re lowering yourself  well  here s the floor  there s the door   and again his eyes traveled inquiringly over all of them
 why i should be lowering myself  i don t understand    then  masha  tell them to bring supper  three portions  spirits and wine   
no  wait a minute   
no  it doesn t matter   
go along   anna karenina 191 of 1759  so you see   pursued nikolay levin  painfully wrinkling his forehead and twitching
it was obviously difficult for him to think of what to say and do
 here  do you see    
he pointed to some sort of iron bars  fastened together with strings  lying in a corner of the room
 do you see that  that s the beginning of a new thing we re going into
it s a productive association    konstantin scarcely heard him
he looked into his sickly  consumptive face  and he was more and more sorry for him  and he could not force himself to listen to what his brother was telling him about the association he saw that this association was a mere anchor to save him from self contempt
nikolay levin went on talking   you know that capital oppresses the laborer
the laborers with us  the peasants  bear all the burden of labor  and are so placed that however much they work they can t escape from their position of beasts of burden
all the profits of labor  on which they might improve their position  and gain leisure for themselves  and after that education  all the surplus values are taken from them by anna karenina 192 of 1759 the capitalists and society s so constituted that the harder they work  the greater the profit of the merchants and landowners  while they stay beasts of burden to the end
and that state of things must be changed   he finished up  and he looked questioningly at his brother
 yes  of course   said konstantin  looking at the patch of red that had come out on his brother s projecting cheek bones
 and so we re founding a locksmiths  association  where all the production and profit and the chief instruments of production will be in common    where is the association to be   asked konstantin levin
 in the village of vozdrem  kazan government    but why in a village  in the villages  i think  there is plenty of work as it is
why a locksmiths  association in a village    why  because the peasants are just as much slaves as they ever were  and that s why you and sergey ivanovitch don t like people to try and get them out of their slavery   said nikolay levin  exasperated by the objection
konstantin levin sighed  looking meanwhile about the cheerless and dirty room
this sigh seemed to exasperate nikolay still more
anna karenina 193 of 1759  i know your and sergey ivanovitch s aristocratic views
i know that he applies all the power of his intellect to justify existing evils    no  and what do you talk of sergey ivanovitch for   said levin  smiling
 sergey ivanovitch  i ll tell you what for   nikolay levin shrieked suddenly at the name of sergey ivanovitch
 i ll tell you what for   
but what s the use of talking  there s only one thing   
what did you come to me for  you look down on this  and you re welcome to  and go away  in god s name go away   he shrieked  getting up from his chair
 and go away  and go away    i don t look down on it at all   said konstantin levin timidly
 i don t even dispute it   at that instant marya nikolaevna came back
nikolay levin looked round angrily at her
she went quickly to him  and whispered something
 i m not well  i ve grown irritable   said nikolay levin  getting calmer and breathing painfully   and then you talk to me of sergey ivanovitch and his article
it s such rubbish  such lying  such self deception
what can a man write of justice who knows nothing of it  have you read his article   he asked kritsky  sitting down again at the anna karenina 194 of 1759 table  and moving back off half of it the scattered cigarettes  so as to clear a space
 i ve not read it   kritsky responded gloomily  obviously not desiring to enter into the conversation
 why not   said nikolay levin  now turning with exasperation upon kritsky
 because i didn t see the use of wasting my time over it    oh  but excuse me  how did you know it would be wasting your time  that article s too deep for many people that s to say it s over their heads
but with me  it s another thing  i see through his ideas  and i know where its weakness lies   everyone was mute
kritsky got up deliberately and reached his cap
 won t you have supper  all right  good bye  come round tomorrow with the locksmith   kritsky had hardly gone out when nikolay levin smiled and winked
 he s no good either   he said
 i see  of course    but at that instant kritsky  at the door  called him  
 what do you want now   he said  and went out to him in the passage
left alone with marya nikolaevna  levin turned to her
anna karenina 195 of 1759  have you been long with my brother   he said to her
 yes  more than a year
nikolay dmitrievitch s health has become very poor
nikolay dmitrievitch drinks a great deal   she said
 that is   how does he drink    drinks vodka  and it s bad for him    and a great deal   whispered levin
 yes   she said  looking timidly towards the doorway  where nikolay levin had reappeared
 what were you talking about   he said  knitting his brows  and turning his scarred eyes from one to the other
 what was it    oh  nothing   konstantin answered in confusion
 oh  if you don t want to say  don t
only it s no good your talking to her
she s a wench  and you re a gentleman   he said with a jerk of the neck
 you understand everything  i see  and have taken stock of everything  and look with commiseration on my shortcomings   he began again  raising his voice
 nikolay dmitrievitch  nikolay dmitrievitch   whispered marya nikolaevna  again going up to him
 oh  very well  very well   
but where s the supper  ah  here it is   he said  seeing a waiter with a tray
 here  set it here   he added angrily  and promptly seizing the anna karenina 196 of 1759 vodka  he poured out a glassful and drank it greedily
 like a drink   he turned to his brother  and at once became better humored
 well  enough of sergey ivanovitch
i m glad to see you  anyway
after all s said and done  we re not strangers
come  have a drink
tell me what you re doing   he went on  greedily munching a piece of bread  and pouring out another glassful
 how are you living    i live alone in the country  as i used to
i m busy looking after the land   answered konstantin  watching with horror the greediness with which his brother ate and drank  and trying to conceal that he noticed it
 why don t you get married    it hasn t happened so   konstantin answered  reddening a little
 why not  for me now   everything s at an end  i ve made a mess of my life
but this i ve said  and i say still  that if my share had been given me when i needed it  my whole life would have been different   konstantin made haste to change the conversation
 do you know your little vanya s with me  a clerk in the countinghouse at pokrovskoe   nikolay jerked his neck  and sank into thought
anna karenina 197 of 1759  yes  tell me what s going on at pokrovskoe
is the house standing still  and the birch trees  and our schoolroom  and philip the gardener  is he living  how i remember the arbor and the seat  now mind and don t alter anything in the house  but make haste and get married  and make everything as it used to be again
then i ll come and see you  if your wife is nice    but come to me now   said levin
 how nicely we would arrange it   i d come and see you if i were sure i should not find sergey ivanovitch    you wouldn t find him there
i live quite independently of him    yes  but say what you like  you will have to choose between me and him   he said  looking timidly into his brother s face
this timidity touch konstantin
 if you want to hear my confession of faith on the subject  i tell you that in your quarrel with sergey ivanovitch i take neither side
you re both wrong
you re more wrong externally  and he inwardly    ah  ah  you see that  you see that   nikolay shouted joyfully
anna karenina 198 of 1759  but i personally value friendly relations with you more because     why  why   konstantin could not say that he valued it more because nikolay was unhappy  and needed affection
but nikolay knew that this was just what he meant to say  and scowling he took up the vodka again
 enough  nikolay dmitrievitch   said marya nikolaevna  stretching out her plump  bare arm towards the decanter  let it be  don t insist  i ll beat you   he shouted
marya nikolaevna smiled a sweet and good humored smile  which was at once reflected on nikolay s face  and she took the bottle
 and do you suppose she understands nothing   said nikolay
 she understands it all better than any of us
isn t it true there s something good and sweet in her    were you never before in moscow   konstantin said to her  for the sake of saying something
 only you mustn t be polite and stiff with her
it frightens her
no one ever spoke to her so but the justices of the peace who tried her for trying to get out of a house of ill fame
mercy on us  the senselessness in the world   anna karenina 199 of 1759 he cried suddenly
 these new institutions  these justices of the peace  rural councils  what hideousness it all is   and he began to enlarge on his encounters with the new institutions
konstantin levin heard him  and the disbelief in the sense of all public institutions  which he shared with him  and often expressed  was distasteful to him now from his brother s lips
 in another world we shall understand it all   he said lightly
 in another world  ah  i don t like that other world  i don t like it   he said  letting his scared eyes rest on his brother s eyes
 here one would think that to get out of all the baseness and the mess  one s own and other people s  would be a good thing  and yet i m afraid of death  awfully afraid of death   he shuddered
 but do drink something
would you like some champagne  or shall we go somewhere  let s go to the gypsies  do you know i have got so fond of the gypsies and russian songs   his speech had begun to falter  and he passed abruptly from one subject to another
konstantin with the help of masha persuaded him not to go out anywhere  and got him to bed hopelessly drunk
anna karenina 200 of 1759 masha promised to write to konstantin in case of need  and to persuade nikolay levin to go and stay with his brother
in the morning konstantin levin left moscow  and towards evening he reached home
on the journey in the train he talked to his neighbors about politics and the new railways  and  just as in moscow  he was overcome by a sense of confusion of ideas  dissatisfaction with himself  shame of something or other but when he got out at his own station  when he saw his one eyed coachman  ignat  with the collar of his coat turned up  when  in the dim light reflected by the station fires  he saw his own sledge  his own horses with their tails tied up  in their harness trimmed with rings and tassels  when the coachman ignat  as he put in his luggage  told him the village news  that the contractor had arrived  and that pava had calved  he felt that little by little the confusion was clearing up  and the shame and self dissatisfaction were passing away
he felt this at the mere sight of ignat and the horses  but when he had put on the sheepskin brought for him  had sat down wrapped in the sledge  and had driven off pondering on the work that lay before him in the village  and staring at the side horse  that had been his saddle horse  past his prime now  but a spirited beast from the don  he began to anna karenina 202 of 1759 see what had happened to him in quite a different light
he felt himself  and did not want to be any one else all he wanted now was to be better than before
in the first place he resolved that from that day he would give up hoping for any extraordinary happiness  such as marriage must have given him  and consequently he would not so disdain what he really had
secondly  he would never again let himself give way to low passion  the memory of which had so tortured him when he had been making up his mind to make an offer then remembering his brother nikolay  he resolved to himself that he would never allow himself to forget him  that he would follow him up  and not lose sight of him  so as to be ready to help when things should go ill with him and that would be soon  he felt
then  too  his brother s talk of communism  which he had treated so lightly at the time  now made him think
he considered a revolution in economic conditions nonsense
but he always felt the injustice of his own abundance in comparison with the poverty of the peasants  and now he determined that so as to feel quite in the right  though he had worked hard and lived by no means luxuriously before  he would now work still harder  and would allow himself even less luxury and all this seemed to him so easy a conquest over himself that he spent the anna karenina 203 of 1759 whole drive in the pleasantest daydreams with a resolute feeling of hope in a new  better life  he reached home before nine o clock at night
the snow of the little quadrangle before the house was lit up by a light in the bedroom windows of his old nurse  agafea mihalovna  who performed the duties of housekeeper in his house
she was not yet asleep
kouzma  waked up by her  came sidling sleepily out onto the steps
a setter bitch  laska  ran out too  almost upsetting kouzma  and whining  turned round about levin s knees  jumping up and longing  but not daring  to put her forepaws on his chest
 you re soon back again  sir   said agafea mihalovna
 i got tired of it  agafea mihalovna
with friends  one is well  but at home  one is better   he answered  and went into his study
the study was slowly lit up as the candle was brought in
the familiar details came out  the stag s horns  the bookshelves  the looking glass  the stove with its ventilator  which had long wanted mending  his father s sofa  a large table  on the table an open book  a broken ash tray  a manuscript book with his handwriting
as he saw all this  there came over him for an instant a doubt of the possibility of arranging the new life  of which he had been anna karenina 204 of 1759 dreaming on the road
all these traces of his life seemed to clutch him  and to say to him   no  you re not going to get away from us  and you re not going to be different  but you re going to be the same as you ve always been  with doubts  everlasting dissatisfaction with yourself  vain efforts to amend  and falls  and everlasting expectation  of a happiness which you won t get  and which isn t possible for you   this the tings said to him  but another voice in his heart was telling him that he must not fall under the sway of the past  and that one can do anything with oneself
and hearing that voice  he went into the corner where stood his two heavy dumbbells  and began brandishing them like a gymnast  trying to restore his confident temper
there was a creak of steps at the door
he hastily put down the dumbbells
the bailiff came in  and said everything  thank god  was doing well  but informed him that the buckwheat in the new drying machine had been a little scorched
this piece of news irritated levin
the new drying machine had been constructed and partly invented by levin
the bailiff had always been against the drying machine  and now it was with suppressed triumph that he announced that the buckwheat had been scorched
levin was firmly anna karenina 205 of 1759 convinced that if the buckwheat had been scorched  it was only because the precautions had not been taken  for which he had hundreds of times given orders
he was annoyed  and reprimanded the bailiff
but there had been an important and joyful event  pava  his best cow  an expensive beast  bought at a show  had calved
 kouzma  give me my sheepskin
and you tell them to take a lantern
i ll come and look at her   he said to the bailiff
the cowhouse for the more valuable cows was just behind the house
walking across the yard  passing a snowdrift by the lilac tree  he went into the cowhouse
there was the warm  steamy smell of dung when the frozen door was opened  and the cows  astonished at the unfamiliar light of the lantern  stirred on the fresh straw
he caught a glimpse of the broad  smooth  black and piebald back of hollandka
berkoot  the bull  was lying down with his ring in his lip  and seemed about to get up  but thought better of it  and only gave two snorts as they passed by him
pava  a perfect beauty  huge as a hippopotamus  with her back turned to them  prevented their seeing the calf  as she sniffed her all over
levin went into the pen  looked pava over  and lifted the red and spotted calf onto her long  tottering legs
pava  anna karenina 206 of 1759 uneasy  began lowing  but when levin put the calf close to her she was soothed  and  sighing heavily  began licking her with her rough tongue
the calf  fumbling  poked her nose under her mother s udder  and stiffened her tail out straight
 here  bring the light  fyodor  this way   said levin  examining the calf
 like the mother  though the color takes after the father  but that s nothing
very good
long and broad in the haunch
vassily fedorovitch  isn t she splendid   he said to the bailiff  quite forgiving him for the buckwheat under the influence of his delight in the calf
 how could she fail to be  oh  semyon the contractor came the day after you left
you must settle with him  konstantin dmitrievitch   said the bailiff
 i did inform you about the machine   this question was enough to take levin back to all the details of his work on the estate  which was on a large scale  and complicated
he went straight from the cowhouse to the counting house  and after a little conversation with the bailiff and semyon the contractor  he went back to the house and straight upstairs to the drawing room
anna karenina 207 of 1759 the house was big and old fashioned  and levin  though he lived alone  had the whole house heated and used
he knew that this was stupid  he knew that it was positively not right  and contrary to his present new plans  but this house was a whole world to levin
it was the world in which his father and mother had lived and died
they had lived just the life that to levin seemed the ideal of perfection  and that he had dreamed of beginning with his wife  his family
levin scarcely remembered his mother
his conception of her was for him a sacred memory  and his future wife was bound to be in his imagination a repetition of that exquisite  holy ideal of a woman that his mother had been
he was so far from conceiving of love for woman apart from marriage that he positively pictured to himself first the family  and only secondarily the woman who would give him a family his ideas of marriage were  consequently  quite unlike those of the great majority of his acquaintances  for whom getting married was one of the numerous facts of social life
for levin it was the chief anna karenina 208 of 1759 affair of life  on which its whole happiness turned
and now he had to give up that
when he had gone into the little drawing room  where he always had tea  and had settled himself in his armchair with a book   and agafea mihalovna had brought him tea  and with her usual   well  i ll stay a while  sir   had taken a chair in the window  he felt that  however strange it might be  he had not parted from his daydreams  and that he could not live without them whether with her  or with another  still it would be
he was reading a book  and thinking of what he was reading  and stopping to listen to agafea mihalovna  who gossiped away without flagging  and yet with all that  all sorts of pictures of family life and work in the future rose disconnectedly before his imagination
he felt that in the depth of his soul something had been put in its place  settled down  and laid to rest
he heard agafea mihalovna talking of how prohor had forgotten his duty to god  and with the money levin had given him to buy a horse  had been drinking without stopping  and had beaten his wife till he d half killed her
he listened  and read his book  and recalled the whole train of ideas suggested by his reading
it was tyndall s treatise on heat
he recalled his own criticisms of anna karenina 209 of 1759 tyndall of his complacent satisfaction in the cleverness of his experiments  and for his lack of philosophic insight and suddenly there floated into his mind the joyful thought   in two years  time i shall have two dutch cows  pava herself will perhaps still be alive  a dozen young daughters of berkoot and the three others how lovely   he took up his book again
 very good  electricity and heat are the same thing  but is it possible to substitute the one quantity for the other in the equation for the solution of any problem  no
well  then what of it  the connection between all the forces of nature is felt instinctively   
it s particulary nice if pava s daughter should be a red spotted cow  and all the herd will take after her  and the other three  too  splendid  to go out with my wife and visitors to meet the herd   
my wife says  kostya and i looked after that calf like a child    how can it interest you so much   says a visitor
 everything that interests him  interests me   but who will she be   and he remembered what had happened at moscow   
 well  there s nothing to be done   
it s not my fault
but now everything shall go on in a new way
it s nonsense to pretend that life won t let one  that the past won t let one
one must struggle to live better  much better    
he raised his head  and fell to dreaming
old laska  who had not yet anna karenina 210 of 1759 fully digested her delight at his return  and had run out into the yard to bark  came back wagging her tail  and crept up to him  bringing in the scent of fresh air  put her head under his hand  and whined plaintively  asking to be stroked
 there  who d have thought it   said agafea mihalovna
 the dog now   why  she understands that her master s come home  and that he s low spirited    why low spirited    do you suppose i don t see it  sir  it s high time i should know the gentry
why  i ve grown up from a little thing with them
it s nothing  sir  so long as there s health and a clear conscience   levin looked intently at her  surprised at how well she knew his thought
 shall i fetch you another cup   said she  and taking his cup she went out laska kept poking her head under his hand
he stroked her  and she promptly curled up at his feet  laying her head on a hindpaw
and in token of all now being well and satisfactory  she opened her mouth a little  smacked her lips  and settling her sticky lips more comfortably about her old teeth  she sank into blissful repose
levin watched all her movements attentively
anna karenina 211 of 1759  that s what i ll do   he said to himself   that s what i ll do  nothing s amiss    all s well   anna karenina 212 of 1759 after the ball  early next morning  anna arkadyevna sent her husband a telegram that she was leaving moscow the same day
 no  i must go  i must go   she explained to her sisterin law the change in her plans in a tone that suggested that she had to remember so many things that there was no enumerating them   no  it had really better be today   stepan arkadyevitch was not dining at home  but he promised to come and see his sister off at seven o clock
kitty  too  did not come  sending a note that she had a headache
dolly and anna dined alone with the children and the english governess
whether it was that the children were fickle  or that they had acute senses  and felt that anna was quite different that day from what she had been when they had taken such a fancy to her  that she was not now interested in them  but they had abruptly dropped their play with their aunt  and their love for her  and were quite indifferent that she was going away
anna was absorbed the whole morning in preparations for her departure
she wrote notes to her moscow acquaintances  put down her accounts  and packed
altogether dolly anna karenina 213 of 1759 fancied she was not in a placid state of mind  but in that worried mood  which dolly knew well with herself  and which does not come without cause  and for the most part covers dissatisfaction with self
after dinner  anna went up to her room to dress  and dolly followed her
 how queer you are today   dolly said to her
 i  do you think so  i m not queer  but i m nasty
i am like that sometimes
i keep feeling as if i could cry
it s very stupid  but it ll pass off   said anna quickly  and she bent her flushed face over a tiny bag in which she was packing a nightcap and some cambric handkerchiefs
her eyes were particulary bright  and were continually swimming with tears
 in the same way i didn t want to leave petersburg  and now i don t want to go away from here    you came here and did a good deed   said dolly  looking intently at her
anna looked at her with eyes wet with tears
 don t say that  dolly
i ve done nothing  and could do nothing
i often wonder why people are all in league to spoil me
what have i done  and what could i do  in your heart there was found love enough to forgive    anna karenina 214 of 1759  if it had not been for you  god knows what would have happened  how happy you are  anna   said dolly
 everything is clear and good in your heart    every heart has its own skeletons  as the english say    you have no sort of skeleton  have you  everything is so clear in you    i have   said anna suddenly  and  unexpectedly after her tears  a sly  ironical smile curved her lips
 come  he s amusing  anyway  your skeleton  and not depressing   said dolly  smiling
 no  he s depressing
do you know why i m going today instead of tomorrow  it s a confession that weighs on me  i want to make it to you   said anna  letting herself drop definitely into an armchair  and looking straight into dolly s face
and to her surprise dolly saw that anna was blushing up to her ears  up to the curly black ringlets on her neck
 yes   anna went on
 do you know why kitty didn t come to dinner  she s jealous of me
i have spoiled   i ve been the cause of that ball being a torture to her instead of a pleasure
but truly  truly  it s not my fault  or only my fault a little bit   she said  daintily drawling the words  a little bit    oh  how like stiva you said that   said dolly  laughing
anna karenina 215 of 1759 anna was hurt
 oh no  oh no  i m not stiva   she said  knitting her brows
 that s why i m telling you  just because i could never let myself doubt myself for an instant   said anna
but at the very moment she was uttering the words  she felt that they were not true
she was not merely doubting herself  she felt emotion at the thought of vronsky  and was going away sooner than she had meant  simply to avoid meeting him
 yes  stiva told me you danced the mazurka with him  and that he     you can t imagine how absurdly it all came about
i only meant to be matchmaking  and all at once it turned out quite differently
possibly against my own will    she crimsoned and stopped  oh  they feel it directly   said dolly
 but i should be in despair if there were anything serious in it on his side   anna interrupted her
 and i am certain it will all be forgotten  and kitty will leave off hating me    all the same  anna  to tell you the truth  i m not very anxious for this marriage for kitty
and it s better it should come to nothing  if he  vronsky  is capable of falling in love with you in a single day   anna karenina 216 of 1759  oh  heavens  that would be too silly   said anna  and again a deep flush of pleasure came out on her face  when she heard the idea  that absorbed her  put into words
 and so here i am going away  having made an enemy of kitty  whom i liked so much  ah  how sweet she is  but you ll make it right  dolly  eh   dolly could scarcely suppress a smile
she loved anna  but she enjoyed seeing that she too had her weaknesses
 an enemy  that can t be    i did so want you all to care for me  as i do for you  and now i care for you more than ever   said anna  with tears in her eyes
 ah  how silly i am today   she passed her handkerchief over her face and began dressing
at the very moment of starting stepan arkadyevitch arrived  late  rosy and good humored  smelling of wine and cigars
anna s emotionalism infected dolly  and when she embraced her sister in law for the last time  she whispered   remember  anna  what you ve done for me i shall never forget
and remember that i love you  and shall always love you as my dearest friend    i don t know why   said anna  kissing her and hiding her tears
anna karenina 217 of 1759  you understood me  and you understand
good bye  my darling   anna karenina 218 of 1759  come  it s all over  and thank god   was the first thought that came to anna arkadyevna  when she had said good bye for the last time to her brother  who had stood blocking up the entrance to the carriage till the third bell rang
she sat down on her lounge beside annushka  and looked about her in the twilight of the sleepingcarriage
 thank god  tomorrow i shall see seryozha and alexey alexandrovitch  and my life will go on in the old way  all nice and as usual   still in the same anxious frame of mind  as she had been all that day  anna took pleasure in arranging herself for the journey with great care
with her little deft hands she opened and shut her little red bag  took out a cushion  laid it on her knees  and carefully wrapping up her feet  settled herself comfortably
an invalid lady had already lain down to sleep
two other ladies began talking to anna  and a stout elderly lady tucked up her feet  and made observations about the heating of the train
anna answered a few words  but not foreseeing any entertainment from the conversation  she asked annushka to get a lamp  hooked it onto the arm of her seat  and took from her bag anna karenina 219 of 1759 a paper knife and an english novel
at first her reading made no progress
the fuss and bustle were disturbing  then when the train had started  she could not help listening to the noises  then the snow beating on the left window and sticking to the pane  and the sight of the muffled guard passing by  covered with snow on one side  and the conversations about the terrible snowstorm raging outside  distracted her attention
farther on  it was continually the same again and again  the same shaking and rattling  the same snow on the window  the same rapid transitions from steaming heat to cold  and back again to heat  the same passing glimpses of the same figures in the twilight  and the same voices  and anna began to read and to understand what she read
annushka was already dozing  the red bag on her lap  clutched by her broad hands  in gloves  of which one was torn
anna arkadyevna read and understood  but it was distasteful to her to read  that is  to follow the reflection of other people s lives
she had too great a desire to live herself
if she read that the heroine of the novel was nursing a sick man  she longed to move with noiseless steps about the room of a sick man  if she read of a member of parliament making a speech  she longed to be delivering the speech  if she read of how lady mary had ridden after the hounds  anna karenina 220 of 1759 and had provoked her sister in law  and had surprised everyone by her boldness  she too wished to be doing the same
but there was no chance of doing anything  and twisting the smooth paper knife in her little hands  she forced herself to read
the hero of the novel was already almost reaching his english happiness  a baronetcy and an estate  and anna was feeling a desire to go with him to the estate  when she suddenly felt that he ought to feel ashamed  and that she was ashamed of the same thing but what had he to be ashamed of   what have i to be ashamed of   she asked herself in injured surprise
she laid down the book and sank against the back of the chair  tightly gripping the paper cutter in both hands
there was nothing
she went over all her moscow recollections
all were good  pleasant
she remembered the ball  remembered vronsky and his face of slavish adoration  remembered all her conduct with him  there was nothing shameful
and for all that  at the same point in her memories  the feeling of shame was intensified  as though some inner voice  just at the point when she thought of vronsky  were saying to her   warm  very warm  hot    well  what is it   she said to herself resolutely  shifting her seat in the lounge
 what does it mean  am i afraid to look it straight in the face  anna karenina 221 of 1759 why  what is it  can it be that between me and this officer boy there exist  or can exist  any other relations than such as are common with every acquaintance   she laughed contemptuously and took up her book again  but now she was definitely unable to follow what she read
she passed the paper knife over the window pane  then laid its smooth  cool surface to her cheek  and almost laughed aloud at the feeling of delight that all at once without cause came over her
she felt as though her nerves were strings being strained tighter and tighter on some sort of screwing peg
she felt her eyes opening wider and wider  her fingers and toes twitching nervously  something within oppressing her breathing  while all shapes and sounds seemed in the uncertain half light to strike her with unaccustomed vividness
moments of doubt were continually coming upon her  when she was uncertain whether the train were going forwards or backwards  or were standing still altogether  whether it were annushka at her side or a stranger
 what s that on the arm of the chair  a fur cloak or some beast  and what am i myself  myself or some other woman   she was afraid of giving way to this delirium
but something drew her towards it  and she could yield to it or resist it at will
she got up to rouse herself  and slipped off her plaid and the anna karenina 222 of 1759 cape of her warm dress
for a moment she regained her self possession  and realized that the thin peasant who had come in wearing a long overcoat  with buttons missing from it  was the stoveheater  that he was looking at the thermometer  that it was the wind and snow bursting in after him at the door  but then everything grew blurred again   
that peasant with the long waist seemed to be gnawing something on the wall  the old lady began stretching her legs the whole length of the carriage  and filling it with a black cloud  then there was a fearful shrieking and banging  as though someone were being torn to pieces  then there was a blinding dazzle of red fire before her eyes and a wall seemed to rise up and hide everything anna felt as though she were sinking down
but it was not terrible  but delightful
the voice of a man muffled up and covered with snow shouted something in her ear
she got up and pulled herself together  she realized that they had reached a station and that this was the guard
she asked annushka to hand her the cape she had taken off and her shawl  put them on and moved towards the door
 do you wish to get out   asked annushka
 yes  i want a little air
it s very hot in here   and she opened the door
the driving snow and the wind rushed anna karenina 223 of 1759 to meet her and struggled with her over the door
but she enjoyed the struggle
she opened the door and went out
the wind seemed as though lying in wait for her  with gleeful whistle it tried to snatch her up and bear her off  but she clung to the cold door post  and holding her skirt got down onto the platform and under the shelter of the carriages
the wind had been powerful on the steps  but on the platform  under the lee of the carriages  there was a lull
with enjoyment she drew deep breaths of the frozen  snowy air  and standing near the carriage looked about the platform and the lighted station
anna karenina 224 of 1759 the raging tempest rushed whistling between the wheels of the carriages  about the scaffolding  and round the corner of the station
the carriages  posts  people  everything that was to be seen was covered with snow on one side  and was getting more and more thickly covered
for a moment there would come a lull in the storm  but then it would swoop down again with such onslaughts that it seemed impossible to stand against it
meanwhile men ran to and fro  talking merrily together  their steps crackling on the platform as they continually opened and closed the big doors
the bent shadow of a man glided by at her feet  and she heard sounds of a hammer upon iron
 hand over that telegram   came an angry voice out of the stormy darkness on the other side
 this way  no
28   several different voices shouted again  and muffled figures ran by covered with snow
two gentleman with lighted cigarettes passed by her
she drew one more deep breath of the fresh air  and had just put he hand out of her muff to take hold of the door post and get back into the carriage  when another man in a military overcoat  quite close beside her  stepped between her and the flickering anna karenina 225 of 1759 light of the lamp post
she looked round  and the same instant recognized vronsky s face
putting his hand to the peak of his cap  he bowed to her and asked  was there anything she wanted  could he be of any service to her  she gazed rather a long while at him without answering  and  in spite of the shadow in which he was standing  she saw  or fancied she saw  both the expression of his face and his eyes
it was again that expression of reverential ecstasy which had so worked upon her the day before
more than once she had told herself during the past few days  and again only a few moments before  that vronsky was for her only one of the hundreds of young men  forever exactly the same  that are met everywhere  that she would never allow herself to bestow a thought upon him
but now at the first instant of meeting him  she was seized by a feeling of joyful pride
she had no need to ask why he had come
she knew as certainly as if he had told her that he was here to be where she was
 i didn t know you were going
what are you coming for   she said  letting fall the hand with which she had grasped the door post
and irrepressible delight and eagerness shone in her face
anna karenina 226 of 1759  what am i coming for   he repeated  looking straight into her eyes
 you know that i have come to be where you are   he said   i can t help it   at that moment the wind  as it were  surmounting all obstacles  sent the snow flying from the carriage roofs  and clanked some sheet of iron it had torn off  while the hoarse whistle of the engine roared in front  plaintively and gloomily
all the awfulness of the storm seemed to her more splendid now
he had said what her soul longed to hear  though she feared it with her reason
she made no answer  and in her face he saw conflict
 forgive me  if you dislike what i said   he said humbly
he had spoken courteously  deferentially  yet so firmly  so stubbornly  that for a long while she could make no answer
 it s wrong  what you say  and i beg you  if you re a good man  to forget what you ve said  as i forget it   she said at last
 not one word  not one gesture of yours shall i  could i  ever forget     enough  enough   she cried trying assiduously to give a stern expression to her face  into which he was gazing greedily
and clutching at the cold door post  she clambered up the steps and got rapidly into the corridor of anna karenina 227 of 1759 the carriage
but in the little corridor she paused  going over in her imagination what had happened
though she could not recall her own words or his  she realized instinctively that the momentary conversation had brought them fearfully closer  and she was panic stricken and blissful at it
after standing still a few seconds  she went into the carriage and sat down in her place
the overstrained condition which had tormented her before did not only come back  but was intensified  and reached such a pitch that she was afraid every minute that something would snap within her from the excessive tension
she did not sleep all night
but in that nervous tension  and in the visions that filled her imagination  there was nothing disagreeable or gloomy  on the contrary there was something blissful  glowing  and exhilarating
towards morning anna sank into a doze  sitting in her place  and when she waked it was daylight and the train was near petersburg
at once thoughts of home  of husband and of son  and the details of that day and the following came upon her
at petersburg  as soon as the train stopped and she got out  the first person that attracted her attention was her husband
 oh  mercy  why do his ears look like that   she thought  looking at his frigid and imposing figure  and anna karenina 228 of 1759 especially the ears that struck her at the moment as propping up the brim of his round hat
catching sight of her  he came to meet her  his lips falling into their habitual sarcastic smile  and his big  tired eyes looking straight at her
an unpleasant sensation gripped at her heart when she met his obstinate and weary glance  as though she had expected to see him different
she was especially struck by the feeling of dissatisfaction with herself that she experienced on meeting him
that feeling was an intimate  familiar feeling  like a consciousness of hypocrisy  which she experienced in her relations with her husband
but hitherto she had not taken note of the feeling  now she was clearly and painfully aware of it
 yes  as you see  your tender spouse  as devoted as the first year after marriage  burned with impatience to see you   he said in his deliberate  high pitched voice  and in that tone which he almost always took with her  a tone of jeering at anyone who should say in earnest what he said
 is seryozha quite well   she asked
 and is this all the reward   said he   for my ardor  he s quite well    anna karenina 229 of 1759 vronsky had not even tried to sleep all that night
he sat in his armchair  looking straight before him or scanning the people who got in and out
if he had indeed on previous occasions struck and impressed people who did not know him by his air of unhesitating composure  he seemed now more haughty and self possessed than ever
he looked at people as if they were things
a nervous young man  a clerk in a law court  sitting opposite him  hated him for that look
the young man asked him for a light  and entered into conversation with him  and even pushed against him  to make him feel that he was not a thing  but a person
but vronsky gazed at him exactly as he did at the lamp  and the young man made a wry face  feeling that he was losing his self possession under the oppression of this refusal to recognize him as a person
vronsky saw nothing and no one
he felt himself a king  not because he believed that he had made an impression on anna he did not yet believe that  but because the impression she had made on him gave him happiness and pride anna karenina 230 of 1759 what would come if it all he did not know  he did not even think
he felt that all his forces  hitherto dissipated  wasted  were centered on one thing  and bent with fearful energy on one blissful goal
and he was happy at it
he knew only that he had told her the truth  that he had come where she was  that all the happiness of his life  the only meaning in life for him  now lay in seeing and hearing her
and when he got out of the carriage at bologova to get some seltzer water  and caught sight of anna  involuntarily his first word had told her just what he thought
and he was glad he had told her it  that she knew it now and was thinking of it
he did not sleep all night
when he was back in the carriage  he kept unceasingly going over every position in which he had seen her  every word she had uttered  and before his fancy  making his heart faint with emotion  floated pictures of a possible future
when he got out of the train at petersburg  he felt after his sleepless night as keen and fresh as after a cold bath
he paused near his compartment  waiting for her to get out
 once more   he said to himself  smiling unconsciously   once more i shall see her walk  her face  she will say something  turn her head  glance  smile  maybe   but before he caught sight of her  he saw her husband  whom anna karenina 231 of 1759 the station master was deferentially escorting through the crowd  ah  yes  the husband   only now for the first time did vronsky realize clearly the fact that there was a person attached to her  a husband
he knew that she had a husband  but had hardly believed in his existence  and only now fully believed in him  with his head and shoulders  and his legs clad in black trousers  especially when he saw this husband calmly take her arm with a sense of property
seeing alexey alexandrovitch with his petersburg face and severely self confident figure  in his round hat  with his rather prominent spine  he believed in him  and was aware of a disagreeable sensation  such as a man might feel tortured by thirst  who  on reaching a spring  should find a dog  a sheep  or a pig  who has drunk of it and muddied the water
alexey alexandrovitch s manner of walking  with a swing of the hips and flat feet  particularly annoyed vronsky
he could recognize in no one but himself an indubitable right to love her but she was still the same  and the sight of her affected him the same way  physically reviving him  stirring him  and filling his soul with rapture
he told his german valet  who ran up to him from the second class  to take his things and go on  and he himself went up to her he saw the first meeting between anna karenina 232 of 1759 the husband and wife  and noted with a lover s insight the signs of slight reserve with which she spoke to her husband
 no  she does not love him and cannot love him   he decided to himself at the moment when he was approaching anna arkadyevna he noticed too with joy that she was conscious of his being near  and looked round  and seeing him  turned again to her husband
 have you passed a good night   he asked  bowing to her and her husband together  and leaving it up to alexey alexandrovitch to accept the bow on his own account  and to recognize it or not  as he might see fit
 thank you  very good   she answered
her face looked weary  and there was not that play of eagerness in it  peeping out in her smile and her eyes  but for a single instant  as she glanced at him  there was a flash of something in her eyes  and although the flash died away at once  he was happy for that moment
she glanced at her husband to find out whether he knew vronsky
alexey alexandrovitch looked at vronsky with displeasure  vaguely recalling who this was
vronsky s composure and self confidence have struck  like a scythe against a stone  upon the cold self confidence of alexey alexandrovitch
 count vronsky   said anna
anna karenina 233 of 1759  ah  we are acquainted  i believe   said alexey alexandrovitch indifferently  giving his hand
 you set off with the mother and you return with the son   he said  articulating each syllable  as though each were a separate favor he was bestowing
 you re back from leave  i suppose   he said  and without waiting for a reply  he turned to his wife in his jesting tone   well  were a great many tears shed at moscow at parting   by addressing his wife like this he gave vronsky to understand that he wished to be left alone  and  turning slightly towards him  he touched his hat  but vronsky turned to anna arkadyevna
 i hope i may have the honor of calling on you   he said
alexey alexandrovitch glanced with his weary eyes at vronsky
 delighted   he said coldly
 on mondays we re at home
most fortunate   he said to his wife  dismissing vronsky altogether   that i should just have half an hour to meet you  so that i can prove my devotion   he went on in the same jesting tone
 you lay too much stress on your devotion for me to value it much   she responded in the same jesting tone  anna karenina 234 of 1759 involuntarily listening to the sound of vronsky s steps behind them
 but what has it to do with me   she said to herself  and she began asking her husband how seryozha had got on without her
 oh  capitally  mariette says he has been very good  and   i must disappoint you   but he has not missed you as your husband has
but once more merci  my dear  for giving me a day
our dear samovar will be delighted    he used to call the countess lidia ivanovna  well known in society  a samovar  because she was always bubbling over with excitement    she has been continually asking after you
and  do you know  if i may venture to advise you  you should go and see her today
you know how she takes everything to heart
just now  with all her own cares  she s anxious about the oblonskys being brought together   the countess lidia ivanovna was a friend of her husband s  and the center of that one of the coteries of the petersburg world with which anna was  through her husband  in the closest relations
 but you know i wrote to her    still she ll want to hear details
go and see her  if you re not too tired  my dear
well  kondraty will take you in the carriage  while i go to my committee
i shall anna karenina 235 of 1759 not be alone at dinner again   alexey alexandrovitch went on  no longer in a sarcastic tone
 you wouldn t believe how i ve missed     and with a long pressure of her hand and a meaning smile  he put her in her carriage
anna karenina 236 of 1759 the first person to meet anna at home was her son
he dashed down the stairs to her  in spite of the governess s call  and with desperate joy shrieked   mother  mother   running up to her  he hung on her neck
 i told you it was mother   he shouted to the governess
 i knew   and her son  like her husband  aroused in anna a feeling akin to disappointment
she had imagined him better than he was in reality
she had to let herself drop down to the reality to enjoy him as he really was
but even as he was  he was charming  with his fair curls  his blue eyes  and his plump  graceful little legs in tightly pulled up stockings
anna experienced almost physical pleasure in the sensation of his nearness  and his caresses  and moral soothing  when she met his simple  confiding  and loving glance  and heard his naive questions
anna took out the presents dolly s children had sent him  and told her son what sort of little girl was tanya at moscow  and how tanya could read  and even taught the other children
 why  am i not so nice as she   asked seryozha
anna karenina 237 of 1759 to me you re nicer than anyone in the world    i know that   said seryozha  smiling
anna had not had time to drink her coffee when the countess lidia ivanovna was announced
the countess lidia ivanovna was a tall  stout woman  with an unhealthily sallow face and splendid  pensive black eyes
anna liked her  but today she seemed to be seeing her for the first time with all her defects
 well  my dear  so you took the olive branch   inquired countess lidia ivanovna  as soon as she came into the room
 yes  it s all over  but it was all much less serious than we had supposed   answered anna
 my belle soeur is in general too hasty   but countess lidia ivanovna  though she was interested in everything that did not concern her  had a habit of never listening to what interested her  she interrupted anna   yes  there s plenty of sorrow and evil in the world
i am so worried today    oh  why   asked anna  trying to suppress a smile
 i m beginning to be weary of fruitlessly championing the truth  and sometimes i m quite unhinged by it
the society of the little sisters   this was a religiously  anna karenina 238 of 1759 patriotic  philanthropic institution   was going splendidly  but with these gentlemen it s impossible to do anything   added countess lidia ivanovna in a tone of ironical submission to destiny
 they pounce on the idea  and distort it  and then work it out so pettily and unworthily
two or three people  your husband among them  understand all the importance of the thing  but the others simply drag it down
yesterday pravdin wrote to me    pravdin was a well known panslavist abroad  and countess lidia ivanovna described the purport of his letter
then the countess told her of more disagreements and intrigues against the work of the unification of the churches  and departed in haste  as she had that day to be at the meeting of some society and also at the slavonic committee
 it was all the same before  of course  but why was it i didn t notice it before   anna asked herself
 or has she been very much irritated today  it s really ludicrous  her object is doing good  she a christian  yet she s always angry  and she always has enemies  and always enemies in the name of christianity and doing good   after countess lidia ivanovna another friend came  the wife of a chief secretary  who told her all the news of the anna karenina 239 of 1759 town
at three o clock she too went away  promising to come to dinner
alexey alexandrovitch was at the ministry
anna  left alone  spent the time till dinner in assisting at her son s dinner  he dined apart from his parents  and in putting her things in order  and in reading and answering the notes and letters which had accumulated on her table
the feeling of causeless shame  which she had felt on the journey  and her excitement  too  had completely vanished
in the habitual conditions of her life she felt again resolute and irreproachable
she recalled with wonder her state of mind on the previous day
 what was it  nothing
vronsky said something silly  which it was easy to put a stop to  and i answered as i ought to have done
to speak of it to my husband would be unnecessary and out of the question
to speak of it would be to attach importance to what has no importance   she remembered how she had told her husband of what was almost a declaration made her at petersburg by a young man  one of her husband s subordinates  and how alexey alexandrovitch had answered that every woman living in the world was exposed to such incidents  but that he had the fullest confidence in her tact  and could never lower her and anna karenina 240 of 1759 himself by jealousy  so then there s no reason to speak of it  and indeed  thank god  there s nothing to speak of   she told herself
anna karenina 241 of 1759 alexey alexandrovitch came back from the meeting of the ministers at four o clock  but as often happened  he had not time no come in to her
he went into his study to see the people waiting for him with petitions  and to sign some papers brought him by his chief secretary
at dinner time  there were always a few people dining with the karenins  there arrived an old lady  a cousin of alexey alexandrovitch  the chief secretary of the department and his wife  and a young man who had been recommended to alexey alexandrovitch for the service
anna went into the drawing room to receive these guests
precisely at five o clock  before the bronze peter the first clock had struck the fifth stroke  alexey alexandrovitch came in  wearing a white tie and evening coat with two stars  as he had to go out directly after dinner
every minute of alexey alexandrovitch s life was portioned out and occupied
and to make time to get through all that lay before him every day  he adhered to the strictest punctuality
 unhasting and unresting   was his motto
he came into the dining hall  greeted everyone  and hurriedly sat down  smiling to his wife
anna karenina 242 of 1759  yes  my solitude is over
you wouldn t believe how uncomfortable   he laid stress on the word uncomfortable   it is to dine alone   at dinner he talked a little to his wife about moscow matters  and  with a sarcastic smile  asked her after stepan arkadyevitch  but the conversation was for the most part general  dealing with petersburg official and public news
after dinner he spent half an hour with his guests  and again  with a smile  pressed his wife s hand  withdrew  and drove off to the council
anna did not go out that evening either to the princess betsy tverskaya  who  hearing of her return  had invited her  nor to the theater  where she had a box for that evening
she did not go out principally because the dress she had reckoned upon was not ready
altogether  anna  on turning  after the departure of her guests  to the consideration of her attire  was very much annoyed
she was generally a mistress of the art of dressing well without great expense  and before leaving moscow she had given her dressmaker three dresses to transform
the dresses had to be altered so that they could not be recognized  and they ought to have been ready three days before
it appeared that two dresses had not been done at all  while the other one had not been altered as anna had intended
the dressmaker came to explain  declaring that anna karenina 243 of 1759 it would be better as she had done it  and anna was so furious that she felt ashamed when she thought of it afterwards
to regain her serenity completely she went into the nursery  and spent the whole evening with her son  put him to bed herself  signed him with the cross  and tucked him up
she was glad she had not gone out anywhere  and had spent the evening so well
she felt so light hearted and serene  she saw so clearly that all that had seemed to her so important on her railway journey was only one of the common trivial incidents of fashionable life  and that she had no reason to feel ashamed before anyone else or before herself
anna sat down at the hearth with an english novel and waited for her husband
exactly at half past nine she heard his ring  and he came into the room
 here you are at last   she observed  holding out her hand to him
he kissed her hand and sat down beside her
 altogether then  i see your visit was a success   he said to her
 oh  yes   she said  and she began telling him about everything from the beginning  her journey with countess vronskaya  her arrival  the accident at the station
then anna karenina 244 of 1759 she described the pity she had felt  first for her brother  and afterwards for dolly
 i imagine one cannot exonerate such a man from blame  though he is your brother   said alexey alexandrovitch severely
anna smiled
she knew that he said that simply to show that family considerations could not prevent him from expressing his genuine opinion
she knew that characteristic in her husband  and liked it
 i am glad it has all ended so satisfactorily  and that you are back again   he went on
 come  what do they say about the new act i have got passed in the council   anna had heard nothing of this act  and she felt conscience stricken at having been able so readily to forget what was to him of such importance
 here  on the other hand  it has made a great sensation   he said  with a complacent smile
she saw that alexey alexandrovitch wanted to tell her something pleasant to him about it  and she brought him by questions to telling it
with the same complacent smile he told her of the ovations he had received in consequence of the act the had passed
anna karenina 245 of 1759  i was very  very glad
it shows that at last a reasonable and steady view of the matter is becoming prevalent among us   having drunk his second cup of tea with cream  and bread  alexey alexandrovitch got up  and was going towards his study
 and you ve not been anywhere this evening  you ve been dull  i expect   he said
 oh  no   she answered  getting up after him and accompanying him across the room to his study
 what are you reading now   she asked
 just now i m reading duc de likke  poesie des enfers   he answered
 a very remarkable book   anna smiled  as people smile at the weaknesses of those they love  and  putting her hand under his  she escorted him to the door of the study
she knew his habit  that had grown into a necessity  of reading in the evening
she knew  too  that in spite of his official duties  which swallowed up almost the whole of his time  he considered it his duty to keep up with everything of note that appeared in the intellectual world
she knew  too  that he was really interested in books dealing with politics  philosophy  and theology  that art was utterly foreign to his nature  but  in spite of this  or rather  in consequence anna karenina 246 of 1759 of it  alexey alexandrovitch never passed over anything in the world of art  but made it his duty to read everything
she knew that in politics  in philosophy  in theology  alexey alexandrovitch often had doubts  and made investigations  but on questions of art and poetry  and  above all  of music  of which he was totally devoid of understanding  he had the most distinct and decided opinions
he was fond of talking about shakespeare  raphael  beethoven  of the significance of new schools of poetry and music  all of which were classified by him with very conspicuous consistency
 well  god be with you   she said at the door of the study  where a shaded candle and a decanter of water were already put by his armchair
 and i ll write to moscow   he pressed her hand  and again kissed it
 all the same he s a good man  truthful  good hearted  and remarkable in his own line   anna said to herself going back to her room  as though she were defending him to someone who had attacked him and said that one could not love him
 but why is it his ears stick out so strangely  or has he had his hair cut   precisely at twelve o clock  when anna was still sitting at her writing table  finishing a letter to dolly  she heard the sound of measured steps in slippers  and alexey anna karenina 247 of 1759 alexandrovitch  freshly washed and combed  with a book under his arm  came in to her
 it s time  it s time   said he  with a meaning smile  and he went into their bedroom
 and what right had he to look at him like that   thought anna  recalling vronsky s glance at alexey alexandrovitch
undressing  she went into the bedroom  but her face had none of the eagerness which  during her stay in moscow  had fairly flashed from her eyes and her smile  on the contrary  now the fire seemed quenched in her  hidden somewhere far away
anna karenina 248 of 1759 when vronsky went to moscow from petersburg  he had left his large set of rooms in morskaia to his friend and favorite comrade petritsky petritsky was a young lieutenant  not particularly wellconnected  and not merely not wealthy  but always hopelessly in debt towards evening he was always drunk  and he had often been locked up after all sorts of ludicrous and disgraceful scandals  but he was a favorite both of his comrades and his superior officers on arriving at twelve o clock from the station at his flat  vronsky saw  at the outer door  a hired carriage familiar to him
while still outside his own door  as he rang  he heard masculine laughter  the lisp of a feminine voice  and petritsky s voice
 if that s one of the villains  don t let him in   vronsky told the servant not to announce him  and slipped quietly into the first room
baroness shilton  a friend of petritsky s  with a rosy little face and flaxen hair  resplendent in a lilac satin gown  and filling the whole room  like a canary  with her parisian chatter  sat at the round table making coffee
petritsky  in his overcoat  and anna karenina 249 of 1759 the cavalry captain kamerovsky  in full uniform  probably just come from duty  were sitting each side of her
 bravo  vronsky   shouted petritsky  jumping up  scraping his chair
 our host himself  baroness  some coffee for him out of the new coffee pot why  we didn t expect you  hope you re satisfied with the ornament of your study   he said  indicating the baroness
 you know each other  of course    i should think so   said vronsky  with a bright smile  pressing the baroness s little hand
 what next  i m an old friend    you re home after a journey   said the baroness   so i m flying
oh  i ll be off this minute  if i m in the way    you re home  wherever you are  baroness   said vronsky
 how do you do  kamerovsky   he added  coldly shaking hands with kamerovsky
 there  you never know how to say such pretty things   said the baroness  turning to petritsky
 no  what s that for  after dinner i say things quite as good    after dinner there s no credit in them  well  then  i ll make you some coffee  so go and wash and get ready   said the baroness  sitting down again  and anxiously turning the screw in the new coffee pot
 pierre  give me the coffee   anna karenina 250 of 1759 she said  addressing petritsky  whom she called as a contraction of his surname  making no secret of her relations with him
 i ll put it in    you ll spoil it    no  i won t spoil it  well  and your wife   said the baroness suddenly  interrupting vronsky s conversation with his comrade  we ve been marrying you here
have you brought your wife    no  baroness
i was born a bohemian  and a bohemian i shall die    so much the better  so much the better
shake hands on it   and the baroness  detaining vronsky  began telling him  with many jokes  about her last new plans of life  asking his advice
 he persists in refusing to give me a divorce  well  what am i to do    he was her husband    now i want to begin a suit against him
what do you advise  kamerovsky  look after the coffee  it s boiling over
you see  i m engrossed with business  i want a lawsuit  because i must have my property
do you understand the folly of it  that on the pretext of my being unfaithful to him   she said contemptuously   he wants to get the benefit of my fortune   anna karenina 251 of 1759 vronsky heard with pleasure this light hearted prattle of a pretty woman  agreed with her  gave her half joking counsel  and altogether dropped at once into the tone habitual to him in talking to such women
in his petersburg world all people were divided into utterly opposed classes
one  the lower class  vulgar  stupid  and  above all  ridiculous people  who believe that one husband ought to live with the one wife whom he has lawfully married  that a girl should be innocent  a woman modest  and a man manly  self controlled  and strong  that one ought to bring up one s children  earn one s bread  and pay one s debts  and various similar absurdities
this was the class of old fashioned and ridiculous people
but there was another class of people  the real people
to this class they all belonged  and in it the great thing was to be elegant  generous  plucky  gay  to abandon oneself without a blush to every passion  and to laugh at everything else
for the first moment only  vronsky was startled after the impression of a quite different world that he had brought with him from moscow
but immediately as though slipping his feet into old slippers  he dropped back into the light hearted  pleasant world he had always lived in
anna karenina 252 of 1759 the coffee was never really made  but spluttered over every one  and boiled away  doing just what was required of it that is  providing much cause for much noise and laughter  and spoiling a costly rug and the baroness s gown
 well now  good bye  or you ll never get washed  and i shall have on my conscience the worst sin a gentleman can commit
so you would advise a knife to his throat    to be sure  and manage that your hand may not be far from his lips
he ll kiss your hand  and all will end satisfactorily   answered vronsky
 so at the francais   and  with a rustle of her skirts  she vanished
kamerovsky got up too  and vronsky  not waiting for him to go  shook hands and went off to his dressing room
while he was washing  petritsky described to him in brief outlines his position  as far as it had changed since vronsky had left petersburg
no money at all
his father said he wouldn t give him any and pay his debts
his tailor was trying to get him locked up  and another fellow  too  was threatening to get him locked up
the colonel of the regiment had announced that if these scandals did not cease he would have to leave
as for the baroness  he was sick to death of her  especially since she d taken to offering anna karenina 253 of 1759 continually to lend him money
but he had found a girl  he d show her to vronsky a marvel  exquisite  in the strict oriental style   genre of the slave rebecca  don t you know   he d had a row  too  with berkoshov  and was going to send seconds to him  but of course it would come to nothing
altogether everything was supremely amusing and jolly
and  not letting his comrade enter into further details of his position  petritsky proceeded to tell him all the interesting news as he listened to petritsky s familiar stories in the familiar setting of the rooms he had spent the last three years in  vronsky felt a delightful sense of coming back to the careless petersburg life that he was used to  impossible   he cried  letting down the pedal of the washing basin in which he had been sousing his healthy red neck
 impossible   he cried  at the news that laura had flung over fertinghof and had made up to mileev
 and is he as stupid and pleased as ever  well  and how s buzulukov    oh  there is a tale about buzulukov simply lovely   cried petritsky
 you know his weakness for balls  and he never misses a single court ball
he went to a big ball in a new helmet
have you seen the new helmets  very nice  lighter
well  so he s standing   
no  i say  do listen   anna karenina 254 of 1759  i am listening   answered vronsky  rubbing himself with a rough towel  up comes the grand duchess with some ambassador or other  and  as ill luck would have it  she begins talking to him about the new helmets
the grand duchess positively wanted to show the new helmet to the ambassador
they see our friend standing there    petritsky mimicked how he was standing with the helmet    the grand duchess asked him to give her the helmet  he doesn t give it to her
what do you think of that  well  every one s winking at him  nodding  frowning give it to her  do  he doesn t give it to her
he s mute as a fish
only picture it   
well  the   what s his name  whatever he was   tries to take the helmet from him   he won t give it up   
he pulls it from him  and hands it to the grand duchess
 here  your highness   says he   is the new helmet   she turned the helmet the other side up  and  just picture it  plop went a pear and sweetmeats out of it  two pounds of sweetmeats    he d been storing them up  the darling   vronsky burst into roars of laughter
and long afterwards  when he was talking of other things  he broke out into his healthy laugh  showing his strong  close rows of teeth  when he thought of the helmet
anna karenina 255 of 1759 having heard all the news  vronsky  with the assistance of his valet  got into his uniform  and went off to report himself he intended  when he had done that  to drive to his brother s and to betsy s and to pay several visits with a view to beginning to go into that society where he might meet madame karenina
as he always did in petersburg  he left home not meaning to return till late at night
anna karenina 256 of 1759 part two anna karenina 257 of 1759 at the end of the winter  in the shtcherbatskys  house  a consultation was being held  which was to pronounce on the state of kitty s health and the measures to be taken to restore her failing strength
she had been ill  and as spring came on she grew worse
the family doctor gave her cod liver oil  then iron  then nitrate of silver  but as the first and the second and the third were alike in doing no good  and as his advice when spring came was to go abroad  a celebrated physician was called in
the celebrated physician  a very handsome man  still youngish  asked to examine the patient
he maintained  with peculiar satisfaction  it seemed  that maiden modesty is a mere relic of barbarism  and that nothing could be more natural than for a man still youngish to handle a young girl naked
he thought it natural because he did it every day  and felt and thought  as it seemed to him  no harm as he did it and consequently he considered modesty in the girl not merely as a relic of barbarism  but also as an insult to himself there was nothing for it but to submit  since  although all the doctors had studied in the same school  had read the same books  and learned the same science  and though some people said this celebrated doctor was a bad doctor  anna karenina 258 of 1759 in the princess s household and circle it was for some reason accepted that this celebrated doctor alone had some special knowledge  and that he alone could save kitty
after a careful examination and sounding of the bewildered patient  dazed with shame  the celebrated doctor  having scrupulously washed his hands  was standing in the drawing room talking to the prince
the prince frowned and coughed  listening to the doctor
as a man who had seen something of life  and neither a fool nor an invalid  he had no faith in medicine  and in his heart was furious at the whole farce  specially as he was perhaps the only one who fully comprehended the cause of kitty s illness
 conceited blockhead   he thought  as he listened to the celebrated doctor s chatter about his daughter s symptoms the doctor was meantime with difficulty restraining the expression of his contempt for this old gentleman  and with difficulty condescending to the level of his intelligence
he perceived that it was no good talking to the old man  and that the principal person in the house was the mother
before her he decided to scatter his pearls
at that instant the princess came into the drawing room with the family doctor
the prince withdrew  trying not to show how ridiculous he thought the whole anna karenina 259 of 1759 performance
the princess was distracted  and did not know what to do
she felt she had sinned against kitty
 well  doctor  decide our fate   said the princess
 tell me everything    is there hope   she meant to say  but her lips quivered  and she could not utter the question
 well  doctor    immediately  princess
i will talk it over with my colleague  and then i will have the honor of laying my opinion before you    so we had better leave you    as you please   the princess went out with a sigh
when the doctors were left alone  the family doctor began timidly explaining his opinion  that there was a commencement of tuberculous trouble  but   and so on
the celebrated doctor listened to him  and in the middle of his sentence looked at his big gold watch
 yes   said he
 but    the family doctor respectfully ceased in the middle of his observations
 the commencement of the tuberculous process we are not  as you are aware  able to define  till there are cavities  there is nothing definite
but we may suspect it
and there are indications  malnutrition  nervous excitability  and so anna karenina 260 of 1759 on
the question stands thus  in presence of indications of tuberculous process  what is to be done to maintain nutrition    but  you know  there are always moral  spiritual causes at the back in these cases   the family doctor permitted himself to interpolate with a subtle smile  yes  that s an understood thing   responded the celebrated physician  again glancing at his watch
 beg pardon  is the yausky bridge done yet  or shall i have to drive around   he asked
 ah  it is
oh  well  then i can do it in twenty minutes
so we were saying the problem may be put thus  to maintain nutrition and to give tone to the nerves
the one is in close connection with the other  one must attack both sides at once    and how about a tour abroad   asked the family doctor
 i ve no liking for foreign tours
and take note  if there is an early stage of tuberculous process  of which we cannot be certain  a foreign tour will be of no use
what is wanted is means of improving nutrition  and not for lowering it   and the celebrated doctor expounded his plan of treatment with soden waters  a remedy obviously prescribed primarily on the ground that they could do no harm
anna karenina 261 of 1759 the family doctor listened attentively and respectfully
 but in favor of foreign travel i would urge the change of habits  the removal from conditions calling up reminiscences
and then the mother wishes it   he added
 ah  well  in that case  to be sure  let them go
only  those german quacks are mischievous   
they ought to be persuaded   
well  let them go then   he glanced once more at his watch
 oh  time s up already   and he went to the door
the celebrated doctor announced to the princess  a feeling of what was due from him dictated his doing so  that he ought to see the patient once more
 what  another examination   cried the mother  with horror
 oh  no  only a few details  princess    come this way   and the mother  accompanied by the doctor  went into the drawing room to kitty
wasted and flushed  with a peculiar glitter in her eyes  left there by the agony of shame she had been put through  kitty stood in the middle of the room
when the doctor came in she flushed crimson  and her eyes filled with tears all her illness and treatment struck her as a thing so stupid  ludicrous even  doctoring her seemed to her as absurd as putting together anna karenina 262 of 1759 the pieces of a broken vase
her heart was broken
why would they try to cure her with pills and powders  but she could not grieve her mother  especially as her mother considered herself to blame
 may i trouble you to sit down  princess   the celebrated doctor said to her
he sat down with a smile  facing her  felt her pulse  and again began asker her tiresome questions
she answered him  and all at once got up  furious
 excuse me  doctor  but there is really no object in this
this is the third time you ve asked me the same thing   the celebrated doctor did not take offense
 nervous irritability   he said to the princess  when kitty had left the room
 however  i had finished    and the doctor began scientifically explaining to the princess  as an exceptionally intelligent woman  the condition of the young princess  and concluded by insisting on the drinking of the waters  which were certainly harmless
at the question  should they go abroad  the doctor plunged into deep meditation  as though resolving a weighty problem
finally his decision was pronounced  they were to go abroad  but to put no faith in foreign quacks  and to apply to him in any need
anna karenina 263 of 1759 it seemed as though some piece of good fortune had come to pass after the doctor had gone
the mother was much more cheerful when she went back to her daughter  and kitty pretended to be more cheerful
she had often  almost always  to be pretending now
 really  i m quite well  mamma
but if you want to go abroad  let s go   she said  and trying to appear interested in the proposed tour  she began talking of the preparations for the journey
anna karenina 264 of 1759 soon after the doctor  dolly had arrived
she knew that there was to be a consultation that day  and though she was only just up after her confinement  she had another baby  a little girl  born at the end of the winter   though she had trouble and anxiety enough of her own  she had left her tiny baby and a sick child  to come and hear kitty s fate  which was to be decided that day
 well  well   she said  coming into the drawing room  without taking off her hat
 you re all in good spirits
good news  then   they tried to tell her what the doctor had said  but it appeared that though the doctor had talked distinctly enough and at great length  it was utterly impossible to report what he had said
the only point of interest was that it was settled they should go abroad
dolly could not help sighing
her dearest friend  her sister  was going away
and her life was not a cheerful one
her relations with stepan arkadyevitch after their reconciliation had become humiliating
the union anna had cemented turned out to be of no solid character  and family harmony was breaking down again at the same anna karenina 265 of 1759 point
there had been nothing definite  but stepan arkadyevitch was hardly ever at home  money  too  was hardly ever forthcoming  and dolly was continually tortured by suspicions of infidelity  which she tried to dismiss  dreading the agonies of jealousy she had been through already
the first onslaught of jealousy  once lived through  could never come back again  and even the discovery of infidelities could never now affect her as it had the first time
such a discovery now would only mean breaking up family habits  and she let herself be deceived  despising him and still more herself  for the weakness
besides this  the care of her large family was a constant worry to her  first  the nursing of her young baby did not go well  then the nurse had gone away  now one of the children had fallen ill
 well  how are all of you   asked her mother
 ah  mamma  we have plenty of troubles of our own
lili is ill  and i m afraid it s scarlatina
i have come here now to hear about kitty  and then i shall shut myself up entirely  if god forbid it should be scarlatina   the old prince too had come in from his study after the doctor s departure  and after presenting his cheek to dolly  and saying a few words to her  he turned to his wife  anna karenina 266 of 1759  how have you settled it  you re going  well  and what do you mean to do with me    i suppose you had better stay here  alexander   said his wife
 that s as you like    mamma  why shouldn t father come with us   said kitty
 it would be nicer for him and for us too   the old prince got up and stroked kitty s hair
she lifted her head and looked at them with a forced smile
it always seemed to her that he understood her better than anyone in the family  though he did not say much about her
being the youngest  she was her father s favorite  and she fancied that his love gave him insight
when now her glance meet his blue kindly eyes looking intently at her  it seemed to her that he saw right through her  and understood all that was not good that was passing within her
reddening  she stretched out towards him expecting a kiss  but he only patted her hair and said   these stupid chignons  there s no getting at the real daughter one simply strokes the bristles of dead women
well  dolinka   he turned to his elder daughter   what s your young buck about  hey   anna karenina 267 of 1759  nothing  father   answered dolly  understanding that her husband was meant
 he s always out  i scarcely ever see him   she could not resist adding with a sarcastic smile
 why  hasn t he gone into the country yet to see about selling that forest    no  he s still getting ready for the journey    oh  that s it   said the prince
 and so am i to be getting ready for a journey too  at your service   he said to his wife  sitting down
 and i tell you what  katia   he went on to his younger daughter   you must wake up one fine day and say to yourself  why  i m quite well  and merry  and going out again with father for an early morning walk in the frost
hey   what her father said seemed simple enough  yet at these words kitty became confused and overcome like a detected criminal
 yes  he sees it all  he understands it all  and in these words he s telling me that though i m ashamed  i must get over my shame   she could not pluck up spirit to make any answer
she tried to begin  and all at once burst into tears  and rushed out of the room
 see what comes of your jokes   the princess pounced down on her husband
 you re always     she began a string of reproaches
anna karenina 268 of 1759 the prince listened to the princess s scolding rather a long while without speaking  but his face was more and more frowning
 she s so much to be pitied  poor child  so much to be pitied  and you don t feel how it hurts her to hear the slightest reference to the cause of it
ah  to be so mistaken in people   said the princess  and by the change in her tone both dolly and the prince knew she was speaking of vronsky
 i don t know why there aren t laws against such base  dishonorable people    ah  i can t bear to hear you   said the prince gloomily  getting up from his low chair  and seeming anxious to get away  yet stopping in the doorway
 there are laws  madam  and since you ve challenged me to it  i ll tell you who s to blame for it all  you and you  you and nobody else
laws against such young gallants there have always been  and there still are  yes  if there has been nothing that ought not to have been  old as i am  i d have called him out to the barrier  the young dandy
yes  and now you physic her and call in these quacks   the prince apparently had plenty more to say  but as soon as the princess heard his tone she subsided at once  and became penitent  as she always did on serious occasions
anna karenina 269 of 1759  alexander  alexander   she whispered  moving to him and beginning to weep
as soon as she began to cry the prince too calmed down
he went up to her
 there  that s enough  that s enough  you re wretched too  i know it can t be helped
there s no great harm done
god is merciful   thanks     he said  not knowing what he was saying  as he responded to the tearful kiss of the princess that he felt on his hand
and the prince went out of the room
before this  as soon as kitty went out of the room in tears  dolly  with her motherly  family instincts  had promptly perceived that here a woman s work lay before her  and she prepared to do it
she took of her hat  and  morally speaking  tucked up her sleeves and prepared for action
while her mother was attacking her father  she tried to restrain her mother  so far as filial reverence would allow
during the prince s outburst she was silent  she felt ashamed for her mother  and tender towards her father for so quickly being kind again
but when her father left them she made ready for what was the chief thing needful to go to kitty and console her
 i d been meaning to tell you something for a long while  mamma  did you know that levin meant to make anna karenina 270 of 1759 kitty an offer when he was here the last time  he told stiva so    well  what then  i don t understand     so did kitty perhaps refuse him   
she didn t tell you so    no  she has said nothing to me either of one or the other  she s too proud
but i know it s all on account of the other    yes  but suppose she has refused levin  and she wouldn t have refused him if it hadn t been for the other  i know
and then  he has deceived her so horribly   it was too terrible for the princess to think how she had sinned against her daughter  and she broke out angrily
 oh  i really don t understand  nowadays they will all go their own way  and mothers haven t a word to say in anything  and then     mamma  i ll go up to her    well  do
did i tell you not to   said her mother
anna karenina 271 of 1759 when she went into kitty s little room  a pretty  pink little room  full of knick knacks in vieux saxe  as fresh  and pink  and white  and gay as kitty herself had been two months ago  dolly remembered how they had decorated the room the year before together  with what love and gaiety
her heart turned cold when she saw kitty sitting on a low chair near the door  her eyes fixed immovably on a corner of the rug
kitty glanced at her sister  and the cold  rather ill tempered expression of her face did not change
 i m just going now  and i shall have to keep in and you won t be able to come to see me   said dolly  sitting down beside her
 i want to talk to you    what about   kitty asked swiftly  lifting her head in dismay
 what should it be  but your trouble    i have no trouble    nonsense  kitty
do you suppose i could help knowing  i know all about it
and believe me  it s of so little consequence   
we ve all been through it   anna karenina 272 of 1759 kitty did not speak  and her face had a stern expression
 he s not worth your grieving over him   pursued darya alexandrovna  coming straight to the point
 no  because he has treated me with contempt   said kitty  in a breaking voice
 don t talk of it  please  don t talk of it    but who can have told you so  no one has said that
i m certain he was in love with you  and would still be in love with you  if it hadn t  
 oh  the most awful thing of all for me is this sympathizing   shrieked kitty  suddenly flying into a passion
she turned round on her chair  flushed crimson  and rapidly moving her fingers  pinched the clasp of her belt first with one hand and then with the other dolly knew this trick her sister had of clenching her hands when she was much excited  she knew  too  that in moments of excitement kitty was capable of forgetting herself and saying a great deal too much  and dolly would have soothed her  but it was too late
 what  what is it you want to make me feel  eh   said kitty quickly
 that i ve been in love with a man who didn t care a straw for me  and that i m dying of love for him  and this is said to me by my own sister  who anna karenina 273 of 1759 imagines that   that   that she s sympathizing with me    i don t want these condolences and his humbug    kitty  you re unjust    why are you tormenting me    but i   quite the contrary   i see you re unhappy    but kitty in her fury did not hear her
 i ve nothing to grieve over and be comforted about
i am too proud ever to allow myself to care for a man who does not love me    yes  i don t say so either   
only one thing
tell me the truth   said darya alexandrovna  taking her by the hand   tell me  did levin speak to you     the mention of levin s name seemed to deprive kitty of the last vestige of self control
she leaped up from her chair  and flinging her clasp on the ground  she gesticulated rapidly with her hands and said   why bring levin in too  i can t understand what you want to torment me for
i ve told you  and i say it again  that i have some pride  and never  never would i do as you re doing go back to a man who s deceived you  who has cared for another woman
i can t understand it  you may  but i can t   and saying these words she glanced at her sister  and seeing that dolly sat silent  her head mournfully bowed  anna karenina 274 of 1759 kitty  instead of running out of the room as she had meant to do  sat down near the door  and hid her face in her handkerchief
the silence lasted for two minutes  dolly was thinking of herself
that humiliation of which she was always conscious came back to her with a peculiar bitterness when her sister reminded her of it
she had not looked for such cruelty in her sister  and she was angry with her
but suddenly she heard the rustle of a skirt  and with it the sound of heart rending  smothered sobbing  and felt arms about her neck kitty was on her knees before her
 dolinka  i am so  so wretched   she whispered penitently and the sweet face covered with tears hid itself in darya alexandrovna s skirt
as though tears were the indispensable oil  without which the machinery of mutual confidence could not run smoothly between the two sisters  the sisters after their tears talked  not of what was uppermost in their minds  but  though they talked of outside matters  they understood each other
kitty knew that the words she had uttered in anger about her husband s infidelity and her humiliating position had cut her poor sister to the heart  but that she had forgiven her
dolly for her part knew all she had wanted to find out
she felt certain that her anna karenina 275 of 1759 surmises were correct  that kitty s misery  her inconsolable misery  was due precisely to the fact that levin had made her an offer and she had refused him  and vronsky had deceived her  and that she was fully prepared to love levin and to detest vronsky
kitty said not a word of that  she talked of nothing but her spiritual condition
 i have nothing to make me miserable   she said  getting calmer   but can you understand that everything has become hateful  loathsome  coarse to me  and i myself most of all  you can t imagine what loathsome thoughts i have about everything    why  whatever loathsome thoughts can you have   asked dolly  smiling
 the most utterly loathsome and coarse  i can t tell you
it s not unhappiness  or low spirits  but much worse
as though everything that was good in me was all hidden away  and nothing was left but the most loathsome
come  how am i to tell you   she went on  seeing the puzzled look in her sister s eyes
 father began saying something to me just now   
it seems to me he thinks all i want is to be married mother takes me to a ball  it seems to me she only takes me to get me married off as soon as may be  and be rid of me i know it s not the truth  but i can t drive away such thoughts
eligible suitors  as they call anna karenina 276 of 1759 them i can t bear to see them
it seems to me they re taking stock of me and summing me up in old days to go anywhere in a ball dress was a simple joy to me  i admired myself  now i feel ashamed and awkward
and then  the doctor   
then     kitty hesitated  she wanted to say further that ever since this change had taken place in her  stepan arkadyevitch had become insufferably repulsive to her  and that she could not see him without the grossest and most hideous conceptions rising before her imagination
 oh  well  everything presents itself to me  in the coarsest  most loathsome light   she went on
 that s my illness
perhaps it will pass off    but you mustn t think about it    i can t help it
i m never happy except with the children at your house    what a pity you can t be with me    oh  yes  i m coming
i ve had scarlatina  and i ll persuade mamma to let me   kitty insisted on having her way  and went to stay at her sister s and nursed the children all through the scarlatina  for scarlatina it turned out to be
the two sisters brought all the six children successfully through it  but anna karenina 277 of 1759 kitty was no better in health  and in lent the shtcherbatskys went abroad
anna karenina 278 of 1759 the highest petersburg society is essentially one  in it everyone knows everyone else  everyone even visits everyone else
but this great set has its subdivisions
anna arkadyevna karenina had friends and close ties in three different circles of this highest society
one circle was her husband s government official set  consisting of his colleagues and subordinates  brought together in the most various and capricious manner  and belonging to different social strata
anna found it difficult now to recall the feeling of almost awe stricken reverence which she had at first entertained for these persons
now she knew all of them as people know one another in a country town  she knew their habits and weaknesses  and where the shoe pinched each one of them
she knew their relations with one another and with the head authorities  knew who was for whom  and how each one maintained his position  and where they agreed and disagreed
but the circle of political  masculine interests had never interested her  in spite of countess kidia ivanovna s influence  and she avoided it
anna karenina 279 of 1759 another little set with which anna was in close relations was the one by means of which alexey alexandrovitch had made his career
the center of this circle was the countess lidia ivanovna
it was a set made up of elderly  ugly  benevolent  and godly women  and clever  learned  and ambitious men
one of the clever people belonging to the set had called it  the conscience of petersburg society   alexey alexandrovitch had the highest esteem for this circle  and anna with her special gift for getting on with everyone  had in the early days of her life in petersburg made friends in this circle also
now  since her return from moscow  she had come to feel this set insufferable
it seemed to her that both she and all of them were insincere  and she fell so bored and ill at ease in that world that she went to see the countess lidia ivanovna as little as possible
the third circle with which anna had ties was preeminently the fashionable world the world of balls  of dinners  of sumptuous dresses  the world that hung on to the court with one hand  so as to avoid sinking to the level of the demi monde
for the demi monde the members of that fashionable world believed that they despised  though their tastes were not merely similar  but in fact identical
her connection with this circle was kept up through anna karenina 280 of 1759 princess betsy tverskaya  her cousin s wife  who had an income of a hundred and twenty thousand roubles  and who had taken a great fancy to anna ever since she first came out  showed her much attention  and drew her into her set  making fun of countess kidia ivanovna s coterie
 when i m old and ugly i ll be the same   betsy used to say   but for a pretty young woman like you it s early days for that house of charity   anna had at first avoided as far as she could princess tverskaya s world  because it necessitated an expenditure beyond her means  and besides in her heart she preferred the first circle
but since her visit to moscow she had done quite the contrary
she avoided her serious minded friends  and went out into the fashionable world
there she met vronsky  and experienced an agitating joy at those meetings
she met vronsky specially often at betsy s for betsy was a vronsky by birth and his cousin
vronsky was everywhere where he had any chance of meeting anna  and speaking to her  when he could  of his love
she gave him no encouragement  but every time she met him there surged up in her heart that same feeling of quickened life that had come upon her that day in the railway carriage when she saw him for the first time
she was conscious herself that her delight sparkled in her eyes and curved her anna karenina 281 of 1759 lips into a smile  and she could not quench the expression of this delight
at first anna sincerely believed that she was displeased with him for daring to pursue her
soon after her return from moscow  on arriving at a soiree where she had expected to meet him  and not finding him there  she realized distinctly from the rush of disappointment that she had been deceiving herself  and that this pursuit was not merely not distasteful to her  but that it made the whole interest of her life
a celebrated singer was singing for the second time  and all the fashionable world was in the theater
vronsky  seeing his cousin from his stall in the front row  did not wait till the entr acte  but went to her box
 why didn t you come to dinner   she said to him
 i marvel at the second sight of lovers   she added with a smile  so that no one but he could hear   she wasn t there
but come after the opera   vronsky looked inquiringly at her
she nodded
he thanked her by a smile  and sat down beside her
 but how i remember your jeers   continued princess betsy  who took a peculiar pleasure in following up this passion to a successful issue
 what s become of all that  you re caught  my dear boy   anna karenina 282 of 1759  that s my one desire  to be caught   answered vronsky  with his serene  good humored smile
 if i complain of anything it s only that i m not caught enough  to tell the truth
i begin to lose hope    why  whatever hope can you have   said betsy  offended on behalf of her friend
 enendons nous      but in her eyes there were gleams of light that betrayed that she understood perfectly and precisely as he did what hope he might have  none whatever   said vronsky  laughing and showing his even rows of teeth
 excuse me   he added  taking an opera glass out of her hand  and proceeding to scrutinize  over her bare shoulder  the row of boxes facing them
 i m afraid i m becoming ridiculous   he was very well aware that he ran no risk of being ridiculous in the eyes of betsy or any other fashionable people
he was very well aware that in their eyes the position of an unsuccessful lover of a girl  or of any woman free to marry  might be ridiculous
but the position of a man pursuing a married woman  and  regardless of everything  staking his life on drawing her into adultery  has something fine and grand about it  and can never be ridiculous  and so it was with a proud and anna karenina 283 of 1759 gay smile under his mustaches that he lowered the opera glass and looked at his cousin
 but why was it you didn t come to dinner   she said  admiring him
 i must tell you about that
i was busily employed  and doing what  do you suppose  i ll give you a hundred guesses  a thousand   you d never guess
i ve been reconciling a husband with a man who d insulted his wife
yes  really    well  did you succeed    almost    you really must tell me about it   she said  getting up
 come to me in the next entr acte    i can t  i m going to the french theater    from nilsson   betsy queried in horror  though she could not herself have distinguished nilsson s voice from any chorus girl s
 can t help it
i ve an appointment there  all to do with my mission of peace     blessed are the peacemakers  theirs is the kingdom of heaven    said betsy  vaguely recollecting she had heard some similar saying from someone
 very well  then  sit down  and tell me what it s all about   and she sat down again
anna karenina 284 of 1759  this is rather indiscreet  but it s so good it s an awful temptation to tell the story   said vronsky  looking at her with his laughing eyes
 i m not going to mention any names    but i shall guess  so much the better    well  listen  two festive young men were driving     officers of your regiment  of course    i didn t say they were officers  two young men who had been lunching    in other words  drinking    possibly
they were driving on their way to dinner with a friend in the most festive state of mind
and they beheld a pretty woman in a hired sledge  she overtakes them  looks round at them  and  so they fancy anyway  nods to them and laughs
they  of course  follow her
they gallop at full speed
to their amazement  the fair one alights at the entrance of the very house to which they were going
the fair one darts upstairs to the top story
they get a glimpse of red lips under a short veil  and exquisite little feet   anna karenina 285 of 1759  you describe it with such feeling that i fancy you must be one of the two    and after what you said  just now  well  the young men go in to their comrade s  he was giving a farewell dinner there they certainly did drink a little too much  as one always does at farewell dinners
and at dinner they inquire who lives at the top in that house
no one knows  only their host s valet  in answer to their inquiry whether any  young ladies  are living on the top floor  answered that there were a great many of them about there
after dinner the two young men go into their host s study  and write a letter to the unknown fair one
they compose an ardent epistle  a declaration in fact  and they carry the letter upstairs themselves  so as to elucidate whatever might appear not perfectly intelligible in the letter    why are you telling me these horrible stories  well    they ring a maidservant opens the door  they hand her the letter  and assure the maid that they re both so in love that they ll die on the spot at the door
the maid  stupefied  carries in their messages
all at once a gentleman appears with whiskers like sausages  as red as a lobster  announces that there is no one living in the flat except his wife  and sends them both about their business   anna karenina 286 of 1759  how do you know he had whiskers like sausages  as you say    ah  you shall hear
i ve just been to make peace between them    well  and what then    that s the most interesting part of the story
it appears that it s a happy couple  a government clerk and his lady
the government clerk lodges a complaint  and i became a mediator  and such a mediator   
i assure you talleyrand couldn t hold a candle to me    why  where was the difficulty    ah  you shall hear   
we apologize in due form  we are in despair  we entreat forgiveness for the unfortunate misunderstanding
the government clerk with the sausages begins to melt  but he  too  desires to express his sentiments  and as soon as ever he begins to express them  he begins to get hot and say nasty things  and again i m obliged to trot out all my diplomatic talents
i allowed that their conduct was bad  but i urged him to take into consideration their heedlessness  their youth  then  too  the young men had only just been lunching together
 you understand
they regret it deeply  and beg you to overlook their misbehavior   the government clerk was softened once more
 i consent  count  and am ready to anna karenina 287 of 1759 overlook it  but you perceive that my wife my wife s a respectable woman  his been exposed to the persecution  and insults  and effrontery of young upstarts  scoundrels      and you must understand  the young upstarts are present all the while  and i have to keep the peace between them
again i call out all my diplomacy  and again as soon as the thing was about at an end  our friend the government clerk gets hot and red  and his sausages stand on end with wrath  and once more i launch out into diplomatic wiles    ah  he must tell you this story   said betsy  laughing  to a lady to came into her box
 he has been making me laugh so    well  bonne chance   she added  giving vronsky one finger of the hand in which she held her fan  and with a shrug of her shoulders she twitched down the bodice of her gown that had worked up  so as to be duly naked as she moved forward towards the footlights into the light of the gas  and the sight of all eyes
vronsky drove to the french theater  where he really had to see the colonel of his regiment  who never missed a single performance there
he wanted to see him  to report on the result of his mediation  which had occupied and amused him for the last three days
petritsky  whom he liked  was implicated in the affair  and the other culprit anna karenina 288 of 1759 was a capital fellow and first rate comrade  who had lately joined the regiment  the young prince kedrov and what was most important  the interests of the regiment were involved in it too
both the young men were in vronsky s company
the colonel of the regiment was waited upon by the government clerk  venden  with a complaint against his officers  who had insulted his wife
his young wife  so venden told the story he had been married half a year  was at church with her mother  and suddenly overcome by indisposition  arising from her interesting condition  she could not remain standing  she drove home in the first sledge  a smart looking one  she came across
on the spot the officers set off in pursuit of her  she was alarmed  and feeling still more unwell  ran up the staircase home
venden himself  on returning from his office  heard a ring at their bell and voices  went out  and seeing the intoxicated officers with a letter  he had turned them out he asked for exemplary punishment
 yes  it s all very well   said the colonel to vronsky  whom he had invited to come and see him
 petritsky s becoming impossible
not a week goes by without some scandal
this government clerk won t let it drop  he ll go on with the thing   anna karenina 289 of 1759 vronsky saw all the thanklessness of the business  and that there could be no question of a duel in it  that everything must be done to soften the government clerk  and hush the matter up
the colonel had called in vronsky just because he knew him to be an honorable and intelligent man  and  more than all  a man who cared for the honor of the regiment
they talked it over  and decided that petritsky and kedrov must go with vronsky to venden s to apologize
the colonel and vronsky were both fully aware that vronsky s name and rank would be sure to contribute greatly to softening of the injured husband s feelings
and these two influences were not in fact without effect  though the result remained  as vronsky had described  uncertain
on reaching the french theater  vronsky retired to the foyer with the colonel  and reported to him his success  or non success
the colonel  thinking it all over  made up his mind not to pursue the matter further  but then for his own satisfaction proceeded to cross examine vronsky about his interview  and it was a long while before he could restrain his laughter  as vronsky described how the government clerk  after subsiding for a while  would suddenly flare up again  as he recalled the details  and how anna karenina 290 of 1759 vronsky  at the last half word of conciliation  skillfully maneuvered a retreat  shoving petritsky out before him
 it s a disgraceful story  but killing
kedrov really can t fight the gentleman  was he so awfully hot   he commented  laughing
 but what do you say to claire today  she s marvelous   he went on  speaking of a new french actress
 however often you see her  every day she s different
it s only the french who can to that   anna karenina 291 of 1759 princess betsy drove home from the theater  without waiting for the end of the last act
she had only just time to go into her dressing room  sprinkle her long  pale face with powder  rub it  set her dress to rights  and order tea in the big drawing room  when one after another carriages drove up to her huge house in bolshaia morskaia
her guests stepped out at the wide entrance  and the stout porter  who used to read the newspapers in the mornings behind the glass door  to the edification of the passers by  noiselessly opened the immense door  letting the visitors pass by him into the house
almost at the same instant the hostess  with freshly arranged coiffure and freshened face  walked in at one door and her guests at the other door of the drawing room  a large room with dark walls  downy rugs  and a brightly lighted table  gleaming with the light of candles  white cloth  silver samovar  and transparent china tea things
the hostess sat down at the table and took off her gloves
chairs were set with the aid of footmen  moving almost imperceptibly about the room  the party settled anna karenina 292 of 1759 itself  divided into two groups  one round the samovar near the hostess  the other at the opposite end of the drawing room  round the handsome wife of an ambassador  in black velvet  with sharply defined black eyebrows
in both groups conversation wavered  as it always does  for the first few minutes  broken up by meetings  greetings  offers of tea  and as it were  feeling about for something to rest upon
 she s exceptionally good as an actress  one can see she s studied kaulbach   said a diplomatic attache in the group round the ambassador s wife
 did you notice how she fell down      oh  please  don t let us talk about nilsson  no one can possibly say anything new about her   said a fat  red faced  flaxen headed lady  without eyebrows and chignon  wearing an old silk dress
this was princess myakaya  noted for her simplicity and the roughness of her manners  and nicknamed enfant terrible
princess myakaya  sitting in the middle between the two groups  and listening to both  took part in the conversation first of one and then of the other
 three people have used that very phrase about kaulbach to me today already  just as though they had made a compact about it
and i can t see why they liked that remark so   anna karenina 293 of 1759 the conversation was cut short by this observation  and a new subject had to be thought of again
 do tell me something amusing but not spiteful   said the ambassador s wife  a great proficient in the art of that elegant conversation called by the english  small talk
she addressed the attache  who was at a loss now what to begin upon
 they say that that s a difficult task  that nothing s amusing that isn t spiteful   he began with a smile
 but i ll try
get me a subject
it all lies in the subject
if a subject s given me  it s easy to spin something round it
i often think that the celebrated talkers of the last century would have found it difficult to talk cleverly now
everything clever is so stale     that has been said long ago   the ambassador s wife interrupted him  laughing
the conversation began amiably  but just because it was too amiable  it came to a stop again
they had to have recourse to the sure  never failing topic gossip
 don t you think there s something louis quinze about tushkevitch   he said  glancing towards a handsome  fair haired young man  standing at the table
 oh  yes  he s in the same style as the drawing room and that s why it is he s so often here   anna karenina 294 of 1759 this conversation was maintained  since it rested on allusions to what could not be talked on in that room  that is to say  of the relations of tushkevitch with their hostess
round the samovar and the hostess the conversation had been meanwhile vacillating in just the same way between three inevitable topics  the latest piece of public news  the theater  and scandal
it  too  came finally to rest on the last topic  that is  ill natured gossip
 have you heard the maltishtcheva woman the mother  not the daughter has ordered a costume in diable rose color    nonsense  no  that s too lovely    i wonder that with her sense for she s not a fool  you know  that she doesn t see how funny she is   everyone had something to say in censure or ridicule of the luckless madame maltishtcheva  and the conversation crackled merrily  like a burning faggot stack
the husband of princess betsy  a good natured fat man  an ardent collector of engravings  hearing that his wife had visitors  came into the drawing room before going to his club
stepping noiselessly over the thick rugs  he went up to princess myakaya
 how did you like nilsson   he asked
anna karenina 295 of 1759  oh  how can you steal upon anyone like that  how you startled me   she responded
 please don t talk to me about the opera  you know nothing about music
i d better meet you on your own ground  and talk about your majolica and engravings
come now  what treasure have yo been buying lately at the old curiosity shops    would you like me to show you  but you don t understand such things    oh  do show me  i ve been learning about them at those what s their names    the bankers   they ve some splendid engravings
they showed them to us    why  have you been at the schuetzburgs   asked the hostess from the samovar
 yes  ma chere
they asked my husband and me to dinner  and told us the sauce at that dinner cost a hundred pounds   princess myakaya said  speaking loudly  and conscious everyone was listening   and very nasty sauce it was  some green mess
we had to ask them  and i made them sauce for eighteen pence  and everybody was very much pleased with it
i can t run to hundred pound sauces    she s unique   said the lady of the house
 marvelous   said someone
anna karenina 296 of 1759 the sensation produced by princess myakaya s speeches was always unique  and the secret of the sensation she produced lay in the fact that though she spoke not always appropriately  as now  she said simple things with some sense in them
in the society in which she lived such plain statements produced the effect of the wittiest epigram
princess myakaya could never see why it had that effect  but she knew it had  and took advantage of it
as everyone had been listening while princess myakaya spoke  and so the conversation around the ambassador s wife had dropped  princess betsy tried to bring the whole party together  and turned to the ambassador s wife
 will you really not have tea  you should come over here by us    no  we re very happy here   the ambassador s wife responded with a smile  and she went on with the conversation that had been begun
 it was a very agreeable conversation
they were criticizing the karenins  husband and wife
 anna is quite changed since her stay in moscow
there s something strange about her   said her friend
 the great change is that she brought back with her the shadow of alexey vronsky   said the ambassador s wife
anna karenina 297 of 1759  well  what of it  there s a fable of grimm s about a man without a shadow  a man who s lost his shadow
and that s his punishment for something
i never could understand how it was a punishment
but a woman must dislike being without a shadow    yes  but women with a shadow usually come to a bad end   said anna s friend
 bad luck to your tongue   said princess myakaya suddenly
 madame karenina s a splendid woman
i don t like her husband  but i like her very much    why don t you like her husband  he s such a remarkable man   said the ambassador s wife
 my husband says there are few statesmen like him in europe    and my husband tells me just the same  but i don t believe it   said princess myakaya
 if our husbands didn t talk to us  we should see the facts as they are
alexey alexandrovitch  to my thinking  is simply a fool
i say it in a whisper   but doesn t it really make everything clear  before  when i was told to consider him clever  i kept looking for his ability  and thought myself a fool for not seeing it  but directly i said  he a fool  though only in a whisper  everything s explained  isn t it    how spiteful you are today   anna karenina 298 of 1759  not a bit
i d no other way out of it
one of the two had to be a fool
and  well  you know one can t say that of oneself     no one is satisfied with his fortune  and everyone is satisfied with his wit    the attache repeated the french saying
 that s just it  just it   princess myakaya turned to him
 but the point is that i won t abandon anna to your mercies
she s so nice  so charming
how can she help it if they re all in love with her  and follow her about like shadows    oh  i had no idea of blaming her for it   anna s friend said in self defense
 if no one follows us about like a shadow  that s no proof that we ve any right to blame her   and having duly disposed of anna s friend  the princess myakaya got up  and together with the ambassador s wife  joined the group at the table  where the conversation was dealing with the king of prussia
 what wicked gossip were you talking over there   asked betsy
 about the karenins
the princess gave us a sketch of alexey alexandrovitch   said the ambassador s wife with a smile  as she sat down at the table anna karenina 299 of 1759  pity we didn t hear it   said princess betsy  glancing towards the door
 ah  here you are at last   she said  turning with a smile to vronsky  as he came in
vronsky was not merely acquainted with all the persons whom he was meeting here  he saw them all every day  and so he came in with the quiet manner with which one enters a room full of people from whom one has only just parted
 where do i come from   he said  in answer to a question from the ambassador s wife
 well  there s no help for it  i must confess
from the opera bouffe
i do believe i ve seen it a hundred times  and always with fresh enjoyment
it s exquisite  i know it s disgraceful  but i go to sleep at the opera  and i sit out the opera bouffe to the last minute  and enjoy it
this evening    he mentioned a french actress  and was going to tell something about her  but the ambassador s wife  with playful horror  cut him short
 please don t tell us about that horror    all right  i won t especially as everyone knows those horrors    and we should all go to see them if it were accepted as the correct thing  like the opera   chimed in princess myakaya
anna karenina 300 of 1759 steps were heard at the door  and princess betsy  knowing it was madame karenina  glanced at vronsky
he was looking towards the door  and his face wore a strange new expression
joyfully  intently  and at the same time timidly  he gazed at the approaching figure  and slowly he rose to his feet
anna walked into the drawing room
holding herself extremely erect  as always  looking straight before her  and moving with her swift  resolute  and light step  that distinguished her from all other society women  she crossed the short space to her hostess  shook hands with her  smiled  and with the same smile looked around at vronsky
vronsky bowed low and pushed a chair up for her
she acknowledged this only by a slight nod  flushed a little  and frowned
but immediately  while rapidly greeting her acquaintances  and shaking the hands proffered to her  she addressed princess betsy   i have been at countess lidia s  and meant to have come here earlier  but i stayed on
sir john was there
he s very interesting    oh  that s this missionary   anna karenina 301 of 1759  yes  he told us about the life in india  most interesting things   the conversation  interrupted by her coming in  flickered up again like the light of a lamp being blown out
 sir john  yes  sir john  i ve seen him
he speaks well
the vlassieva girl s quite in love with him    and is it true the younger vlassieva girl s to marry topov    yes  they say it s quite a settled thing    i wonder at the parents  they say it s a marriage for love    for love  what antediluvian notions you have  can one talk of love in these days   said the ambassador s wife
 what s to be done  it s a foolish old fashion that s kept up still   said vronsky
 so much the worse for those who keep up the fashion
the only happy marriages i know are marriages of prudence    yes  but then how often the happiness of these prudent marriages flies away like dust just because that passion turns up that they have refused to recognize   said vronsky
anna karenina 302 of 1759  but by marriages of prudence we mean those in which both parties have sown their wild oats already
that s like scarlatina one has to go through it and get it over    then they ought to find out how to vaccinate for love  like smallpox    i was in love in my young days with a deacon   said the princess myakaya
 i don t know that it did me any good    no  i imagine  joking apart  that to know love  one must make mistakes and then correct them   said princess betsy
 even after marriage   aid the ambassador s wife playfully
  it s never too late to mend    the attache repeated the english proverb
 just so   betsy agreed   one must make mistakes and correct them
what do you think about it   she turned to anna  who  with a faintly perceptible resolute smile on her lips  was listening in silence to the conversation
 i think   said anna  playing with the glove she had taken off   i think   if so many men  so many minds  certainly so many hearts  so many kinds of love   anna karenina 303 of 1759 vronsky was gazing at anna  and with a fainting heart waiting for what she would say
he sighed as after a danger escaped when she uttered these words
anna suddenly turned to him
 oh  i have had a letter from moscow
they write me that kitty shtcherbatskaya s very ill    really   said vronsky  knitting his brows
anna looked sternly at him
 that doesn t interest you    on the contrary  it does  very much
what was it exactly they told you  if i may know   he questioned
anna got up and went to betsy
 give me a cup of tea   she said  standing at her table
while betsy was pouring out the tea  vronsky went up to anna
 what is it they write to you   he repeated
 i often think men have no understanding of what s not honorable though they re always talking of it   said anna  without answering him
 i ve wanted to tell you so a long while   she added  and moving a few steps away  she sat down at a table in a corner covered with albums  i don t quite understand the meaning of your words   he said  handing her the cup
anna karenina 304 of 1759 she glanced towards the sofa beside her  and he instantly sat down
 yes  i have been wanting to tell you   she said  not looking at him
 you behaved wrongly  very wrongly    do you suppose i don t know that i ve acted wrongly  but who was the cause of my doing so    what do you say that to me for   she said  glancing severely at him
 you know what for   he answered boldly and joyfully  meeting her glance and not dropping his eyes
not he  but she  was confused
 that only shows you have no heart   she said
but her eyes said that she knew he had a heat  and that was why she was afraid of him
 what you spoke of just now was a mistake  and not love    remember that i have forbidden you to utter that word  that hateful word   said anna  with a shudder
but at once she felt that by that very word  forbidden  she had shown that she acknowledged certain rights over him  and by that very fact was encouraging him to speak of love
 i have long meant to tell you this   she went on  looking resolutely into his eyes  and hot all over from the burning flush on her cheeks
 i ve come on purpose this evening  anna karenina 305 of 1759 knowing i should meet you
i have come to tell you that this must end
i have never blushed before anyone  and you force me to feel to blame for something   he looked at her and was struck by a new spiritual beauty in her face
 what do you wish of me   he said simply and seriously
 i want you to go to moscow and ask for kitty s forgiveness   she said
 you don t wish that   he said
he saw she was saying what she forced herself to say  not what she wanted to say
 if you love me  as you say   she whispered   do so that i may be at peace   his face grew radiant
 don t you know that you re all my life to me  but i know no peace  and i can t give to you  all myself and love   yes
i can t think of you and myself apart
you and i are one to me
and i see no chance before us of peace for me or for you
i see a chance of despair  of wretchedness   or i see a chance of bliss  what bliss    can it be there s no chance of it   he murmured with his lips  but she heard
anna karenina 306 of 1759 she strained every effort of her mind to say what ought to be said
but instead of that she let her eyes rest on him  full of love  and made no answer
 it s come   he thought in ecstasy
 when i was beginning to despair  and it seemed there would be no end it s come  she loves me  she owns it    then do this for me  never say such things to me  and let us be friends   she said in words  but her eyes spoke quite differently
 friends we shall never be  you know that yourself
whether we shall be the happiest or the wretchedest of people that s in your hands   she would have said something  but he interrupted her  i ask one thing only  i ask for the right to hope  to suffer as i do
but if even that cannot be  command me to disappear  and i disappear
you shall not see me if my presence is distasteful to you    i don t want to drive you away    only don t change anything  leave everything as it is   he said in a shaky voice
 here s your husband   at that instant alexey alexandrovitch did in fact walk into the room with his calm  awkward gait
glancing at his wife and vronsky  he went up to the lady of the house  and sitting down for a cup of tea  began anna karenina 307 of 1759 talking in his deliberate  always audible voice  in his habitual tone of banter  ridiculing someone
 your rambouillet is in full conclave   he said  looking round at all the party   the graces and the muses   but princess betsy could not endure that tone of his   sneering   as she called it  using the english word  and like a skillful hostess she at once brought him into a serious conversation on the subject of universal conscription
alexey alexandrovitch was immediately interested in the subject  and began seriously defending the new imperial decree against princess betsy  who had attacked it
vronsky and anna still sat at the little table
 this is getting indecorous   whispered one lady  with an expressive glance at madame karenina  vronsky  and her husband
 what did i tell you   said anna s friend
but not only those ladies  almost everyone in the room  even the princess myakaya and betsy herself  looked several times in the direction of the two who had withdrawn from the general circle  as though that were a disturbing fact
alexey alexandrovitch was the only person who did not once look in that direction  and was not diverted from the interesting discussion he had entered upon
anna karenina 308 of 1759 noticing the disagreeable impression that was being made on everyone  princess betsy slipped someone else into her place to listen to alexey alexandrovitch  and went up to anna
 i m always amazed at the clearness and precision of your husband s language   she said
 the most transcendental ideas seem to be within my grasp when he s speaking    oh  yes   said anna  radiant with a smile of happiness  and not understanding a word of what betsy had said
she crossed over to the big table and took part in the general conversation
alexey alexandrovitch  after staying half an hour  went up to his wife and suggested that they should go home together
but she answered  not looking at him  that she was staying to supper
alexey alexandrovitch made his bows and withdrew
the fat old tatar  madame karenina s coachman  was with difficulty holding one of her pair of grays  chilled with the cold and rearing at the entrance
a footman stood opening the carriage door
the hall porter stood holding open the great door of the house
anna arkadyevna  with her quick little hand  was unfastening the lace of her sleeve  caught in the hook of her fur cloak  and with bent anna karenina 309 of 1759 head listening to the words vronsky murmured as he escorted her down
 you ve said nothing  of course  and i ask nothing   he was saying   but you know that friendship s not what i want  that there s only one happiness in life for me  that word that you dislike so   yes  love      love   she repeated slowly  in an inner voice  and suddenly  at the very instant she unhooked the lace  she added   why i don t like the word is that it means too much to me  far more than you can understand   and she glanced into his face
 au revoir   she gave him her hand  and with her rapid  springy step she passed by the porter and vanished into the carriage
her glance  the touch of her hand  set him aflame
he kissed the palm of his hand where she had touched it  and went home  happy in the sense that he had got nearer to the attainment of his aims that evening than during the last two months anna karenina 310 of 1759 alexey alexandrovitch had seen nothing striking or improper in the fact that his wife was sitting with vronsky at a table apart  in eager conversation with him about something
but he noticed that to the rest of the party this appeared something striking and improper  and for that reason it seemed to him too to be improper
he made up his mind that he must speak of it to his wife
on reaching home alexey alexandrovitch went to his study  as he usually did  seated himself in his low chair  opened a book on the papacy at the place where he had laid the paper knife in it  and read till one o clock  just as he usually did but from time to time he rubbed his high forehead and shook his head  as though to drive away something
at his usual time he got up and made his toilet for the night
anna arkadyevna had not yet come in
with a book under his arm he went upstairs
but this evening  instead of his usual thought and meditations upon official details  his thoughts were absorbed by his wife and something disagreeable connected with her
contrary to his usual habit  he did not get into bed  but fell to walking up and down the rooms with his hands clasped behind his anna karenina 311 of 1759 back he could not go to bed  feeling that it was absolutely needful for him first to think thoroughly over the position that had just arisen
when alexey alexandrovitch had made up his mind that he must talk to his wife about it  it had seemed a very easy and simple matter
but now  when he began to think over the question that had just presented itself  it seemed to him very complicated and difficult
alexey alexandrovitch was not jealous
jealousy according to his notions was an insult to one s wife  and one ought to have confidence in one s wife
why one ought to have confidence  that is to say  complete conviction that his young wife would always love him  he did not ask himself but he had no experience of lack of confidence  because he had confidence in her  and told himself that he ought to have it now  though his conviction that jealousy was a shameful feeling and that one ought to feel confidence  had not broken down  he felt that he was standing face to face with something illogical and irrational  and did not know what was to be done
alexey alexandrovitch was standing face to face with life  with the possibility of his wife s loving someone other than himself  and this seemed to him very irrational and incomprehensible because it was life itself all his life anna karenina 312 of 1759 alexey alexandrovitch had lived and worked in official spheres  having to do with the reflection of life
and every time he had stumbled against life itself he had shrunk away from it
now he experienced a feeling akin to that of a man who  wile calmly crossing a precipice by a bridge  should suddenly discover that the bridge is broken  and that there is a chasm below
that chasm was life itself  the bridge that artificial life in which alexey alexandrovitch had lived
for the first time the question presented itself to him of the possibility of his wife s loving someone else  and he was horrified at it
he did not undress  but walked up and down with his regular tread over the resounding parquet of the dining room  where one lamp was burning  over the carpet of the dark drawing room  in which the light was reflected on the big new portrait of himself handing over the sofa  and across her boudoir  where two candles burned  lighting up the portraits of her parents and woman friends  and the pretty knick knacks of her writing table  that he knew so well he walked across her boudoir to the bedroom door  and turned back again
at each turn in his walk  especially at the parquet of the lighted dining room  he halted and said to himself   yes  this i must decide and put a stop to  i must express my view of it and my decision   and he anna karenina 313 of 1759 turned back again  but express what what decision   he said to himself in the drawing room  and he found no reply  but after all   he asked himself before turning into the boudoir   what has occurred  nothing she was talking a long while with him
but what of that  surely women in society can talk to whom they please
and then  jealousy means lowering both myself and her   he told himself as he went into her boudoir  but this dictum  which had always had such weight with him before  had now no weight and no meaning at all and from the bedroom door he turned back again  but as he entered the dark drawing room some inner voice told him that it was not so  and that if others noticed it that showed that there was something
and he said to himself again in the dining room   yes  i must decide and put a stop to it  and express my view of it     and again at the turn in the drawing room he asked himself   decide how   and again he asked himself   what had occurred   and answered   nothing   and recollected that jealousy was a feeling insulting to his wife  but again in the drawing room he was convinced that something had happened his thoughts  like his body  went round a complete circle  without coming upon anything new
he noticed this  rubbed his forehead  and sat down in her boudoir
anna karenina 314 of 1759 there  looking at her table  with the malachite blotting case lying at the top and an unfinished letter  his thoughts suddenly changed
he began to think of her  of what she was thinking and feeling
for the first time he pictured vividly to himself her personal life  her ideas  her desires  and the idea that she could and should have a separate life of her own seemed to him so alarming that he made haste to dispel it it was the chasm which he was afraid to peep into
to put himself in thought and feeling in another person s place was a spiritual exercise not natural to alexey alexandrovitch he looked on this spiritual exercise as a harmful and dangerous abuse of the fancy
 and the worst of it all   thought he   is that just now  at the very moment when my great work is approaching completion   he was thinking of the project he was bringing forward at the time    when i stand in need of all my mental peace and all my energies  just now this stupid worry should fall foul of me
but what s to be done  i m not one of those men who submit to uneasiness and worry without having the force of character to face them    i must think it over  come to a decision  and put it out of my mind   he said aloud
 the question of her feelings  of what has passed and may be passing in her soul  that s not my affair  that s the anna karenina 315 of 1759 affair of her conscience  and falls under the head of religion   he said to himself  feeling consolation in the sense that he had found to which division of regulating principles this new circumstance could be properly referred  and so   alexey alexandrovitch said to himself   questions as to her feelings  and so on  are questions for her conscience  with which i can have nothing to do my duty is clearly defined
as the head of the family  i am a person bound in duty to guide her  and consequently  in part the person responsible  i am bound to point out the danger i perceive  to warn her  even to use my authority
i ought to speak plainly to her   and everything that he would say tonight to his wife took clear shape in alexey alexandrovitch s head
thinking over what he would say  he somewhat regretted that he should have to use his time and mental powers for domestic consumption  with so little to show for it  but  in spite of that  the form and contents of the speech before him shaped itself as clearly and distinctly in his head as a ministerial report
 i must say and express fully the following points  first  exposition of the value to be attached to public opinion and to decorum  secondly  exposition of religious significance of marriage  thirdly  if need be  reference to anna karenina 316 of 1759 the calamity possibly ensuing to our son  fourthly  reference to the unhappiness likely to result to herself   and  interlacing his fingers  alexey alexandrovitch stretched them  and the joints of the fingers cracked this trick  a bad habit  the cracking of his fingers  always soothed him  and gave precision to his thoughts  so needful to him at this juncture
there was the sound of a carriage driving up to the front door
alexey alexandrovitch halted in the middle of the room
a woman s step was heard mounting the stairs
alexey alexandrovitch  ready for his speech  stood compressing his crossed fingers  waiting to see if the crack would not come again
one joint cracked
already  from the sound of light steps on the stairs  he was aware that she was close  and though he was satisfied with his speech  he felt frightened of the explanation confronting him  
anna karenina 317 of 1759 anna came in with hanging head  playing with the tassels of her hood
her face was brilliant and glowing  but this glow was not one of brightness  it suggested the fearful glow of a conflagration in the midst of a dark night
on seeing her husband  anna raised her head and smiled  as though she had just waked up
 you re not in bed  what a wonder   she said  letting fall her hood  and without stopping  she went on into the dressing room
 it s late  alexey alexandrovitch   she said  when she had gone through the doorway
 anna  it s necessary for me to have a talk with you    with me   she said  wonderingly
she came out from behind the door of the dressing room  and looked at him
 why  what is it  what about   she asked  sitting down
 well  let s talk  if it s so necessary
but it would be better to get to sleep   anna said what came to her lips  and marveled  hearing herself  at her own capacity for lying
how simple and natural were her words  and how likely that she was simply sleepy  she felt herself clad in an impenetrable anna karenina 318 of 1759 armor of falsehood
she felt that some unseen force had come to her aid and was supporting her
 anna  i must warn you   he began
 warn me   she said
 of what   she looked at him so simply  so brightly  that anyone who did not know her as her husband knew her could not have noticed anything unnatural  either in the sound or the sense of her words
but to him  knowing her  knowing that whenever he went to bed five minutes later than usual  she noticed it  and asked him the reason  to him  knowing that every joy  every pleasure and pain that she felt she communicated to him at once  to him  now to see that she did not care to notice his state of mind  that she did not care to say a word about herself  meant a great deal
he saw that the inmost recesses of her soul  that had always hitherto lain open before him  were closed against him
more than that  he saw from her tone that she was not even perturbed at that  but as it were said straight out to him   yes  it s shut up  and so it must be  and will be in future   now he experienced a feeling such as a man might have  returning home and finding his own house locked up
 but perhaps the key may yet be found   thought alexey alexandrovitch
anna karenina 319 of 1759  i want to warn you   he said in a low voice   that through thoughtlessness and lack of caution you may cause yourself to be talked about in society
your too animated conversation this evening with count vronsky   he enunciated the name firmly and with deliberate emphasis   attracted attention   he talked and looked at her laughing eyes  which frightened him now with their impenetrable look  and  as he talked  he felt all the uselessness and idleness of his words
 you re always like that   she answered as though completely misapprehending him  and of all he had said only taking in the last phrase
 one time you don t like my being dull  and another time you don t like my being lively
i wasn t dull
does that offend you   alexey alexandrovitch shivered  and bent his hands to make the joints crack
 oh  please  don t do that  i do so dislike it   she said
 anna  is this you   said alexey alexandrovitch  quietly making an effort over himself  and restraining the motion of his fingers  but what is it all about   she said  with such genuine and droll wonder
 what do you want of me   anna karenina 320 of 1759 alexey alexandrovitch paused  and rubbed his forehead and his eyes
he saw that instead of doing as he had intended that is to say  warning his wife against a mistake in the eyes of the world he had unconsciously become agitated over what was the affair of her conscience  and was struggling against the barrier he fancied between them
 this is what i meant to say to you   he went on coldly and composedly   and i beg you to listen to it
i consider jealousy  as you know  a humiliating and degrading feeling  and i shall never allow myself to be influenced by it  but there are certain rules of decorum which cannot be disregarded with impunity
this evening it was not i observed it  but judging by the impression made on the company  everyone observed that your conduct and deportment were not altogether what could be desired    i positively don t understand   said anna  shrugging her shoulders  he doesn t care   she thought
 but other people noticed it  and that s what upsets him    you re not well  alexey alexandrovitch   she added  and she got up  and would have gone towards the door  but he moved forward as though he would stop her
his face was ugly and forbidding  as anna had never seen him
she stopped  and bending her head back and on anna karenina 321 of 1759 one side  began with her rapid hand taking out her hairpins
 well  i m listening to what s to come   she said  calmly and ironically   and indeed i listened with interest  for i should like to understand what s the matter   she spoke  and marveled at the confident  calm  and natural tone in which she was speaking  and the choice of the words she used
 to enter into all the details of your feelings i have no right  and besides  i regard that as useless and even harmful   began alexey alexandrovitch
 ferreting in one s soul  one often ferrets out something that might have lain there unnoticed
your feelings are an affair of your own conscience  but i am in duty bound to you  to myself  and to god  to point out to you your duties
our life has been joined  not by man  but by god
that union can only be severed by a crime  and a crime of that nature brings its own chastisement    i don t understand a word
and  oh dear  how sleepy i am  unluckily   she said  rapidly passing her hand through her hair  feeling for the remaining hairpins
 anna  for god s sake don t speak like that   he said gently
 perhaps i am mistaken  but believe me  what i say  anna karenina 322 of 1759 i say as much for myself as for you
i am your husband  and i love you   for an instant her face fell  and the mocking gleam in her eyes died away  but the word love threw her into revolt again
she thought   love  can he love  if he hadn t heard there was such a thing as love  he would never have used the word
he doesn t even know what love is    alexey alexandrovitch  really i don t understand   she said
define what it is you find     pardon  let me say all i have to say
i love you
but i am not speaking of myself  the most important persons in this matter are our son and yourself
it may very well be  i repeat  that my words seem to you utterly unnecessary and out of place  it may be that they are called forth by my mistaken impression
in that case  i beg you to forgive me
but if you are conscious yourself of even the smallest foundation for them  then i beg you to think a little  and if your heart prompts you  to speak out to me    alexey alexandrovitch was unconsciously saying something utterly unlike what he had prepared
 i have nothing to say
and besides   she said hurriedly  with difficulty repressing a smile   it s really time to be in bed   anna karenina 323 of 1759 alexey alexandrovitch sighed  and  without saying more  went into the bedroom
when she came into the bedroom  he was already in bed
his lips were sternly compressed  and his eyes looked away from her
anna got into her bed  and lay expecting every minute that he would begin to speak to her again
she both feared his speaking and wished for it
but he was silent
she waited for a long while without moving  and had forgotten about him
she thought of that other  she pictured him  and felt how her heart was flooded with emotion and guilty delight at the thought of him
suddenly she heard an even  tranquil snore
for the first instant alexey alexandrovitch seemed  as it were  appalled at his own snoring  and ceased  but after an interval of two breathings the snore sounded again  with a new tranquil rhythm
 it s late  it s late   she whispered with a smile
a long while she lay  not moving  with open eyes  whose brilliance she almost fancied she could herself see in the darkness
anna karenina 324 of 1759 from that time a new life began for alexey alexandrovitch and for his wife
nothing special happened
anna went out into society  as she had always done  was particularly often at princess betsy s  and met vronsky everywhere
alexey alexandrovitch saw this  but could do nothing
all his efforts to draw her into open discussion she confronted with a barrier which he could not penetrate  made up of a sort of amused perplexity
outwardly everything was the same  but their inner relations were completely changed
alexey alexandrovitch  a man of great power in the world of politics  felt himself helpless in this like an ox with head bent  submissively he awaited the blow which he felt was lifted over him
every time he began to think about it  he felt that he must try once more  that by kindness  tenderness  and persuasion there was still hope of saving her  of bringing her back to herself  and every day he made ready to talk to her
but every time he began talking to her  he felt that the spirit of evil and deceit  which had taken possession of her  had possession of him too  and he talked to her in a tone quite unlike that in which he had anna karenina 325 of 1759 meant to talk
involuntarily he talked to her in his habitual tone of jeering at anyone who should say what he was saying
and in that tone it was impossible to say what needed to be said to her
anna karenina 326 of 1759 that which for vronsky had been almost a whole year the one absorbing desire of his life  replacing all his old desires  that which for anna had been an impossible  terrible  and even for that reason more entrancing dream of bliss  that desire had been fulfilled
he stood before her  pale  his lower jaw quivering  and besought her to be calm  not knowing how or why
 anna  anna   he said with a choking voice   anna  for pity s sake     but the louder he spoke  the lower she dropped her once proud and gay  now shame stricken head  and she bowed down and sank from the sofa where she was sitting  down on the floor  at his feet  she would have fallen on the carpet if he had not held her
 my god  forgive me   she said  sobbing  pressing his hands to her bosom
she felt so sinful  so guilty  that nothing was left her but to humiliate herself and beg forgiveness  and as now there was no one in her life but him  to him she addressed her prayer for forgiveness
looking at him  she had a physical sense of her humiliation  and she could say nothing more
anna karenina 327 of 1759 he felt what a murderer must feel  when he sees the body he has robbed of life
that body  robbed by him of life  was their love  the first stage of their love
there was something awful and revolting in the memory of what had been bought at this fearful price of shame
shame at their spiritual nakedness crushed her and infected him
but in spite of all the murderer s horror before the body of his victim  he must hack it to pieces  hide the body  must use what he has gained by his murder
and with fury  as it were with passion  the murderer falls on the body  and drags it and hacks at it  so he covered her face and shoulders with kisses
she held his hand  and did not stir
 yes  these kisses that is what has been bought by this shame
yes  and one hand  which will always be mine the hand of my accomplice   she lifted up that hand and kissed it
he sank on his knees and tried to see her face  but she hid it  and said nothing
at last  as though making an effort over herself  she got up and pushed him away
her face was still as beautiful  but it was only the more pitiful for that
 all is over   she said   in have nothing but you
remember that    i can never forget what is my whole life
for one instant of this happiness    anna karenina 328 of 1759  happiness   she said with horror and loathing and her horror unconsciously infected him
 for pity s sake  not a word  not a word more   she rose quickly and moved away from him
 not a word more   she repeated  and with a look of chill despair  incomprehensible to him  she parted from him
she felt that at that moment she could not put into words the sense of shame  of rapture  and of horror at this stepping into a new life  and she did not want to speak of it  to vulgarize this feeling by inappropriate words
but later too  and the next day and the third day  she still found no words in which she could express the complexity of her feelings  indeed  she could not even find thoughts in which she could clearly think out all that was in her soul
she said to herself   no  just now i can t think of it  later on  when i am calmer   but this calm for thought never came  every time the thought rose of what she had done and what would happen to her  and what she ought to do  a horror came over her and she drove those thoughts away
 later  later   she said  when i am calmer   but in dreams  when she had no control over her thoughts  her position presented itself to her in all its anna karenina 329 of 1759 hideous nakedness once dream haunted her almost every night
she dreamed that both were her husbands at once  that both were lavishing caresses on her
alexey alexandrovitch was weeping  kissing her hands  and saying   how happy we are now   and alexey vronsky was there too  and he too was her husband
and she was marveling that it had once seemed impossible to her  was explaining to them  laughing  that this was ever so much simpler  and that now both of them were happy and contented
but this dream weighed on her like a nightmare  and she awoke from it in terror
anna karenina 330 of 1759 in the early days after his return from moscow  whenever levin shuddered and grew red  remembering the disgrace of his rejection  he said to himself   this was just how i used to shudder and blush  thinking myself utterly lost  when i was plucked in physics and did not get my remove  and how i thought myself utterly ruined after i had mismanaged that affair of my sister s that was entrusted to me and yet  now that years have passed  i recall it and wonder that it could distress me so much
it will be the same thing too with this trouble
time will go by and i shall not mind about this either   but three months had passed and he had not left off minding about it  and it was as painful for him to think of it as it had been those first days
he could not be at peace because after dreaming so long of family life  and feeling himself so ripe for it  he was still not married  and was further than ever from marriage he was painfully conscious himself  as were all about him  that at his years it is not well for man to be alone he remembered how before starting for moscow he had once said to his cowman nikolay  a simple hearted peasant  whom he anna karenina 331 of 1759 liked talking to   well  nikolay  i mean to get married   and how nikolay had promptly answered  as of a matter on which there could be no possible doubt   and high time too  konstantin demitrievitch   but marriage had now become further off than ever
the place was taken  and whenever he tried to imagine any of the girls he knew in that place  he felt that it was utterly impossible
moreover  the recollection of the rejection and the part he had played in the affair tortured him with shame
however often he told himself that he was in no wise to blame in it  that recollection  like other humiliating reminiscences of a similar kind  made him twinge and blush there had been in his past  as in every man s  actions  recognized by him as bad  for which his conscience ought to have tormented him  but the memory of these evil actions was far from causing him so much suffering as those trivial but humiliating reminiscences
these wounds never healed
and with these memories was now ranged his rejection and the pitiful position in which he must have appeared to others that evening
but time and work did their part
bitter memories were more and more covered up by the incidents paltry in his eyes  but really important of his country life
every week he thought less often of kitty
he was impatiently looking anna karenina 332 of 1759 forward to the news that she was married  or just going to be married  hoping that such news would  like having a tooth out  completely cure him
meanwhile spring came on  beautiful and kindly  without the delays and treacheries of spring  one of those rare springs in which plants  beasts  and man rejoice alike
this lovely spring roused levin still more  and strengthened him in his resolution of renouncing all his past and building up his lonely life firmly and independently
though many of the plans with which he had returned to the country had not been carried out  still his most important resolution that of purity had been kept by him
he was free from that shame  which had usually harassed him after a fall  and he could look everyone straight in the face
in february he had received a letter from marya nikolaevna telling him that his brother nikolay s health was getting worse  but that he would not take advice  and in consequence of this letter levin went to moscow to his brother s and succeeded in persuading him to see a doctor and to go to a wateringplace abroad
he succeeded so well in persuading his brother  and in lending him money for the journey without irritating him  that he was satisfied with himself in that matter in addition to his farming  which called for anna karenina 333 of 1759 special attention in spring  and in addition to reading  levin had begun that winter a work on agriculture  the plan of which turned on taking into account the character of the laborer on the land as one of the unalterable data of the question  like the climate and the soil  and consequently deducing all the principles of scientific culture  not simply from the data of soil and climate  but from the data of soil  climate  and a certain unalterable character of the laborer
thus  in spite of his solitude  or in consequence of his solitude  his life was exceedingly full
only rarely he suffered from an unsatisfied desire to communicate his stray ideas to someone besides agafea mihalovna
with her indeed he not infrequently fell into discussion upon physics  the theory of agriculture  and especially philosophy  philosophy was agafea mihalovna s favorite subject
spring was slow in unfolding
for the last few weeks it had been steadily fine frosty weather
in the daytime it thawed in the sun  but at night there were even seven degrees of frost
there was such a frozen surface on the snow that they drove the wagons anywhere off the roads
easter came in the snow
then all of a sudden  on easter monday  a warm wind sprang up  storm clouds swooped down  and for three days and three nights the warm  anna karenina 334 of 1759 driving rain fell in streams on thursday the wind dropped  and a thick gray fog brooded over the land as though hiding the mysteries of the transformations that were being wrought in nature
behind the fog there was the flowing of water  the cracking and floating of ice  the swift rush of turbid  foaming torrents  and on the following monday  in the evening  the fog parted  the storm clouds split up into little curling crests of cloud  the sky cleared  and the real spring had come
in the morning the sun rose brilliant and quickly wore away the thin layer of ice that covered the water  and all the warm air was quivering with the steam that rose up from the quickened earth
the old grass looked greener  and the young grass thrust up its tiny blades  the buds of the guelder rose and of the currant and the sticky birch buds were swollen with sap  and an exploring bee was humming about the golden blossoms that studded the willow larks trilled unseen above the velvety green fields and the ice covered stubbleland  peewits wailed over the low lands and marshes flooded by the pools  cranes and wild geese flew high across the sky uttering their spring calls
the cattle  bald in patches where the new hair had not grown yet  lowed in the pastures  the bowlegged lambs frisked round their bleating mothers
nimble children ran about the drying anna karenina 335 of 1759 paths  covered with the prints of bare feet
there was a merry chatter of peasant women over their linen at the pond  and the ring of axes in the yard  where the peasants were repairing ploughs and harrows
the real spring had come
anna karenina 336 of 1759 levin put on his big boots  and  for the first time  a cloth jacket  instead of his fur cloak  and went out to look after his farm  stepping over streams of water that flashed in the sunshine and dazzled his eyes  and treading one minute on ice and the next into sticky mud spring is the time of plans and projects
and  as he came out into the farmyard  levin  like a tree in spring that knows not what form will be taken by the young shoots and twigs imprisoned in its swelling buds  hardly knew what undertakings he was going to begin upon now in the farm work that was so dear to him
but he felt that he was full of the most splendid plans and projects
first of all he went to the cattle
the cows had been let out into their paddock  and their smooth sides were already shining with their new  sleek  spring coats  they basked in the sunshine and lowed to go to the meadow
levin gazed admiringly at the cows he knew so intimately to the minutest detail of their condition  and gave orders for them to be driven out into the meadow  and the calves to be let into the paddock
the herdsman ran gaily to get ready for the meadow
the cowherd girls  picking up anna karenina 337 of 1759 their petticoats  ran splashing through the mud with bare legs  still white  not yet brown from the sun  waving brush wood in their hands  chasing the calves that frolicked in the mirth of spring
after admiring the young ones of that year  who were particularly fine the early calves were the size of a peasant s cow  and pava s daughter  at three months old  was a big as a yearling  levin gave orders for a trough to be brought out and for them to be fed in the paddock
but it appeared that as the paddock had not been used during the winter  the hurdles made in the autumn for it were broken
he sent for the carpenter  who  according to his orders  ought to have been at work at the thrashing machine
but it appeared that the carpenter was repairing the harrows  which ought to have been repaired before lent
this was very annoying to levin
it was annoying to come upon that everlasting slovenliness in the farm work against which he had been striving with all his might for so many years
the hurdles  as he ascertained  being not wanted in winter  had been carried to the cart horses  stable  and there broken  as they were of light construction  only meant for folding calves
moreover  it was apparent also that the harrows and all the agricultural implements  which he had directed to be looked over and anna karenina 338 of 1759 repaired in the winter  for which very purpose he had hired three carpenters  had not been put into repair  and the harrows were being repaired when they ought to have been harrowing the field
levin sent for his bailiff  but immediately went off himself to look for him the bailiff  beaming all over  like everyone that day  in a sheepskin bordered with astrachan  came out of the barn  twisting a bit of straw in his hands
 why isn t the carpenter at the thrashing machine    oh  i meant to tell you yesterday  the harrows want repairing
here it s time they got to work in the fields    but what were they doing in the winter  then    but what did you want the carpenter for    where are the hurdles for the calves  paddock    i ordered them to be got ready
what would you have with those peasants   said the bailiff  with a wave of his hand
 it s not those peasants but this bailiff   said levin  getting angry
 why  what do i keep you for   he cried
but  bethinking himself that this would not help matters  he stopped short in the middle of a sentence  and merely sighed  well  what do you say  can sowing begin   he asked  after a pause
anna karenina 339 of 1759  behind turkin tomorrow or the next day they might begin    and the clover    i ve sent vassily and mishka  they re sowing
only i don t know if they ll manage to get through  it s so slushy    how many acres    about fifteen    why not sow all   cried levin
that they were only sowing the clover on fifteen acres  not on all the forty five  was still more annoying to him
clover  as he knew  both from books and from his own experience  never did well except when it was sown as early as possible  almost in the snow
and yet levin could never get this done
 there s no one to send
what would you have with such a set of peasants  three haven t turned up
and there s semyon     well  you should have taken some men from the thatching    and so i have  as it is    where are the peasants  then   anna karenina 340 of 1759  five are making compote  which meant compost    four are shifting the oats for fear of a touch of mildew  konstantin dmitrievitch   levin knew very well that  a touch of mildew  meant that his english seed oats were already ruined
again they had not done as he had ordered
 why  but i told you during lent to put in pipes   he cried
 don t put yourself out  we shall get it all done in time   levin waved his hand angrily  went into the granary to glance at the oats  and then to the stable
the oats were not yet spoiled
but the peasants were carrying the oats in spaces when they might simply let the slide down into the lower granary  and arranging for this to be done  and taking two workmen from there for sowing clover  levin got over his vexation with the bailiff
indeed  it was such a lovely day that one could not be angry
 ignat   he called to the coachman  who  with his sleeves tucked up  was washing the carriage wheels   saddle me     which  sir    well  let it be kolpik    yes  sir   anna karenina 341 of 1759 while they were saddling his horse  levin again called up the bailiff  who was handing about in sight  to make it up with him  and began talking to him about the spring operations before them  and his plans for the farm
the wagons were to begin carting manure earlier  so as to get all done before the early mowing
and the ploughing of the further land to go on without a break so as to let it ripen lying fallow
and the mowing to be all done by hired labor  not on half profits
the bailiff listened attentively  and obviously made an effort to approve of his employer s projects
but still he had that look levin knew so well that always irritated him  a look of hopelessness and despondency
that look said   that s all very well  but as god wills   nothing mortified levin so much as that tone
but it was the tone common to all the bailiffs he had ever had
they had all taken up that attitude to his plans  and so now he was not angered by it  but mortified  and felt all the more roused to struggle against this  as it seemed  elemental force continually ranged against him  for which he could find no other expression than  as god wills    if we can manage it  konstantin dmitrievitch   said the bailiff
 why ever shouldn t you manage it   anna karenina 342 of 1759  we positively must have another fifteen laborers
and they don t turn up
there were some here today asking seventy roubles for the summer   levin was silent
again he was brought face to face with that opposing force
he knew that however much they tried  they could not hire more than forty thirtyseven perhaps or thirty eight  laborers for a reasonable sum
some forty had been taken on  and there were no more
but still he could not help struggling against it
 send to sury  to tchefirovka  if they don t come we must look for them    oh  i ll send  to be sure   said vassily fedorovitch despondently
 but there are the horses  too  they re not good for much    we ll get some more
i know  of course   levin added laughing   you always want to do with as little and as poor quality as possible  but this year i m not going to let you have things your own way
i ll see to everything myself    why  i don t think you take much rest as it is
it cheers us up to work under the master s eye     so they re sowing clover behind the birch dale  i ll go and have a look at them   he said  getting on to the little bay cob  kolpik  who was let up by the coachman
anna karenina 343 of 1759  you can t get across the streams  konstantin dmitrievitch   the coachman shouted  all right  i ll go by the forest   and levin rode through the slush of the farmyard to the gate and out into the open country  his good little horse  after his long inactivity  stepping out gallantly  snorting over the pools  and asking  as it were  for guidance
if levin had felt happy before in the cattle pens and farmyard  he felt happier yet in the open country
swaying rhythmically with the ambling paces of his good little cob  drinking in the warm yet fresh scent of the snow and the air  as he rode through his forest over the crumbling  wasted snow  still left in parts  and covered with dissolving tracks  he rejoiced over every tree  with the moss reviving on its bark and the buds swelling on its shoots
when he came out of the forest  in the immense plain before him  his grass fields stretched in an unbroken carpet of green  without one bare place or swamp  only spotted here and there in the hollows with patches of melting snow he was not put out of temper even by the sight of the peasants  horses and colts trampling down his young grass  he told a peasant he met to drive them out   nor by the sarcastic and stupid reply of the peasant ipat  whom he met on the way  and asked   well  ipat  shall we anna karenina 344 of 1759 soon be sowing    we must get the ploughing done first  konstantin dmitrievitch   answered ipat
the further he rode  the happier he became  and plans for the land rose to his mind each better than the last  to plant all his fields with hedges along the southern borders  so that the snow should not lie under them  to divide them up into six fields of arable and three of pasture and hay  to build a cattle yard at the further end of the estate  and to dig a pond and to construct movable pens for the cattle as a means of manuring the land
and then eight hundred acres of wheat  three hundred of potatoes  and four hundred of clover  and not one acre exhausted
absorbed in such dreams  carefully keeping his horse by the hedges  so as not to trample his young crops  he rode up to the laborers who had been sent to sow clover a cart with the seed in it was standing  not at the edge  but in the middle of the crop  and the winter corn had been torn up by the wheels and trampled by the horse
both the laborers were sitting in the hedge  probably smoking a pipe together
the earth in the cart  with which the seed was mixed  was not crushed to powder  but crusted together or adhering in clods
seeing the master  the laborer  vassily  went towards the cart  while mishka set to work sowing
this was not as it should be  but with the anna karenina 345 of 1759 laborers levin seldom lost his temper
when vassily came up  levin told him to lead the horse to the hedge
 it s all right  sir  it ll spring up again   responded vassily
 please don t argue   said levin   but do as you re told    yes  sir   answered vassily  and he took the horse s head
 what a sowing  konstantin dmitrievitch   he said  hesitating   first rate
only it s a work to get about  you drag a ton of earth on your shoes    why is it you have earth that s not sifted   said levin
 well  we crumble it up   answered vassily  taking up some seed and rolling the earth in his palms vassily was not to blame for their having filled up his cart with unsifted earth  but still it was annoying
levin had more than once already tried a way he knew for stifling his anger  and turning all that seemed dark right again  and he tried that way now
he watched how mishka strode along  swinging the huge clods of earth that clung to each foot  and getting off his horse  he took the sieve from vassily and started sowing himself  where did you stop   vassily pointed to the mark with his foot  and levin went forward as best he could  scattering the seed on the land
walking was a difficult as on a bog  and by the time anna karenina 346 of 1759 levin had ended the row he was in a great heat  and he stopped and gave up the sieve to vassily
 well  master  when summer s here  mind you don t scold me for these rows   said vassily
 eh   said levin cheerily  already feeling the effect of his method
 why  you ll see in the summer time
it ll look different
look you where i sowed last spring
how i did work at it  i do my best  konstantin dmitrievitch  d ye see  as i would for my own father
i don t like bad work myself  nor would i let another man do it
what s good for the master s good for us too
to look out yonder now   said vassily  pointing   it does one s heart good    it s a lovely spring  vassily    why  it s a spring such as the old men don t remember the like of
i was up home  an old man up there has sown wheat too  about an acre of it
he was saying you wouldn t know it from rye    have yo been sowing wheat long    why  sir  it was you taught us the year before last
you gave me two measures
we sold about eight bushels and sowed a rood    well  mind you crumble up the clods   said levin  going towards his horse   and keep an eye on mishka
and anna karenina 347 of 1759 if there s a good crop you shall have half a rouble for every acre    humbly thankful
we are very well content  sir  as it is   levin got on his horse and rode towards the field where was last year s clover  and the one which was ploughed ready for the spring corn
the crop of clover coming up in the stubble was magnificent
it had survived everything  and stood up vividly green through the broken stalks of last year s wheat
the horse sank in up to the pasterns  and he drew each hoof with a sucking sound out of the half thawed ground
over the ploughland riding was utterly impossible  the horse could only keep a foothold where there was ice  and in the thawing furrows he sank deep in at each step
the ploughland was in splendid condition  in a couple of days it would be fit for harrowing and sowing
everything was capital  everything was cheering
levin rode back across the streams  hoping the water would have gone down and he did in fact get across  and startled two ducks
 there must be snipe too   he thought  and just as he reached the turning homewards he met the forest keeper  who confirmed his theory about the snipe
anna karenina 348 of 1759 levin went home at a trot  so as to have time to eat his dinner and get his gun ready for the evening
anna karenina 349 of 1759 as he rode up to the house in the happiest frame of mind  levin heard the bell ring at the side of the principal entrance of the house
 yes  that s someone from the railway station   he thought   just the time to be here from the moscow train   who could it be  what if it s brother nikolay  he did say   maybe i ll go to the waters  or maybe i ll come down to you    he felt dismayed and vexed for the first minute  that his brother nikolay s presence should come to disturb his happy mood of spring
but he felt ashamed of the feeling  and at once he opened  as it were  the arms of his soul  and with a softened feeling of joy and expectation  now he hoped with all his heart that it was his brother he pricked up his horse  and riding out from behind the acacias he saw a hired three horse sledge from the railway station  and a gentleman in a fur coat
it was not his brother
 oh  if it were only some nice person one could talk to a little   he thought
 ah   cried levin joyfully  flinging up both his hands
 here s a delightful visitor  ah  how glad i am to see you   he shouted  recognizing stepan arkadyevitch
anna karenina 350 of 1759  in shall find out for certain whether she s married  or when she s going to be married   he thought
and on that delicious spring day he felt that the thought of her did not hurt him at all
 well  you didn t expect me  eh   said stepan arkadyevitch  getting out of the sledge  splashed with mud on the bridge of his nose  on his cheek  and on his eyebrows  but radiant with health and good spirits
 i ve come to see you in the first place   he said  embracing and kissing him   to have some stand shooting second  and to sell the forest at ergushovo third    delightful  what a spring we re having  how ever did you get along in a sledge    in a cart it would have been worse still  konstantin dmitrievitch   answered the driver  who knew him
 well  i m very  very glad to see you   said levin  with a genuine smile of childlike delight
levin let his friend to the room set apart for visitors  where stepan arkadyevitch s things were carried also a bag  a gun in a case  a satchel for cigars
leaving him there to wash and change his clothes  levin went off to the counting house to speak about the ploughing and clover
agafea mihalovna  always very anxious for the credit of the house  met him in the hall with inquiries about dinner
anna karenina 351 of 1759  do just as you like  only let it be as soon as possible   he said  and went to the bailiff
when he came back  stepan arkadyevitch  washed and combed  came out of his room with a beaming smile  and they went upstairs together
 well  i am glad i managed to get away to you  now i shall understand what the mysterious business is that you are always absorbed in here
no  really  i envy you
what a house  how nice it all is  so bright  so cheerful   said stepan arkadyevitch  forgetting that it was not always spring and fine weather like that day
 and your nurse is simply charming  a pretty maid in an apron might be even more agreeable  perhaps  but for your severe monastic style it does very well   stepan arkadyevitch told him many interesting pieces of news  especially interesting to levin was the news that his brother  sergey ivanovitch  was intending to pay him a visit in the summer
not one word did stepan arkadyevitch say in reference to kitty and the shtcherbatskys  he merely gave him greetings from his wife
levin was grateful to him for his delicacy and was very glad of his visitor
as always happened with him during his solitude  a mass of ideas and feelings had been accumulating within him  which he anna karenina 352 of 1759 could not communicate to those about him
and now he poured out upon stepan arkadyevitch his poetic joy in the spring  and his failures and plans for the land  and his thoughts and criticisms on the books he had been reading  and the idea of his own book  the basis of which really was  though he was unaware of it himself  a criticism of all the old books on agriculture stepan arkadyevitch  always charming  understanding everything at the slightest reference  was particularly charming on this visit  and levin noticed in him a special tenderness  as it were  and a new tone of respect that flattered him
the efforts of agafea mihalovna and the cook  that the dinner should be particularly good  only ended in two famished friends attacking the preliminary course  eating a great deal of bread and butter  salt goose and salted mushrooms  and in levin s finally ordering the soup to be served without the accompaniment of little pies  with which the cook had particularly meant to impress their visitor but though stepan arkadyevitch was accustomed to very different dinners  he thought everything excellent  the herb brandy  and the bread  and the butter  and above all the salt goose and the mushrooms  and the nettle soup  and the chicken in white sauce  and the white crimean wine  everything was superb and delicious anna karenina 353 of 1759  splendid  splendid   he said  lighting a fat cigar after the roast
 i feel as if  coming to you  i had landed on a peaceful shore after the noise and jolting of a steamer
and so you maintain that the laborer himself is an element to be studied and to regulate the choice of methods in agriculture of course  i m an ignorant outsider  but i should fancy theory and its application will have its influence on the laborer too    yes  but wait a bit
i m not talking of political economy  i m talking of the science of agriculture
it ought to be like the natural sciences  and to observe given phenomena and the laborer in his economic  ethnographical    at that instant agafea mihalovna came in with jam
 oh  agafea mihalovna   said stepan arkadyevitch  kissing the tips of his plump fingers   what salt goose  what herb brandy    what do yo think  isn t it time to start  kostya   he added
levin looked out of the window at the sun sinking behind the bare tree tops of the forest
 yes  it s time   he said
 kouzma  get ready the trap   and he ran downstairs
stepan arkadyevitch  going down  carefully took the canvas cover off his varnished gun case with his own anna karenina 354 of 1759 hands  and opening it  began to get ready his expensive new fashioned gun
kouzma  who already scented a big tip  never left stepan arkadyevitch s side  and put on him both his stockings and boots  a task which stepan arkadyevitch readily left him
 kostya  give orders that if the merchant ryabinin comes   i told him to come today  he s to be brought in and to wait for me     why  do you mean to say you re selling the forest to ryabinin    yes
do you know him    to be sure i do
i have had to do business with him   positively and conclusively    stepan arkadyevitch laughed
 positively and conclusively  were the merchant s favorite words
 yes  it s wonderfully funny the way he talks
she knows where her master s going   he added  patting laska  who hung about levin  whining and licking his hands  his boots  and his gun
the trap was already at the steps when they went out
 i told them to bring the trap round  or would you rather walk    no  we d better drive   said stepan arkadyevitch  getting into the trap
he sat down  tucked the tiger skin anna karenina 355 of 1759 rug round him  and lighted a cigar
 how is it you don t smoke  a cigar is a sort of thing  not exactly a pleasure  but the crown and outward sign of pleasure
come  this is life  how splendid it is  this is how in should like to live    why  who prevents you   said levin  smiling
 no  you re a lucky man  you ve got everything you like
you like horses and you have them  dogs you have them  shooting  you have it  farming you have it    perhaps because i rejoice in what i have  and don t fret for what i haven t   said levin  thinking of kitty
stepan arkadyevitch comprehended  looked at him  but said nothing
levin was grateful to oblonsky for noticing  with his never failing tact  that he dreaded conversation about the shtcherbatskys  and so saying nothing about them
but now levin was longing to find out what was tormenting him so  yet he had not the courage to begin
 come  tell me how things are going with you   said levin  bethinking himself that it was not nice of him to think only of himself stepan arkadyevitch s eyes sparkled merrily
 you don t admit  i know  that one can be fond of new rolls when one has had one s rations of bread to your mind it s a crime  but i don t count life as life without anna karenina 356 of 1759 love   he said  taking levin s question his own way
 what am i to do  i m made that way
and really  one does so little harm to anyone  and gives oneself so much pleasure     what  is there something new  then   queried levin
 yes  my boy  there is  there  do you see  you know the type of ossian s women   
women  such as one sees in dreams    well  these women are sometimes to be met in reality   and these women are terrible
woman  don t you know  is such a subject that however much you study it  it s always perfectly new    well  then  it would be better not to study it    no
some mathematician has said that enjoyment lies in the search for truth  not in the finding it   levin listened in silence  and in spite of all the efforts he made  he could not in the least enter into the feelings of his friend and understand his sentiments and the charm of studying such women
anna karenina 357 of 1759 the place fixed on for the stand shooting was not far above a stream in a little aspen copse
on reaching the copse  levin got out of the trap and led oblonsky to a corner of a mossy  swampy glade  already quite free from snow
he went back himself to a double birch tree on the other side  and leaning his gun on the fork of a dead lower branch  he took off his full overcoat  fastened his belt again  and worked his arms to see if they were free gray old laska  who had followed them  sat down warily opposite him and pricked up her ears
the sun was setting behind a thick forest  and in the glow of sunset the birch trees  dotted about in the aspen copse  stood out clearly with their hanging twigs  and their buds swollen almost to bursting
from the thickest parts of the copse  where the snow still remained  came the faint sound of narrow winding threads of water running away
tiny birds twittered  and now and then fluttered from tree to tree
in the pauses of complete stillness there came the rustle of last year s leaves  stirred by the thawing of the earth and the growth of the grass
anna karenina 358 of 1759  imagine  one can hear and see the grass growing   levin said to himself  noticing a wet  slate colored aspen leaf moving beside a blade of young grass he stood  listened  and gazed sometimes down at the wet mossy ground  sometimes at laska listening all alert  sometimes at the sea of bare tree tops that stretched on the slope below him  sometimes at the darkening sky  covered with white streaks of cloud a hawk flew high over a forest far away with slow sweep of its wings  another flew with exactly the same motion in the same direction and vanished
the birds twittered more and more loudly and busily in the thicket
an owl hooted not far off  and laska  starting  stepped cautiously a few steps forward  and putting her head on one side  began to listen intently
beyond the stream was heard the cuckoo
twice she uttered her usual cuckoo call  and then gave a hoarse  hurried call and broke down
 imagine  the cuckoo already   said stepan arkadyevitch  coming out from behind a bush
 yes  in hear it   answered levin  reluctantly breaking the stillness with his voice  which sounded disagreeable to himself  now it s coming   stepan arkadyevitch s figure again went behind the bush  and levin saw nothing but the bright flash of a anna karenina 359 of 1759 match  followed by the red glow and blue smoke of a cigarette
 tchk  tchk   came the snapping sound of stepan arkadyevitch cocking his gun
 what s that cry   asked oblonsky  drawing levin s attention to a prolonged cry  as though a colt were whinnying in a high voice  in play
 oh  don t you know it  that s the hare
but enough talking  listen  it s flying   almost shrieked levin  cocking his gun
they heard a shrill whistle in the distance  and in the exact time  so well known to the sportsman  two seconds later  another  a third  and after the third whistle the hoarse  guttural cry could be heard
levin looked about him to right and to left  and there  just facing him against the dusky blue sky above the confused mass of tender shoots of the aspens  he saw the flying bird
it was flying straight towards him  the guttural cry  like the even tearing of some strong stuff  sounded close to his ear  the long beak and neck of the bird could be seen  and at the very instant when levin was taking aim  behind the bush where oblonsky stood  there was a flash of red lightning  the bird dropped like an arrow  and darted upwards again
again came the red flash and the anna karenina 360 of 1759 sound of a blow  and fluttering its wings as though trying to keep up in the air  the bird halted  stopped still and instant  and fell with a heavy splash on the slushy ground
 can i have missed it   shouted stepan arkadyevitch  who could not see for the smoke
 here it is   said levin  pointing to laska  who with one ear raised  wagging the end of her shaggy tail  came slowly back as though she would prolong the pleasure  and as it were smiling  brought the dead bird to her master
 well  i m glad you were successful   said levin  who  at the same time  had a sense of envy that he had not succeeded in shooting the snipe
 it was a bad shot from the right barrel   responded stepan arkadyevitch  loading his gun
 sh   it s flying   the shrill whistles rapidly following one another were heard again
two snipe  playing and chasing one another  and only whistling  not crying  flew straight at the very heads of the sportsmen
there was the report of four shots  and like swallows the snipe turned swift somersaults in the air and vanished from sight
the stand shooting was capital
stepan arkadyevitch shot two more birds and levin two  of which one was not found
it began to get dark
venus  bright and silvery  shone with her soft light low down in the west behind the anna karenina 361 of 1759 birch trees  and high up in the east twinkled the red lights of arcturus
over his head levin made out the stars of the great bear and lost them again
the snipe had ceased flying  but levin resolved to stay a little longer  till venus  which he saw below a branch if birch  should be above it  and the stars of the great bear should be perfectly plain
venus had risen above the branch  and the ear of the great bear with its shaft was now all plainly visible against the dark blue sky  yet still he waited
 isn t it time to go home   said stepan arkadyevitch
it was quite still now in the copse  and not a bird was stirring
 let s stay a little while   answered levin
 as you like   they were standing now about fifteen paces from one another
 stiva   said levin unexpectedly   how is it you don t tell me whether your sister in law s married yet  or when she s going to be   levin felt so resolute and serene that no answer  he fancied  could affect him
but he had never dreamed of what stepan arkadyevitch replied
anna karenina 362 of 1759  she s never thought of being married  and isn t thinking of it  but she s very ill  and the doctors have sent her abroad
they re positively afraid she may not live    what   cried levin
 very ill  what is wrong with her  how has she      while they were saying this  laska  with ears pricked up  was looking upwards at the sky  and reproachfully at them
 they have chosen a time to talk   she was thinking
 it s on the wing   
here it is  yes  it is
they ll miss it   thought laska
but at that very instant both suddenly heard a shrill whistle which  as it were  smote on their ears  and both suddenly seized their guns and two flashes gleamed  and two gangs sounded at the very same instant
the snipe flying high above instantly folded its wings and fell into a thicket  bending down the delicate shoots
 splendid  together   cried levin  and he ran with laska into the thicket to look for the snipe
 oh  yes  what was it that was unpleasant   he wondered
 yes  kitty s ill   
well  it can t be helped  i m very sorry   he thought
anna karenina 363 of 1759  she s found it  isn t she a clever thing   he said  taking the warm bird from laska s mouth and packing it into the almost full game bag
 i ve got it  stiva   he shouted
anna karenina 364 of 1759 on the way home levin asked all details of kitty s illness and the shtcherbatskys  plans  and though he would have been ashamed to admit it  he was pleased at what he heard
he was pleased that there was still hope  and still more pleased that she should be suffering who had made him suffer so much
but when stepan arkadyevitch began to speak of the causes of kitty s illness  and mentioned vronsky s name  levin cut him short
 i have no right whatever to know family matters  and  to tell the truth  no interest in them either   stepan arkadyevitch smiled hardly perceptibly  catching the instantaneous change he knew so well in levin s face  which had become as gloomy as it had been bright a minute before
 have you quite settled about the forest with ryabinin   asked levin
 yes  it s settled
the price is magnificent  thirty eight thousand
eight straight away  and the rest in six years
i ve been bothering about it for ever so long
no one would give more   anna karenina 365 of 1759  then you ve as good as given away your forest for nothing   said levin gloomily
 how do you mean for nothing   said stepan arkadyevitch with a good humored smile  knowing that nothing would be right in levin s eyes now
 because the forest is worth at least a hundred and fifty roubles the acre   answered levin
 oh  these farmers   said stepan arkadyevitch playfully
 your tone of contempt for us poor townsfolk   
but when it comes to business  we do it better than anyone
i assure you i have reckoned it all out   he said   and the forest is fetching a very good price so much so that i m afraid of this fellow s crying off  in fact you know it s not  timber    said stepan arkadyevitch  hoping by this distinction to convince levin completely of the unfairness of his doubts
 and it won t run to more than twenty five yards of fagots per acre  and he s giving me at the rate of seventy roubles the acre   levin smiled contemptuously
 i know   he thought   that fashion not only in him  but in all city people  who  after being twice in ten years in the country  pick up two or three phrases and use them in season and out of season  firmly persuaded that they know all about it
 timber  run anna karenina 366 of 1759 to so many yards the acre   he says those words without understanding them himself    i wouldn t attempt to teach you what you write about in your office   said he   and if need arose  i should come to you to ask about it but you re so positive you know all the lore of the forest
it s difficult
have you counted the trees    how count the trees   said stepan arkadyevitch  laughing  still trying to draw his friend out of his illtemper
 count the sands of the sea  number the stars
some higher power might do it    oh  well  the higher power of ryabinin can
not a single merchant ever buys a forest without counting the trees  unless they get it given them for nothing  as you re doing now
i know your forest
i go there every year shooting  and your forest s worth a hundred and fifty roubles and acre paid down  while he s giving you sixty by installments
so that in fact you re making him a present of thirty thousand    come  don t let your imagination run away with you   said stepan arkadyevitch piteously
 why was it none would give it  then    why  because he has an understanding with the merchants  he s bought them off
i ve had to do with all of anna karenina 367 of 1759 them  i know them
they re not merchants  you know  they re speculators
he wouldn t look at a bargain that gave him ten  fifteen per cent profit  but holds back to buy a rouble s worth for twenty kopecks    well  enough of it  you re out of temper    not the least   said levin gloomily  as they drove up to the house
at the steps there stood a trap tightly covered with iron and leather  with a sleek horse tightly harnessed with broad collar straps
in the trap sat the chubby  tightly belted clerk who served ryabinin as coachman
ryabinin himself was already in the house  and met the friends in the hall ryabinin was a tall  thinnish  middle aged man  with mustache and a projecting clean shaven chin  and prominent muddy looking eyes
he was dressed in a longskirted blue coat  with buttons below the waist at the back  and wore high boots wrinkled over the ankles and straight over the calf  with big galoshes drawn over them
he rubbed his face with his handkerchief  and wrapping round him his coat  which sat extremely well as it was  he greeted them with a smile  holding out his hand to stepan arkadyevitch  as though he wanted to catch something
 so here you are   said stepan arkadyevitch  giving him his hand
 that s capital   anna karenina 368 of 1759  i did not venture to disregard your excellency s commands  though the road was extremely bad
i positively walked the whole way  but i am here at my time
konstantin dmitrievitch  my respects   he turned to levin  trying to seize his hand too
but levin  scowling  made as though he did not notice his hand  and took out the snipe
 your honors have been diverting yourselves with the chase  what kind of bird may it be  pray   added ryabinin  looking contemptuously at the snipe   a great delicacy  i suppose   and he shook his head disapprovingly  as though he had grave doubts whether this game were worth the candle
 would you like to go into my study   levin said in french to stepan arkadyevitch  scowling morosely
 go into my study  you can talk there    quite so  where you please   said ryabinin with contemptuous dignity  as though wishing to make it felt that others might be in difficulties as to how to behave  but that he could never be in any difficulty about anything
on entering the study ryabinin looked about  as his habit was  as though seeking the holy picture  but when he had found it  he did not cross himself he scanned the bookcases and bookshelves  and with the same dubious air anna karenina 369 of 1759 with which he had regarded the snipe  he smiled contemptuously and hook his head disapprovingly  as though by no means willing to allow that this game were worth the candle
 well  have you brought the money   asked oblonsky
 sit down    oh  don t trouble about the money
i ve come to see you to talk it over    what is there to talk over  but do sit down    i don t mind if i do   said ryabinin  sitting down and leaning his elbows on the back of his chair in a position of the intensest discomfort to himself  you must knock it down a bit  prince
it would be too bad
the money is ready conclusively to the last farthing
as to paying the money down  there ll be no hitch there   levin  who had meanwhile been putting his gun away in the cupboard  was just going out of the door  but catching the merchant s words  he stopped
 why  you ve got the forest for nothing as it is   he said
 he came to me too late  or i d have fixed the price for him   ryabinin got up  and in silence  with a smile  he looked levin down and up
anna karenina 370 of 1759  very close about money is konstantin dmitrievitch   he said with a smile  turning to stepan arkadyevitch   there s positively no dealing with him
in was bargaining for some wheat of him  and a pretty price in offered too    why should i give you my goods for nothing  i didn t pick it up on the ground  nor steal it either    mercy on us  nowadays there s no chance at all of stealing
with the open courts and everything done in style  nowadays there s no question of stealing
we are just talking things over like gentlemen
his excellency s asking too much for the forest
i can t make both ends meet over it
i must ask for a little concession    but is the thing settled between you or not  if it s settled  it s useless haggling  but if it s not   said levin   i ll buy the forest   the smile vanished at once from ryabinin s face
a hawklike  greedy  cruel expression was left upon it
with rapid  bony fingers he unbuttoned his coat  revealing a shirt  bronze waistcoat buttons  and a watch chain  and quickly pulled out a fat old pocketbook
 here you are  the forest is mine   he said  crossing himself quickly  and holding out his hand  take the money  it s my forest
that s ryabinin s way of doing anna karenina 371 of 1759 business  he doesn t haggle over every half penny   he added  scowling and waving the pocketbook
 i wouldn t be in a hurry if i were you   said levin
 come  really   said oblonsky in surprise
 i ve given my word  you know   levin went out of the room  slamming the door
ryabinin looked towards the door and shook his head with a smile
 it s all youthfulness positively nothing but boyishness
why  i m buying it  upon my honor  simply  believe me  for the glory of it  that ryabinin  and no one else  should have bought the copse of oblonsky
and as to the profits  why  i must make what god gives
in god s name
if you would kindly sign the title deed    within an hour the merchant  stroking his big overcoat neatly down  and hooding up his jacket  with the agreement in his pocket  seated himself in his tightly covered trap  and drove homewards  ugh  these gentlefolks   he said to the clerk
 they  they re a nice lot    that s so   responded the clerk  handing him the reins and buttoning the leather apron
 but i can congratulate you on the purchase  mihail ignatitch    well  well    anna karenina 372 of 1759 stepan arkadyevitch went upstairs with his pocket bulging with notes  which the merchant had paid him for three months in advance
the business of the forest was over  the money in his pocket  their shooting had been excellent  and stepan arkadyevitch was in the happiest frame of mind  and so he felt specially anxious to dissipate the ill humor that had come upon levin
he wanted to finish the day at supper as pleasantly as it had been begun
levin certainly was out of humor  and in spite off all his desire to be affectionate and cordial to his charming visitor  he could not control his mood
the intoxication of the news that kitty was not married had gradually begun to work upon him
kitty was not married  but ill  and ill from love for a man who had slighted her
this slight  as it were  rebounded upon him
vronsky had slighted her  and she had slighted him  levin
consequently vronsky had the right to despise levin  and therefore he was his enemy
but all this levin did not think out
he vaguely felt that there was something in it insulting to him  and he was not angry now at what had disturbed him  but he fell foul of anna karenina 373 of 1759 everything that presented itself
the stupid sale of the forest  the fraud practiced upon oblonsky and concluded in his house  exasperated him
 well  finished   he said  meeting stepan arkadyevitch upstairs
 would you like supper    well  i wouldn t say no to it
what an appetite i get in the country  wonderful  why didn t you offer ryabinin something    oh  damn him    still  how you do treat him   said oblonsky
 you didn t even shake hands with him
why not shake hands with him    because i don t shake hands with a waiter  and a waiter s a hundred times better than he is    what a reactionist you are  really  what about the amalgamation of classes   said oblonsky
 anyone who likes amalgamating is welcome to it  but it sickens me    you re a regular reactionist  i see    really  i have never considered what i am
i am konstantin levin  and nothing else    and konstantin levin very much out of temper   said stepan arkadyevitch  smiling
anna karenina 374 of 1759  yes  i am out of temper  and do you know why  because excuse me of your stupid sale    stepan arkadyevitch frowned good humoredly  like one who feels himself teased and attacked for no fault of his own  come  enough about it   he said
 when did anybody ever sell anything without being told immediately after the sale   it was worth much more   but when one wants to sell  no one will give anything   
no  i see you ve a grudge against that unlucky ryabinin    maybe i have
and do you know why  you ll say again that i m a reactionist  or some other terrible word  but all the same it does annoy and anger me to see on all sides the impoverishing of the nobility to which i belong  and  in spite of the amalgamation of classes  i m glad to belong
and their impoverishment is not due to extravagance that would be nothing  living in good style  that s the proper thing for noblemen  it s only the nobles who know how to do it
now the peasants about us buy land  and i don t mind that
the gentleman does nothing  while the peasant works and supplants the idle man
that s as it ought to be
and i m very glad for the peasant
but i do mind seeing the process of impoverishment from a sort of i don t know what to call anna karenina 375 of 1759 it  innocence
here a polish speculator bought for half its value a magnificent estate from a young lady who lives in nice
and there a merchant will get three acres of land  worth ten roubles  as security for the loan of one rouble
here  for no kind of reason  you ve made that rascal a present of thirty thousand roubles    well  what should i have done  counted every tree    of course  they must be counted
you didn t count them  but ryabinin did
ryabinin s children will have means of livelihood and education  while yours maybe will not    well  you must excuse me  but there s something mean in this counting
we have our business and they have theirs  and they must make their profit
anyway  the thing s done  and there s an end of it
and here come some poached eggs  my favorite dish
and agafea mihalovna will give us that marvelous herb brandy    stepan arkadyevitch sat down at the table and began joking with agafea mihalovna  assuring her that it was long since he had tasted such a dinner and such a supper
 well  you do praise it  anyway   said agafea mihalovna   but konstantin dmitrievitch  give him what you will a crust of bread he ll eat it and walk away   anna karenina 376 of 1759 though levin tried to control himself  he was gloomy and silent he wanted to put one question to stepan arkadyevitch  but he could not bring himself to the point  and could not find the words or the moment in which to put it stepan arkadyevitch had gone down to his room  undressed  again washed  and attired in a nightshirt with goffered frills  he had got into bed  but levin still lingered in his room  talking of various trifling matters  and not daring to ask what he wanted to know
 how wonderfully they make this soap   he said gazing at a piece of soap he was handling  which agafea mihalovna had put ready for the visitor but oblonsky had not used
 only look  why  it s a work of art    yes  everything s brought to such a pitch of perfection nowadays   said stepan arkadyevitch  with a moist and blissful yawn
 the theater  for instance  and the entertainments  
a a a   he yawned
 the electric light everywhere   a a a    yes  the electric light   said levin
 yes
oh  and where s vronsky now   he asked suddenly  laying down the soap
 vronsky   said stepan arkadyevitch  checking his yawn   he s in petersburg
he left soon after you did  and he s not once been in moscow since
and do you know  anna karenina 377 of 1759 kostya  i ll tell you the truth   he went on  leaning his elbow on the table  and propping on his hand his handsome ruddy face  in which his moist  good natured  sleepy eyes shone like stars
 it s your own fault
you took fright at the sight of your rival
but  as i told you at the time  i couldn t say which had the better chance
why didn t you fight it out  i told you at the time that      he yawned inwardly  without opening his mouth
 does he know  or doesn t he  that i did make an offer   levin wondered  gazing at him
 yes  there s something humbugging  diplomatic in his face   and feeling he was blushing  he looked stepan arkadyevitch straight in the face without speaking
 if there was anything on her side at the time  it was nothing but a superficial attraction   pursued oblonsky
 his being such a perfect aristocrat  don t you know  and his future position in society  had an influence not with her  but with her mother   levin scowled
the humiliation of his rejection stung him to the heart  as though it were a fresh wound he had only just received
but he was at home  and the walls of home are a support
 stay  stay   he began  interrupting oblonsky
 you talk of his being an aristocrat
but allow me to ask what it anna karenina 378 of 1759 consists in  that aristocracy of vronsky or of anybody else  beside which i can be looked down upon  you consider vronsky an aristocrat  but i don t
a man whose father crawled up from nothing at all by intrigue  and whose mother god knows whom she wasn t mixed up with   
no  excuse me  but i consider myself aristocratic  and people like me  who can point back in the past to three or four honorable generations of their family  of the highest degree of breeding  talent and intellect  of course that s another matter   and have never curried favor with anyone  never depended on anyone for anything  like my father and my grandfather
and i know many such
you think it mean of me to count the trees in my forest  while you may ryabinin a present of thirty thousand  but you get rents from your lands and i don t know what  while i don t and so i prize what s come to me from my ancestors or been won by hard work   
we are aristocrats  and not those who can only exist by favor of the powerful of this world  and who can be bought for twopence halfpenny    well  but whom are you attacking  i agree with you   said stepan arkadyevitch  sincerely and genially  though he was aware that in the class of those who could be bought for twopence halfpenny levin was reckoning him too
levin s warmth gave him genuine pleasure
 whom anna karenina 379 of 1759 are you attacking  though a good deal is not true that you say about vronsky  but i won t talk about that
i tell you straight out  if i were you  i should go back with me to moscow  and     no  i don t know whether you know it or not  but i don t care
and i tell you i did make an offer and was rejected  and katerina alexandrovna is nothing now to me but a painful and humiliating reminiscence    what ever for  what nonsense    but we won t talk about it
please forgive me  if i ve been nasty   said levin
now that he had opened his heart  he became as he had been in the morning
 you re not angry with me  stiva  please don t be angry   he said  and smiling  he took his hand
 of course not  not a bit  and no reason to be
i m glad we ve spoken openly
and do you know  stand shooting in the morning is unusually good why not go  i couldn t sleep the night anyway  but i might go straight from shooting to the station    capital   anna karenina 380 of 1759 although all vronsky s inner life was absorbed in his passion  his external life unalterably and inevitably followed along the old accustomed lines of his social and regimental ties and interests
the interests of his regiment took an important place in vronsky s life  both because he was fond of the regiment  and because the regiment was fond of him
they were not only fond of vronsky in his regiment  they respected him too  and were proud of him  proud that this man  with his immense wealth  his brilliant education and abilities  and the path open before him to every kind of success  distinction  and ambition  had disregarded all that  and of all the interests of life had the interests of his regiment and his comrades nearest to his heart vronsky was aware of his comrades  view of him  and in addition to his liking for the life  he felt bound to keep up that reputation it need not be said that he did not speak of his love to any of his comrades  nor did he betray his secret even in the wildest drinking bouts  though indeed he was never so drunk as to lose all control of himself  and he shut up any of his thoughtless comrades who attempted to allude to his anna karenina 381 of 1759 connection but in spite of that  his love was known to all the town  everyone guessed with more or less confidence at his relations with madame karenina the majority of the younger men envied him for just what was the most irksome factor in his love the exalted position of karenin  and the consequent publicity of their connection in society
the greater number of the young women  who envied anna and had long been weary of hearing her called virtuous  rejoiced at the fulfillment of their predictions  and were only waiting for a decisive turn in public opinion to fall upon her with all the weight of their scorn
they were already making ready their handfuls of mud to fling at her when the right moment arrived
the greater number of the middle aged people and certain great personages were displeased at the prospect of the impending scandal in society
vronsky s mother  on hearing of his connection  was at first pleased at it  because nothing to her mind gave such a finishing touch to a brilliant young man as a liaison in the highest society  she was pleased  too  that madame karenina  who had so taken her fancy  and had talked so much of her son  was  after all  just like all other pretty and well bred women  at least according to the countess anna karenina 382 of 1759 vronskaya s ideas
but she had heard of late that her son had refused a position offered him of great importance to his career  simply in order to remain in the regiment  where he could be constantly seeing madame karenina
she learned that great personages were displeased with him on this account  and she changed her opinion
she was vexed  too  that from all she could learn of this connection it was not that brilliant  graceful  worldly liaison which she would have welcomed  but a sort of wertherish  desperate passion  so she was told  which might well lead him into imprudence
she had not seen him since his abrupt departure from moscow  and she sent her elder son to bid him come to see her
this elder son  too  was displeased with his younger brother
he did not distinguish what sort of love his might be  big or little  passionate or passionless  lasting or passing  he kept a ballet girl himself  though he was the father of a family  so he was lenient in these matters   but he knew that this love affair was viewed with displeasure by those whom it was necessary to please  and therefore he did not approve of his brother s conduct besides the service and society  vronsky had another great interest horses  he was passionately fond of horses
anna karenina 383 of 1759 that year races and a steeplechase had been arranged for the officers
vronsky had put his name down  bought a thoroughbred english mare  and in spite of his love affair  he was looking forward to the races with intense  though reserved  excitement  
these two passions did not interfere with one another
on the contrary  he needed occupation and distraction quite apart from his love  so as to recruit and rest himself from the violent emotions that agitated him anna karenina 384 of 1759 on the day of the races at krasnoe selo  vronsky had come earlier than usual to eat beefsteak in the common messroom of the regiment
he had no need to be strict with himself  as he had very quickly been brought down to the required light weight  but still he had to avoid gaining flesh  and so he eschewed farinaceous and sweet dishes he sat with his coat unbuttoned over a white waistcoat  resting both elbows on the table  and while waiting for the steak he had ordered he looked at a french novel that lay open on his plate
he was only looking at the book to avoid conversation with the officers coming in and out  he was thinking
he was thinking of anna s promise to see him that day after the races
but he had not seen her for three days  and as her husband had just returned from aborad  he did not know whether she would be able to meet him today or not  and he did not know how to find out
he had had his last interview with her at his cousin betsy s summer villa
he visited the karenins  summer villa as rarely as possible
now he wanted to go there  and he pondered the question how to do it
anna karenina 385 of 1759  of course in shall say betsy has sent me to ask whether she s coming to the races
of course  i ll go   he decided  lifting his head from the book
and as he vividly pictured the happiness of seeing her  his face lighted up
 send to my house  and tell them to have out the carriage and three horses as quick as they can   he said to the servant  who handed him the steak on a hot silver dish  and moving the dish up he began eating
from the billiard room next door came the sound of balls knocking  of talk and laughter
two officers appeared at the entrance door  one  a young fellow  with a feeble  delicate face  who had lately joined the regiment from the corps of pages  the other  a plump  elderly officer  with a bracelet on his wrist  and little eyes  lost in fat
vronsky glanced at them  frowned  and looking down at his book as though he had not noticed them  he proceeded to eat and read at the same time
 what  fortifying yourself for your work   said the plump officer  sitting down beside him
 as you see   responded vronsky  knitting his brows  wiping his mouth  and not looking at the officer
 so you re not afraid of getting fat   said the latter  turning a chair round for the young officer
anna karenina 386 of 1759  what   said vronsky angrily  making a wry face of disgust  and showing his even teeth
 you re not afraid of getting fat    waiter  sherry   said vronsky  without replying  and moving the book to the other side of him  he went on reading
the plump officer took up the list of wines and turned to the young officer
 you choose what we re to drink   he said  handing him the card  and looking at him
 rhine wine  please   said the young officer  stealing a timid glance at vronsky  and trying to pull his scarcely visible mustache
seeing that vronsky did not turn round  the young officer got up
 let s go into the billiard room   he said
the plump officer rose submissively  and they moved towards the door
at that moment there walked into the room the tall and well built captain yashvin
nodding with an air of lofty contempt to the two officers  he went up to vronsky
 ah  here he is   he cried  bringing his big hand down heavily on his epaulet
vronsky looked round angrily  but anna karenina 387 of 1759 his face lighted up immediately with his characteristic expression of genial and manly serenity
 that s it  alexey   said the captain  in his loud baritone
 you must just eat a mouthful  now  and drink only one tiny glass    oh  i m not hungry    there go the inseparables   yashvin dropped  glancing sarcastically at the two officers who were at that instant leaving the room
and he bent his long legs  swatched in tight riding breeches  and sat down in the chair  too low for him  so that his knees were cramped up in a sharp angle
 why didn t you turn up at the red theater yesterday  numerova wasn t at all bad
where were you    in was late at the tverskoys    said vronsky
 ah   responded yashvin
yashvin  a gambler and a rake  a man not merely without moral principles  but of immoral principles  yashvin was vronsky s greatest friend in the regiment
vronsky liked him both for his exceptional physical strength  which he showed for the most part by being able to drink like a fish  and do without sleep without being in the slightest degree affected by it  and for his great strength of character  which he showed in his relations with his anna karenina 388 of 1759 comrades and superior officers  commanding both fear and respect  and also at cards  when he would play for tens of thousands and however much he might have drunk  always with such skill and decision that he was reckoned the best player in the english club vronsky respected and liked yashvin particularly because he felt yashvin liked him  not for his name and his money  but for himself and of all men he was the only one with whom vronsky would have liked to speak of his love
he felt that yashvin  in spite of his apparent contempt for every sort of feeling  was the only man who could  so he fancied  comprehend the intense passion which now filled his whole life
moreover  he felt certain that yashvin  as it was  took no delight in gossip and scandal  and interpreted his feeling rightly  that is to say  knew and believed that this passion was not a jest  not a pastime  but something more serious and important
vronsky had never spoken to him of his passion  but he was aware that he knew all about it  and that he put the right interpretation on it  and he was glad to see that in his eyes
 ah  yes   he said  to the announcement that vronsky had been at the tverskoys   and his black eyes shining  he anna karenina 389 of 1759 plucked at his left mustache  and began twisting it into his mouth  a bad habit he had
 well  and what did you do yesterday  win anything   asked vronsky
 eight thousand
but three don t count  he won t pay up    oh  then you can afford to lose over me   said vronsky  laughing
 yashvin had bet heavily on vronsky in the races    no chance of my losing
mahotin s the only one that s risky   and the conversation passed to forecasts of the coming race  the only thing vronsky could think of just now
 come along  i ve finished   said vronsky  and getting up he went to the door
yashvin got up too  stretching his long legs and his long back  it s too early for me to dine  but i must have a drink
i ll come along directly
hi  wine   he shouted  in his rich voice  that always rang out so loudly at drill  and set the windows shaking now
 no  all right   he shouted again immediately after
 you re going home  so i ll go with you   and he walked out with vronsky
anna karenina 390 of 1759 vronsky was staying in a roomy  clean  finnish hut  divided into two by a partition
petritsky lived with him in camp too
petritsky was asleep when vronsky and yashvin came into the hut
 get up  don t go on sleeping   said yashvin  going behind the partition and giving petritsky  who was lying with ruffled hair and with his nose in the pillow  a prod on the shoulder
petritsky jumped up suddenly onto his knees and looked round
 your brother s been here   he said to vronsky
 he waked me up  damn him  and said he d look in again   and pulling up the rug he flung himself back on the pillow  oh  do shut up  yashvin   he said  getting furious with yashvin  who was pulling the rug off him
 shut up   he turned over and opened his eyes
 you d better tell me what to drink  such a nasty taste in my mouth  that     brandy s better than anything   boomed yashvin
 tereshtchenko  brandy for your master and cucumbers   he shouted  obviously taking pleasure in the sound of his own voice
anna karenina 391 of 1759  brandy  do you think  eh   queried petritsky  blinking and rubbing his eyes
 and you ll drink something  all right then  we ll have a drink together  vronsky  have a drink   said petritsky  getting up and wrapping the tigerskin rug round him
he went to the door of the partition wall  raised his hands  and hummed in french   there was a king in thule    vronsky  will you have a drink    go along   said vronsky  putting on the coat his valet handed to him
 where are you off to   asked yashvin
 oh  here are your three horses   he added  seeing the carriage drive up
 to the stables  and i ve got to see bryansky  too  about the horses   said vronsky
vronsky had as a fact promised to call at bryansky s  some eight miles from peterhof  and to bring him some money owing for some horses  and he hoped to have time to get that in too
but his comrades were at once aware that he was not only going there petritsky  still humming  winked and made a pout with his lips  as though he would say   oh  yes  we know your bryansky    mind you re not late   was yashvin s only comment  and to change the conversation   how s my roan  is he doing all right   he inquired  looking out of the window at anna karenina 392 of 1759 the middle one of the three horses  which he had sold vronsky
 stop   cried petritsky to vronsky as he was just going out
 your brother left a letter and a note for you
wait a bit  where are they   vronsky stopped
 well  where are they    where are they  that s just the question   said petritsky solemnly  moving his forefinger upwards from his nose
 come  tell me  this is silly   said vronsky smiling
 i have not lighted the fire
here somewhere about    come  enough fooling  where is the letter    no  i ve forgotten really
or was it a dream  wait a bit  wait a bit  but what s the use of getting in a rage
if you d drunk four bottles yesterday as i did you d forget where you were lying
wait a bit  i ll remember   petritsky went behind the partition and lay down on his bed
 wait a bit  this was how i was lying  and this was how he was standing
yes yes yes   
here it is   and petritsky pulled a letter out from under the mattress  where he had hidden it
anna karenina 393 of 1759 vronsky took the letter and his brother s note
it was the letter he was expecting from his mother  reproaching him for not having been to see her and the note was from his brother to say that he must have a little talk with him
vronsky knew that it was all about the same thing
 what business is it of theirs   thought vronsky  and crumpling up the letters he thrust them between the buttons of his coat so as to read them carefully on the road
in the porch of the hut he was met by two officers  one of his regiment and one of another
vronsky s quarters were always a meeting place for all the officers
 where are you off to    i must go to peterhof    has the mare come from tsarskoe    yes  but i ve not seen her yet    they say mahotin s gladiator s lame    nonsense  but however are you going to race in this mud   said the other
 here are my saviors   cried petritsky  seeing them come in
before him stood the orderly with a tray of brandy and salted cucumbers
 here s yashvin ordering me a drink a pick me up   anna karenina 394 of 1759  well  you did give it to us yesterday   said one of those who had come in   you didn t let us get a wink of sleep all night    oh  didn t we make a pretty finish   said petritsky
 volkov climbed onto the roof and began telling us how sad he was
i said   let s have music  the funeral march   he fairly dropped asleep on the roof over the funeral march    drink it up  you positively must drink the brandy  and then seltzer water and a lot of lemon   said yashvin  standing over petritsky like a mother making a child take medicine   and then a little champagne just a small bottle    come  there s some sense in that
stop a bit  vronsky
we ll all have a drink    no  good bye all of you
i m not going to drink today    why  are you gaining weight  all right  then we must have it alone
give us the seltzer water and lemon    vronsky   shouted someone when he was already outside
 well    you d better get your hair cut  it ll weigh you down  especially at the top   anna karenina 395 of 1759 vronsky was in fact beginning  prematurely  to get a little bald
he laughed gaily  showing his even teeth  and puling his cap over the thin place  went out and got into his carriage
 to the stables   he said  and was just pulling out the letters to read them through  but he thought better of it  and put off reading them so as not to distract his attention before looking at the mare
 later   anna karenina 396 of 1759 the temporary stable  a wooden shed  had been put up close to the race course  and there his mare was to have been taken the previous day
he had not yet seen her there
during the last few days he had not ridden her out for exercise himself  but had put her in the charge of the trainer  and so now he positively did not know in what condition his mare had arrived yesterday and was today he had scarcely got out of his carriage when his groom  the so called  stable boy   recognizing the carriage some way off  called the trainer
a dry looking englishman  in high boots and a short jacket  clean shaven  except for a tuft below his chin  came to meet him  walking with the uncouth gait of jockey  turning his elbows out and swaying from side to side
 well  how s frou frou   vronsky asked in english
 all right  sir   the englishman s voice responded somewhere in the inside of his throat
 better not go in   he added  touching his hat
 i ve put a muzzle on her  and the mare s fidgety
better not go in  it ll excite the mare    no  i m going in
i want to look at her   anna karenina 397 of 1759  come along  then   said the englishman  frowning  and speaking with his mouth shut  and with swinging elbows  he went on in front with his disjointed gait
they went into the little yard in front of the shed
a stable boy  spruce and smart in his holiday attire  met them with a broom in his hand  and followed them
in the shed there were five horses in their separate stalls  and vronsky knew that his chief rival  gladiator  a very tall chestnut horse  had been brought there  and must be standing among them
even more than his mare  vronsky longed to see gladiator  whom he had never seen
but he knew that by the etiquette of the race course it was not merely impossible for him to see the horse  but improper even to ask questions about him
just as he was passing along the passage  the boy opened the door into the second horsebox on the left  and vronsky caught a glimpse of a big chestnut horse with white legs
he knew that this was gladiator  but  with the feeling of a man turning away from the sight of another man s open letter  he turned round and went into frou frou s stall
 the horse is here belonging to mak   mak   i never can say the name   said the englishman  over his shoulder  pointing his big finger and dirty nail towards gladiator s stall
anna karenina 398 of 1759  mahotin  yes  he s my most serious rival   said vronsky
 if you were riding him   said the englishman   i d bet on you    frou frou s more nervous  he s stronger   said vronsky  smiling at the compliment to his riding
 in a steeplechase it all depends on riding and on pluck   said the englishman
of pluck that is  energy and courage vronsky did not merely feel that he had enough  what was of far more importance  he was firmly convinced that no one in the world could have more of this  pluck  than he had
 don t you think i want more thinning down    oh  no   answered the englishman
 please  don t speak loud
the mare s fidgety   he added  nodding towards the horse box  before which they were standing  and from which came the sound of restless stamping in the straw
he opened the door  and vronsky went into the horsebox  dimly lighted by one little window
in the horse box stood a dark bay mare  with a muzzle on  picking at the fresh straw with her hoofs
looking round him in the twilight of the horse box  vronsky unconsciously took in once more in a comprehensive glance all the points of his anna karenina 399 of 1759 favorite mare
frou frou was a beast of medium size  not altogether free from reproach  from a breeder s point of view
she was small boned all over  though her chest was extremely prominent in front  it was narrow
her hindquarters were a little drooping  and in her fore legs  and still more in her hind legs  there was a noticeable curvature
the muscles of both hind  and fore legs were not very thick  but across her shoulders the mare was exceptionally broad  a peculiarity specially striking now that she was lean from training
the bones of her legs below the knees looked no thicker than a finger from in front  but were extraordinarily thick seen from the side
she looked altogether  except across the shoulders  as it were  pinched in at the sides and pressed out in depth
but she had in the highest degree the quality that makes all defects forgotten  that quality was blood  the blood that tells  as the english expression has it
the muscles stood up sharply under the network of sinews  covered with this delicate  mobile skin  soft as satin  and they were hard a bone
her clean cut head with prominent  bright  spirited eyes  broadened out at the open nostrils  that showed the red blood in the cartilage within
about all her figure  and especially her head  there was a certain expression of energy  and  at the same time  of softness
she was one of anna karenina 400 of 1759 those creatures which seem only not to speak because the mechanism of their mouth does not allow them to
to vronsky  at any rate  it seemed that she understood all he felt at that moment  looking at her
directly vronsky went towards her  she drew in a deep breath  and  turning back her prominent eye till the white looked bloodshot  she started at the approaching figures from the opposite side  shaking her muzzle  and shifting lightly from one leg to the other
 there  you see how fidgety she is   said the englishman
 there  darling  there   said vronsky  going up to the mare and speaking soothingly to her
but the nearer he came  the more excited she grew
only when he stood by her head  she was suddenly quieter  while the muscles quivered under her soft  delicate coat
vronsky patted her strong neck  straightened over her sharp withers a stray lock of her mane that had fallen on the other side  and moved his face near her dilated nostrils  transparent as a bat s wing
she drew a loud breath and snorted out through her tense nostrils  started  pricked up her sharp ear  and put out her strong  black lip towards vronsky  as though she would nip hold of his sleeve
but remembering the muzzle  she shook it and again began restlessly stamping one after the other her shapely legs
 quiet  darling  quiet   he said  patting her again over her hind quarters  and with a glad sense that his mare was in the best possible condition  he went out of the horsebox
the mare s excitement had infected vronsky
he felt that his heart was throbbing  and that he  too  like the mare  longed to move  to bite  it was both dreadful and delicious
 well  i rely on you  then   he said to the englishman   half past six on the ground    all right   said the englishman
 oh  where are you going  my lord   he asked suddenly  using the title  my lord   which he had scarcely ever used before
vronsky in amazement raised his head  and stared  as he knew how to stare  not into the englishman s eyes  but at his forehead  astounded at the impertinence of his question
but realizing that in asking this the englishman had been looking at him not as an employer  but as a jockey  he answered   i ve got to go to bryansky s  i shall be home within an hour   anna karenina 402 of 1759  how often i m asked that question today   he said to himself  and he blushed  a thing which rarely happened to him the englishman looked gravely at him  and  as though he  too  knew where vronsky was going  he added   the great thing s to keep quiet before a race   said he   don t get out of temper or upset about anything    all right   answered vronsky  smiling  and jumping into his carriage  he told the man to drive to peterhof
before he had driven many paces away  the dark clouds that had been threatening rain all day broke  and there was a heavy downpour of rain
 what a pity   thought vronsky  putting up the roof of the carriage
 it was muddy before  now it will be a perfect swamp   as he sat in solitude in the closed carriage  he took out his mother s letter and his brother s note  and read them through
yes  it was the same thing over and over again
everyone  his mother  his brother  everyone thought fit to interfere in the affairs of his heart
this interference aroused in him a feeling of angry hatred a feeling he had rarely known before
 what business is it of theirs  why does everybody feel called upon to concern himself about me  and why do they worry me so  just because they see anna karenina 403 of 1759 that this is something they can t understand if it were a common  vulgar  worldly intrigue  they would have left me alone
they feel that this is something different  that this is not a mere pastime  that this woman is dearer to me than life
and this is incomprehensible  and that s why it annoys them
whatever our destiny is or may be  we have made it ourselves  and we do not complain of it   he said  in the word we linking himself with anna  no  they must needs teach us how to live
they haven t an idea of what happiness is  they don t know that without our love  for us there is neither happiness nor unhappiness no life at all   he thought
he was angry with all of them for their interference just because he felt in his soul that they  all these people  were right
he felt that the love that bound him to anna was not a momentary impulse  which would pass  as worldly intrigues do pass  leaving no other traces in the life of either but pleasant or unpleasant memories
he felt all the torture of his own and her position  all the difficulty there was for them  conspicuous as they were in the eye of all the world  in concealing their love  in lying and deceiving  and in lying  deceiving  feigning  and continually thinking of others  when the passion that anna karenina 404 of 1759 united them was so intense that they were both oblivious of everything else but their love
he vividly recalled all the constantly recurring instances of inevitable necessity for lying and deceit  which were so against his natural bent
he recalled particularly vividly the shame he had more than once detected in her at this necessity for lying and deceit
and he experienced the strange feeling that had sometimes come upon him since his secret love for anna
this was a feeling of loathing for something whether for alexey alexandrovitch  or for himself  or for the whole world  he could not have said but he always drove away this strange feeling
now  too  he shook it off and continued the thread of his thoughts
 yes  she was unhappy before  but proud and at peace  and now she cannot be at peace and feel secure in her dignity  though she does not show it
yes  we must put an end to it   he decided
and for the first time the idea clearly presented itself that it was essential to put an end to this false position  and the sooner the better
 throw up everything  she and i  and hide ourselves somewhere alone with our love   he said to himself the rain did not last long  and by the time vronsky arrived  his shaft horse trotting at full speed and dragging the trace horses galloping through the mud  with their reins hanging loose  the sun had peeped out again  the roofs of the summer villas and the old limetrees in the gardens on both sides of the principal streets sparkled with wet brilliance  and from the twigs came a pleasant drip and from the roofs rushing streams of water he thought no more of the shower spoiling the race course  but was rejoicing now that thanks to the rain he would be sure to find her at home and alone  as he knew that alexey alexandrovitch  who had lately returned from a foreign watering place  had not moved from petersburg
hoping to find her alone  vronsky alighted  as he always did  to avoid attracting attention  before crossing the bridge  and walked to the house
he did not go up the steps to the street door  but went into the court
 has your master come   he asked a gardener
 no  sir
the mistress is at home
but will you please go to the frond door  there are servants there   the gardener answered
 they ll open the door   anna karenina 406 of 1759  no  i ll go in from the garden   and feeling satisfied that she was alone  and wanting to take her by surprise  since he had not promised to be there today  and she would certainly not expect him to come before the races  he walked  holding his sword and stepping cautiously over the sandy path  bordered with flowers  to the terrace that looked out upon the garden
vronsky forgot now all that he had thought on the way of the hardships and difficulties of their position
he thought of nothing but that he would see her directly  not in imagination  but living  all of her  as she was in reality
he was just going in  stepping on his whole foot so as not to creak  up the worn steps of the terrace  when he suddenly remembered what he always forgot  and what caused the most torturing side of his relations with her  her son with his questioning hostile  as he fancied eyes
this boy was more often than anyone else a check upon their freedom
when he was present  both vronsky and anna did not merely avoid speaking of anything that they could not have repeated before everyone  they did not even allow themselves to refer by hints to anything the boy did not understand they had made no agreement about this  it had settled itself
they would have felt it wounding themselves to deceive the child in his presence anna karenina 407 of 1759 they talked like acquaintances
but in spite of this caution  vronsky often saw the child s intent  bewildered glance fixed upon him  and a strange shyness  uncertainty  at one time friendliness  at another  coldness and reserve  in the boy s manner to him  as though the child felt that between this man and his mother there existed some important bond  the significance of which he could not understand
as a fact  the boy did feel that he could not understand this relation  and he tried painfully  and was not able to make clear to himself what feeling he ought to have for this man with a child s keen instinct for every manifestation of feeling  he saw distinctly that his father  his governess  his nurse  all did not merely dislike vronsky  but looked on him with horror and aversion  though they never said anything about him  while his mother looked on him as her greatest friend
 what does it mean  who is he  how ought i to love him  if i don t know  it s my fault  either i m stupid or a naughty boy   thought the child
and this was what caused his dubious  inquiring  sometimes hostile  expression  and the shyness and uncertainty which vronsky found so irksome
this child s presence always and infallibly called up in vronsky that strange feeling of inexplicable loathing which he had experienced of late
this child s presence anna karenina 408 of 1759 called up both in vronsky and in anna a feeling akin to the feeling of a sailor who sees by the compass that the direction in which he is swiftly moving is far from the right one  but that to arrest his motion is not in his power  that every instant is carrying him further and further away  and that to admit to himself his deviation from the right direction is the same as admitting his certain ruin this child  with his innocent outlook upon life  was the compass that showed them the point to which they had departed from what they knew  but did not want to know
this time seryozha was not at home  and she was completely alone
she was sitting on the terrace waiting for the return of her son  who had gone out for his walk and been caught in the rain
she had sent a manservant and a maid out to look for him
dressed in a white gown  deeply embroidered  she was sitting in a corner of the terrace behind some flowers  and did not hear him
bending her curly black head  she pressed her forehead against a cool watering pot that stood on the parapet  and both her lovely hands  with the rings he knew so well  clasped the pot
the beauty of her whole figure  her head  her neck  her hands  struck vronsky every time as something new and unexpected
he stood still  gazing at anna karenina 409 of 1759 her in ecstasy
but  directly he would have made a step to come nearer to her  she was aware of his presence  pushed away the watering pot  and turned her flushed face towards him
 what s the matter  you are ill   he said to her in french  going up to her
he would have run to her  but remembering that there might be spectators  he looked round towards the balcony door  and reddened a little  as he always reddened  feeling that he had to be afraid and be on his guard
 no  i m quite well   she said  getting up and pressing his outstretched hand tightly  i did not expect   thee    mercy  what cold hands   he said
 you startled me   she said
 i m alone  and expecting seryozha  he s out for a walk  they ll come in from this side   but  in spite of her efforts to be calm  her lips were quivering
 forgive me for coming  but i couldn t pass the day without seeing you   he went on  speaking french  as he always did to avoid using the stiff russian plural form  so impossibly frigid between them  and the dangerously intimate singular
 forgive you  i m so glad   anna karenina 410 of 1759  but you re ill or worried   he went on  not letting go her hands and bending over her
 what were you thinking of    always the same thing   she said  with a smile
she spoke the truth
if ever at any moment she had been asked what she was thinking of  she could have answered truly  of the same thing  of her happiness and her unhappiness
she was thinking  just when he came upon her of this  why was it  she wondered  that to others  to betsy  she knew of her secret connection with tushkevitch  it was all easy  while to her it was such torture  today this thought gained special poignancy from certain other considerations
she asked him about the races
he answered her questions  and  seeing that she was agitated  trying to calm her  he began telling her in the simplest tone the details of his preparations for the races
 tell him or not tell him   she thought  looking into his quiet  affectionate eyes
 he is so happy  so absorbed in his races that he won t understand as he ought  he won t understand all the gravity of this fact to us    but you haven t told me what you were thinking of when i came in   he said  interrupting his narrative   please tell me   anna karenina 411 of 1759 she did not answer  and  bending her head a little  she looked inquiringly at him from under her brows  her eyes shining under their long lashes
her hand shook as it played with a leaf she had picked
he saw it  and his face expressed that utter subjection  that slavish devotion  which had done so much to win her
 i see something has happened
do you suppose i can be at peace  knowing you have a trouble i am not sharing  tell me  for god s sake   he repeated imploringly
 yes  i shan t be able to forgive him if he does not realize all the gravity of it
better not tell  why put him to the proof   she thought  still staring at him in the same way  and feeling the hand that held the leaf was trembling more and more
 for god s sake   he repeated  taking her hand
 shall i tell you    yes  yes  yes

    i m with child   she said  softly and deliberately
the leaf in her hand shook more violently  but she did not take her eyes off him  watching how he would take it
he turned white  would have said something  but stopped  he dropped her hand  and his head sank on his breast
 yes  he realizes all the gravity of it   she thought  and gratefully she pressed his hand
anna karenina 412 of 1759 but she was mistaken in thinking he realized the gravity of the fact as she  a woman  realized it
on hearing it  he felt come upon him with tenfold intensity that strange feeling of loathing of someone
but at the same time  he felt that the turning point he had been longing for had come now  that it was impossible to go on concealing things from her husband  and it was inevitable in one way or another that they should soon put an end to their unnatural position
but  besides that  her emotion physically affected him in the same way
he looked at her with a look of submissive tenderness  kissed her hand  got up  and  in silence  paced up and down the terrace
 yes   he said  going up to her resolutely
 neither you nor i have looked on our relations as a passing amusement  and now our fate is sealed
it is absolutely necessary to put an end  he looked round as he spoke  to the deception in which we are living    put an end  how put an end  alexey   she said softly
she was calmer now  and her face lighted up with a tender smile
 leave your husband and make our life one    it is one as it is   she answered  scarcely audibly
 yes  but altogether  altogether   anna karenina 413 of 1759  but how  alexey  tell me how   she said in melancholy mockery at the hopelessness of her own position
 is there any way out of such a position  am i not the wife of my husband    there is a way out of every position
we must take our line   he said
 anything s better than the position in which you re living
of course  i see how you torture yourself over everything the world and your son and your husband    oh  not over my husband   she said  with a quiet smile
 i don t know him  i don t think of him
he doesn t exist    you re not speaking sincerely
i know you
you worry about him too    oh  he doesn t even know   she said  and suddenly a hot flush came over her face  her cheeks  her brow  her neck crimsoned  and tears of shame came into her eyes  but we won t talk of him   anna karenina 414 of 1759 vronsky had several times already  though not so resolutely as now  tried to bring her to consider their position  and every time he had been confronted by the same superficiality and triviality with which she met his appeal now
it was as though there were something in this which she could not or would not face  as though directly she began to speak of this  she  the real anna  retreated somehow into herself  and another strange and unaccountable woman came out  whom he did not love  and whom he feared  and who was in opposition to him
but today he was resolved to have it out
 whether he knows or not   said vronsky  in his usual quiet and resolute tone   that s nothing to do with us
we cannot   you cannot stay like this  especially now    what s to be done  according to you   she asked with the same frivolous irony
she who had so feared he would take her condition too lightly was now vexed with him for deducing from it the necessity of taking some step
 tell him everything  and leave him    very well  let us suppose i do that   she said
 do you know what the result of that would be  i can tell you it all anna karenina 415 of 1759 beforehand   and a wicked light gleamed in her eyes  that had been so soft a minute before
  eh  you love another man  and have entered into criminal intrigues with him     mimicking her husband  she threw an emphasis on the word  criminal   as alexey alexandrovitch did      i warned you of the results in the religious  the civil  and the domestic relation
you have not listened to me
now in cannot let you disgrace my name      and my son   she had meant to say  but about her son she could not jest     disgrace my name  and  and more in the same style   she added
 in general terms  he ll say in his official manner  and with all distinctness and precision  that he cannot let me go  but will take all measures in his power to prevent scandal and he will calmly and punctually act in accordance with his words
that s what will happen
he s not a man  but a machine  and a spiteful machine when he s angry   she added  recalling alexey alexandrovitch as she spoke  with all the peculiarities of his figure and manner of speaking  and reckoning against him every defect she could find in him  softening nothing for the great wrong she herself was doing him
 but  anna   said vronsky  in a soft and persuasive voice  trying to soothe her   we absolutely must  anyway  tell him  and then be guided by the line he takes   anna karenina 416 of 1759  what  run away    and why not run away  i don t see how we can keep on like this
and not for my sake i see that you suffer    yes  run away  and become your mistress   she said angrily
 anna   he said  with reproachful tenderness
 yes   she went on   become your mistress  and complete the ruin of    again she would have said  my son   but she could not utter that word
vronsky could not understand how she  with her strong and truthful nature  could endure this state of deceit  and not long to get out of it
but he did not suspect that the chief cause of it was the word son  which she could not bring herself to pronounce
when she thought of her son  and his future attitude to his mother  who had abandoned his father  she felt such terror at what she had done  that she could not face it  but  like a woman  could only try to comfort herself with lying assurances that everything would remain as it always had been  and that it was possible to forget the fearful question of how it would be with her son
anna karenina 417 of 1759  i beg you  i entreat you   she said suddenly  taking his hand  and speaking in quite a different tone  sincere and tender   never speak to me of that    but  anna     never
leave it to me
i know all the baseness  all the horror of my position  but it s not so easy to arrange as you think
and leave it to me  and do what i say
never speak to me of it
do you promise me    no  no  promise      i promise everything  but i can t be at peace  especially after what you have told me
i can t be at peace  when you can t be at peace      i   she repeated
 yes  i am worried sometimes  but that will pass  if you will never talk about this
when you talk about it it s only then it worries me    i don t understand   he said
 i know   she interrupted him   how hard it is for your truthful nature to lie  and i grieve for you
i often think that you have ruined your whole life for me    i was just thinking the very same thing   he said   how could you sacrifice everything for my sake  i can t forgive myself that you re unhappy    i unhappy   she said  coming closer to him  and looking at him with an ecstatic smile of love
 i am like a anna karenina 418 of 1759 hungry man who has been given food
he may be cold  and dressed in rags  and ashamed  but he is not unhappy
i unhappy  no  this is my unhappiness     she could hear the sound of her son s voice coming towards them  and glancing swiftly round the terrace  she got up impulsively
her eyes glowed with the fire he knew so well  with a rapid movement she raised her lovely hands  covered with rings  took his head  looked a long look into his face  and  putting up her face with smiling  parted lips  swiftly kissed his mouth and both eyes  and pushed him away
she would have gone  but he held her back
 when   he murmured in a whisper  gazing in ecstasy at her
 tonight  at one o clock   she whispered  and  with a heavy sigh  she walked with her light  swift step to meet her son
seryozha had been caught by the rain in the big garden  and he and his nurse had taken shelter in an arbor
 well  au revoir   she said to vronsky
 i must soon be getting ready for the races
betsy promised to fetch me   vronsky  looking at his watch  went away hurriedly anna karenina 419 of 1759 when vronsky looked at his watch on the karenins  balcony  he was so greatly agitated and lost in his thoughts that he saw the figures on the watch s face  but could not take in what time it was
he came out on to the highroad and walked  picking his way carefully through the mud  to his carriage
he was so completely absorbed in his feeling for anna  that he did not even think what o clock it was  and whether he had time to go to bryansky s
he had left him  as often happens  only the external faculty of memory  that points out each step one has to take  one after the other
he went up to his coachman  who was dozing on the box in the shadow  already lengthening  of a thick limetree  he admired the shifting clouds of midges circling over the hot horses  and  waking the coachman  he jumped into the carriage  and told him to drive to bryansky s
it was only after driving nearly five miles that he had sufficiently recovered himself to look at his watch  and realize that it was half past five  and he was late there were several races fixed for that day  the mounted guards  race  then the officers  mile and a half race  then the three mile race  and then the race for anna karenina 420 of 1759 which he was entered
he could still be in time for his race  but if he went to bryansky s he could only just be in time  and he would arrive when the whole of the court would be in their places
that would be a pity
but he had promised bryansky to come  and so he decided to drive on  telling the coachman not to spare the horses
he reached bryansky s  spent five minutes there  and galloped back
this rapid drive calmed him
all that was painful in his relations with anna  all the feeling of indefiniteness left by their conversation  had slipped out of his mind
he was thinking now with pleasure and excitement of the race  of his being anyhow  in time  and now and then the thought of the blissful interview awaiting him that night flashed across his imagination like a flaming light
the excitement of the approaching race gained upon him as he drove further and further into the atmosphere of the races  overtaking carriages driving up from the summer villas or out of petersburg
at his quarters no one was left at home  all were at the races  and his valet was looking out for him at the gate
while he was changing his clothes  his valet told him that the second race had begun already  that a lot of gentlemen had been to ask for him  and a boy had twice run up from anna karenina 421 of 1759 the stables
dressing without hurry  he never hurried himself  and never lost his self possession   vronsky drove to the sheds from the sheds he could see a perfect sea of carriages  and people on foot  soldiers surrounding the race course  and pavilions swarming with people
the second race was apparently going on  for just as he went into the sheds he heard a bell ringing
going towards the stable  he met the white legged chestnut  mahotin s gladiator  being led to the race course in a blue forage horsecloth  with what looked like huge ears edged with blue
 where s cord   he asked the stable boy
 in the stable  putting on the saddle   in the open horse box stood frou frou  saddled ready
they were just going to lead her out
 i m not too late    all right  all right   said the englishman   don t upset yourself   vronsky once more took in in one glance the exquisite lines of his favorite mare  who was quivering all over  and with an effort he tore himself from the sight of her  and went out of the stable he went towards the pavilions at the most favorable moment for escaping attention
the mile and a half race was just finishing  and all eyes were fixed on the horse guard in front and the light hussar anna karenina 422 of 1759 behind  urging their horses on with a last effort close to the winning post
from the center and outside of the ring all were crowding to the winning post  and a group of soldiers and officers of the horse guards were shouting loudly their delight at the expected triumph of their officer and comrade vronsky moved into the middle of the crowd unnoticed  almost at the very moment when the bell rang at the finish of the race  and the tall  mudspattered horse guard who came in first  bending over the saddle  let go the reins of his panting gray horse that looked dark with sweat
the horse  stiffening out its legs  with an effort stopped its rapid course  and the officer of the horse guards looked round him like a man waking up from a heavy sleep  and just managed to smile
a crowd of friends and outsiders pressed round him
vronsky intentionally avoided that select crowd of the upper world  which was moving and talking with discreet freedom before the pavilions
he knew that madame karenina was there  and betsy  and his brother s wife  and he purposely did not go near them for fear of something distracting his attention
but he was continually met and stopped by acquaintances  who told him about the previous races  and kept asking him why he was so late
anna karenina 423 of 1759 at the time when the racers had to go to the pavilion to receive the prizes  and all attention was directed to that point  vronsky s elder brother  alexander  a colonel with heavy fringed epaulets  came up to him
he was not tall  though as broadly built as alexey  and handsomer and rosier than he  he had a red nose  and an open  drunkenlooking face
 did you get my note   he said
 there s never any finding you   alexander vronsky  in spite of the dissolute life  and in especial the drunken habits  for which he was notorious  was quite one of the court circle
now  as he talked to his brother of a matter bound to be exceedingly disagreeable to him  knowing that the eyes of many people might be fixed upon him  he kept a smiling countenance  as though he were jesting with his brother about something of little moment
 i got it  and i really can t make out what you are worrying yourself about   said alexey
 i m worrying myself because the remark has just been made to me that you weren t here  and that you were seen in peterhof on monday   anna karenina 424 of 1759  there are matters which only concern those directly interested in them  and the matter you are so worried about is     yes  but if so  you may as well cut the service      i beg you not to meddle  and that s all i have to say   alexey vronsky s frowning face turned white  and his prominent lower jaw quivered  which happened rarely with him
being a man of very warm heart  he was seldom angry  but when he was angry  and when his chin quivered  then  as alexander vronsky knew  he was dangerous
alexander vronsky smiled gaily
 i only wanted to give you mother s letter
answer it and don t worry about anything just before the race
bonne chance   he added  smiling and he moved away from him
but after him another friendly greeting brought vronsky to a standstill
 so you won t recognize your friends  how are you  mon cher   said stepan arkadyevitch  as conspicuously brilliant in the midst of all the petersburg brilliance as he was in moscow  his face rosy  and his whiskers sleek and glossy
 i came up yesterday  and i m delighted that i shall see your triumph
when shall we meet    come tomorrow to the messroom   said vronsky  and squeezing him by the sleeve of his coat  with apologies  he anna karenina 425 of 1759 moved away to the center of the race course  where the horses were being led for the great steeplechase
the horses who had run in the last race were being led home  steaming and exhausted  by the stable boys  and one after another the fresh horses for the coming race made their appearance  for the most part english racers  wearing horsecloths  and looking with their drawn up bellies like strange  huge birds
on the right was led in frou frou  lean and beautiful  lifting up her elastic  rather long pasterns  as though moved by springs
not far from her they were taking the rug off the lop eared gladiator
the strong  exquisite  perfectly correct lines of the stallion  with his superb hind quarters and excessively short pasterns almost over his hoofs  attracted vronsky s attention in spite of himself he would have gone up to his mare  but he was again detained by an acquaintance
 oh  there s karenin   said the acquaintance with whom he was chatting
 he s looking for his wife  and she s in the middle of the pavilion
didn t you see her    no   answered vronsky  and without even glancing round towards the pavilion where his friend was pointing out madame karenina  he went up to his mare
vronsky had not had time to look at the saddle  about which he had to give some direction  when the anna karenina 426 of 1759 competitors were summoned to the pavilion to receive their numbers and places in the row at starting
seventeen officers  looking serious and severe  many with pale faces  met together in the pavilion and drew the numbers
vronsky drew the number seven
the cry was heard   mount   feeling that with the others riding in the race  he was the center upon which all eyes were fastened  vronsky walked up to his mare in that state of nervous tension in which he usually became deliberate and composed in his movements
cord  in honor of the races  had put on his best clothes  a black coat buttoned up  a stiffly starched collar  which propped up his cheeks  a round black hat  and top boots
he was calm and dignified as ever  and was with his own hands holding frou frou by both reins  standing straight in front of her
frou frou was still trembling as though in a fever
her eye  full of fire  glanced sideways at vronsky
vronsky slipped his finger under the saddle girth
the mare glanced aslant at him  drew up her lip  and twitched her ear
the englishman puckered up his lips  intending to indicate a smile that anyone should verify his saddling
 get up  you won t feel so excited   anna karenina 427 of 1759 vronsky looked round for the last time at his rivals
he knew that he would not see them during the race
two were already riding forward to the point from which they were to start
galtsin  a friend of vronsky s and one of his more formidable rivals  was moving round a bay horse that would not let him mount
a little light hussar in tight riding breeches rode off at a gallop  crouched up like a cat on the saddle  in imitation of english jockeys
prince kuzovlev sat with a white face on his thoroughbred mare from the grabovsky stud  while an english groom led her by the bridle
vronsky and all his comrades knew kuzovlev and his peculiarity of  weak nerves  and terrible vanity they knew that he was afraid of everything  afraid of riding a spirited horse
but now  just because it was terrible  because people broke their necks  and there was a doctor standing at each obstacle  and an ambulance with a cross on it  and a sister of mercy  he had made up his mind to take part in the race
their eyes met  and vronsky gave him a friendly and encouraging nod
only one he did not see  his chief rival  mahotin on gladiator
 don t be in a hurry   said cord to vronsky   and remember one thing  don t hold her in at the fences  and don t urge her on  let her go as she likes    all right  all right   said vronsky  taking the reins
anna karenina 428 of 1759  if you can  lead the race  but don t lose heart till the last minute  even if you re behind   before the mare had time to move  vronsky stepped with an agile  vigorous movement into the steel toothed stirrup  and lightly and firmly seated himself on the creaking leather of the saddle getting his right foot in the stirrup  he smoothed the double reins  as he always did  between his fingers  and cord let go
as though she did not know which foot to put first  frou frou started  dragging at the reins with her long neck  and as though she were on springs  shaking her rider from side to side
cord quickened his step  following him
the excited mare  trying to shake off her rider first on one side and then the other  pulled at the reins  and vronsky tried in vain with voice and hand to soothe her
they were just reaching the dammed up stream on their way to the starting point
several of the riders were in front and several behind  when suddenly vronsky heard the sound of a horse galloping in the mud behind him  and he was overtaken by mahotin on his white legged  lop eared gladiator
mahotin smiled  showing his long teeth  but vronsky looked angrily at him
he did not like him  and regarded him now as his most formidable rival
he was angry with him for galloping past and exciting his anna karenina 429 of 1759 mare
frou frou started into a gallop  her left foot forward  made two bounds  and fretting at the tightened reins  passed into a jolting trot  bumping her rider up and down
cord  too  scowled  and followed vronsky almost at a trot
anna karenina 430 of 1759 there were seventeen officers in all riding in this race
the race course was a large three mile ring of the form of an ellipse in front of the pavilion
on this course nine obstacles had been arranged  the stream  a big and solid barrier five feet high  just before the pavilion  a dry ditch  a ditch full of water  a precipitous slope  an irish barricade  one of the most difficult obstacles  consisting of a mound fenced with brushwood  beyond which was a ditch out of sight for the horses  so that the horse had to clear both obstacles or might be killed   then two more ditches filled with water  and one dry one  and the end of the race was just facing the pavilion
but the race began not in the ring  but two hundred yards away from it  and in that part of the course was the first obstacle  a dammed up stream  seven feet in breadth  which the racers could leap or wade through as they preferred
three times they were ranged ready to start  but each time some horse thrust itself out of line  and they had to begin again
the umpire who was starting them  colonel sestrin  was beginning to lose his temper  when at last for the fourth time he shouted  away   and the racers started
anna karenina 431 of 1759 every eye  every opera glass  was turned on the brightly colored group of riders at the moment they were in line to start
 they re off  they re starting   was heard on all sides after the hush of expectation
and little groups and solitary figures among the public began running from place to place to get a better view
in the very first minute the close group of horsemen drew out  and it could be seen that they were approaching the stream in two s and three s and one behind another
to the spectators it seemed as though they had all started simultaneously  but to the racers there were seconds of difference that had great value to them
frou frou  excited and over nervous  had lost the first moment  and several horses had started before her  but before reaching the stream  vronsky  who was holding in the mare with all his force as she tugged at the bridle  easily overtook three  and there were left in front of him mahotin s chestnut gladiator  whose hind quarters were moving lightly and rhythmically up and down exactly in front of vronsky  and in front of all  the dainty mare diana bearing kuzovlev more dead than alive
anna karenina 432 of 1759 for the first instant vronsky was not master either of himself or his mare up to the first obstacle  the stream  he could not guide the motions of his mare
gladiator and diana came up to it together and almost at the same instant  simultaneously they rose above the stream and flew across to the other side  frou frou darted after them  as if flying  but at the very moment when vronsky felt himself in the air  he suddenly saw almost under his mare s hoofs kuzovlev  who was floundering with diana on the further side of the stream  kuzovlev had let go the reins as he took the leap  and the mare had sent him flying over her head   those details vronsky learned later  at the moment all he saw was that just under him  where frou frou must alight  diana s legs or head might be in the way
but frou frou drew up her legs and back in the very act of leaping  like a falling cat  and  clearing the other mare  alighted beyond her
 o the darling   thought vronsky
after crossing the stream vronsky had complete control of his mare  and began holding her in  intending to cross the great barrier behind mahotin  and to try to overtake him in the clear ground of about five hundred yards that followed it
anna karenina 433 of 1759 the great barrier stood just in front of the imperial pavilion
the tsar and the whole court and crowds of people were all gazing at them at him  and mahotin a length ahead of him  as they drew near the  devil   as the solid barrier was called
vronsky was aware of those eyes fastened upon him from all sides  but he saw nothing except the ears and neck of his own mare  the ground racing to meet him  and the back and white legs of gladiator beating time swiftly before him  and keeping always the same distance ahead
gladiator rose  with no sound of knocking against anything
with a wave of his short tail he disappeared from vronsky s sight
 bravo   cried a voice
at the same instant  under vronsky s eyes  right before him flashed the palings of the barrier
without the slightest change in her action his mare flew over it  the palings vanished  and he heard only a crash behind him
the mare  excited by gladiator s keeping ahead  had risen too soon before the barrier  and grazed it with her hind hoofs
but her pace never changed  and vronsky  feeling a spatter of mud in his face  realized that he was once more the same distance from gladiator
once more he perceived in front of him the same back and short tail  and again the same swiftly moving white legs that got no further away
anna karenina 434 of 1759 at the very moment when vronsky thought that now was the time to overtake mahotin  frou frou herself  understanding his thoughts  without any incitement on his part  gained ground considerably  and began getting alongside of mahotin on the most favorable side  close to the inner cord
mahotin would not let her pass that side
vronsky had hardly formed the thought that he could perhaps pass on the outer side  when frou frou shifted her pace and began overtaking him on the other side
frou frou s shoulder  beginning by now to be dark with sweat  was even with gladiator s back
for a few lengths they moved evenly
but before the obstacle they were approaching  vronsky began working at the reins  anxious to avoid having to take the outer circle  and swiftly passed mahotin just upon the declivity
he caught a glimpse of his mud stained face as he flashed by
he even fancied that he smiled
vronsky passed mahotin  but he was immediately aware of him close upon him  and he never ceased hearing the even thudding hoofs and the rapid and still quite fresh breathing of gladiator
the next two obstacles  the water course and the barrier  were easily crossed  but vronsky began to hear the snorting and thud of gladiator closer upon him
he urged on his mare  and to his delight felt that she easily anna karenina 435 of 1759 quickened her pace  and the thud of gladiator s hoofs was again heard at the same distance away
vronsky was at the head of the race  just as he wanted to be and as cord had advised  and now he felt sure of being the winner
his excitement  his delight  and his tenderness for frou frou grew keener and keener
he longed to look round again  but he did not dare do this  and tried to be cool and not to urge on his mare so to keep the same reserve of force in her as he felt that gladiator still kept
there remained only one obstacle  the most difficult  if he could cross it ahead of the others he would come in first
he was flying towards the irish barricade  frou frou and he both together saw the barricade in the distance  and both the man and the mare had a moment s hesitation
he saw the uncertainty in the mare s ears and lifted the whip  but at the same time felt that his fears were groundless  the mare knew what was wanted
she quickened her pace and rose smoothly  just as he had fancied she would  and as she left the ground gave herself up to the force of her rush  which carried her far beyond the ditch  and with the same rhythm  without effort  with the same leg forward  frou frou fell back into her pace again
anna karenina 436 of 1759  bravo  vronsky   he heard shouts from a knot of men he knew they were his friends in the regiment  who were standing at the obstacle
he could not fail to recognize yashvin s voice though he did not see him
 o my sweet   he said inwardly to frou frou  as he listened for what was happening behind
 he s cleared it   he thought  catching the thud of gladiator s hoofs behind him
there remained only the last ditch  filled with water and five feet wide
vronsky did not even look at it  but anxious to get in a long way first began sawing away at the reins  lifting the mare s head and letting it go in time with her paces
he felt that the mare was at her very last reserve of strength  not her neck and shoulders merely were wet  but the sweat was standing in drops on her mane  her head  her sharp ears  and her breath came in short  sharp gasps
but he knew that she had strength left more than enough for the remaining five hundred yards
it was only from feeling himself nearer the ground and from the peculiar smoothness of his motion that vronsky knew how greatly the mare had quickened her pace she flew over the ditch as though not noticing it
she flew over it like a bird  but at the same instant vronsky  to his horror  felt that he had failed to keep up with the mare s pace  that he had  he did not know how  made a fearful  anna karenina 437 of 1759 unpardonable mistake  in recovering his seat in the saddle
all at once his position had shifted and he knew that something awful had happened
he could not yet make out what had happened  when the white legs of a chestnut horse flashed by close to him  and mahotin passed at a swift gallop
vronsky was touching the ground with one foot  and his mare was sinking on that foot
he just had time to free his leg when she fell on one side  gasping painfully  and  making vain efforts to rise with her delicate  soaking neck  she fluttered on the ground at his feet like a shot bird
the clumsy movement made by vronsky had broken her back but that he only knew much later
at that moment he knew only that mahotin had down swiftly by  while he stood staggering alone on the muddy  motionless ground  and frou frou lay gasping before him  bending her head back and gazing at him with her exquisite eyes
still unable to realize what had happened  vronsky tugged at his mare s reins
again she struggled all over like a fish  and her shoulders setting the saddle heaving  she rose on her front legs but unable to lift her back  she quivered all over and again fell on her side
with a face hideous with passion  his lower jaw trembling  and his cheeks white  vronsky kicked her with his heel in the stomach and again fell to tugging at the rein
she did not anna karenina 438 of 1759 stir  but thrusting her nose into the ground  she simply gazed at her master with her speaking eyes
 a a a   groaned vronsky  clutching at his head
 ah  what have i done   he cried
 the race lost  and my fault  shameful  unpardonable  and the poor darling  ruined mare  ah  what have i done   a crowd of men  a doctor and his assistant  the officers of his regiment  ran up to him
to his misery he felt that he was whole and unhurt
the mare had broken her back  and it was decided to shoot her
vronsky could not answer questions  could not speak to anyone
he turned  and without picking up his cap that had fallen off  walked away from the race course  not knowing where he was going
he felt utterly wretched for the first time in his life he knew the bitterest sort of misfortune  misfortune beyond remedy  and caused by his own fault
yashvin overtook him with his cap  and led him home  and half an hour later vronsky had regained his selfpossession
but the memory of that race remained for long in his heart  the cruelest and bitterest memory of his life
anna karenina 439 of 1759 the external relations of alexey alexandrovitch and his wife had remained unchanged
the sole difference lay in the fact that he was more busily occupied than ever
as in former years  at the beginning of the spring he had gone to a foreign watering place for the sake of his health  deranged by the winter s work that every year grew heavier
and just as always he returned in july and at once fell to work as usual with increased energy
as usual  too  his wife had moved for the summer to a villa out of town  while he remained in petersburg
from the date of their conversation after the party at princess tverskaya s he had never spoken again to anna of his suspicions and his jealousies  and that habitual tone of his bantering mimicry was the most convenient tone possible for his present attitude to his wife
he was a little colder to his wife
he simply seemed to be slightly displeased with her for that first midnight conversation  which she had repelled
in his attitude to her there was a shade of vexation  but nothing more
 you would not be open with me   he seemed to say  mentally addressing her   so much the worse for you
now you may beg as you please  but i won t be open anna karenina 440 of 1759 with you
so much the worse for you   he said mentally  like a man who  after vainly attempting to extinguish a fire  should fly in a rage with his vain efforts and say   oh  very well then  you shall burn for this   this man  so subtle and astute in official life  did not realize all the senselessness of such an attitude to his wife
he did not realize it  because it was too terrible to him to realize his actual position  and he shut down and locked and sealed up in his heart that secret place where lay hid his feelings towards his family  that is  his wife and son
he who had been such a careful father  had from the end of that winter become peculiarly frigid to his son  and adopted to him just the same bantering tone he used with his wife
 aha  young man   was the greeting with which he met him
alexey alexandrovitch asserted and believed that he had never in any previous year had so much official business as that year
but he was not aware that he sought work for himself that year  that this was one of the means for keeping shut that secret place where lay hid his feelings towards his wife and son and his thoughts about them  which became more terrible the longer they lay there if anyone had had the right to ask alexey alexandrovitch what he thought of his wife s behavior  the mild and peaceable alexey alexandrovitch would have made no anna karenina 441 of 1759 answer  but he would have been greatly angered with any man who should question him on that subject
for this reason there positively came into alexey alexandrovitch s face a look of haughtiness and severity whenever anyone inquired after his wife s health
alexey alexandrovitch did not want to think at all about his wife s behavior  and he actually succeeded in not thinking about it at all
alexey alexandrovitch s permanent summer villa was in peterhof  and the countess lidia ivanovna used as a rule to spend the summer there  close to anna  and constantly seeing her
that year countess lidia ivanovna declined to settle in peterhof  was not once at anna arkadyevna s  and in conversation with alexey alexandrovitch hinted at the unsuitability of anna s close intimacy with betsy and vronsky
alexey alexandrovitch sternly cut her short  roundly declaring his wife to be above suspicion  and from that time began to avoid countess lidia ivanovna
he did not want to see  and did not see  that many people in society cast dubious glances on his wife  he did not want to understand  and did not understand  why his wife had so particularly insisted on staying at tsarskoe  where betsy was staying  and not far from the camp of vronsky s regiment
he did not allow himself to think about it  and he did not think about it  anna karenina 442 of 1759 but all the same though he never admitted it to himself  and had no proofs  not even suspicious evidence  in the bottom of his heart he knew beyond all doubt that he was a deceived husband  and he was profoundly miserable about it how often during those eight years of happy life with his wife alexey alexandrovitch had looked at other men s faithless wives and other deceived husbands and asked himself   how can people descend to that  how is it they don t put an end to such a hideous position   but now  when the misfortune had come upon himself  he was so far from thinking of putting an end to the position that he would not recognize it at all  would not recognize it just because it was too awful  too unnatural since his return from abroad alexey alexandrovitch had twice been at their country villa
once he dined there  another time he spent the evening there with a party of friends  but he had not once stayed the night there  as it had been his habit to do in previous years
the day of the races had been a very busy day for alexey alexandrovitch  but when mentally sketching out the day in the morning  he made up his mind to go to their country house to see his wife immediately after dinner  and from there to the races  which all the court anna karenina 443 of 1759 were to witness  and at which he was bound to be present he was going to see his wife  because he had determined to see her once a week to keep up appearances
and besides  on that day  as it was the fifteenth  he had to give his wife some money for her expenses  according to their usual arrangement
with his habitual control over his thoughts  though he thought all this about his wife  he did not let his thoughts stray further in regard to her
that morning was a very full one for alexey alexandrovitch
the evening before  countess lidia ivanovna had sent him a pamphlet by a celebrated traveler in china  who was staying in petersburg  and with it she enclosed a note begging him to see the traveler himself  as he was an extremely interesting person from various points of view  and likely to be useful alexey alexandrovitch had not had time to read the pamphlet through in the evening  and finished it in the morning
then people began arriving with petitions  and there came the reports  interviews  appointments  dismissals  apportionment of rewards  pensions  grants  notes  the workaday round  as alexey alexandrovitch called it  that always took up so much time
then there was private business of his own  a visit from the doctor and the steward who managed his anna karenina 444 of 1759 property
the steward did not take up much time
he simply gave alexey alexandrovitch the money he needed together with a brief statement of the position of his affairs  which was not altogether satisfactory  as it had happened that during that year  owing to increased expenses  more had been paid out than usual  and there was a deficit
but the doctor  a celebrated petersburg doctor  who was an intimate acquaintance of alexey alexandrovitch  took up a great deal of time
alexey alexandrovitch had not expected him that day  and was surprised at his visit  and still more so when the doctor questioned him very carefully about his health  listened to his breathing  and tapped at his liver
alexey alexandrovitch did not know that his friend lidia ivanovna  noticing that he was not as well as usual that year  had begged the doctor to go and examine him
 do this for my sake   the countess lidia ivanovna had said to him
 i will do it for the sake of russia  countess   replied the doctor
 a priceless man   said the countess lidia ivanovna
the doctor was extremely dissatisfied with alexey alexandrovitch
he found the liver considerably enlarged  and the digestive powers weakened  while the course of anna karenina 445 of 1759 mineral waters had been quite without effect
he prescribed more physical exercise as far as possible  and as far as possible less mental strain  and above all no worry  in other words  just what was as much out of alexey alexandrovitch s power as abstaining from breathing
then he withdrew  leaving in alexey alexandrovitch an unpleasant sense that something was wrong with him  and that there was no chance of curing it
as he was coming away  the doctor chanced to meet on the staircase an acquaintance of his  sludin  who was secretary of alexey alexandrovitch s department
they had been comrades at the university  and though they rarely met  they thought highly of each other and were excellent friends  and so there was no one to whom the doctor would have given his opinion of a patient so freely as to sludin  how glad i am you ve been seeing him   said sludin
 he s not well  and i fancy   
well  what do you think of him    i ll tell you   said the doctor  beckoning over sludin s head to his coachman to bring the carriage round
 it s just this   said the doctor  taking a finger of his kid glove in his white hands and pulling it   if you don t strain the strings  and then try to break them  you ll find it a difficult job  anna karenina 446 of 1759 but strain a string to its very utmost  and the mere weight of one finger on the strained string will snap it
and with his close assiduity  his conscientious devotion to his work  he s strained to the utmost  and there s some outside burden weighing on him  and not a light one   concluded the doctor  raising his eyebrows significantly
 will you be at the races   he added  as he sank into his seat in the carriage
 yes  yes  to be sure  it does waste a lot of time   the doctor responded vaguely to some reply of sludin s he had not caught
directly after the doctor  who had taken up so much time  came the celebrated traveler  and alexey alexandrovitch  by means of the pamphlet he had only just finished reading and his previous acquaintance with the subject  impressed the traveler by the depth of his knowledge of the subject and the breadth and enlightenment of his view of it
at the same time as the traveler there was announced a provincial marshal of nobility on a visit to petersburg  with whom alexey alexandrovitch had to have some conversation
after his departure  he had to finish the daily routine of business with his secretary  and then he still had to drive round to call on a certain great personage on a anna karenina 447 of 1759 matter of grave and serious import
alexey alexandrovitch only just managed to be back by five o clock  his dinnerhour  and after dining with his secretary  he invited him to drive with him to his country villa and to the races
though he did not acknowledge it to himself  alexey alexandrovitch always tried nowadays to secure the presence of a third person in his interviews with his wife anna karenina 448 of 1759 anna was upstairs  standing before the looking glass  and  with annushka s assistance  pinning the last ribbon on her gown when she heard carriage wheels crunching the gravel at the entrance
 it s too early for betsy   she thought  and glancing out of the window she caught sight of the carriage and the black hat of alexey alexandrovitch  and the ears that she knew so well sticking up each side of it
 how unlucky  can he be going to stay the night   she wondered  and the thought of all that might come of such a chance struck her as so awful and terrible that  without dwelling on it for a moment  she went down to meet him with a bright and radiant face  and conscious of the presence of that spirit of falsehood and deceit in herself that she had come to know of late  she abandoned herself to that spirit and began talking  hardly knowing what she was saying
 ah  how nice of you   she said  giving her husband her hand  and greeting sludin  who was like one of the family  with a smile
 you re staying the night  i hope   was the first word the spirit of falsehood prompted her to utter  anna karenina 449 of 1759  and now we ll go together
only it s a pity i ve promised betsy
she s coming for me   alexey alexandrovitch knit his brows at betsy s name
 oh  i m not going to separate the inseparables   he said in his usual bantering tone
 i m going with mihail vassilievitch
i m ordered exercise by the doctors too
i ll walk  and fancy myself at the springs again    there s no hurry   said anna
 would you like tea   she rang
 bring in tea  and tell seryozha that alexey alexandrovitch is here
well  tell me  how have you been  mihail vassilievitch  you ve not been to see me before
look how lovely it is out on the terrace   she said  turning first to one and then to the other
she spoke very simply and naturally  but too much and too fast
she was the more aware of this from noticing in the inquisitive look mihail vassilievitch turned on her that he was  as it were  keeping watch on her
mihail vassilievitch promptly went out on the terrace
she sat down beside her husband
 you don t look quite well   she said
 yes   he said   the doctor s been with me today and wasted an hour of my time
i feel that some one of our anna karenina 450 of 1759 friends must have sent him  my health s so precious  it seems    no  what did he say   she questioned him about his health and what he had been doing  and tried to persuade him to take a rest and come out to her all this she said brightly  rapidly  and with a peculiar brilliance in her eyes
but alexey alexandrovitch did not now attach any special significance to this tone of hers
he heard only her words and gave them only the direct sense they bore
and he answered simply  though jestingly
there was nothing remarkable in all this conversation  but never after could anna recall this brief scene without an agonizing pang of shame
seryozha came in preceded by his governess
if alexey alexandrovitch had allowed himself to observe he would have noticed the timid and bewildered eyes with which seryozha glanced first at his father and then at his mother but he would not see anything  and he did not see it
 ah  the young man  he s grown
really  he s getting quite a man
how are you  young man   and he gave his hand to the scared child
seryozha had been shy of his father before  and now  ever since alexey alexandrovitch had taken to calling him young man  and anna karenina 451 of 1759 since that insoluble question had occurred to him whether vronsky were a friend or a foe  he avoided his father
he looked round towards his mother as though seeking shelter
it was only with his mother that he was at ease
meanwhile  alexey alexandrovitch was holding his son by the shoulder while he was speaking to the governess  and seryozha was so miserably uncomfortable that anna saw he was on the point of tears
anna  who had flushed a little the instant her son came in  noticing that seryozha was uncomfortable  got up hurriedly  took alexey alexandrovitch s hand from her son s shoulder  and kissing the boy  led him out onto the terrace  and quickly came back
 it s time to start  though   said she  glancing at her watch
 how is it betsy doesn t come      yes   said alexey alexandrovitch  and getting up  he folded his hands and cracked his fingers
 i ve come to bring you some money  too  for nightingales  we know  can t live on fairy tales   he said
 you want it  i expect    no  i don t   yes  i do   she said  not looking at him  and crimsoning to the roots of her hair  but you ll come back here after the races  i suppose    oh  yes   answered alexey alexandrovitch
 and here s the glory of peterhof  princess tverskaya   he anna karenina 452 of 1759 added  looking out of the window at the elegant english carriage with the tiny seats placed extremely high
 what elegance  charming  well  let us be starting too  then   princess tverskaya did not get out of her carriage  but her groom  in high boots  a cape  and block hat  darted out at the entrance
 i m going  good bye   said anna  and kissing her son  she went up to alexey alexandrovitch and held out her hand to him
 it was ever so nice of you to come   alexey alexandrovitch kissed her hand
 well  au revoir  then  you ll come back for some tea  that s delightful   she said  and went out  gay and radiant
but as soon as she no longer saw him  she was aware of the spot on her hand that his lips had touched  and she shuddered with repulsion
