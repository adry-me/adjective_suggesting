after prince andrew s engagement to natasha  pierre without any apparent cause suddenly felt it impossible to go on living as before
firmly convinced as he was of the truths revealed to him by his benefactor  and happy as he had been in perfecting his inner man  to which he had devoted himself with such ardor all the zest of such a life vanished after the engagement of andrew and natasha and the death of joseph alexeevich  the news of which reached him almost at the same time only the skeleton of life remained  his house  a brilliant wife who now enjoyed the favors of a very important personage  acquaintance with all petersburg  and his court service with its dull formalities
and this life suddenly seemed to pierre unexpectedly loathsome
he ceased keeping a diary  avoided the company of the brothers  began going to the club again  drank a great deal  and came once more in touch with the bachelor sets  leading such a life that the countess helene thought it necessary to speak severely to him about it
pierre felt that she was right  and to avoid compromising her went away to moscow
in moscow as soon as he entered his huge house in which the faded and fading princesses still lived  with its enormous retinue  as soon as  driving through the town  he saw the iberian shrine with innumerable tapers burning before the golden covers of the icons  the kremlin square with its snow undisturbed by vehicles  the sleigh drivers and hovels of the sivtsev vrazhok  those old moscovites who desired nothing  hurried nowhere  and were ending their days leisurely  when he saw those old moscow ladies  the moscow balls  and the english club  he felt himself at home in a quiet haven in moscow he felt at peace  at home  warm and dirty as in an old dressing gown
moscow society  from the old women down to the children  received pierre like a long expected guest whose place was always ready awaiting him
for moscow society pierre was the nicest  kindest  most intellectual  merriest  and most magnanimous of cranks  a heedless  genial nobleman of the old russian type
his purse was always empty because it was open to everyone
benefit performances  poor pictures  statues  benevolent societies  gypsy  no one and nothing met with a refusal from him  and had it not been for two friends who had borrowed large sums from him and taken him under their protection  he would have given everything away there was never a dinner or soiree at the club without him
as soon as he sank into his place on the sofa after two bottles of margaux he was surrounded  and talking  disputing  and joking began
when there were quarrels  his kindly smile and well timed jests reconciled the antagonists
the masonic dinners were dull and dreary when he was not there
when after a bachelor supper he rose with his amiable and kindly smile  yielding to the entreaties of the festive company to drive off somewhere with them  shouts of delight and triumph arose among the young men
at balls he danced if a partner was needed
young ladies  married and unmarried  liked him because without making love to any of them  he was equally amiable to all  especially after supper
 il est charmant  il n a pas de sexe     they said of him
   he is charming  he has no sex   pierre was one of those retired gentlemen in waiting of whom there were hundreds good humoredly ending their days in moscow
how horrified he would have been seven years before  when he first arrived from abroad  had he been told that there was no need for him to seek or plan anything  that his rut had long been shaped  eternally predetermined  and that wriggle as he might  he would be what all in his position were
he could not have believed it  had he not at one time longed with all his heart to establish a republic in russia  then himself to be a napoleon  then to be a philosopher  and then a strategist and the conqueror of napoleon  had he not seen the possibility of  and passionately desired  the regeneration of the sinful human race  and his own progress to the highest degree of perfection  had he not established schools and hospitals and liberated his serfs  but instead of all that here he was  the wealthy husband of an unfaithful wife  a retired gentleman in waiting  fond of eating and drinking and  as he unbuttoned his waistcoat  of abusing the government a bit  a member of the moscow english club  and a universal favorite in moscow society for a long time he could not reconcile himself to the idea that he was one of those same retired moscow gentlemen in waiting he had so despised seven years before sometimes he consoled himself with the thought that he was only living this life temporarily  but then he was shocked by the thought of how many  like himself  had entered that life and that club temporarily  with all their teeth and hair  and had only left it when not a single tooth or hair remained in moments of pride  when he thought of his position it seemed to him that he was quite different and distinct from those other retired gentlemen in waiting he had formerly despised  they were empty  stupid  contented fellows  satisfied with their position   while i am still discontented and want to do something for mankind
but perhaps all these comrades of mine struggled just like me and sought something new  a path in life of their own  and like me were brought by force of circumstances  society  and race by that elemental force against which man is powerless to the condition i am in   said he to himself in moments of humility  and after living some time in moscow he no longer despised  but began to grow fond of  to respect  and to pity his comrades in destiny  as he pitied himself pierre no longer suffered moments of despair  hypochondria  and disgust with life  but the malady that had formerly found expression in such acute attacks was driven inwards and never left him for a moment  what for  why  what is going on in the world   he would ask himself in perplexity several times a day  involuntarily beginning to reflect anew on the meaning of the phenomena of life  but knowing by experience that there were no answers to these hurried off to the club or to apollon nikolaevich s  to exchange the gossip of the town  helene  who has never cared for anything but her own body and is one of the stupidest women in the world   thought pierre   is regarded by people as the acme of intelligence and refinement  and they pay homage to her
napoleon bonaparte was despised by all as long as he was great  but now that he has become a wretched comedian the emperor francis wants to offer him his daughter in an illegal marriage the spaniards  through the catholic clergy  offer praise to god for their victory over the french on the fourteenth of june  and the french  also through the catholic clergy  offer praise because on that same fourteenth of june they defeated the spaniards
my brother masons swear by the blood that they are ready to sacrifice everything for their neighbor  but they do not give a ruble each to the collections for the poor  and they intrigue  the astraea lodge against the manna seekers  and fuss about an authentic scotch carpet and a charter that nobody needs  and the meaning of which the very man who wrote it does not understand
we all profess the christian law of forgiveness of injuries and love of our neighbors  the law in honor of which we have built in moscow forty times forty churches but yesterday a deserter was knouted to death and a minister of that same law of love and forgiveness  a priest  gave the soldier a cross to kiss before his execution   so thought pierre  and the whole of this general deception which everyone accepts  accustomed as he was to it  astonished him each time as if it were something new
 i understand the deception and confusion   he thought   but how am i to tell them all that i see  i have tried  and have always found that they too in the depths of their souls understand it as i do  and only try not to see it
so it appears that it must be so  but i what is to become of me   thought he
he had the unfortunate capacity many men  especially russians  have of seeing and believing in the possibility of goodness and truth  but of seeing the evil and falsehood of life too clearly to be able to take a serious part in it
every sphere of work was connected  in his eyes  with evil and deception
whatever he tried to be  whatever he engaged in  the evil and falsehood of it repulsed him and blocked every path of activity
yet he had to live and to find occupation
it was too dreadful to be under the burden of these insoluble problems  so he abandoned himself to any distraction in order to forget them he frequented every kind of society  drank much  bought pictures  engaged in building  and above all read
he read  and read everything that came to hand
on coming home  while his from reading he passed to sleeping  from sleeping to gossip in drawing rooms of the club  from gossip to carousals and women  from carousals back to gossip  reading  and wine drinking became more and more a physical and also a moral necessity
though the doctors warned him that with his corpulence wine was dangerous for him  he drank a great deal
he was only quite at ease when having poured several glasses of wine mechanically into his large mouth he felt a pleasant warmth in his body  an amiability toward all his fellows  and a readiness to respond superficially to every idea without probing it deeply
only after emptying a bottle or two did he feel dimly that the terribly tangled skein of life which previously had terrified him was not as dreadful as he had thought
he was always conscious of some aspect of that skein  as with a buzzing in his head after dinner or supper he chatted or listened to conversation or read
but under the influence of wine he said to himself   it doesn t matter i ll get it unraveled
i have a solution ready  but have no time now i ll think it all out later on   but the later on never came
in the morning  on an empty stomach  all the old questions appeared as anyone came to see him he was glad
sometimes he remembered how he had heard that soldiers in war when entrenched under the enemy s fire  if they have nothing to do  try hard to find some occupation the more easily to bear the danger
to pierre all men seemed like those soldiers  seeking refuge from life  some in ambition  some in cards  some in framing laws  some in women  some in toys  some in horses  some in politics  some in sport  some in wine  and some in governmental affairs
 nothing is trivial  and nothing is important  it s all the same only to save oneself from it as best one can   thought pierre
 only not to see it  that dreadful it   at the beginning of winter prince nicholas bolkonski and his daughter moved to moscow
at that time enthusiasm for the emperor alexander s regime had weakened and a patriotic and anti french tendency prevailed there  and this  together with his past and his intellect and his originality  at once made prince nicholas bolkonski an object of particular respect to the moscovites and the center of the moscow opposition to the government
the prince had aged very much that year
he showed marked signs of senility by a tendency to fall asleep  forgetfulness of quite recent events  remembrance of remote ones  and the childish vanity with which he accepted the role of head of the moscow opposition
in spite of this the old man inspired in all his visitors alike a feeling of respectful veneration especially of an evening when he came in to tea in his old fashioned coat and powdered wig and  aroused by anyone  told his abrupt stories of the past  or uttered yet more abrupt and scathing criticisms of the present for them all  that old fashioned house with its gigantic mirrors  pre revolution furniture  powdered footmen  and the stern shrewd old man  himself a relic of the past century  with his gentle daughter and the pretty frenchwoman who were reverently devoted to him presented a majestic and agreeable spectacle but the visitors did not reflect that besides the couple of hours during which they saw their host  there were also twenty two hours in the day during which the private and intimate life of the house continued
latterly that private life had become very trying for princess mary
there in moscow she was deprived of her greatest pleasures talks with the pilgrims and the solitude which refreshed her at bald hills and she had none of the advantages and pleasures of city life she did not go out into society  everyone knew that her father would not let her go anywhere without him  and his failing health prevented his going out himself  so that she was not invited to dinners and evening parties she had quite abandoned the hope of getting married
she saw the coldness and malevolence with which the old prince received and dismissed the young men  possible suitors  who sometimes appeared at their house
she had no friends  during this visit to moscow she had been disappointed in the two who had been nearest to her
mademoiselle bourienne  with whom she had never been able to be quite frank  had now become unpleasant to her  and for various reasons princess mary avoided her
julie  with whom she had corresponded for the last five years  was in moscow  but proved to be quite alien to her when they met
just then julie  who by the death of her brothers had become one of the richest heiresses in moscow  was in the full whirl of society pleasures
she was surrounded by young men who  she fancied  had suddenly learned to appreciate her worth
julie was at that stage in the life of a society woman when she feels that her last chance of marrying has come and that her fate must be decided now or never
on thursdays princess mary remembered with a mournful smile that she now had no one to write to  since julie whose presence gave her no pleasure was here and they met every week
like the old emigre who declined to marry the lady with whom he had spent his evenings for years  she regretted julie s presence and having no one to write to
in moscow princess mary had no one to talk to  no one to whom to confide her sorrow  and much sorrow fell to her lot just then
the time for prince andrew s return and marriage was approaching  but his request to her to prepare his father for it had not been carried out  in fact  it seemed as if matters were quite hopeless  for at every mention of the young countess rostova the old prince  who apart from that was usually in a bad temper  lost control of himself another lately added sorrow arose from the lessons she gave her six year old nephew
to her consternation she detected in herself in relation to little nicholas some symptoms of her father s irritability however often she told herself that she must not get irritable when teaching her nephew  almost every time that  pointer in hand  she sat down to show him the french alphabet  she so longed to pour her own knowledge quickly and easily into the child who was already afraid that auntie might at any moment get angry that at his slightest inattention she trembled  became flustered and heated  raised her voice  and sometimes pulled him by the arm and put him in the corner
having put him in the corner she would herself begin to cry over her cruel  evil nature  and little nicholas  following her example  would sob  and without permission would leave his corner  come to her  pull her wet hands from her face  and comfort her
but what distressed the princess most of all was her father s irritability  which was always directed against her and had of late amounted to cruelty
had he forced her to prostrate herself to the ground all night  had he beaten her or made her fetch wood or water  it would never have entered her mind to think her position hard  but this loving despot the more cruel because he loved her and for that reason tormented himself and her knew how not merely to hurt and humiliate her deliberately  but to show her that she was always to blame for everything of late he had exhibited a new trait that tormented princess mary more than anything else  this was his ever increasing intimacy with mademoiselle bourienne the idea that at the first moment of receiving the news of his son s intentions had occurred to him in jest that if andrew got married he himself would marry bourienne had evidently pleased him  and latterly he had persistently  and as it seemed to princess mary merely to offend her  shown special endearments to the companion and expressed his dissatisfaction with his daughter by demonstrations of love of bourienne one day in moscow in princess mary s presence  she thought her father did it purposely when she was there  the old prince kissed mademoiselle bourienne s hand and  drawing her to him  embraced her affectionately
princess mary flushed and ran out of the room
a few minutes later mademoiselle bourienne came into princess mary s room smiling and making cheerful remarks in her agreeable voice
princess mary hastily wiped away her tears  went resolutely up to mademoiselle bourienne  and evidently unconscious of what she was doing began shouting in angry haste at the frenchwoman  her voice breaking   it s horrible  vile  inhuman  to take advantage of the weakness     she did not finish
 leave my room   she exclaimed  and burst into sobs
next day the prince did not say a word to his daughter  but she noticed that at dinner he gave orders that mademoiselle bourienne should be served first
after dinner  when the footman handed coffee and from habit began with the princess  the prince suddenly grew furious  threw his stick at philip  and instantly gave instructions to have him conscripted for the army
 he doesn t obey  
i said it twice  
and he doesn t obey  she is the first person in this house  she s my best friend   cried the prince
 and if you allow yourself   he screamed in a fury  addressing princess mary for the first time   to forget yourself again before her as you dared to do yesterday  i will show you who is master in this house
go  don t let me set eyes on you  beg her pardon   princess mary asked mademoiselle bourienne s pardon  and also her father s pardon for herself and for philip the footman  who had begged for her intervention
at such moments something like a pride of sacrifice gathered in her soul
and suddenly that father whom she had judged would look for his spectacles in her presence  fumbling near them and not seeing them  or would forget something that had just occurred  or take a false step with his failing legs and turn to see if anyone had noticed his feebleness  or  worst of all  at dinner when there were no visitors to excite him would suddenly fall asleep  letting his napkin drop and his shaking head sink over his plate
 he is old and feeble  and i dare to condemn him   she thought at such moments  with a feeling of revulsion against herself
in 1811 there was living in moscow a french doctor metivier who had rapidly become the fashion
he was enormously tall  handsome  amiable as frenchmen are  and was  as all moscow said  an extraordinarily clever doctor
he was received in the best houses not merely as a doctor  but as an equal
prince nicholas had always ridiculed medicine  but latterly on mademoiselle bourienne s advice had allowed this doctor to visit him and had grown accustomed to him
metivier came to see the prince about twice a week
on december 6 st
nicholas  day and the prince s name day all moscow came to the prince s front door but he gave orders to admit no one and to invite to dinner only a small number  a list of whom he gave to princess mary
metivier  who came in the morning with his felicitations  considered it proper in his quality of doctor de forcer la consigne    as he told princess mary  and went in to see the prince
it happened that on that morning of his name day the prince was in one of his worst moods
he had been going about the house all the morning finding fault with everyone and pretending not to understand what was said to him and not to be understood himself princess mary well knew this mood of quiet absorbed querulousness  which generally culminated in a burst of rage  and she went about all that morning as though facing a cocked and loaded gun and awaited the inevitable explosion
until the doctor s arrival the morning had passed off safely
after admitting the doctor  princess she could hear all that passed in the study
  to force the guard
at first she heard only metivier s voice  then her father s  then both voices began speaking at the same time  the door was flung open  and on the threshold appeared the handsome figure of the terrified metivier with his shock of black hair  and the prince in his dressing gown and fez  his face distorted with fury and the pupils of his eyes rolled downwards
 you don t understand   shouted the prince   but i do  french spy  slave of buonaparte  spy  get out of my house  be off  i tell you     metivier  shrugging his shoulders  went up to mademoiselle bourienne who at the sound of shouting had run in from an adjoining room
 the prince is not very well  bile and rush of blood to the head
keep calm  i will call again tomorrow   said metivier  and putting his fingers to his lips he hastened away
through the study door came the sound of slippered feet and the cry   spies  traitors  traitors everywhere  not a moment s peace in my own house   after metivier s departure the old prince called his daughter in  and the whole weight of his wrath fell on her
she was to blame that a spy had been admitted
had he not told her  yes  told her to make a list  and not to admit anyone who was not on that list  then why was that scoundrel admitted  she was the cause of it all
with her  he said  he could not have a moment s peace and could not die quietly
 no  ma am  we must part  we must part  understand that  understand it  i cannot endure any more   he said  and left the room
then  as if afraid she might find some means of consolation  he returned and trying to appear calm added   and don t imagine i have said this in a moment of anger
i am calm
i have thought it over  and it will be carried out we must part  so find some place for yourself      but he could not restrain himself and with the virulence of which only one who loves is capable  evidently suffering himself  he shook his fists at her and screamed   if only some fool would marry her   then he slammed the door  sent for mademoiselle bourienne  and subsided into his study at two o clock the six chosen guests assembled for dinner
these guests the famous count rostopchin  prince lopukhin with his nephew  general chatrov an old war comrade of the prince s  and of the younger generation pierre and boris drubetskoy awaited the prince in the drawing room boris  who had come to moscow on leave a few days before  had been anxious to be presented to prince nicholas bolkonski  and had contrived to ingratiate himself so well that the old prince in his case made an exception to the rule of not receiving bachelors in his house the prince s house did not belong to what is known as fashionable society  but his little circle though not much talked about in town was one it was more flattering to be received in than any other
boris had realized this the week before when the commander in chief in his presence invited rostopchin to dinner on st
nicholas  day  and rostopchin had replied that he could not come   on that day i always go to pay my devotions to the relics of prince nicholas bolkonski    oh  yes  yes   replied the commander in chief
 how is he      the small group that assembled before dinner in the lofty old fashioned drawing room with its old furniture resembled the solemn gathering of a court of justice
all were silent or talked in low tones
prince nicholas came in serious and taciturn
princess mary seemed even quieter and more diffident than usual
the guests were reluctant to address her  feeling that she was in no mood for their conversation
count rostopchin alone kept the conversation going  now relating the latest town news  and now the latest political gossip
lopukhin and the old general occasionally took part in the conversation
prince bolkonski listened as a presiding judge receives a report  only now and then  silently or by a brief word  showing that he took heed of what was being reported to him
the tone of the conversation was such as indicated that no one approved of what was being done in the political world
incidents were related evidently confirming the opinion that everything was going from bad to worse  but whether telling a story or giving an opinion the speaker always stopped  or was stopped  at the point beyond which his criticism might touch the sovereign himself at dinner the talk turned on the latest political news  napoleon s seizure of the duke of oldenburg s territory  and the russian note  hostile to napoleon  which had been sent to all the european courts
 bonaparte treats europe as a pirate does a captured vessel   said count rostopchin  repeating a phrase he had uttered several times before
 one only wonders at the long suffering or blindness of the crowned heads
now the pope s turn has come and bonaparte doesn t scruple to depose the head of the catholic church yet all keep silent  our sovereign alone has protested against the seizure of the duke of oldenburg s territory  and even     count rostopchin paused  feeling that he had reached the limit beyond which censure was impossible
 other territories have been offered in exchange for the duchy of oldenburg   said prince bolkonski
 he shifts the dukes about as i might move my serfs from bald hills to bogucharovo or my ryazan estates    the duke of oldenburg bears his misfortunes with admirable strength of character and resignation   remarked boris  joining in respectfully
he said this because on his journey from petersburg he had had the honor of being presented to the duke
prince bolkonski glanced at the young man as if about to say something in reply  but changed his mind  evidently considering him too young
 i have read our protests about the oldenburg affair and was surprised how badly the note was worded   remarked count rostopchin in the casual tone of a man dealing with a subject quite familiar to him
pierre looked at rostopchin with naive astonishment  not understanding why he should be disturbed by the bad composition of the note
 does it matter  count  how the note is worded   he asked   so long as its substance is forcible    my dear fellow  with our five hundred thousand troops it should be easy to have a good style   returned count rostopchin
pierre now understood the count s dissatisfaction with the wording of the note
 one would have thought quill drivers enough had sprung up   remarked the old prince
 there in petersburg they are always writing not notes only but even new laws
my andrew there has written a whole volume of laws for russia
nowadays they are always writing   and he laughed unnaturally
there was a momentary pause in the conversation  the old general cleared his throat to draw attention
 did you hear of the last event at the review in petersburg  the figure cut by the new french ambassador    eh  yes  i heard something  he said something awkward in his majesty s presence    his majesty drew attention to the grenadier division and to the march past   continued the general   and it seems the ambassador took no notice and allowed himself to reply that   we in france pay no attention to such trifles   the emperor did not condescend to reply at the next review  they say  the emperor did not once deign to address him   all were silent
on this fact relating to the emperor personally  it was impossible to pass any judgment
 impudent fellows   said the prince
 you know metivier  i turned him out of my house this morning
he was here  they admitted him in spite of my request that they should let no one in   he went on  glancing angrily at his daughter
and he narrated his whole conversation with the french doctor and the reasons that convinced him that metivier was a spy
though these reasons were very insufficient and obscure  no one made any rejoinder
after the roast  champagne was served
the guests rose to congratulate the old prince
princess mary  too  went round to him
he gave her a cold  angry look and offered her his wrinkled  clean shaven cheek to kiss
the whole expression of his face told her that he had not forgotten the morning s talk  that his decision remained in force  and only the presence of visitors hindered his speaking of it to her now
when they went into the drawing room where coffee was served  the old men sat together
prince nicholas grew more animated and expressed his views on the impending war
he said that our wars with bonaparte would be disastrous so long as we sought alliances with the germans and thrust ourselves into european affairs  into which we had been drawn by the peace of tilsit
 we ought not to fight either for or against austria
our political interests are all in the east  and in regard to bonaparte the only thing is to have an armed frontier and a firm policy  and he will never dare to cross the russian frontier  as was the case in 1807    how can we fight the french  prince   said count rostopchin
 can we arm ourselves against our teachers and divinities  look at our youths  look at our ladies  the french are our gods  paris is our kingdom of heaven   he began speaking louder  evidently to be heard by everyone
 french dresses  french ideas  french feelings  there now  you turned metivier out by the scruff of his neck because he is a frenchman and a scoundrel  but our ladies crawl after him on their knees
i went to a party last night  and there out of five ladies three were roman catholics and had the pope s indulgence for doing woolwork on sundays
and they themselves sit there nearly naked  like the signboards at our public baths if i may say so ah  when one looks at our young people  prince  one would like to take peter the great s old cudgel out of the museum and belabor them in the russian way till all the nonsense jumps out of them   all were silent
the old prince looked at rostopchin with a smile and wagged his head approvingly
 well  good by  your excellency  keep well   said rostopchin  getting up with characteristic briskness and holding out his hand to the prince
 good bye  my dear fellow   
his words are music  i never tire of hearing him   said the old prince  keeping hold of the hand and offering his cheek to be kissed
following rostopchin s example the others also rose
princess mary as she sat listening to the old men s talk and faultfinding  understood nothing of what she heard  she only wondered whether the guests had all observed her father s hostile attitude toward her
she did not even notice the special attentions and amiabilities shown her during dinner by boris drubetskoy  who was visiting them for the third time already
princess mary turned with absent minded questioning look to pierre  who hat in hand and with a smile on his face was the last of the guests to approach her after the old prince had gone out and they were left alone in the drawing room
 may i stay a little longer   he said  letting his stout body sink into an armchair beside her
 oh yes   she answered
 you noticed nothing   her look asked
pierre was in an agreeable after dinner mood
he looked straight before him and smiled quietly
 have you known that young man long  princess   he asked
 who    drubetskoy    no  not long      do you like him    yes  he is an agreeable young man   
why do you ask me that   said princess mary  still thinking of that morning s conversation with her father
 because i have noticed that when a young man comes on leave from petersburg to moscow it is usually with the object of marrying an heiress    you have observed that   said princess mary
 yes   returned pierre with a smile   and this young man now manages matters so that where there is a wealthy heiress there he is too
i can read him like a julie karagina
he is very attentive to her    he visits them    yes  very often
and do you know the new way of courting   said pierre with an amused smile  evidently in that cheerful mood of good humored raillery for which he so often reproached himself in his diary  no   replied princess mary
 to please moscow girls nowadays one has to be melancholy
he is very melancholy with mademoiselle karagina   said pierre
 really   asked princess mary  looking into pierre s kindly face and still thinking of her own sorrow
 it would be a relief   thought she   if i ventured to confide what i am feeling to someone
i should like to tell everything to pierre
he is kind and generous
it would be a relief
he would give me advice    would you marry him    oh  my god  count  there are moments when i would marry anybody   she cried suddenly to her own surprise and with tears in her voice
 ah  how bitter it is to love someone near to you and to feel that     she went on in a trembling voice   that you can do nothing for him but grieve him  and to know that you cannot alter this
then there is only one thing left to go away  but where could i go    what is wrong  what is it  princess   but without finishing what she was saying  princess mary burst into tears
 i don t know what is the matter with me today
don t take any notice forget what i have said   pierre s gaiety vanished completely
he anxiously questioned the princess  asked her to speak out fully and confide her grief to him  but she only repeated that she begged him to forget what she had said  that she did not remember what she had said  and that she had no trouble except the one he knew of that prince andrew s marriage threatened to cause a rupture between father and son
 have you any news of the rostovs   she asked  to change the subject
 i was told they are coming soon
i am also expecting andrew any day
i should like them to meet here    and how does he now regard the matter   asked pierre  referring to the old prince
princess mary shook her head
 what is to be done  in a few months the year will be up
the thing is impossible
i only wish i could spare my brother the first moments
i wish they would come sooner
i hope to be friends with her
you have known them a long time   said princess mary
 tell me honestly the whole truth  what sort of girl is she  and what do you think of her  the real truth  because you know andrew is risking so much doing this against his father s will that i should like to know     an undefined instinct told pierre that these explanations  and repeated requests to be told the whole truth  expressed ill will on the princess  part toward her future sister in law and a wish that he should disapprove of andrew s choice  but in reply he said what he felt rather than what he thought
 i don t know how to answer your question   he said  blushing without knowing why
 i really don t know what sort of girl she is  i can t analyze her at all
she is enchanting  but what makes her so i don t know
that is all one can say about her   princess mary sighed  and the expression on her face said   yes  that s what i expected and feared    is she clever   she asked
pierre considered
 i think not   he said   and yet yes
she does not deign to be clever   
oh no  she is simply enchanting  and that is all   princess mary again shook her head disapprovingly
 ah  i so long to like her  tell her so if you see her before i do    i hear they are expected very soon   said pierre
princess mary told pierre of her plan to become intimate with her future sister  in law as soon as the rostovs arrived and to try to accustom the old prince to her
boris had not succeeded in making a wealthy match in petersburg  so with the same object in view he came to moscow
there he wavered between the two richest heiresses  julie and princess mary
though princess mary despite her plainness seemed to him more attractive than julie  he  without knowing why  felt awkward about paying court to her
when they had last met on the old prince s name day  she had answered at random all his attempts to talk sentimentally  evidently not listening to what he was saying
julie on the contrary accepted his attentions readily  though in a manner peculiar to herself
she was twenty seven
after the death of her brothers she had become very wealthy
she was by now decidedly plain  but thought herself not merely as good looking as before but even far more attractive
she was confirmed in this delusion by the fact that she had become a very wealthy heiress and also by the fact that the older she grew the less dangerous she became to men  and the more freely they could associate with her and avail themselves of her suppers  soirees  and the animated company that assembled at her house  without incurring any obligation a man who would have been afraid ten years before of going every day to the house when there was a girl of seventeen there  for fear of compromising her and committing himself  would now go boldly every day and treat her not as a marriageable girl but as a sexless acquaintance that winter the karagins  house was the most agreeable and hospitable in moscow
in addition to the formal evening and dinner parties  a large company  chiefly of men  gathered there every day  supping at midnight and staying till three in the morning
julie never missed a ball  a promenade  or a play
her dresses were always of the latest fashion
but in spite of that she seemed to be disillusioned about everything and told everyone that she did not believe either in friendship or in love  or any of the joys of life  and expected peace only  yonder   she adopted the tone of one who has suffered a great disappointment  like a girl who has either lost the man she loved or been cruelly deceived by him
though nothing of the kind had happened to her she was regarded in that light  and had even herself come to believe that she had suffered much in life
this melancholy  which did not prevent her amusing herself  did not hinder the young people who came to her house from passing the time pleasantly
every visitor who came to the house paid his tribute to the melancholy mood of the hostess  and then amused himself with society gossip  dancing  intellectual games  and bouts rimes  which were in vogue at the karagins  only a few of these young men  among them boris  entered more deeply into julie s melancholy  and with these she had prolonged conversations in private on the vanity of all worldly things  and to them she showed her albums filled with mournful sketches  maxims  and verses to boris  julie was particularly gracious  she regretted his early disillusionment with life  offered him such consolation of friendship as she who had herself suffered so much could render  and showed him her album boris sketched two trees in the album and wrote   rustic trees  your dark branches shed gloom and melancholy upon me   on another page he drew a tomb  and wrote  la mort est secourable et la mort est tranquille ah  contre les douleurs il n y a pas d autre asile
    death gives relief and death is peaceful
ah  from suffering there is no other refuge
julie said this was charming  there is something so enchanting in the smile of melancholy   she said to ray of light in the darkness  a shade between sadness and despair  showing the possibility of consolation   in reply boris wrote these lines  aliment de poison d une ame trop sensible  toi  sans qui le bonheur me serait impossible  tendre melancholie  ah  viens me consoler  viens calmer les tourments de ma sombre retraite  et mele une douceur secrete a ces pleurs que je sens couler
   poisonous nourishment of a too sensitive soul  thou  without whom happiness would for me be impossible  tender melancholy  ah  come to console me  come to calm the torments of my gloomy retreat  and mingle a secret sweetness with these tears that i feel to be flowing
for boris  julie played most doleful nocturnes on her harp
boris read  poor liza  aloud to her  and more than once interrupted the reading because of the emotions that choked him
meeting at large gatherings julie and boris looked on one another as the only souls who understood one another in a world of indifferent people
anna mikhaylovna  who often visited the karagins  while playing cards with the mother made careful inquiries as to julie s dowry  she was to have two estates in penza and the nizhegorod forests 
anna mikhaylovna regarded the refined sadness that united her son to the wealthy julie with emotion  and resignation to the divine will
 you are always charming and melancholy  my dear julie   she said to the daughter
 boris says his soul finds repose at your house
he has suffered so many disappointments and is so sensitive   said she to the mother
 ah  my dear  i can t tell you how fond i have grown of julie latterly   she said to her son
 but who could help loving her  she is an angelic being  ah  boris  boris   she paused
 and how i pity her mother   she went on   today she showed me her accounts and letters from penza  they have enormous estates there   and she  poor thing  has no one to help her  and they do cheat her so   boris smiled almost imperceptibly while listening to his mother
he laughed blandly at her naive diplomacy but listened to what she had to say  and sometimes questioned her carefully about the penza and nizhegorod estates
julie had long been expecting a proposal from her melancholy adorer and was ready to accept it  but some secret feeling of repulsion for her  for her passionate desire to get married  for her artificiality  and a feeling of horror at renouncing the possibility of real love still restrained boris
his leave was expiring
he spent every day and whole days at the karagins   and every day on thinking the matter over told himself that he would propose tomorrow but in julie s presence  looking at her red face and chin  nearly always powdered   her moist eyes  and her expression of continual readiness to pass at once from melancholy to an unnatural rapture of married bliss  boris could not utter the decisive words  though in imagination he had long regarded himself as the possessor of those penza and nizhegorod estates and had apportioned the use of the income from them julie saw boris  indecision  and sometimes the thought occurred to her that she was repulsive to him  but her feminine self  deception immediately supplied her with consolation  and she told herself that he was only shy from love
her melancholy  however  began to turn to irritability  and not long before boris  departure she formed a definite plan of action
just as boris  leave of absence was expiring  anatole kuragin made his appearance in moscow  and of course in the karagins  drawing room  and julie  suddenly abandoning her melancholy  became cheerful and very attentive to kuragin
 my dear   said anna mikhaylovna to her son   i know from a reliable source that prince vasili has sent his son to moscow to get him married to julie
i am so fond of julie that i should be sorry for her
what do you think of it  my dear   the idea of being made a fool of and of having thrown away that whole month of arduous melancholy service to julie  and of seeing all the revenue from the penza estates which he had already mentally apportioned and put to proper use fall into the hands of another  and especially into the hands of that idiot anatole  pained boris
he drove to the karagins  with the firm intention of proposing
julie met him in a gay  careless manner  spoke casually of how she had enjoyed yesterday s ball  and asked when he was leaving
though boris had come intentionally to speak of his love and therefore meant to be tender  he began speaking irritably of feminine inconstancy  of how easily women can turn from sadness to joy  and how their moods depend solely on who happens to be paying court to them
julie was offended and replied that it was true that a woman needs variety  and the same thing over and over again would weary anyone
 then i should advise you     boris began  wishing to sting her  but at that instant the galling thought occurred to him that he might have to leave moscow without having accomplished his aim  and have vainly wasted his efforts which was a thing he never allowed to happen
he checked himself in the middle of the sentence  lowered his eyes to avoid seeing her unpleasantly irritated and irresolute face  and said   i did not come here at all to quarrel with you on the contrary     he glanced at her to make sure that he might go on
her irritability had suddenly quite vanished  and her anxious  imploring eyes were fixed on him with greedy expectation
 i can always arrange so as not to see her often   thought boris
 the affair has been begun and must be finished   he blushed hotly  raised his eyes to hers  and said   you know my feelings for you   there was no need to say more  julie s face shone with triumph and self  satisfaction  but she forced boris to say all that is said on such occasions that he loved her and had never loved any other woman more than her
she knew that for the penza estates and nizhegorod forests she could demand this  and she received what she demanded
the affianced couple  no longer alluding to trees that shed gloom and melancholy upon them  planned the arrangements of a splendid house in petersburg  paid calls  and prepared everything for a brilliant wedding
at the end of january old count rostov went to moscow with natasha and sonya
the countess was still unwell and unable to travel but it was impossible to wait for her recovery
prince andrew was expected in moscow any day  the trousseau had to be ordered and the estate near moscow had to be sold  besides which the opportunity of presenting his future daughter in law to old prince bolkonski while he was in moscow could not be missed
the rostovs  moscow house had not been heated that winter and  as they had come only for a short time and the countess was not with them  the count decided to stay with marya dmitrievna akhrosimova  who had long been pressing her hospitality on them
late one evening the rostovs  four sleighs drove into marya dmitrievna s courtyard in the old konyusheny street
marya dmitrievna lived alone
she had already married off her daughter  and her sons were all in the service
she held herself as erect  told everyone her opinion as candidly  loudly  and bluntly as ever  and her whole bearing seemed a reproach to others for any weakness  passion  or temptation the possibility of which she did not admit
from early in the morning  wearing a dressing jacket  she attended to her household affairs  and then she drove out  on holy days to church and after the service to jails and prisons on affairs of which she never spoke to anyone
on ordinary days  after dressing  she received petitioners of various classes  of whom there were always some
then she had dinner  a substantial and appetizing meal at which there were always three or four guests  after dinner she played a game of boston  and at night she had the newspapers or a new to pay visits  and then only to the most important persons in the town
she had not yet gone to bed when the rostovs arrived and the pulley of the hall door squeaked from the cold as it let in the rostovs and their servants
marya dmitrievna  with her spectacles hanging down on her nose and her head flung back  stood in the hall doorway looking with a stern  grim face at the new arrivals
one might have thought she was angry with the travelers and would immediately turn them out  had she not at the same time been giving careful instructions to the servants for the accommodation of the visitors and their belongings
 the count s things  bring them here   she said  pointing to the portmanteaus and not greeting anyone
 the young ladies   there to the left
now what are you dawdling for   she cried to the maids
 get the samovar ready   
you ve grown plumper and prettier   she remarked  drawing natasha  whose cheeks were glowing from the cold  to her by the hood
 foo  you are cold  now take off your things  quick   she shouted to the count who was going to kiss her hand
 you re half frozen  i m sure  bring some rum for tea   
bonjour  sonya dear   she added  turning to sonya and indicating by this french greeting her slightly contemptuous though affectionate attitude toward her
when they came in to tea  having taken off their outdoor things and tidied themselves up after their journey  marya dmitrievna kissed them all in due order  i m heartily glad you have come and are staying with me
it was high time   she said  giving natasha a significant look
 the old man is here and his son s expected any day
you ll have to make his acquaintance
but we ll speak of that later on   she added  glancing at sonya with a look that showed she did not want to speak of it in her presence
 now listen   she said to the count
 what do you want tomorrow  whom will you send for  shinshin   she crooked one of her fingers
 the sniveling anna mikhaylovna  that s two
she s here with her son
the son is getting married  then bezukhov  eh  he is here too  with his wife
he ran away from her and she came galloping after him
he dined with me on wednesday
as for them  and she pointed to the girls  tomorrow i ll take them first to the iberian shrine of the mother of god  and then we ll drive to the super rogue s
i suppose you ll have everything new
don t judge by me  sleeves nowadays are this size  the other day young princess irina vasilevna came to see me  she was an awful sight  looked as if she had put two barrels on her arms you know not a day passes now without some new fashion   
and what have you to do yourself   she asked the count sternly
 one thing has come on top of another  her rags to buy  and now a purchaser has turned up for the moscow estate and for the house
if you will be so kind  i ll fix a time and go down to the estate just for a day  and leave my lassies with you    all right
all right
they ll be safe with me  as safe as in chancery  i ll take them where they must go  scold them a bit  and pet them a bit   said marya dmitrievna  touching her goddaughter and favorite  natasha  on the cheek with her large hand
next morning marya dmitrievna took the young ladies to the iberian shrine of the mother of god and to madame suppert roguet  who was so afraid of marya dmitrievna that she always let her have costumes at a loss merely to get rid of her
marya dmitrievna ordered almost the whole trousseau
when they got home she turned everybody out of the room except natasha  and then called her pet to her armchair
 well  now we ll talk
i congratulate you on your betrothed
you ve hooked a fine fellow  i am glad for your sake and i ve known him since he was so high   she held her hand a couple of feet from the ground
natasha blushed happily
 i like him and all his family
now listen  you know that old prince nicholas much dislikes his son s marrying
the old fellow s crotchety  of course prince andrew is not a child and can shift without him  but it s not nice to enter a family against a father s will
one wants to do it peacefully and lovingly
you re a clever girl and you ll know how to manage
be kind  and use your wits
then all will be well   natasha remained silent  from shyness marya dmitrievna supposed  but really because she disliked anyone interfering in what touched her love of prince andrew  which seemed to her so apart from all human affairs that no one could understand it
she loved and knew prince andrew  he loved her only  and was to come one of these days and take her
she wanted nothing more
 you see i have known him a long time and am also fond of mary  your future sister in law
 husbands  sisters bring up blisters   but this one wouldn t hurt a fly
she has asked me to bring you two together
tomorrow you ll go with your father to see her
be very nice and affectionate to her  you re younger than she
when he comes  he ll find you already know his sister and father and are liked by them
am i right or not  won t that be best    yes  it will   natasha answered reluctantly
next day  by marya dmitrievna s advice  count rostov took natasha to call on prince nicholas bolkonski
the count did not set out cheerfully on this visit  at heart he felt afraid
he well remembered the last interview he had had with the old prince at the time of the enrollment  when in reply to an invitation to dinner he had had to listen to an angry reprimand for not having provided his full quota of men
natasha  on the other hand  having put on her best gown  was in the highest spirits
 they can t help liking me   she thought
 everybody always has liked me  and i am so willing to do anything they wish  so ready to be fond of him for being his father and of her for being his sister that there is no reason for them not to like me     they drove up to the gloomy old house on the vozdvizhenka and entered the vestibule
 well  the lord have mercy on us   said the count  half in jest  half in earnest  but natasha noticed that her father was flurried on entering the anteroom and inquired timidly and softly whether the prince and princess were at home
when they had been announced a perturbation was noticeable among the servants
the footman who had gone to announce them was stopped by another in the large hall and they whispered to one another
then a maidservant ran into the hall and hurriedly said something  mentioning the princess
at last an old  cross looking footman came and announced to the rostovs that the prince was not receiving  but that the princess begged them to walk up
the first person who came to meet the visitors was mademoiselle bourienne
she greeted the father and daughter with special politeness and showed them to the princess  room
the princess  looking excited and nervous  her face flushed in patches  ran in to meet the visitors  treading heavily  and vainly trying to appear cordial and at ease
from the first glance princess mary did not like natasha
she thought her too fashionably dressed  frivolously gay and vain
she did not at all realize that before having seen her future sister in  law she was prejudiced against her by involuntary envy of her beauty  youth  and happiness  as well as by jealousy of her brother s love for her
apart from this insuperable antipathy to her  princess mary was agitated just then because on the rostovs  being announced  the old prince had shouted that he did not wish to see them  that princess mary might do so if she chose  but they were not to be admitted to him
she had decided to receive them  but feared lest the prince might at any moment indulge in some freak  as he seemed much upset by the rostovs  visit
 there  my dear princess  i ve brought you my songstress   said the count  bowing and looking round uneasily as if afraid the old prince might appear
 i am so glad you should get to know one another  
very sorry the prince is still ailing   and after a few more commonplace remarks he rose
 if you ll allow me to leave my natasha in your hands for a quarter of an hour  princess  i ll drive round to see anna semenovna  it s quite near in the dogs  square  and then i ll come back for her   the count had devised this diplomatic ruse  as he afterwards told his daughter  to give the future sisters in law an opportunity to talk to one another freely  but another motive was to avoid the danger of encountering the old prince  of whom he was afraid
he did not mention this to his daughter  but natasha noticed her father s nervousness and anxiety and felt mortified by it
she blushed for him  grew still angrier at having blushed  and looked at the princess with a bold and defiant expression which said that she was not afraid of anybody
the princess told the count that she would be delighted  and only begged him to stay longer at anna semenovna s  and he departed
despite the uneasy glances thrown at her by princess mary who wished to have a tête à tête with natasha mademoiselle bourienne remained in the room and persistently talked about moscow amusements and theaters
natasha felt offended by the hesitation she had noticed in the anteroom  by her father s nervousness  and by the unnatural manner of the princess who she thought  was making a favor of receiving her  and so everything displeased her
she did not like princess mary  whom she thought very plain  affected  and dry
natasha suddenly shrank into herself and involuntarily assumed an offhand air which alienated princess mary still more
after five minutes of irksome  constrained conversation  they heard the sound of slippered feet rapidly approaching
princess mary looked frightened
the door opened and the old prince  in a dressing gown and a white nightcap  came in
 ah  madam   he began
 madam  countess  
countess rostova  if i am not mistaken  
i beg you to excuse me  to excuse me  
i did not know  madam
god is my witness  i did not know you had honored us with a visit  and i came in such a costume only to see my daughter
i beg you to excuse me  
god is my witness  i didn t know   he repeated  stressing the word  god  so unnaturally and so unpleasantly that princess mary stood with downcast eyes not daring to look either at her father or at natasha
nor did the latter  having risen and curtsied  know what to do
mademoiselle bourienne alone smiled agreeably
 i beg you to excuse me  excuse me  god is my witness  i did not know   muttered the old man  and after looking natasha over from head to foot he went out
mademoiselle bourienne was the first to recover herself after this apparition and began speaking about the prince s indisposition
natasha and princess mary looked at one another in silence  and the longer they did so without saying what they wanted to say  the greater grew their antipathy to one another
when the count returned  natasha was impolitely pleased and hastened to get away  at that moment she hated the stiff  elderly princess  who could place her in such an embarrassing position and had spent half an hour with her without once mentioning prince andrew
 i couldn t begin talking about him in the presence of that frenchwoman   thought natasha
the same thought was meanwhile tormenting princess mary
she knew what she ought to have said to natasha  but she had been unable to say it because mademoiselle bourienne was in the way  and because  without knowing why  she felt it very difficult to speak of the marriage
when the count was already leaving the room  princess mary went up hurriedly to natasha  took her by the hand  and said with a deep sigh   wait  i must     natasha glanced at her ironically without knowing why
 dear natalie   said princess mary   i want you to know that i am glad my brother has found happiness      she paused  feeling that she was not telling the truth
natasha noticed this and guessed its reason
 i think  princess  it is not convenient to speak of that now   she said with external dignity and coldness  though she felt the tears choking her
 what have i said and what have i done   thought she  as soon as she was out of the room
they waited a long time for natasha to come to dinner that day
she sat in her room crying like a child  blowing her nose and sobbing
sonya stood beside her  kissing her hair
 natasha  what is it about   she asked
 what do they matter to you  it will all pass  natasha    but if you only knew how offensive it was  
as if i      don t talk about it  natasha
it wasn t your fault so why should you mind  kiss me   said sonya
natasha raised her head and  kissing her friend on the lips  pressed her wet face against her
 i can t tell you  i don t know
no one s to blame   said natasha  it s my fault
but it all hurts terribly
oh  why doesn t he come      she came in to dinner with red eyes
marya dmitrievna  who knew how the prince had received the rostovs  pretended not to notice how upset natasha was and jested resolutely and loudly at table with the count and the other guests
that evening the rostovs went to the opera  for which marya dmitrievna had taken a box
natasha did not want to go  but could not refuse marya dmitrievna s kind offer which was intended expressly for her
when she came ready dressed into the ballroom to await her father  and looking in the large mirror there saw that she was pretty  very pretty  she felt even more sad  but it was a sweet  tender sadness
 o god  if he were here now i would not behave as i did then  but differently
i would not be silly and afraid of things  i would simply embrace him  cling to him  and make him look at me with those searching inquiring eyes with which he has so often looked at me  and then i would make him laugh as he used to laugh
and his eyes how i see those eyes   thought natasha
 and what do his father and sister matter to me  i love him alone  him  him  with that face and those eyes  with his smile  manly and yet childlike   
no  i had better not think of him  not think of him but forget him  quite forget him for the present
i can t bear this waiting and i shall cry in a minute   and she turned away from the glass  making an effort not to cry
 and how can sonya love nicholas so calmly and quietly and wait so long and so patiently   thought she  looking at sonya  who also came in quite ready  with a fan in her hand
 no  she s altogether different
i can t   natasha at that moment felt so softened and tender that it was not enough for her to love and know she was beloved  she wanted now  at once  to embrace the man she loved  to speak and hear from him words of love such as filled her heart
while she sat in the carriage beside her father  pensively watching the lights of the street lamps flickering on the frozen window  she felt still sadder and more in love  and forgot where she was going and with whom
having fallen into the line of carriages  the rostovs  carriage drove up to the theater  its wheels squeaking over the snow
natasha and sonya  holding up their dresses  jumped out quickly
the count got out helped by the footmen  and  passing among men and women who were entering and the program sellers  they all three went along the corridor to the first row of boxes
through the closed doors the music was already audible
 natasha  your hair      whispered sonya
an attendant deferentially and quickly slipped before the ladies and opened the door of their box
the music sounded louder and through the door rows of brightly lit boxes in which ladies sat with bare arms and shoulders  and noisy stalls brilliant with uniforms  glittered before their eyes a lady entering the next box shot a glance of feminine envy at natasha
the curtain had not yet risen and the overture was being played
natasha  smoothing her gown  went in with sonya and sat down  scanning the brilliant tiers of boxes opposite
a sensation she had not experienced for a long time that of hundreds of eyes looking at her bare arms and neck suddenly affected her both agreeably and disagreeably and called up a whole crowd of memories  desires and emotions associated with that feeling the two remarkably pretty girls  natasha and sonya  with count rostov who had not been seen in moscow for a long time  attracted general attention
moreover  everybody knew vaguely of natasha s engagement to prince andrew  and knew that the rostovs had lived in the country ever since  and all looked with curiosity at a fiancee who was making one of the best matches in russia
natasha s looks  as everyone told her  had improved in the country  and that evening thanks to her agitation she was particularly pretty
she struck those who saw her by her fullness of life and beauty  combined with her indifference to everything about her
her black eyes looked at the crowd without seeking anyone  and her delicate arm  bare to above the elbow  lay on the velvet edge of the box  while  evidently unconsciously  she opened and closed her hand in time to the music  crumpling her program
 look  there s alenina   said sonya   with her mother  isn t it    dear me  michael kirilovich has grown still stouter   remarked the count
 look at our anna mikhaylovna what a headdress she has on    the karagins  julie and boris with them
one can see at once that they re engaged       drubetskoy has proposed    oh yes  i heard it today   said shinshin  coming into the rostovs  box
natasha looked in the direction in which her father s eyes were turned and saw julie sitting beside her mother with a happy look on her face and a string of pearls round her thick red neck which natasha knew was covered with powder
behind them  wearing a smile and leaning over with an ear to julie s mouth  was boris  handsome smoothly brushed head
he looked at the rostovs from under his brows and said something  smiling  to his betrothed
 they are talking about us  about me and him   thought natasha
 and he no doubt is calming her jealousy of me
they needn t trouble themselves  if only they knew how little i am concerned about any of them   behind them sat anna mikhaylovna wearing a green headdress and with a happy look of resignation to the will of god on her face their box was pervaded by that atmosphere of an affianced couple which natasha knew so well and liked so much
she turned away and suddenly remembered all that had been so humiliating in her morning s visit
 what right has he not to wish to receive me into his family  oh  better not think of it not till he comes back   she told herself  and began looking at the faces  some strange and some familiar  in the stalls
in the front  in the very center  leaning back against the orchestra rail  stood dolokhov in a persian dress  his curly hair brushed up into a huge shock
he stood in full view of the audience  well aware that he was attracting everyone s attention  yet as much at ease as though he were in his own room
around him thronged moscow s most brilliant young men  whom he evidently dominated
the count  laughing  nudged the blushing sonya and pointed to her former adorer
 do you recognize him   said he
 and where has he sprung from   he asked  turning to shinshin
 didn t he vanish somewhere    he did   replied shinshin
 he was in the caucasus and ran away from there
they say he has been acting as minister to some ruling prince in persia  where he killed the shah s brother
now all the moscow ladies are mad about him  it s  dolokhov the persian  that does it  we never hear a word but dolokhov is mentioned
they swear by him  they offer him to you as they would a dish of choice sterlet
dolokhov and anatole kuragin have turned all our ladies  heads   a tall  beautiful woman with a mass of plaited hair and much exposed plump white shoulders and neck  round which she wore a double string of large pearls  entered the adjoining box rustling her heavy silk dress and took a long time settling into her place
natasha involuntarily gazed at that neck  those shoulders  and pearls and coiffure  and admired the beauty of the shoulders and the pearls
while natasha was fixing her gaze on her for the second time the lady looked round and  meeting the count s eyes  nodded to him and smiled
she was the countess bezukhova  pierre s wife  and the count  who knew everyone in society  leaned over and spoke to her
 have you been here long  countess   he inquired
 i ll call  i ll call to kiss your hand
i m here on business and have brought my girls with me
they say semenova acts marvelously
count pierre never used to forget us
is he here    yes  he meant to look in   answered helene  and glanced attentively at natasha
count rostov resumed his seat
 handsome  isn t she   he whispered to natasha
 wonderful   answered natasha
 she s a woman one could easily fall in love with   just then the last chords of the overture were heard and the conductor tapped with his stick
some latecomers took their seats in the stalls  and the curtain rose
as soon as it rose everyone in the boxes and stalls became silent  and all the men  old and young  in uniform and evening dress  and all the women with gems on their bare flesh  turned their whole attention with eager curiosity to the stage natasha too began to look at it
the floor of the stage consisted of smooth boards  at the sides was some painted cardboard representing trees  and at the back was a cloth stretched over boards in the center of the stage sat some girls in red bodices and white skirts
one very fat girl in a white silk dress sat apart on a low bench  to the back of which a piece of green cardboard was glued
they all sang something
when they had finished their song the girl in white went up to the prompter s box and a man with tight silk trousers over his stout legs  and holding a plume and a dagger  went up to her and began singing  waving his arms about first the man in the tight trousers sang alone  then she sang  then they both paused while the orchestra played and the man fingered the hand of the girl in white  obviously awaiting the beat to start singing with her
they sang together and everyone in the theater began clapping and shouting  while the man and woman on the stage who represented lovers began smiling  spreading out their arms  and bowing after her life in the country  and in her present serious mood  all this seemed grotesque and amazing to natasha
she could not follow the opera nor even listen to the music  she saw only the painted cardboard and the queerly dressed men and women who moved  spoke  and sang so strangely in that brilliant light
she knew what it was all meant to represent  but it was so pretentiously false and unnatural that she first felt ashamed for the actors and then amused at them
she looked at the faces of the audience  seeking in them the same sense of ridicule and perplexity she herself experienced  but they all seemed attentive to what was happening on the stage  and expressed delight which to natasha seemed feigned
 i suppose it has to be like this   she thought
she kept looking round in turn at the rows of pomaded heads in the stalls and then at the seminude women in the boxes  especially at helene in the next box  who  apparently quite unclothed sat with a quiet tranquil smile  not taking her eyes off the stage
and feeling the bright light that flooded the whole place and the warm air heated by the crowd  natasha little by little began to pass into a state of intoxication she had not experienced for a long while
she did not realize who and where she was  nor what was going on before her
as she looked and thought  the strangest fancies unexpectedly and disconnectedly passed through her mind  the idea occurred to her of jumping onto the edge of the box and singing the air the actress was singing  then she wished to touch with her fan an old gentleman sitting not far from her  then to lean over to helene and tickle her
at a moment when all was quiet before the commencement of a song  a door leading to the stalls on the side nearest the rostovs  box creaked  and the steps of a belated arrival were heard
 there s kuragin   whispered shinshin
countess bezukhova turned smiling to the newcomer  and natasha  following the direction of that look  saw an exceptionally handsome adjutant approaching their box with a self assured yet courteous bearing
this was anatole kuragin whom she had seen and noticed long ago at the ball in petersburg
he was now in an adjutant s uniform with one epaulet and a shoulder knot
he moved with a restrained swagger which would have been ridiculous had he not been so good looking and had his handsome face not worn such an expression of good humored complacency and gaiety
though the performance was proceeding  he walked deliberately down the carpeted gangway  his sword and spurs slightly jingling and his handsome perfumed head held high
having looked at natasha he approached his sister  laid his well gloved hand on the edge of her box  nodded to her  and leaning forward asked a question  with a motion toward natasha
 mais charmante   said he  evidently referring to natasha  who did not exactly hear his words but understood them from the movement of his lips
then he took his place in the first row of the stalls and sat down beside dolokhov  nudging with his elbow in a friendly and offhand way that dolokhov whom others treated so fawningly
he winked at him gaily  smiled  and rested his foot against the orchestra screen
 how like the brother is to the sister   remarked the count
 and how handsome they both are   shinshin  lowering his voice  began to tell the count of some intrigue of kuragin s in moscow  and natasha tried to overhear it just because he had said she was  charmante   the first act was over
in the stalls everyone began moving about  going out and coming in
boris came to the rostovs  box  received their congratulations very simply  and raising his eyebrows with an absent minded smile conveyed to natasha and sonya his fiancee s invitation to her wedding  and went away
natasha with a gay  coquettish smile talked to him  and congratulated on his approaching wedding that same boris with whom she had formerly been in love
in the state of intoxication she was in  everything seemed simple and natural
the scantily clad helene smiled at everyone in the same way  and natasha gave boris a similar smile
helene s box was filled and surrounded from the stalls by the most distinguished and intellectual men  who seemed to vie with one another in their wish to let everyone see that they knew her
during the whole of that entr acte kuragin stood with dolokhov in front of the orchestra partition  looking at the rostovs  box
natasha knew he was talking about her and this afforded her pleasure
she even turned so that he should see her profile in what she thought was its most becoming aspect
before the beginning of the second act pierre appeared in the stalls
the rostovs had not seen him since their arrival
his face looked sad  and he had grown still stouter since natasha last saw him
he passed up to the front rows  not noticing anyone
anatole went up to him and began speaking to him  looking at and indicating the rostovs  box
on seeing natasha pierre grew animated and  hastily passing between the rows  came toward their box
when he got there he leaned on his elbows and  smiling  talked to her for a long time
while conversing with pierre  natasha heard a man s voice in countess bezukhova s box and something told her it was kuragin
she turned and their eyes met
almost smiling  he gazed straight into her eyes with such an enraptured caressing look that it seemed strange to be so near him  to look at him like that  to be so sure he admired her  and not to be acquainted with him
in the second act there was scenery representing tombstones  there was a round hole in the canvas to represent the moon  shades were raised over the footlights  and from horns and contrabass came deep notes while many people appeared from right and left wearing black cloaks and holding things like daggers in their hands
they began waving their arms then some other people ran in and began dragging away the maiden who had been in white and was now in light blue
they did not drag her away at once  but sang with her for a long time and then at last dragged her off  and behind the scenes something metallic was struck three times and everyone knelt down and sang a prayer
all these things were repeatedly interrupted by the enthusiastic shouts of the audience
during this act every time natasha looked toward the stalls she saw anatole kuragin with an arm thrown across the back of his chair  staring at her
she was pleased to see that he was captivated by her and it did not occur to her that there was anything wrong in it
when the second act was over countess bezukhova rose  turned to the rostovs  box her whole bosom completely exposed beckoned the old count with a gloved finger  and paying no attention to those who had entered her box began talking to him with an amiable smile
 do make me acquainted with your charming daughters   said she
 the whole town is singing their praises and i don t even know them   natasha rose and curtsied to the splendid countess
she was so pleased by praise from this brilliant beauty that she blushed with pleasure
 i want to become a moscovite too  now   said helene
 how is it you re not ashamed to bury such pearls in the country   countess bezukhova quite deserved her reputation of being a fascinating woman
she could say what she did not think especially what was flattering  quite simply and naturally
 dear count  you must let me look after your daughters  though i am not staying here long this time nor are you i will try to amuse them
i have already heard much of you in petersburg and wanted to get to know you   said she to natasha with her stereotyped and lovely smile
 i had heard about you from my page  drubetskoy
have you heard he is getting married  and also from my husband s friend bolkonski  prince andrew bolkonski   she went on with special emphasis  implying that she knew of his relation to natasha
to get better acquainted she asked that one of the young ladies should come into her box for the rest of the performance  and natasha moved over to it
the scene of the third act represented a palace in which many candles were burning and pictures of knights with short beards hung on the walls
in the middle stood what were probably a king and a queen
the king waved his right arm and  evidently nervous  sang something badly and sat down on a crimson throne the maiden who had been first in white and then in light blue  now wore only a smock  and stood beside the throne with her hair down
she sang something mournfully  addressing the queen  but the king waved his arm severely  and men and women with bare legs came in from both sides and began dancing all together
then the violins played very shrilly and merrily and one of the women with thick bare legs and thin arms  separating from the others  went behind the wings  adjusted her bodice  returned to the middle of the stage  and began jumping and striking one foot rapidly against the other in the stalls everyone clapped and shouted  bravo   then one of the men went into a corner of the stage
the cymbals and horns in the orchestra struck up more loudly  and this man with bare legs jumped very high and waved his feet about very rapidly
 he was duport  who received sixty thousand rubles a year for this art   everybody in the stalls  boxes  and galleries began clapping and shouting with all their might  and the man stopped and began smiling and bowing to all sides
then other men and women danced with bare legs
then the king again shouted to the sound of music  and they all began singing
but suddenly a storm came on  chromatic scales and diminished sevenths were heard in the orchestra  everyone ran off  again dragging one of their number away  and the curtain dropped
once more there was a terrible noise and clatter among the audience  and with rapturous faces everyone began shouting   duport  duport  duport   natasha no longer thought this strange
she looked about with pleasure  smiling joyfully
 isn t duport delightful   helene asked her
 oh  yes   replied natasha
during the entr acte a whiff of cold air came into helene s box  the door opened  and anatole entered  stooping and trying not to brush against anyone
 let me introduce my brother to you   said helene  her eyes shifting uneasily from natasha to anatole
natasha turned her pretty little head toward the elegant young officer and smiled at him over her bare shoulder
anatole  who was as handsome at close quarters as at a distance  sat down beside her and told her he had long wished to have this happiness ever since the naryshkins  ball in fact  at which he had had the well remembered pleasure of seeing her
kuragin was much more sensible and simple with women than among men
he talked boldly and naturally  and natasha was strangely and agreeably struck by the fact that there was nothing formidable in this man about whom there was so much talk  but that on the contrary his smile was most naive  cheerful  and good natured
kuragin asked her opinion of the performance and told her how at a previous performance semenova had fallen down on the stage
 and do you know  countess   he said  suddenly addressing her as an old  familiar acquaintance   we are getting up a costume tournament  you ought to take part in it  it will be great fun
we shall all meet at the karagins   please come  no  really  eh   said he
while saying this he never removed his smiling eyes from her face  her neck  and her bare arms natasha knew for certain that he was enraptured by her
this pleased her  yet his presence made her feel constrained and oppressed
when she was not looking at him she felt that he was looking at her shoulders  and she involuntarily caught his eye so that he should look into hers rather than this
but looking into his eyes she was frightened  realizing that there was not that barrier of modesty she had always felt between herself and other men
she did not know how it was that within five minutes she had come to feel herself terribly near to this man
when she turned away she feared he might seize her from behind by her bare arm and kiss her on the neck
they spoke of most ordinary things  yet she felt that they were closer to one another than she had ever been to any man
natasha kept turning to helene and to her father  as if asking what it all meant  but helene was engaged in conversation with a general and did not answer her look  and her father s eyes said nothing but what they always said   having a good time  well  i m glad of it   during one of these moments of awkward silence when anatole s prominent eyes were gazing calmly and fixedly at her  natasha  to break the silence  asked him how he liked moscow
she asked the question and blushed
she felt all the time that by talking to him she was doing something improper
anatole smiled as though to encourage her
 at first i did not like it much  because what makes a town pleasant ce sont les jolies femmes    isn t that so  but now i like it very much indeed   he said  looking at her significantly
 you ll come to the costume tournament  countess  do come   and putting out his hand to her bouquet and dropping his voice  he added   you will be the prettiest there
do come  dear countess  and give me this flower as a pledge     are the pretty women
natasha did not understand what he was saying any more than he did himself  but she felt that his incomprehensible words had an improper intention she did not know what to say and turned away as if she had not heard his remark
but as soon as she had turned away she felt that he was there  behind  so close behind her
 how is he now  confused  angry  ought i to put it right   she asked herself  and she could not refrain from turning round
she looked straight into his eyes  and his nearness  self assurance  and the good natured tenderness of his smile vanquished her
she smiled just as he was doing  gazing straight into his eyes
and again she felt with horror that no barrier lay between him and her
the curtain rose again
anatole left the box  serene and gay
natasha went back to her father in the other box  now quite submissive to the world she found herself in
all that was going on before her now seemed quite natural  but on the other hand all her previous thoughts of her betrothed  of princess mary  or of life in the country did not once recur to her mind and were as if belonging to a remote past
in the fourth act there was some sort of devil who sang waving his arm about  till the boards were withdrawn from under him and he disappeared down below
that was the only part of the fourth act that natasha saw
she felt agitated and tormented  and the cause of this was kuragin whom she could not help watching
as they were leaving the theater anatole came up to them  called their carriage  and helped them in
as he was putting natasha in he pressed her arm above the elbow
agitated and flushed she turned round
he was looking at her with glittering eyes  smiling tenderly
only after she had reached home was natasha able clearly to think over what had happened to her  and suddenly remembering prince andrew she was horrified  and at tea to which all had sat down after the opera  she gave a loud exclamation  flushed  and ran out of the room
 o god  i am lost   she said to herself
 how could i let him   she sat for a long time hiding her flushed face in her hands trying to realize what had happened to her  but was unable either to understand what had happened or what she felt
everything seemed dark  obscure  and terrible
there in that enormous  illuminated theater where the bare legged duport  in a tinsel  decorated jacket  jumped about to the music on wet boards  and young girls and old men  and the nearly naked helene with her proud  calm smile  rapturously cried  bravo   there in the presence of that helene it had all seemed clear and simple  but now  alone by herself  it was incomprehensible
 what is it  what was that terror i felt of him  what is this gnawing of conscience i am feeling now   she thought
only to the old countess at night in bed could natasha have told all she was feeling
she knew that sonya with her severe and simple views would either not understand it at all or would be horrified at such a confession
so natasha tried to solve what was torturing her by herself
 am i spoiled for andrew s love or not   she asked herself  and with soothing irony replied   what a fool i am to ask that  what did happen to me  nothing  i have done nothing  i didn t lead him on at all
nobody will know and i shall never see him again   she told herself
 so it is plain that nothing has happened and there is nothing to repent of  and andrew can love me still
but why  still   o god  why isn t he here   natasha quieted herself for a moment  but again some instinct told her that though all this was true  and though nothing had happened  yet the former purity of her love for prince andrew had perished
and again in imagination she went over her whole conversation with kuragin  and again saw the face  gestures  and tender smile of that bold handsome man when he pressed her arm
anatole kuragin was staying in moscow because his father had sent him away from petersburg  where he had been spending twenty thousand rubles a year in cash  besides running up debts for as much more  which his creditors demanded from his father
his father announced to him that he would now pay half his debts for the last time  but only on condition that he went to moscow as adjutant to the commander in chief a post his father had procured for him and would at last try to make a good match there
he indicated to him princess mary and julie karagina
anatole consented and went to moscow  where he put up at pierre s house
pierre received him unwillingly at first  but got used to him after a while  sometimes even accompanied him on his carousals  and gave him money under the guise of loans
as shinshin had remarked  from the time of his arrival anatole had turned the heads of the moscow ladies  especially by the fact that he slighted them and plainly preferred the gypsy girls and french actresses with the chief of whom  mademoiselle george  he was said to be on intimate relations
he had never missed a carousal at danilov s or other moscow revelers   drank whole nights through  outvying everyone else  and was at all the balls and parties of the best society
there was talk of his intrigues with some of the ladies  and he flirted with a few of them at the balls
but he did not run after the unmarried girls  especially the rich heiresses who were most of them plain
there was a special reason for this  as he had got married two years before a fact known only to his most intimate friends
at that time while with his regiment in poland  a polish landowner of small means had forced him to marry his daughter
anatole had very soon abandoned his wife and  for a payment which he agreed to send to his father in law  had arranged to be free to pass himself off as a bachelor anatole was always content with his position  with himself  and with others he was instinctively and thoroughly convinced that it was impossible for him to live otherwise than as he did and that he had never in his life done anything base
he was incapable of considering how his actions might affect others or what the consequences of this or that action of his might be
he was convinced that  as a duck is so made that it must live in water  so god had made him such that he must spend thirty thousand rubles a year and always occupy a prominent position in society
he believed this so firmly that others  looking at him  were persuaded of it too and did not refuse him either a leading place in society or money  which he borrowed from anyone and everyone and evidently would not repay
he was not a gambler  at any rate he did not care about winning
he was not vain
he did not mind what people thought of him
still less could he be accused of ambition
more than once he had vexed his father by spoiling his own career  and he laughed at distinctions of all kinds
he was not mean  and did not refuse anyone who asked of him
all he cared about was gaiety and women  and as according to his ideas there was nothing dishonorable in these tastes  and he was incapable of considering what the gratification of his tastes entailed for others  he honestly considered himself irreproachable  sincerely despised rogues and bad people  and with a tranquil conscience carried his head high rakes  those male magdalenes  have a secret feeling of innocence similar to that which female magdalenes have  based on the same hope of forgiveness
 all will be forgiven her  for she loved much  and all will be forgiven him  for he enjoyed much   dolokhov  who had reappeared that year in moscow after his exile and his persian adventures  and was leading a life of luxury  gambling  and dissipation  associated with his old petersburg comrade kuragin and made use of him for his own ends anatole was sincerely fond of dolokhov for his cleverness and audacity
dolokhov  who needed anatole kuragin s name  position  and connections as a bait to draw rich young men into his gambling set  made use of him and amused himself at his expense without letting the other feel it apart from the advantage he derived from anatole  the very process of dominating another s will was in itself a pleasure  a habit  and a necessity to dolokhov
natasha had made a strong impression on kuragin
at supper after the opera he described to dolokhov with the air of a connoisseur the attractions of her arms  shoulders  feet  and hair and expressed his intention of making love to her anatole had no notion and was incapable of considering what might come of such love making  as he never had any notion of the outcome of any of his actions
 she s first rate  my dear fellow  but not for us   replied dolokhov
 i will tell my sister to ask her to dinner   said anatole
 eh    you d better wait till she s married       you know  i adore little girls  they lose their heads at once   pursued anatole
 you have been caught once already by a  little girl    said dolokhov who knew of kuragin s marriage
 take care    well  that can t happen twice  eh   said anatole  with a good humored laugh
the day after the opera the rostovs went nowhere and nobody came to see them
marya dmitrievna talked to the count about something which they concealed from natasha
natasha guessed they were talking about the old prince and planning something  and this disquieted and offended her
she was expecting prince andrew any moment and twice that day sent a manservant to the vozdvizhenka to ascertain whether he had come
he had not arrived
she suffered more now than during her first days in moscow
to her impatience and pining for him were now added the unpleasant recollection of her interview with princess mary and the old prince  and a fear and anxiety of which she did not understand the cause
she continually fancied that either he would never come or that something would happen to her before he came
she could no longer think of him by herself calmly and continuously as she had done before
as soon as she began to think of him  the recollection of the old prince  of princess mary  of the theater  and of kuragin mingled with her thoughts
the question again presented itself whether she was not guilty  whether she had not already broken faith with prince andrew  and again she found herself recalling to the minutest detail every word  every gesture  and every shade in the play of expression on the face of the man who had been able to arouse in her such an incomprehensible and terrifying feeling
to the family natasha seemed livelier than usual  but she was far less tranquil and happy than before
on sunday morning marya dmitrievna invited her visitors to mass at her parish church the church of the assumption built over the graves of victims of the plague  i don t like those fashionable churches   she said  evidently priding herself on her independence of thought
 god is the same everywhere
we have an excellent priest  he conducts the service decently and with dignity  and the deacon is the same
what holiness is there in giving concerts in the choir  i don t like it  it s just self indulgence   marya dmitrievna liked sundays and knew how to keep them
her whole house was scrubbed and cleaned on saturdays  neither she nor the servants worked  and they all wore holiday dress and went to church
at her table there were extra dishes at dinner  and the servants had vodka and roast goose or suckling pig
but in nothing in the house was the holiday so noticeable as in marya dmitrievna s broad  stern face  which on that day wore an invariable look of solemn festivity
after mass  when they had finished their coffee in the dining room where the loose covers had been removed from the furniture  a servant announced that the carriage was ready  and marya dmitrievna rose with a stern air
she wore her holiday shawl  in which she paid calls  and announced that she was going to see prince nicholas bolkonski to have an explanation with him about natasha
after she had gone  a dressmaker from madame suppert roguet waited on the rostovs  and natasha  very glad of this diversion  having shut herself into a room adjoining the drawing room  occupied herself trying on the new dresses
just as she had put on a bodice without sleeves and only tacked together  and was turning her head to see in the glass how the back fitted  she heard in the drawing room the animated sounds of her father s voice and another s a woman s that made her flush
it was helene
natasha had not time to take off the bodice before the door opened and countess bezukhova  dressed in a purple velvet gown with a high collar  came into the room beaming with goodhumored amiable smiles
 oh  my enchantress   she cried to the blushing natasha
 charming  no  this is really beyond anything  my dear count   said she to count rostov who had followed her in
 how can you live in moscow and go nowhere  no  i won t let you off  mademoiselle george will recite at my house tonight and there ll be some people  and if you don t bring your lovely girls who are prettier than mademoiselle george i won t know you  my husband is away in tver or i would send him to fetch you you must come
you positively must  between eight and nine   she nodded to the dressmaker  whom she knew and who had curtsied respectfully to her  and seated herself in an armchair beside the looking glass  draping the folds of her velvet dress picturesquely
she did not cease chattering good naturedly and gaily  continually praising natasha s beauty
she looked at natasha s dresses and praised them  as well as a new dress of her own made of  metallic gauze   which she had received from paris  and advised natasha to have one like it
 but anything suits you  my charmer   she remarked
a smile of pleasure never left natasha s face
she felt happy and as if she were blossoming under the praise of this dear countess bezukhova who had formerly seemed to her so unapproachable and important and was now so kind to her
natasha brightened up and felt almost in love with this woman  who was so beautiful and so kind
helene for her part was sincerely delighted with natasha and wished to give her a good time
anatole had asked her to bring him and natasha together  and she was calling on the rostovs for that purpose
the idea of throwing her brother and natasha together amused her
though at one time  in petersburg  she had been annoyed with natasha for drawing boris away  she did not think of that now  and in her own way heartily wished natasha well
as she was leaving the rostovs she called her protegee aside
 my brother dined with me yesterday we nearly died of laughter he ate nothing and kept sighing for you  my charmer  he is madly  quite madly  in love with you  my dear   natasha blushed scarlet when she heard this
 how she blushes  how she blushes  my pretty   said helene
 you must certainly come
if you love somebody  my charmer  that is not a reason to shut yourself up
even if you are engaged  i am sure your fiance would wish you to go into society rather than be bored to death    so she knows i am engaged  and she and her husband pierre that good pierre have talked and laughed about this
so it s all right   and again  under helene s influence  what had seemed terrible now seemed simple and natural
 and she is such a grande dame  so kind  and evidently likes me so much
and why not enjoy myself   thought natasha  gazing at helene with wide open  wondering eyes
marya dmitrievna came back to dinner taciturn and serious  having evidently suffered a defeat at the old prince s
she was still too agitated by the encounter to be able to talk of the affair calmly
in answer to the count s inquiries she replied that things were all right and that she would tell about it next day
on hearing of countess bezukhova s visit and the invitation for that evening  marya dmitrievna remarked   i don t care to have anything to do with bezukhova and don t advise you to  however  if you ve promised go
it will divert your thoughts   she added  addressing natasha
count rostov took the girls to countess bezukhova s
there were a good many people there  but nearly all strangers to natasha
count rostov was displeased to see that the company consisted almost entirely of men and women known for the freedom of their conduct
mademoiselle george was standing in a corner of the drawing room surrounded by young men
there were several frenchmen present  among them metivier who from the time helene reached moscow had been an intimate in her house
the count decided not to sit down to cards or let his girls out of his sight and to get away as soon as mademoiselle george s performance was over
anatole was at the door  evidently on the lookout for the rostovs
immediately after greeting the count he went up to natasha and followed her
as soon as she saw him she was seized by the same feeling she had had at the opera gratified vanity at his admiration of her and fear at the absence of a moral barrier between them
helene welcomed natasha delightedly and was loud in admiration of her beauty and her dress
soon after their arrival mademoiselle george went out of the room to change her costume
in the drawing room people began arranging the chairs and taking their seats
anatole moved a chair for natasha and was about to sit down beside her  but the count  who never lost sight of her  took the seat himself anatole sat down behind her
mademoiselle george  with her bare  fat  dimpled arms  and a red shawl draped over one shoulder  came into the space left vacant for her  and assumed an unnatural pose enthusiastic whispering was audible
mademoiselle george looked sternly and gloomily at the audience and began reciting some french verses describing her guilty love for her son
in some places she raised her voice  in others she whispered  lifting her head triumphantly  sometimes she paused and uttered hoarse sounds  rolling her eyes
 adorable  divine  delicious   was heard from every side
natasha looked at the fat actress  but neither saw nor heard nor understood anything of what went on before her
she only felt herself again completely borne away into this strange senseless world so remote from her old world  a world in which it was impossible to know what was good or bad  reasonable or senseless
behind her sat anatole  and conscious of his proximity she experienced a frightened sense of expectancy
after the first monologue the whole company rose and surrounded mademoiselle george  expressing their enthusiasm
 how beautiful she is   natasha remarked to her father who had also risen and was moving through the crowd toward the actress
 i don t think so when i look at you   said anatole  following natasha
he said this at a moment when she alone could hear him
 you are enchanting  
from the moment i saw you i have never ceased      come  come  natasha   said the count  as he turned back for his daughter
 how beautiful she is   natasha without saying anything stepped up to her father and looked at him with surprised inquiring eyes
after giving several recitations  mademoiselle george left  and countess bezukhova asked her visitors into the ballroom
the count wished to go home  but helene entreated him not to spoil her improvised ball  and the rostovs stayed on
anatole asked natasha for a valse and as they danced he pressed her waist and hand and told her she was bewitching and that he loved her
during the ecossaise  which she also danced with him  anatole said nothing when they happened to be by themselves  but merely gazed at her natasha lifted her frightened eyes to him  but there was such confident tenderness in his affectionate look and smile that she could not  whilst looking at him  say what she had to say
she lowered her eyes
 don t say such things to me
i am betrothed and love another   she said rapidly   
she glanced at him
anatole was not upset or pained by what she had said
 don t speak to me of that  what can i do   said he
 i tell you i am madly  madly  in love with you  is it my fault that you are enchanting   
it s our turn to begin   natasha  animated and excited  looked about her with wide open frightened eyes and seemed merrier than usual
she understood hardly anything that went on that evening
they danced the ecossaise and the grossvater
her father asked her to come home  but she begged to remain
wherever she went and whomever she was speaking to  she felt his eyes upon her
later on she recalled how she had asked her father to let her go to the dressing room to rearrange her dress  that helene had followed her and spoken laughingly of her brother s love  and that she again met anatole in the little sitting room
helene had disappeared leaving them alone  and anatole had taken her hand and said in a tender voice   i cannot come to visit you but is it possible that i shall never see you  i love you madly
can i never      and  blocking her path  he brought his face close to hers
his large  glittering  masculine eyes were so close to hers that she saw nothing but them
 natalie   he whispered inquiringly while she felt her hands being painfully pressed
 natalie    i don t understand
i have nothing to say   her eyes replied
burning lips were pressed to hers  and at the same instant she felt herself released  and helene s footsteps and the rustle of her dress were heard in the room
natasha looked round at her  and then  red and trembling  threw a frightened look of inquiry at anatole and moved toward the door
 one word  just one  for god s sake   cried anatole
she paused
she so wanted a word from him that would explain to her what had happened and to which she could find no answer
 natalie  just a word  only one   he kept repeating  evidently not knowing what to say and he repeated it till helene came up to them
helene returned with natasha to the drawing room
the rostovs went away without staying for supper
after reaching home natasha did not sleep all night
she was tormented by the insoluble question whether she loved anatole or prince andrew
she loved prince andrew she remembered distinctly how deeply she loved him
but she also loved anatole  of that there was no doubt
 else how could all this have happened   thought she
 if  after that  i could return his smile when saying good by  if i was able to let it come to that  it means that i loved him from the first
it means that he is kind  noble  and splendid  and i could not help loving him
what am i to do if i love him and the other one too   she asked herself  unable to find an answer to these terrible questions
morning came with its cares and bustle
everyone got up and began to move about and talk  dressmakers came again
marya dmitrievna appeared  and they were called to breakfast
natasha kept looking uneasily at everybody with wide open eyes  as if wishing to intercept every glance directed toward her  and tried to appear the same as usual
after breakfast  which was her best time  marya dmitrievna sat down in her armchair and called natasha and the count to her
 well  friends  i have now thought the whole matter over and this is my advice   she began
 yesterday  as you know  i went to see prince bolkonski
well  i had a talk with him   
he took it into his head to begin shouting  but i am not one to be shouted down
i said what i had to say    well  and he   asked the count
 he  he s crazy  
he did not want to listen
but what s the use of talking  as it is we have worn the poor girl out   said marya dmitrievna
 my advice to you is finish your business and go back home to otradnoe  
and wait there    oh  no   exclaimed natasha
 yes  go back   said marya dmitrievna   and wait there
if your betrothed comes here now there will be no avoiding a quarrel  but alone with the old man he will talk things over and then come on to you   count rostov approved of this suggestion  appreciating its reasonableness
if the old man came round it would be all the better to visit him in moscow or at bald hills later on  and if not  the wedding  against his wishes  could only be arranged at otradnoe
 that is perfectly true
and i am sorry i went to see him and took her   said the old count
 no  why be sorry  being here  you had to pay your respects
but if he won t  that s his affair   said marya dmitrievna  looking for something in her reticule
 besides  the trousseau is ready  so there is nothing to wait for  and what is not ready i ll send after you
though i don t like letting you go  it is the best way
so go  with god s blessing   having found what she was looking for in the reticule she handed it to natasha
it was a letter from princess mary
 she has written to you
how she torments herself  poor thing  she s afraid you might think that she does not like you    but she doesn t like me   said natasha
 don t talk nonsense   cried marya dmitrievna
 i shan t believe anyone  i know she doesn t like me   replied natasha boldly as she took the letter  and her face expressed a cold and angry resolution that caused marya dmitrievna to look at her more intently and to frown
 don t answer like that  my good girl   she said
 what i say is true  write an answer   natasha did not reply and went to her own room to read princess mary s letter
princess mary wrote that she was in despair at the misunderstanding that had occurred between them
whatever her father s feelings might be  she begged natasha to believe that she could not help loving her as the one chosen by her brother  for whose happiness she was ready to sacrifice everything
 do not think  however   she wrote   that my father is ill disposed toward you
he is an invalid and an old man who must be forgiven  but he is good and magnanimous and will love her who makes his son happy   princess mary went on to ask natasha to fix a time when she could see her again
after reading the letter natasha sat down at the writing table to answer it
 dear princess   she wrote in french quickly and mechanically  and then paused
what more could she write after all that had happened the evening before   yes  yes  all that has happened  and now all is changed   she thought as she sat with the letter she had begun before her
 must i break off with him  must i really  that s awful     and to escape from these dreadful thoughts she went to sonya and began sorting patterns with her
after dinner natasha went to her room and again took up princess mary s letter
 can it be that it is all over   she thought
 can it be that all this has happened so quickly and has destroyed all that went before   she recalled her love for prince andrew in all its former strength  and at the same time felt that she loved kuragin
she vividly pictured herself as prince andrew s wife  and the scenes of happiness with him she had so often repeated in her imagination  and at the same time  aglow with excitement  recalled every detail of yesterday s interview with anatole
 why could that not be as well   she sometimes asked herself in complete bewilderment
 only so could i be completely happy  but now i have to choose  and i can t be happy without either of them
only   she thought   to tell prince andrew what has happened or to hide it from him are both equally impossible
but with that one nothing is spoiled
but am i really to abandon forever the joy of prince andrew s love  in which i have lived so long    please  miss   whispered a maid entering the room with a mysterious air
 a man told me to give you this   and she handed natasha a letter
 only  for christ s sake     the girl went on  as natasha  without thinking  mechanically broke the seal and read a love letter from anatole  of which  without taking in a word  she understood only that it was a letter from him  from the man she loved
yes  she loved him  or else how could that have happened which had happened  and how could she have a love letter from him in her hand  with trembling hands natasha held that passionate love letter which dolokhov had composed for anatole  and as she read it she found in it an echo of all that she herself imagined she was feeling
 since yesterday evening my fate has been sealed  to be loved by you or to die
there is no other way for me   the letter began
then he went on to say that he knew her parents would not give her to him for this there were secret reasons he could reveal only to her but that if she loved him she need only say the word yes  and no human power could hinder their bliss
love would conquer all
he would steal her away and carry her off to the ends of the earth
 yes  yes  i love him   thought natasha  reading the letter for the twentieth time and finding some peculiarly deep meaning in each word of it
that evening marya dmitrievna was going to the akharovs  and proposed to take the girls with her
natasha  pleading a headache  remained at home
on returning late in the evening sonya went to natasha s room  and to her surprise found her still dressed and asleep on the sofa
open on the table  beside her lay anatole s letter
sonya picked it up and read it
as she read she glanced at the sleeping natasha  trying to find in her face an explanation of what she was reading  but did not find it
her face was calm  gentle  and happy
clutching her breast to keep herself from choking  sonya  pale and trembling with fear and agitation  sat down in an armchair and burst into tears
 how was it i noticed nothing  how could it go so far  can she have left off loving prince andrew  and how could she let kuragin go to such lengths  he is a deceiver and a villain  that s plain  what will nicholas  dear noble nicholas  do when he hears of it  so this is the meaning of her excited  resolute  unnatural look the day before yesterday  yesterday  and today   thought sonya
 but it can t be that she loves him  she probably opened the letter without knowing who it was from
probably she is offended by it
she could not do such a thing   sonya wiped away her tears and went up to natasha  again scanning her face
 natasha   she said  just audibly
natasha awoke and saw sonya
 ah  you re back   and with the decision and tenderness that often come at the moment of awakening  she embraced her friend  but noticing sonya s look of embarrassment  her own face expressed confusion and suspicion
 sonya  you ve read that letter   she demanded
 yes   answered sonya softly
natasha smiled rapturously
 no  sonya  i can t any longer   she said
 i can t hide it from you any longer
you know  we love one another  sonya  darling  he writes  
sonya     sonya stared open eyed at natasha  unable to believe her ears
 and bolkonski   she asked
 ah  sonya  if you only knew how happy i am   cried natasha
 you don t know what love is       but  natasha  can that be all over   natasha looked at sonya with wide open eyes as if she could not grasp the question
 well  then  are you refusing prince andrew   said sonya
 oh  you don t understand anything  don t talk nonsense  just listen   said natasha  with momentary vexation
 but i can t believe it   insisted sonya
 i don t understand
how is it you have loved a man for a whole year and suddenly  
why  you have only seen him three times  natasha  i don t believe you  you re joking  in three days to forget everything and so      three days   said natasha
 it seems to me i ve loved him a hundred years it seems to me that i have never loved anyone before you can t understand it   
sonya  wait a bit  sit here   and natasha embraced and kissed her
 i had heard that it happens like this  and you must have heard it too  but it s only now that i feel such love
it s not the same as before
as soon as i saw him i felt he was my master and i his slave  and that i could not help loving him
yes  his slave  whatever he orders i shall do
you don t understand that
what can i do  what can i do  sonya   cried natasha with a happy yet frightened expression
 but think what you are doing   cried sonya
 i can t leave it like this
this secret correspondence  
how could you let him go so far   she went on  with a horror and disgust she could hardly conceal
 i told you that i have no will   natasha replied
 why can t you understand  i love him    then i won t let it come to that  
i shall tell   cried sonya  bursting into tears
 what do you mean  for god s sake  
if you tell  you are my enemy   declared natasha
 you want me to be miserable  you want us to be separated      when she saw natasha s fright  sonya shed tears of shame and pity for her friend
 but what has happened between you   she asked
 what has he said to you  why doesn t he come to the house   natasha did not answer her questions
 for god s sake  sonya  don t tell anyone  don t torture me   natasha entreated
 remember no one ought to interfere in such matters  i have confided in you       but why this secrecy  why doesn t he come to the house   asked sonya
 why doesn t he openly ask for your hand  you know prince andrew gave you complete freedom if it is really so  but i don t believe it  natasha  have you considered what these secret reasons can be   natasha looked at sonya with astonishment
evidently this question presented itself to her mind for the first time and she did not know how to answer it
 i don t know what the reasons are
but there must be reasons   sonya sighed and shook her head incredulously
 if there were reasons     she began
but natasha  guessing her doubts  interrupted her in alarm
 sonya  one can t doubt him  one can t  one can t  don t you understand   she cried
 does he love you    does he love me   natasha repeated with a smile of pity at her friend s lack of comprehension
 why  you have read his letter and you have seen him    but if he is dishonorable    he  dishonorable  if you only knew   exclaimed natasha
 if he is an honorable man he should either declare his intentions or cease seeing you  and if you won t do this  i will
i will write to him  and i will tell papa   said sonya resolutely
 but i can t live without him   cried natasha
 natasha  i don t understand you
and what are you saying  think of your father and of nicholas    i don t want anyone  i don t love anyone but him
how dare you say he is dishonorable  don t you know that i love him   screamed natasha
 go away  sonya  i don t want to quarrel with you  but go  for god s sake go  you see how i am suffering   natasha cried angrily  in a voice of despair and repressed irritation
sonya burst into sobs and ran from the room
natasha went to the table and without a moment s reflection wrote that answer to princess mary which she had been unable to write all the morning
in this letter she said briefly that all their misunderstandings were at an end  that availing herself of the magnanimity of prince andrew who when he went abroad had given her her freedom  she begged princess mary to forget everything and forgive her if she had been to blame toward her  but that she could not be his wife
at that moment this all seemed quite easy  simple  and clear to natasha
on friday the rostovs were to return to the country  but on wednesday the count went with the prospective purchaser to his estate near moscow
on the day the count left  sonya and natasha were invited to a big dinner party at the karagins   and marya dmitrievna took them there
at that party natasha again met anatole  and sonya noticed that she spoke to him  trying not to be overheard  and that all through dinner she was more agitated than ever
when they got home natasha was the first to begin the explanation sonya expected
 there  sonya  you were talking all sorts of nonsense about him   natasha began in a mild voice such as children use when they wish to be praised
 we have had an explanation today    well  what happened  what did he say  natasha  how glad i am you re not angry with me  tell me everything the whole truth
what did he say   natasha became thoughtful
 oh  sonya  if you knew him as i do  he said  
he asked me what i had promised bolkonski
he was glad i was free to refuse him   sonya sighed sorrowfully
 but you haven t refused bolkonski   said she
 perhaps i have
perhaps all is over between me and bolkonski
why do you think so badly of me    i don t think anything  only i don t understand this      wait a bit  sonya  you ll understand everything
you ll see what a man he is  now don t think badly of me or of him
i don t think badly of anyone  i love and pity everybody
but what am i to do   sonya did not succumb to the tender tone natasha used toward her
the more emotional and ingratiating the expression of natasha s face became  the more serious and stern grew sonya s
 natasha   said she   you asked me not to speak to you  and i haven t spoken  but now you yourself have begun
i don t trust him  natasha
why this secrecy    again  again   interrupted natasha
 natasha  i am afraid for you    afraid of what    i am afraid you re going to your ruin   said sonya resolutely  and was herself horrified at what she had said
anger again showed in natasha s face
 and i ll go to my ruin  i will  as soon as possible  it s not your business  it won t be you  but i  who ll suffer
leave me alone  leave me alone  i hate you    natasha   moaned sonya  aghast
 i hate you  i hate you  you re my enemy forever   and natasha ran out of the room
natasha did not speak to sonya again and avoided her
with the same expression of agitated surprise and guilt she went about the house  taking up now one occupation  now another  and at once abandoning them
hard as it was for sonya  she watched her friend and did not let her out of her sight
the day before the count was to return  sonya noticed that natasha sat by the drawing room window all the morning as if expecting something and that she made a sign to an officer who drove past  whom sonya took to be anatole
sonya began watching her friend still more attentively and noticed that at dinner and all that evening natasha was in a strange and unnatural state
she answered questions at random  began sentences she did not finish  and laughed at everything
after tea sonya noticed a housemaid at natasha s door timidly waiting to let her pass
she let the girl go in  and then listening at the door learned that another letter had been delivered
then suddenly it became clear to sonya that natasha had some dreadful plan for that evening
sonya knocked at her door
natasha did not let her in
 she will run away with him   thought sonya
 she is capable of anything
there was something particularly pathetic and resolute in her face today
she cried as she said good by to uncle   sonya remembered
 yes  that s it  she means to elope with him  but what am i to do   thought she  recalling all the signs that clearly indicated that natasha had some terrible intention
 the count is away
what am i to do  write to kuragin demanding an explanation  but what is there to oblige him to reply  write to pierre  as prince andrew asked me to in case of some misfortune   
but perhaps she really has already refused bolkonski she sent a letter to princess mary yesterday
and uncle is away      to tell marya dmitrievna who had such faith in natasha seemed to sonya terrible
 well  anyway   thought sonya as she stood in the dark passage   now or never i must prove that i remember the family s goodness to me and that i love nicholas
yes  if i don t sleep for three nights i ll not leave this passage and will hold her back by force and will and not let the family be disgraced   thought she
anatole had lately moved to dolokhov s
the plan for natalie rostova s abduction had been arranged and the preparations made by dolokhov a few days before  and on the day that sonya  after listening at natasha s door  resolved to safeguard her  it was to have been put into execution
natasha had promised to come out to kuragin at the back porch at ten that evening
kuragin was to put her into a troyka he would have ready and to drive her forty miles to the village of kamenka  where an unfrocked priest was in readiness to perform a marriage ceremony over them
at kamenka a relay of horses was to wait which would take them to the warsaw highroad  and from there they would hasten abroad with post horses
anatole had a passport  an order for post horses  ten thousand rubles he had taken from his sister and another ten thousand borrowed with dolokhov s help
two witnesses for the mock marriage khvostikov  a retired petty official whom dolokhov made use of in his gambling transactions  and makarin  a retired hussar  a kindly  weak fellow who had an unbounded affection for kuragin were sitting at tea in dolokhov s front room
in his large study  the walls of which were hung to the ceiling with persian rugs  bearskins  and weapons  sat dolokhov in a traveling cloak and high boots  at an open desk on which lay an abacus and some bundles of paper money
anatole  with uniform unbuttoned  walked to and fro from the room where the witnesses were sitting  through the study to the room behind  where his french valet and others were packing the last of his things
dolokhov was counting the money and noting something down
 well   he said   khvostikov must have two thousand    give it to him  then   said anatole
 makarka   their name for makarin   will go through fire and water for you for nothing
so here are our accounts all settled   said dolokhov  showing him the memorandum
 is that right    yes  of course   returned anatole  evidently not listening to dolokhov and looking straight before him with a smile that did not leave his face
dolokhov banged down the lid of his desk and turned to anatole with an ironic smile   do you know  you d really better drop it all
there s still time    fool   retorted anatole
 don t talk nonsense  if you only knew  
it s the devil knows what    no  really  give it up   said dolokhov
 i am speaking seriously
it s no joke  this plot you ve hatched    what  teasing again  go to the devil  eh   said anatole  making a grimace
 really it s no time for your stupid jokes   and he left the room
dolokhov smiled contemptuously and condescendingly when anatole had gone out
 you wait a bit   he called after him
 i m not joking  i m talking sense
come here  come here   anatole returned and looked at dolokhov  trying to give him his attention and evidently submitting to him involuntarily
 now listen to me
i m telling you this for the last time
why should i joke about it  did i hinder you  who arranged everything for you  who found the priest and got the passport  who raised the money  i did it all    well  thank you for it
do you think i am not grateful   and anatole sighed and embraced dolokhov
 i helped you  but all the same i must tell you the truth  it is a dangerous business  and if you think about it a stupid business
well  you ll carry her off all right  will they let it stop at that  it will come out that you re already married
why  they ll have you in the criminal court       oh  nonsense  nonsense   anatole ejaculated and again made a grimace
 didn t i explain to you  what   and anatole  with the partiality dull witted people have for any conclusion they have reached by their own reasoning  repeated the argument he had already put to dolokhov a hundred times
 didn t i explain to you that i have come to this conclusion  if this marriage is invalid   he went on  crooking one finger   then i have nothing to answer for  but if it is valid  no matter  abroad no one will know anything about it
isn t that so  and don t talk to me  don t  don t    seriously  you d better drop it  you ll only get yourself into a mess    go to the devil   cried anatole and  clutching his hair  left the room  but returned at once and dropped into an armchair in front of dolokhov with his feet turned under him
 it s the very devil  what  feel how it beats   he took dolokhov s hand and put it on his heart
 what a foot  my dear fellow  what a glance  a goddess   he added in french
 what   dolokhov with a cold smile and a gleam in his handsome insolent eyes looked at him evidently wishing to get some more amusement out of him
 well and when the money s gone  what then    what then  eh   repeated anatole  sincerely perplexed by a thought of the future
 what then   
then  i don t know   
but why talk nonsense   he glanced at his watch
 it s time   anatole went into the back room
 now then  nearly ready  you re dawdling   he shouted to the servants
dolokhov put away the money  called a footman whom he ordered to bring something for them to eat and drink before the journey  and went into the room where khvostikov and makarin were sitting
anatole lay on the sofa in the study leaning on his elbow and smiling pensively  while his handsome lips muttered tenderly to himself  come and eat something
have a drink   dolokhov shouted to him from the other room
 i don t want to   answered anatole continuing to smile
 come  balaga is here   anatole rose and went into the dining room
balaga was a famous troyka driver who had known dolokhov and anatole some six years and had given them good service with his troykas
more than once when anatole s regiment was stationed at tver he had taken him from tver in the evening  brought him to moscow by daybreak  and driven him back again the next night
more than once he had enabled dolokhov to escape when pursued
more than once he had driven them through the town with gypsies and  ladykins  as he called the cocottes
more than once in their service he had run over pedestrians and upset vehicles in the streets of moscow and had always been protected from the consequences by  my gentlemen  as he called them
he had ruined more than one horse in their service
more than once they had beaten him  and more than once they had made him drunk on champagne and madeira  which he loved  and he knew more than one thing about each of them which would long ago have sent an ordinary man to siberia
they often called balaga into their orgies and made him drink and dance at the gypsies   and more than one thousand rubles of their money had passed through his hands
in their service he risked his skin and his life twenty times a year  and in their service had lost more horses than the money he had from them would buy
but he liked them  liked that mad driving at twelve miles an hour  liked upsetting a driver or running down a pedestrian  and flying at full gallop through the moscow streets
he liked to hear those wild  tipsy shouts behind him   get on  get on   when it was impossible to go any faster
he liked giving a painful lash on the neck to some peasant who  more dead than alive  was already hurrying out of his way
 real gentlemen   he considered them
anatole and dolokhov liked balaga too for his masterly driving and because he liked the things they liked
with others balaga bargained  charging twenty  five rubles for a two hours  drive  and rarely drove himself  generally letting his young men do so but with  his gentlemen  he always drove himself and never demanded anything for his work only a couple of times a year when he knew from their valets that they had money in hand he would turn up of a morning quite sober and with a deep bow would ask them to help him
the gentlemen always made him sit down
 do help me out  theodore ivanych  sir   or  your excellency   he would say
 i am quite out of horses
let me have what you can to go to the fair   and anatole and dolokhov  when they had money  would give him a thousand or a couple of thousand rubles
balaga was a fair haired  short  and snub nosed peasant of about twenty  seven  red faced  with a particularly red thick neck  glittering little eyes  and a small beard
he wore a fine  dark blue  silk lined cloth coat over a sheepskin
on entering the room now he crossed himself  turning toward the front corner of the room  and went up to dolokhov  holding out a small  black hand  theodore ivanych   he said  bowing
 how d you do  friend  well  here he is    good day  your excellency   he said  again holding out his hand to anatole who had just come in
 i say  balaga   said anatole  putting his hands on the man s shoulders   do you care for me or not  eh  now  do me a service   
what horses have you come with  eh    as your messenger ordered  your special beasts   replied balaga
 well  listen  balaga  drive all three to death but get me there in three hours
eh    when they are dead  what shall i drive   said balaga with a wink
 mind  i ll smash your face in  don t make jokes   cried anatole  suddenly rolling his eyes
 why joke   said the driver  laughing
 as if i d grudge my gentlemen anything  as fast as ever the horses can gallop  so fast we ll go    ah   said anatole
 well  sit down    yes  sit down   said dolokhov
 i ll stand  theodore ivanych    sit down  nonsense  have a drink   said anatole  and filled a large glass of madeira for him
the driver s eyes sparkled at the sight of the wine
after refusing it for manners  sake  he drank it and wiped his mouth with a red silk handkerchief he took out of his cap
 and when are we to start  your excellency    well     anatole looked at his watch
 we ll start at once
mind  balaga  you ll get there in time  eh    that depends on our luck in starting  else why shouldn t we be there in time   replied balaga
 didn t we get you to tver in seven hours  i think you remember that  your excellency    do you know  one christmas i drove from tver   said anatole  smilingly at the recollection and turning to makarin who gazed rapturously at him with wide open eyes
 will you believe it  makarka  it took one s breath away  the rate we flew
we came across a train of loaded sleighs and drove right over two of them
eh    those were horses   balaga continued the tale
 that time i d harnessed two young side horses with the bay in the shafts   he went on  turning to dolokhov
 will you believe it  theodore ivanych  those animals flew forty miles  i couldn t hold them in  my hands grew numb in the sharp frost so that i threw down the reins  catch hold yourself  your excellency   says i  and i just tumbled on the bottom of the sleigh and sprawled there
it wasn t a case of urging them on  there was no holding them in till we reached the place
the devils took us there in three hours  only the near one died of it   anatole went out of the room and returned a few minutes later wearing a fur coat girt with a silver belt  and a sable cap jauntily set on one side and very becoming to his handsome face
having looked in a mirror  and standing before dolokhov in the same pose he had assumed before it  he lifted a glass of wine
 well  good by  theodore
thank you for everything and farewell   said anatole
 well  comrades and friends     he considered for a moment     of my youth  farewell   he said  turning to makarin and the others though they were all going with him  anatole evidently wished to make something touching and solemn out of this address to his comrades he spoke slowly in a loud voice and throwing out his chest slightly swayed one leg
 all take glasses  you too  balaga
well  comrades and friends of my youth  we ve had our fling and lived and reveled eh  and now  when shall we meet again  i am going abroad
we have had a good time now farewell  lads  to our health  hurrah      he cried  and emptying his glass flung it on the floor
 to your health   said balaga who also emptied his glass  and wiped his mouth with his handkerchief
makarin embraced anatole with tears in his eyes
 ah  prince  how sorry i am to part from you   let s go
let s go   cried anatole
balaga was about to leave the room
 no  stop   said anatole
 shut the door  we have first to sit down
that s the way   they shut the door and all sat down
 now  quick march  lads   said anatole  rising
joseph  his valet  handed him his sabretache and saber  and they all went out into the vestibule
 and where s the fur cloak   asked dolokhov
 hey  ignatka  go to matrena matrevna and ask her for the sable cloak
i have heard what elopements are like   continued dolokhov with a wink
 why  she ll rush out more dead than alive just in the things she is wearing  if you delay at all there ll be tears and  papa  and  mamma   and she s frozen in a minute and must go back but you wrap the fur cloak round her first thing and carry her to the sleigh   the valet brought a woman s fox lined cloak
 fool  i told you the sable one  hey  matrena  the sable   he shouted so that his voice rang far through the rooms a handsome  slim  and pale faced gypsy girl with glittering black eyes and curly blue black hair  wearing a red shawl  ran out with a sable mantle on her arm
 here  i don t grudge it take it   she said  evidently afraid of her master and yet regretful of her cloak
dolokhov  without answering  took the cloak  threw it over matrena  and wrapped her up in it
 that s the way   said dolokhov   and then so   and he turned the collar up round her head  leaving only a little of the face uncovered
 and then so  do you see   and he pushed anatole s head forward to meet the gap left by the collar  through which matrena s brilliant smile was seen
 well  good by  matrena   said anatole  kissing her
 ah  my revels here are over
remember me to steshka
there  good by  good bye  matrena  wish me luck    well  prince  may god give you great luck   said matrena in her gypsy accent
two troykas were standing before the porch and two young drivers were holding the horses
balaga took his seat in the front one and holding his elbows high arranged the reins deliberately
anatole and dolokhov got in with him
makarin  khvostikov  and a valet seated themselves in the other sleigh  well  are you ready   asked balaga
 go   he cried  twisting the reins round his hands  and the troyka tore down the nikitski boulevard
 tproo  get out of the way  hi   
tproo      the shouting of balaga and of the sturdy young fellow seated on the box was all that could be heard
on the arbat square the troyka caught against a carriage  something cracked  shouts were heard  and the troyka flew along the arbat street
after taking a turn along the podnovinski boulevard  balaga began to rein in  and turning back drew up at the crossing of the old konyusheny street
the young fellow on the box jumped down to hold the horses and anatole and dolokhov went along the pavement
when they reached the gate dolokhov whistled
the whistle was answered  and a maidservant ran out
 come into the courtyard or you ll be seen  she ll come out directly   said she
dolokhov stayed by the gate
anatole followed the maid into the courtyard  turned the corner  and ran up into the porch
he was met by gabriel  marya dmitrievna s gigantic footman
 come to the mistress  please   said the footman in his deep bass  intercepting any retreat
 to what mistress  who are you   asked anatole in a breathless whisper
 kindly step in  my orders are to bring you in    kuragin  come back   shouted dolokhov
 betrayed  back   dolokhov  after anatole entered  had remained at the wicket gate and was struggling with the yard porter who was trying to lock it
with a last desperate effort dolokhov pushed the porter aside  and when anatole ran back seized him by the arm  pulled him through the wicket  and ran back with him to the troyka
marya dmitrievna  having found sonya weeping in the corridor  made her confess everything  and intercepting the note to natasha she read it and went into natasha s room with it in her hand
 you shameless good for nothing   said she
 i won t hear a word   pushing back natasha who looked at her with astonished but tearless eyes  she locked her in  and having given orders to the yard porter to admit the persons who would be coming that evening  but not to let them out again  and having told the footman to bring them up to her  she seated herself in the drawing room to await the abductors
when gabriel came to inform her that the men who had come had run away again  she rose frowning  and clasping her hands behind her paced through the rooms a long time considering what she should do toward midnight she went to natasha s room fingering the key in her pocket
sonya was sitting sobbing in the corridor
 marya dmitrievna  for god s sake let me in to her   she pleaded  but marya dmitrievna unlocked the door and went in without giving her an answer   
 disgusting  abominable  
in my house  
horrid girl  hussy  i m only sorry for her father   thought she  trying to restrain her wrath
 hard as it may be  i ll tell them all to hold their tongues and will hide it from the count   she entered the room with resolute steps
natasha lying on the sofa  her head hidden in her hands  and she did not stir
she was in just the same position in which marya dmitrievna had left her
 a nice girl  very nice   said marya dmitrievna
 arranging meetings with lovers in my house  it s no use pretending  you listen when i speak to you   and marya dmitrievna touched her arm
 listen when i speak  you ve disgraced yourself like the lowest of hussies
i d treat you differently  but i m sorry for your father  so i will conceal it   natasha did not change her position  but her whole body heaved with noiseless  convulsive sobs which choked her
marya dmitrievna glanced round at sonya and seated herself on the sofa beside natasha
 it s lucky for him that he escaped me  but i ll find him   she said in her rough voice
 do you hear what i am saying or not   she added
she put her large hand under natasha s face and turned it toward her
both marya dmitrievna and sonya were amazed when they saw how natasha looked
her eyes were dry and glistening  her lips compressed  her cheeks sunken
 let me be   
what is it to me   
i shall die   she muttered  wrenching herself from marya dmitrievna s hands with a vicious effort and sinking down again into her former position
 natalie   said marya dmitrievna
 i wish for your good
lie still  stay like that then  i won t touch you
but listen
i won t tell you how guilty you are
you know that yourself
but when your father comes back tomorrow what am i to tell him  eh   again natasha s body shook with sobs
 suppose he finds out  and your brother  and your betrothed    i have no betrothed  i have refused him   cried natasha
 that s all the same   continued marya dmitrievna
 if they hear of this  will they let it pass  he  your father  i know him  
if he challenges him to a duel will that be all right  eh    oh  let me be  why have you interfered at all  why  why  who asked you to   shouted natasha  raising herself on the sofa and looking malignantly at marya dmitrievna
 but what did you want   cried marya dmitrievna  growing angry again
 were you kept under lock and key  who hindered his coming to the house  why carry you off as if you were some gypsy singing girl   
well  if he had carried you off  
do you think they wouldn t have found him  your father  or brother  or your betrothed  and he s a scoundrel  a wretch that s a fact    he is better than any of you   exclaimed natasha getting up  if you hadn t interfered  
oh  my god  what is it all  what is it  sonya  why   
go away   and she burst into sobs with the despairing vehemence with which people bewail disasters they feel they have themselves occasioned marya dmitrievna was to speak again but natasha cried out   go away  go away  you all hate and despise me   and she threw herself back on the sofa
marya dmitrievna went on admonishing her for some time  enjoining on her that it must all be kept from her father and assuring her that nobody would know anything about it if only natasha herself would undertake to forget it all and not let anyone see that something had happened
natasha did not reply  nor did she sob any longer  but she grew cold and had a shivering fit
marya dmitrievna put a pillow under her head  covered her with two quilts  and herself brought her some lime flower water  but natasha did not respond to her
 well  let her sleep   said marya dmitrievna as she went out of the room supposing natasha to be asleep
but natasha was not asleep  with pale face and fixed wide open eyes she looked straight before her
all that night she did not sleep or weep and did not speak to sonya who got up and went to her several times
next day count rostov returned from his estate near moscow in time for lunch as he had promised
he was in very good spirits  the affair with the purchaser was going on satisfactorily  and there was nothing to keep him any longer in moscow  away from the countess whom he missed
marya dmitrievna met him and told him that natasha had been very unwell the day before and that they had sent for the doctor  but that she was better now
natasha had not left her room that morning
with compressed and parched lips and dry fixed eyes  she sat at the window  uneasily watching the people who drove past and hurriedly glancing round at anyone who entered the room
she was evidently expecting news of him and that he would come or would write to her
when the count came to see her she turned anxiously round at the sound of a man s footstep  and then her face resumed its cold and malevolent expression
she did not even get up to greet him
 what is the matter with you  my angel  are you ill   asked the count
after a moment s silence natasha answered   yes  ill   in reply to the count s anxious inquiries as to why she was so dejected and whether anything had happened to her betrothed  she assured him that nothing had happened and asked him not to worry
marya dmitrievna confirmed natasha s assurances that nothing had happened
from the pretense of illness  from his daughter s distress  and by the embarrassed faces of sonya and marya dmitrievna  the count saw clearly that something had gone wrong during his absence  but it was so terrible for him to think that anything disgraceful had happened to his beloved daughter  and he so prized his own cheerful tranquillity  that he avoided inquiries and tried to assure himself that nothing particularly had happened  and he was only dissatisfied that her indisposition delayed their return to the country from the day his wife arrived in moscow pierre had been intending to go away somewhere  so as not to be near her
soon after the rostovs came to moscow the effect natasha had on him made him hasten to carry out his intention
he went to tver to see joseph alexeevich s widow  who had long since promised to hand over to him some papers of her deceased husband s
when he returned to moscow pierre was handed a letter from marya dmitrievna asking him to come and see her on a matter of great importance relating to andrew bolkonski and his betrothed
pierre had been avoiding natasha because it seemed to him that his feeling for her was stronger than a married man s should be for his friend s fiancee
yet some fate constantly threw them together
 what can have happened  and what can they want with me   thought he as he dressed to go to marya dmitrievna s
 if only prince andrew would hurry up and come and marry her   thought he on his way to the house
on the tverskoy boulevard a familiar voice called to him
 pierre  been back long   someone shouted
pierre raised his head
in a sleigh drawn by two gray trotting horses that were bespattering the dashboard with snow  anatole and his constant companion makarin dashed past
anatole was sitting upright in the classic pose of military dandies  the lower part of his face hidden by his beaver collar and his head slightly bent
his face was fresh and rosy  his white plumed hat  tilted to one side  disclosed his curled and pomaded hair besprinkled with powdery snow
 yes  indeed  that s a true sage   thought pierre
 he sees nothing beyond the pleasure of the moment  nothing troubles him and so he is always cheerful  satisfied  and serene
what wouldn t i give to be like him   he thought enviously
in marya dmitrievna s anteroom the footman who helped him off with his fur coat said that the mistress asked him to come to her bedroom
when he opened the ballroom door pierre saw natasha sitting at the window  with a thin  pale  and spiteful face
she glanced round at him  frowned  and left the room with an expression of cold dignity
 what has happened   asked pierre  entering marya dmitrievna s room
 fine doings   answered dmitrievna
 for fifty eight years have i lived in this world and never known anything so disgraceful   and having put him on his honor not to repeat anything she told him  marya dmitrievna informed him that natasha had refused prince andrew without her parents  knowledge and that the cause of this was anatole kuragin into whose society pierre s wife had thrown her and with whom natasha had tried to elope during her father s absence  in order to be married secretly
pierre raised his shoulders and listened open mouthed to what was told him  scarcely able to believe his own ears
that prince andrew s deeply loved affianced wife the same natasha rostova who used to be so charming  should give up bolkonski for that fool anatole who was already secretly married  as pierre knew   and should be so in love with him as to agree to run away with him  was something pierre could not conceive and could not imagine
he could not reconcile the charming impression he had of natasha  whom he had known from a child  with this new conception of her baseness  folly  and cruelty
he thought of his wife
 they are all alike   he said to himself  reflecting that he was not the only man unfortunate enough to be tied to a bad woman but still he pitied prince andrew to the point of tears and sympathized with his wounded pride  and the more he pitied his friend the more did he think with contempt and even with disgust of that natasha who had just passed him in the ballroom with such a look of cold dignity
he did not know that natasha s soul was overflowing with despair  shame  and humiliation  and that it was not her fault that her face happened to assume an expression of calm dignity and severity
 but how get married   said pierre  in answer to marya dmitrievna
 he could not marry he is married    things get worse from hour to hour   ejaculated marya dmitrievna
 a nice youth  what a scoundrel  and she s expecting him expecting him since yesterday
she must be told  then at least she won t go on expecting him   after hearing the details of anatole s marriage from pierre  and giving vent to her anger against anatole in words of abuse  marya dmitrievna told pierre why she had sent for him
she was afraid that the count or bolkonski  who might arrive at any moment  if they knew of this affair  which she hoped to hide from them  might challenge anatole to a duel  and she therefore asked pierre to tell his brother in law in her name to leave moscow and not dare to let her set eyes on him again
pierre only now realizing the danger to the old count  nicholas  and prince andrew promised to do as she wished
having briefly and exactly explained her wishes to him  she let him go to the drawing room
 mind  the count knows nothing
behave as if you know nothing either   she said
 and i will go and tell her it is no use expecting him  and stay to dinner if you care to   she called after pierre
pierre met the old count  who seemed nervous and upset
that morning natasha had told him that she had rejected bolkonski
 troubles  troubles  my dear fellow   he said to pierre
 what troubles one has with these girls without their mother  i do so regret having come here   
i will be frank with you
have you heard she has broken off her engagement without consulting anybody  it s true this engagement never was much to my liking
of course he is an excellent man  but still  with his father s disapproval they wouldn t have been happy  and natasha won t lack suitors
still  it has been going on so long  and to take such a step without father s or mother s consent  and now she s ill  and god knows what  it s hard  count  hard to manage daughters in their mother s absence      pierre saw that the count was much upset and tried to change the subject  but the count returned to his troubles
sonya entered the room with an agitated face
 natasha is not quite well  she s in her room and would like to see you
marya dmitrievna is with her and she too asks you to come    yes  you are a great friend of bolkonski s  no doubt she wants to send him a message   said the count
 oh dear  oh dear  how happy it all was   and clutching the spare gray locks on his temples the count left the room
when marya dmitrievna told natasha that anatole was married  natasha did not wish to believe it and insisted on having it confirmed by pierre himself sonya told pierre this as she led him along the corridor to natasha s room
natasha  pale and stern  was sitting beside marya dmitrievna  and her eyes  glittering feverishly  met pierre with a questioning look the moment he entered
she did not smile or nod  but only gazed fixedly at him  and her look asked only one thing  was he a friend  or like the others an enemy in regard to anatole  as for pierre  he evidently did not exist for her
 he knows all about it   said marya dmitrievna pointing to pierre and addressing natasha
 let him tell you whether i have told the truth   natasha looked from one to the other as a hunted and wounded animal looks at the approaching dogs and sportsmen
 natalya ilynichna   pierre began  dropping his eyes with a feeling of pity for her and loathing for the thing he had to do   whether it is true or not should make no difference to you  because      then it is not true that he s married    yes  it is true    has he been married long   she asked
 on your honor      pierre gave his word of honor
 is he still here   she asked  quickly
 yes  i have just seen him   she was evidently unable to speak and made a sign with her hands that they should leave her alone
pierre did not stay for dinner  but left the room and went away at once
he drove through the town seeking anatole kuragin  at the thought of whom now the blood rushed to his heart and he felt a difficulty in breathing
he was not at the ice hills  nor at the gypsies   nor at komoneno s
pierre drove to the club
in the club all was going on as usual
the members who were assembling for dinner were sitting about in groups  they greeted pierre and spoke of the town news
the footman having greeted him  knowing his habits and his acquaintances  told him there was a place left for him in the small dining room and that prince michael zakharych was in the library  but paul timofeevich had not yet arrived
one of pierre s acquaintances  while they were talking about the weather  asked if he had heard of kuragin s abduction of rostova which was talked of in the town  and was it true  pierre laughed and said it was nonsense for he had just come from the rostovs 
he asked everyone about anatole
one man told him he had not come yet  and another that he was coming to dinner
pierre felt it strange to see this calm  indifferent crowd of people unaware of what was going on in his soul
he paced through the ballroom  waited till everyone had come  and as anatole had not turned up did not stay for dinner but drove home
anatole  for whom pierre was looking  dined that day with dolokhov  consulting him as to how to remedy this unfortunate affair
it seemed to him essential to see natasha
in the evening he drove to his sister s to discuss with her how to arrange a meeting
when pierre returned home after vainly hunting all over moscow  his valet informed him that prince anatole was with the countess
the countess  drawing room was full of guests
pierre without greeting his wife whom he had not seen since his return at that moment she was more repulsive to him than ever entered the drawing room and seeing anatole went up to him
 ah  pierre   said the countess going up to her husband
 you don t know what a plight our anatole     she stopped  seeing in the forward thrust of her husband s head  in his glowing eyes and his resolute gait  the terrible indications of that rage and strength which she knew and had herself experienced after his duel with dolokhov
 where you are  there is vice and evil   said pierre to his wife
 anatole  come with me  i must speak to you   he added in french
anatole glanced round at his sister and rose submissively  ready to follow pierre
pierre  taking him by the arm  pulled him toward himself and was leading him from the room  if you allow yourself in my drawing room     whispered helene  but pierre did not reply and went out of the room
anatole followed him with his usual jaunty step but his face betrayed anxiety
having entered his study pierre closed the door and addressed anatole without looking at him
 you promised countess rostova to marry her and were about to elope with her  is that so    mon cher   answered anatole  their whole conversation was in french    i don t consider myself bound to answer questions put to me in that tone   pierre s face  already pale  became distorted by fury
he seized anatole by the collar of his uniform with his big hand and shook him from side to side till anatole s face showed a sufficient degree of terror
 when i tell you that i must talk to you      repeated pierre
 come now  this is stupid
what   said anatole  fingering a button of his collar that had been wrenched loose with a bit of the cloth
 you re a scoundrel and a blackguard  and i don t know what deprives me from the pleasure of smashing your head with this   said pierre  expressing himself so artificially because he was talking french he took a heavy paperweight and lifted it threateningly  but at once put it back in its place
 did you promise to marry her    i  
i didn t think of it
i never promised  because     pierre interrupted him
 have you any letters of hers  any letters   he said  moving toward anatole
anatole glanced at him and immediately thrust his hand into his pocket and pierre took the letter anatole handed him and  pushing aside a table that stood in his way  threw himself on the sofa  i shan t be violent  don t be afraid   said pierre in answer to a frightened gesture of anatole s
 first  the letters   said he  as if repeating a lesson to himself  secondly   he continued after a short pause  again rising and again pacing the room   tomorrow you must get out of moscow    but how can i       thirdly   pierre continued without listening to him   you must never breathe a word of what has passed between you and countess rostova
i know i can t prevent your doing so  but if you have a spark of conscience     pierre paced the room several times in silence
anatole sat at a table frowning and biting his lips
 after all  you must understand that besides your pleasure there is such a thing as other people s happiness and peace  and that you are ruining a whole life for the sake of amusing yourself  amuse yourself with women like my wife  with them you are within your rights  for they know what you want of them
they are armed against you by the same experience of debauchery  but to promise a maid to marry her  
to deceive  to kidnap   
don t you understand that it is as mean as beating an old man or a child      pierre paused and looked at anatole no longer with an angry but with a questioning look
 i don t know about that  eh   said anatole  growing more confident as pierre mastered his wrath
 i don t know that and don t want to   he said  not looking at pierre and with a slight tremor of his lower jaw   but you have used such words to me  mean  and so on which as a man of honor i can t allow anyone to use   pierre glanced at him with amazement  unable to understand what he wanted
 though it was tête à tête   anatole continued   still i can t      is it satisfaction you want   said pierre ironically
 you could at least take back your words
what  if you want me to do as you wish  eh    i take them back  i take them back   said pierre   and i ask you to forgive me   pierre involuntarily glanced at the loose button
 and if you require money for your journey     anatole smiled
the expression of that base and cringing smile  which pierre knew so well in his wife  revolted him
 oh  vile and heartless brood   he exclaimed  and left the room
next day anatole left for petersburg
pierre drove to marya dmitrievna s to tell her of the fulfillment of her wish that kuragin should be banished from moscow
the whole house was in a state of alarm and commotion
natasha was very ill  having  as marya dmitrievna told him in secret  poisoned herself the night after she had been told that anatole was married  with some arsenic she had stealthily procured
after swallowing a little she had been so frightened that she woke sonya and told her what she had done
the necessary antidotes had been administered in time and she was now out of danger  though still so weak that it was out of the question to move her to the country  and so the countess had been sent for
pierre saw the distracted count  and sonya  who had a tear stained face  but he could not see natasha
pierre dined at the club that day and heard on all sides gossip about the attempted abduction of rostova
he resolutely denied these rumors  assuring everyone that nothing had happened except that his brother in law had proposed to her and been refused
it seemed to pierre that it was his duty to conceal the whole affair and re establish natasha s reputation
he was awaiting prince andrew s return with dread and went every day to the old prince s for news of him
old prince bolkonski heard all the rumors current in the town from mademoiselle bourienne and had read the note to princess mary in which natasha had broken off her engagement
he seemed in better spirits than usual and awaited his son with great impatience
some days after anatole s departure pierre received a note from prince andrew  informing him of his arrival and asking him to come to see him
as soon as he reached moscow  prince andrew had received from his father natasha s note to princess mary breaking off her engagement  mademoiselle bourienne had purloined it from princess mary and given it to the old prince   and he heard from him the story of natasha s elopement  with additions
prince andrew had arrived in the evening and pierre came to see him next morning
pierre expected to find prince andrew in almost the same state as natasha and was therefore surprised on entering the drawing room to hear him in the study talking in a loud animated voice about some intrigue going on in petersburg
the old prince s voice and another now and then interrupted him
princess mary came out to meet pierre
she sighed  looking toward the door of the room where prince andrew was  evidently intending to express her sympathy with his sorrow  but pierre saw by her face that she was glad both at what had happened and at the way her brother had taken the news of natasha s faithlessness
 he says he expected it   she remarked
 i know his pride will not let him express his feelings  but still he has taken it better  far better  than i expected
evidently it had to be       but is it possible that all is really ended   asked pierre
princess mary looked at him with astonishment
she did not understand how he could ask such a question
pierre went into the study
prince andrew  greatly changed and plainly in better health  but with a fresh horizontal wrinkle between his brows  stood in civilian dress facing his father and prince meshcherski  warmly disputing and vigorously gesticulating
the conversation was about speranski the news of whose sudden exile and alleged treachery had just reached moscow
 now he is censured and accused by all who were enthusiastic about him a month ago   prince andrew was saying   and by those who were unable to understand his aims to judge a man who is in disfavor and to throw on him all the blame of other men s mistakes is very easy  but i maintain that if anything good has been accomplished in this reign it was done by him  by him alone   he paused at the sight of pierre
his face quivered and immediately assumed a vindictive expression
 posterity will do him justice   he concluded  and at once turned to pierre
 well  how are you  still getting stouter   he said with animation  but the new wrinkle on his forehead deepened
 yes  i am well   he said in answer to pierre s question  and smiled
to pierre that smile said plainly   i am well  but my health is now of no use to anyone   after a few words to pierre about the awful roads from the polish frontier  about people he had met in switzerland who knew pierre  and about m
dessalles  whom he had brought from abroad to be his son s tutor  prince andrew again joined warmly in the conversation about speranski which was still going on between the two old men
 if there were treason  or proofs of secret relations with napoleon  they would have been made public   he said with warmth and haste
 i do not  and never did  like speranski personally  but i like justice   pierre now recognized in his friend a need with which he was only too familiar  to get excited and to have arguments about extraneous matters in order to stifle thoughts that were too oppressive and too intimate
when prince meshcherski had left  prince andrew took pierre s arm and asked him into the room that had been assigned him
a bed had been made up there  and some open portmanteaus and trunks stood about
prince andrew went to one and took out a small casket  from which he drew a packet wrapped in paper
he did it all silently and very quickly
he stood up and coughed
his face was gloomy and his lips compressed
 forgive me for troubling you     pierre saw that prince andrew was going to speak of natasha  and his broad face expressed pity and sympathy
this expression irritated prince andrew  and in a determined  ringing  and unpleasant tone he continued   i have received a refusal from countess rostova and have heard reports of your brother in law having sought her hand  or something of that kind
is that true    both true and untrue   pierre began  but prince andrew interrupted him
 here are her letters and her portrait   said he
he took the packet from the table and handed it to pierre
 give this to the countess  
if you see her    she is very ill   said pierre
 then she is here still   said prince andrew
 and prince kuragin   he added quickly
 he left long ago
she has been at death s door    i much regret her illness   said prince andrew  and he smiled like his father  coldly  maliciously  and unpleasantly
 so monsieur kuragin has not honored countess rostova with his hand   said prince andrew  and he snorted several times
 he could not marry  for he was married already   said pierre
prince andrew laughed disagreeably  again reminding one of his father
 and where is your brother in law now  if i may ask   he said
 he has gone to peters  
but i don t know   said pierre
 well  it doesn t matter   said prince andrew
 tell countess rostova that she was and is perfectly free and that i wish her all that is good   pierre took the packet
prince andrew  as if trying to remember whether he had something more to say  or waiting to see if pierre would say anything  looked fixedly at him
 i say  do you remember our discussion in petersburg   asked pierre   about      yes   returned prince andrew hastily
 i said that a fallen woman should be forgiven  but i didn t say i could forgive her
i can t    but can this be compared      said pierre
prince andrew interrupted him and cried sharply   yes  ask her hand again  be magnanimous  and so on   
yes  that would be very noble  but i am unable to follow in that gentleman s footsteps
if you wish to be my friend never speak to me of that  
of all that  well  good by
so you ll give her the packet   pierre left the room and went to the old prince and princess mary
the old man seemed livelier than usual
princess mary was the same as always  but beneath her sympathy for her brother  pierre noticed her satisfaction that the engagement had been broken off
looking at them pierre realized what contempt and animosity they all felt for the rostovs  and that it was impossible in their presence even to mention the name of her who could give up prince andrew for anyone else
at dinner the talk turned on the war  the approach of which was becoming evident
prince andrew talked incessantly  arguing now with his father  now with the swiss tutor dessalles  and showing an unnatural animation  the cause of which pierre so well understood
that same evening pierre went to the rostovs  to fulfill the commission entrusted to him
natasha was in bed  the count at the club  and pierre  after giving the letters to sonya  went to marya dmitrievna who was interested to know how prince andrew had taken the news
ten minutes later sonya came to marya dmitrievna
 natasha insists on seeing count peter kirilovich   said she
 but how  are we to take him up to her  the room there has not been tidied up    no  she has dressed and gone into the drawing room   said sonya
marya dmitrievna only shrugged her shoulders
 when will her mother come  she has worried me to death  now mind  don t tell her everything   said she to pierre
 one hasn t the heart to scold her  she is so much to be pitied  so much to be pitied   natasha was standing in the middle of the drawing room  emaciated  with a pale set face  but not at all shamefaced as pierre expected to find her
when he appeared at the door she grew flurried  evidently undecided whether to go to meet him or to wait till he came up
pierre hastened to her
he thought she would give him her hand as usual  but she  stepping up to him  stopped  breathing heavily  her arms hanging lifelessly just in the pose she used to stand in when she went to the middle of the ballroom to sing  but with quite a different expression of face  peter kirilovich   she began rapidly   prince bolkonski was your friend is your friend   she corrected herself
 it seemed to her that everything that had once been must now be different    he told me once to apply to you     pierre sniffed as he looked at her  but did not speak
till then he had reproached her in his heart and tried to despise her  but he now felt so sorry for her that there was no room in his soul for reproach
 he is here now  tell him  
to for  
forgive me   she stopped and breathed still more quickly  but did not shed tears
 yes  
i will tell him   answered pierre   but     he did not know what to say
natasha was evidently dismayed at the thought of what he might think she had meant
 no  i know all is over   she said hurriedly
 no  that can never be
i m only tormented by the wrong i have done him
tell him only that i beg him to forgive  forgive  forgive me for everything      she trembled all over and sat down on a chair
a sense of pity he had never before known overflowed pierre s heart
 i will tell him  i will tell him everything once more   said pierre
 but  
i should like to know one thing       know what   natasha s eyes asked
 i should like to know  did you love     pierre did not know how to refer to anatole and flushed at the thought of him  did you love that bad man    don t call him bad   said natasha
 but i don t know  don t know at all      she began to cry and a still greater sense of pity  tenderness  and love welled up in pierre
he felt the tears trickle under his spectacles and hoped they would not be noticed
 we won t speak of it any more  my dear   said pierre  and his gentle  cordial tone suddenly seemed very strange to natasha
 we won t speak of it  my dear i ll tell him everything  but one thing i beg of you  consider me your friend and if you want help  advice  or simply to open your heart to someone not now  but when your mind is clearer think of me   he took her hand and kissed it
 i shall be happy if it s in my power     pierre grew confused
 don t speak to me like that
i am not worth it   exclaimed natasha and turned to leave the room  but pierre held her hand
he knew he had something more to say to her
but when he said it he was amazed at his own words
 stop  stop  you have your whole life before you   said he to her
 before me  no  all is over for me   she replied with shame and self abasement
 all over   he repeated
 if i were not myself  but the handsomest  cleverest  and best man in the world  and were free  i would this moment ask on my knees for your hand and your love   for the first time for many days natasha wept tears of gratitude and tenderness  and glancing at pierre she went out of the room
pierre too when she had gone almost ran into the anteroom  restraining tears of tenderness and joy that choked him  and without finding the sleeves of his fur cloak threw it on and got into his sleigh
 where to now  your excellency   asked the coachman
 where to   pierre asked himself  where can i go now  surely not to the club or to pay calls   all men seemed so pitiful  so poor  in comparison with this feeling of tenderness and love he experienced  in comparison with that softened  grateful  last look she had given him through her tears
 home   said pierre  and despite twenty two degrees of frost fahrenheit he threw open the bearskin cloak from his broad chest and inhaled the air with joy
it was clear and frosty
above the dirty  ill lit streets  above the black roofs  stretched the dark starry sky only looking up at the sky did pierre cease to feel how sordid and humiliating were all mundane things compared with the heights to which his soul had just been raised
at the entrance to the arbat square an immense expanse of dark starry sky presented itself to his eyes
almost in the center of it  above the prechistenka boulevard  surrounded and sprinkled on all sides by stars but distinguished from them all by its nearness to the earth  its white light  and its long uplifted tail  shone the enormous and brilliant comet of 1812 the comet which was said to portend all kinds of woes and the end of the world
in pierre  however  that comet with its long luminous tail aroused no feeling of fear
on the contrary he gazed joyfully  his eyes moist with tears  at this bright comet which  having traveled in its orbit with inconceivable velocity through immeasurable space  seemed suddenly  like an arrow piercing the earth to remain fixed in a chosen spot  vigorously holding its tail erect  shining and displaying its white light amid countless other scintillating stars
it seemed to pierre that this comet fully responded to what was passing in his own softened and uplifted soul  now blossoming into a new life
from the close of the year 1811 intensified arming and concentrating of the forces of western europe began  and in 1812 these forces millions of men  reckoning those transporting and feeding the army moved from the west eastwards to the russian frontier  toward which since 1811 russian forces had been similarly drawn
on the twelfth of june  1812  the forces of western europe crossed the russian frontier and war began  that is  an event took place opposed to human reason and to human nature
millions of men perpetrated against one another such innumerable crimes  frauds  treacheries  thefts  forgeries  issues of false money  burglaries  incendiarisms  and murders as in whole centuries are not recorded in the annals of all the law courts of the world  but which those who committed them did not at the time regard as being crimes what produced this extraordinary occurrence  what were its causes  the historians tell us with naive assurance that its causes were the wrongs inflicted on the duke of oldenburg  the nonobservance of the continental system  the ambition of napoleon  the firmness of alexander  the mistakes of the diplomatists  and so on
consequently  it would only have been necessary for metternich  rumyantsev  or talleyrand  between a levee and an evening party  to have taken proper pains and written a more adroit note  or for napoleon to have written to alexander   my respected brother  i consent to restore the duchy to the duke of oldenburg  and there would have been no war
we can understand that the matter seemed like that to contemporaries
it naturally seemed to napoleon that the war was caused by england s intrigues  as in fact he said on the island of st
helena 
it naturally seemed to members of the english parliament that the cause of the war was napoleon s ambition  to the duke of oldenburg  that the cause of the war was the violence done to him  to businessmen that the cause of the war was the continental system which was ruining europe  to the generals and old soldiers that the chief reason for the war was the necessity of giving them employment  to the legitimists of that day that it was the need of re establishing les bons principes  and to the diplomatists of that time that it all resulted from the fact that the alliance between russia and austria in 1809 had not been sufficiently well concealed from napoleon  and from the awkward wording of memorandum no
178
it is natural that these and a countless and infinite quantity of other reasons  the number depending on the endless diversity of points of view  presented themselves to the men of that day  but to us  to posterity who view the thing that happened in all its magnitude and perceive its plain and terrible meaning  these causes seem insufficient to us it is incomprehensible that millions of christian men killed and tortured each other either because napoleon was ambitious or alexander was firm  or because england s policy was astute or the duke of oldenburg wronged
we cannot grasp what connection such circumstances have with the actual fact of slaughter and violence  why because the duke was wronged  thousands of men from the other side of europe killed and ruined the people of smolensk and moscow and were killed by them to us  their descendants  who are not historians and are not carried away by the process of research and can therefore regard the event with unclouded common sense  an incalculable number of causes present themselves the deeper we delve in search of these causes the more of them we find  and each separate cause or whole series of causes appears to us equally valid in itself and equally false by its insignificance compared to the magnitude of the events  and by its impotence apart from the cooperation of all the other coincident causes to occasion the event
to us  the wish or objection of this or that french corporal to serve a second term appears as much a cause as napoleon s refusal to withdraw his troops beyond the vistula and to restore the duchy of oldenburg  for had he not wished to serve  and had a second  a third  and a thousandth corporal and private also refused  there would have been so many less men in napoleon s army and the war could not have occurred
had napoleon not taken offense at the demand that he should withdraw beyond the vistula  and not ordered his troops to advance  there would have been no war  but had all his sergeants objected to serving a second term then also there could have been no war
nor could there have been a war had there been no english intrigues and no duke of oldenburg  and had alexander not felt insulted  and had there not been an autocratic government in russia  or a revolution in france and a subsequent dictatorship and empire  or all the things that produced the french revolution  and so on
without each of these causes nothing could have happened
so all these causes myriads of causes  coincided to bring it about
and so there was no one cause for that occurrence  but it had to occur because it had to
millions of men  renouncing their human feelings and reason  had to go from west to east to slay their fellows  just as some centuries previously hordes of men had come from the east to the west  slaying their fellows
the actions of napoleon and alexander  on whose words the event seemed to hang  were as little voluntary as the actions of any soldier who was drawn into the campaign by lot or by conscription
this could not be otherwise  for in order that the will of napoleon and alexander  on whom the event seemed to depend  should be carried out  the concurrence of innumerable circumstances was needed without any one of which the event could not have taken place it was necessary that millions of men in whose hands lay the real power the soldiers who fired  or transported provisions and guns should consent to carry out the will of these weak individuals  and should have been induced to do so by an infinite number of diverse and complex causes
we are forced to fall back on fatalism as an explanation of irrational events  that is to say  events the reasonableness of which we do not understand 
the more we try to explain such events in history reasonably  the more unreasonable and incomprehensible do they become to us
each man lives for himself  using his freedom to attain his personal aims  and feels with his whole being that he can now do or abstain from doing this or that action  but as soon as he has done it  that action performed at a certain moment in time becomes irrevocable and belongs to history  in which it has not a free but a predestined significance there are two sides to the life of every man  his individual life  which is the more free the more abstract its interests  and his elemental hive life in which he inevitably obeys laws laid down for him
man lives consciously for himself  but is an unconscious instrument in the attainment of the historic  universal  aims of humanity a deed done is irrevocable  and its result coinciding in time with the actions of millions of other men assumes an historic significance
the higher a man stands on the social ladder  the more people he is connected with and the more power he has over others  the more evident is the predestination and inevitability of his every action
 the king s heart is in the hands of the lord   a king is history s slave
history  that is  the unconscious  general  hive life of mankind  uses every moment of the life of kings as a tool for its own purposes
though napoleon at that time  in 1812  was more convinced than ever that it depended on him  verser  ou ne pas verser  le sang de ses peuples   as alexander expressed it in the last letter he wrote him he had never been so much in the grip of inevitable laws  which compelled him  while thinking that he was acting on his own volition  to perform for the hive life that is to say  for history whatever had to be performed
   to shed  or not to shed  the blood of his peoples   the people of the west moved eastwards to slay their fellow men  and by the law of coincidence thousands of minute causes fitted in and co ordinated to produce that movement and war  reproaches for the nonobservance of the continental system  the duke of oldenburg s wrongs  the movement of troops into prussia undertaken  as it seemed to napoleon  only for the purpose of securing an armed peace  the french emperor s love and habit of war coinciding with his people s inclinations  allurement by the grandeur of the preparations  and the expenditure on those preparations and the need of obtaining advantages to compensate for that expenditure  the intoxicating honors he received in dresden  the diplomatic negotiations which  in the opinion of contemporaries  were carried on with a sincere desire to attain peace  but which only wounded the self love of both sides  and millions of other causes that adapted themselves to the event that was happening or coincided with it when an apple has ripened and falls  why does it fall  because of its attraction to the earth  because its stalk withers  because it is dried by the sun  because it grows heavier  because the wind shakes it  or because the boy standing below wants to eat it  nothing is the cause
all this is only the coincidence of conditions in which all vital organic and elemental events occur
and the botanist who finds that the apple falls because the cellular tissue decays and so forth is equally right with the child who stands under the tree and says the apple fell because he wanted to eat it and prayed for it
equally right or wrong is he who says that napoleon went to moscow because he wanted to  and perished because alexander desired his destruction  and he who says that an undermined hill weighing a million tons fell because the last navvy struck it for the last time with his mattock
in historic events the so called great men are labels giving names to events  and like labels they have but the smallest connection with the event itself
every act of theirs  which appears to them an act of their own will  is in an historical sense involuntary and is related to the whole course of history and predestined from eternity
on the twenty ninth of may napoleon left dresden  where he had spent three weeks surrounded by a court that included princes  dukes  kings  and even an emperor
before leaving  napoleon showed favor to the emperor  kings  and princes who had deserved it  reprimanded the kings and princes with whom he was dissatisfied  presented pearls and diamonds of his own that is  which he had taken from other kings to the empress of austria  and having  as his historian tells us  tenderly embraced the empress marie louise who regarded him as her husband  though he had left another wife in paris left her grieved by the parting which she seemed hardly able to bear
though the diplomatists still firmly believed in the possibility of peace and worked zealously to that end  and though the emperor napoleon himself wrote a letter to alexander  calling him monsieur mon frere  and sincerely assured him that he did not want war and would always love and honor him yet he set off to join his army  and at every station gave fresh orders to accelerate the movement of his troops from west to east he went in a traveling coach with six horses  surrounded by pages  aides de camp  and an escort  along the road to posen  thorn  danzig  and konigsberg
at each of these towns thousands of people met him with excitement and enthusiasm
the army was moving from west to east  and relays of six horses carried him in the same direction
on the tenth of june    coming up with the army  he spent the night in apartments prepared for him on the estate of a polish count in the vilkavisski forest
  old style
next day  overtaking the army  he went in a carriage to the niemen  and  changing into a polish uniform  he drove to the riverbank in order to select a place for the crossing
seeing  on the other side  some cossacks  les cosaques  and the wide  spreading steppes in the midst of which lay the holy city of moscow  moscou  la ville sainte   the capital of a realm such as the scythia into which alexander the great had marched napoleon unexpectedly  and contrary alike to strategic and diplomatic considerations  ordered an advance  and the next day his army began to cross the niemen
early in the morning of the twelfth of june he came out of his tent  which was pitched that day on the steep left bank of the niemen  and looked through a spyglass at the streams of his troops pouring out of the vilkavisski forest and flowing over the three bridges thrown across the river the troops  knowing of the emperor s presence  were on the lookout for him  and when they caught sight of a figure in an overcoat and a cocked hat standing apart from his suite in front of his tent on the hill  they threw up their caps and shouted   vive l empereur   and one after another poured in a ceaseless stream out of the vast forest that had concealed them and  separating  flowed on and on by the three bridges to the other side
 now we ll go into action
oh  when he takes it in hand himself  things get hot   by heaven   
there he is   
vive l empereur  so these are the steppes of asia  it s a nasty country all the same
au revoir  beauche  i ll keep the best palace in moscow for you  au revoir
good luck   
did you see the emperor  vive l empereur   
preur  if they make me governor of india  gerard  i ll make you minister of kashmir that s settled
vive l empereur  hurrah  hurrah  hurrah  the cossacks those rascals see how they run  vive l empereur  there he is  do you see him  i ve seen him twice  as i see you now
the little corporal  
i saw him give the cross to one of the veterans   
vive l empereur   came the voices of men  old and young  of most diverse characters and social positions
on the faces of all was one common expression of joy at the commencement of the long expected campaign and of rapture and devotion to the man in the gray coat who was standing on the hill
on the thirteenth of june a rather small  thoroughbred arab horse was brought to napoleon
he mounted it and rode at a gallop to one of the bridges over the niemen  deafened continually by incessant and rapturous acclamations which he evidently endured only because it was impossible to forbid the soldiers to express their love of him by such shouting  but the shouting which accompanied him everywhere disturbed him and distracted him from the military cares that had occupied him from the time he joined the army
he rode across one of the swaying pontoon bridges to the farther side  turned sharply to the left  and galloped in the direction of kovno  preceded by enraptured  mounted chasseurs of the guard who  breathless with delight  galloped ahead to clear a path for him through the troops
on reaching the broad river viliya  he stopped near a regiment of polish uhlans stationed by the river
 vivat   shouted the poles  ecstatically  breaking their ranks and pressing against one another to see him
napoleon looked up and down the river  dismounted  and sat down on a log that lay on the bank
at a mute sign from him  a telescope was handed him which he rested on the back of a happy page who had run up to him  and he gazed at the opposite bank
then he became absorbed in a map laid out on the logs
without lifting his head he said something  and two of his aides de camp galloped off to the polish uhlans
 what  what did he say   was heard in the ranks of the polish uhlans when one of the aides de camp rode up to them
the order was to find a ford and to cross the river
the colonel of the polish uhlans  a handsome old man  flushed and  fumbling in his speech from excitement  asked the aide de camp whether he would be permitted to swim the river with his uhlans instead of seeking a ford
in evident fear of refusal  like a boy asking for permission to get on a horse  he begged to be allowed to swim across the river before the emperor s eyes
the aide de camp replied that probably the emperor would not be displeased at this excess of zeal
as soon as the aide de camp had said this  the old mustached officer  with happy face and sparkling eyes  raised his saber  shouted  vivat   and  commanding the uhlans to follow him  spurred his horse and galloped into the river
he gave an angry thrust to his horse  which had grown restive under him  and plunged into the water  heading for the deepest part where the current was swift
hundreds of uhlans galloped in after him
it was cold and uncanny in the rapid current in the middle of the stream  and the uhlans caught hold of one another as they fell off their horses
some of the horses were drowned and some of the men  the others tried to swim on  some in the saddle and some clinging to their horses  manes
they tried to make their way forward to the opposite bank and  though there was a ford one third of a mile away  were proud that they were swimming and drowning in this river under the eyes of the man who sat on the log and was not even looking at what they were doing
when the aide de camp  having returned and choosing an opportune moment  ventured to draw the emperor s attention to the devotion of the poles to his person  the little man in the gray overcoat got up and  having summoned berthier  began pacing up and down the bank with him  giving him instructions and occasionally glancing disapprovingly at the drowning uhlans who distracted his attention
for him it was no new conviction that his presence in any part of the world  from africa to the steppes of muscovy alike  was enough to dumfound people and impel them to insane self oblivion
he called for his horse and rode to his quarters
some forty uhlans were drowned in the river  though boats were sent to their assistance
the majority struggled back to the bank from which they had started
the colonel and some of his men got across and with difficulty clambered out on the further bank
and as soon as they had got out  in their soaked and streaming clothes  they shouted  vivat   and looked ecstatically at the spot where napoleon had been but where he no longer was and at that moment considered themselves happy that evening  between issuing one order that the forged russian paper money prepared for use in russia should be delivered as quickly as possible and another that a saxon should be shot  on whom a letter containing information about the orders to the french army had been found  napoleon also gave instructions that the polish colonel who had needlessly plunged into the river should be enrolled in the legion d honneur of which napoleon was himself the head quos vult perdere dementat
    those whom  god  wishes to destroy he drives mad
the emperor of russia had  meanwhile  been in vilna for more than a month  reviewing troops and holding maneuvers
nothing was ready for the war that everyone expected and to prepare for which the emperor had come from petersburg
there was no general plan of action
the vacillation between the various plans that were proposed had even increased after the emperor had been at headquarters for a month
each of the three armies had its own commander in chief  but there was no supreme commander of all the forces  and the emperor did not assume that responsibility himself the longer the emperor remained in vilna the less did everybody tired of waiting prepare for the war
all the efforts of those who surrounded the sovereign seemed directed merely to making him spend his time pleasantly and forget that war was impending
in june  after many balls and fetes given by the polish magnates  by the courtiers  and by the emperor himself  it occurred to one of the polish aides  de camp in attendance that a dinner and ball should be given for the emperor by his aides de camp this idea was eagerly received
the emperor gave his consent
the aides de camp collected money by subscription
the lady who was thought to be most pleasing to the emperor was invited to act as hostess
count bennigsen  being a landowner in the vilna province  offered his country house for the fete  and the thirteenth of june was fixed for a ball  dinner  regatta  and fireworks at zakret  count bennigsen s country seat
the very day that napoleon issued the order to cross the niemen  and his vanguard  driving off the cossacks  crossed the russian frontier  alexander spent the evening at the entertainment given by his aides de camp at bennigsen s country house
it was a gay and brilliant fete
connoisseurs of such matters declared that rarely had so many beautiful women been assembled in one place
countess bezukhova was present among other russian ladies who had followed the sovereign from petersburg to vilna and eclipsed the refined polish ladies by her massive  so called russian type of beauty
the emperor noticed her and honored her with a dance
boris drubetskoy  having left his wife in moscow and being for the present en garcon  as he phrased it   was also there and  though not an aide de camp  had subscribed a large sum toward the expenses
boris was now a rich man who had risen to high honors and no longer sought patronage but stood on an equal footing with the highest of those of his own age
he was meeting helene in vilna after not having seen her for a long time and did not recall the past  but as helene was enjoying the favors of a very important personage and boris had only recently married  they met as good friends of long standing
at midnight dancing was still going on
helene  not having a suitable partner  herself offered to dance the mazurka with boris
they were the third couple
boris  coolly looking at helene s dazzling bare shoulders which emerged from a dark  gold embroidered  gauze gown  talked to her of old acquaintances and at the same time  unaware of it himself and unnoticed by others  never for an instant ceased to observe the emperor who was in the same room the emperor was not dancing  he stood in the doorway  stopping now one pair and now another with gracious words which he alone knew how to utter
as the mazurka began  boris saw that adjutant general balashev  one of those in closest attendance on the emperor  went up to him and contrary to court etiquette stood near him while he was talking to a polish lady
having finished speaking to her  the emperor looked inquiringly at balashev and  evidently understanding that he only acted thus because there were important reasons for so doing  nodded slightly to the lady and turned to him
hardly had balashev begun to speak before a look of amazement appeared on the emperor s face
he took balashev by the arm and crossed the room with him  unconsciously clearing a path seven yards wide as the people on both sides made way for him
boris noticed arakcheev s excited face when the sovereign went out with balashev
arakcheev looked at the emperor from under his brow and  sniffing with his red nose  stepped forward from the crowd as if expecting the emperor to address him
 boris understood that arakcheev envied balashev and was displeased that evidently important news had reached the emperor otherwise than through himself   but the emperor and balashev passed out into the illuminated garden without noticing arakcheev who  holding his sword and glancing wrathfully around  followed some twenty paces behind them all the time boris was going through the figures of the mazurka  he was worried by the question of what news balashev had brought and how he could find it out before others
in the figure in which he had to choose two ladies  he whispered to helene that he meant to choose countess potocka who  he thought  had gone out onto the veranda  and glided over the parquet to the door opening into the garden  where  seeing balashev and the emperor returning to the veranda  he stood still
they were moving toward the door
boris  fluttering as if he had not had time to withdraw  respectfully pressed close to the doorpost with bowed head
the emperor  with the agitation of one who has been personally affronted  was finishing with these words   to enter russia without declaring war  i will not make peace as long as a single armed enemy remains in my country   it seemed to boris that it gave the emperor pleasure to utter these words
he was satisfied with the form in which he had expressed his thoughts  but displeased that boris had overheard it
 let no one know of it   the emperor added with a frown
boris understood that this was meant for him and  closing his eyes  slightly bowed his head
the emperor re entered the ballroom and remained there about another half hour
boris was thus the first to learn the news that the french army had crossed the niemen and  thanks to this  was able to show certain important personages that much that was concealed from others was usually known to him  and by this means he rose higher in their estimation
the unexpected news of the french having crossed the niemen was particularly startling after a month of unfulfilled expectations  and at a ball
on first receiving the news  under the influence of indignation and resentment the emperor had found a phrase that pleased him  fully expressed his feelings  and has since become famous
on returning home at two o clock that night he sent for his secretary  shishkov  and told him to write an order to the troops and a rescript to field marshal prince saltykov  in which he insisted on the words being inserted that he would not make peace so long as a single armed frenchman remained on russian soil
next day the following letter was sent to napoleon  monsieur mon frere  yesterday i learned that  despite the loyalty with which i have kept my engagements with your majesty  your troops have crossed the russian frontier  and i have this moment received from petersburg a note  in which count lauriston informs me  as a reason for this aggression  that your majesty has considered yourself to be in a state of war with me from the time prince kuragin asked for his passports the reasons on which the duc de bassano based his refusal to deliver them to him would never have led me to suppose that that could serve as a pretext for aggression
in fact  the ambassador  as he himself has declared  was never authorized to make that demand  and as soon as i was informed of it i let him know how much i disapproved of it and ordered him to remain at his post if your majesty does not intend to shed the blood of our peoples for such a misunderstanding  and consents to withdraw your troops from russian territory  i will regard what has passed as not having occurred and an understanding between us will be possible
in the contrary case  your majesty  i shall see myself forced to repel an attack that nothing on my part has provoked
it still depends on your majesty to preserve humanity from the calamity of another war
i am  etc    signed  alexander at two in the morning of the fourteenth of june  the emperor  having sent for balashev and read him his letter to napoleon  ordered him to take it and hand it personally to the french emperor
when dispatching balashev  the emperor repeated to him the words that he would not make peace so long as a single armed enemy remained on russian soil and told him to transmit those words to napoleon
alexander did not insert them in his letter to napoleon  because with his characteristic tact he felt it would be injudicious to use them at a moment when a last attempt at reconciliation was being made  but he definitely instructed balashev to repeat them personally to napoleon
having set off in the small hours of the fourteenth  accompanied by a bugler and two cossacks  balashev reached the french outposts at the village of rykonty  on the russian side of the niemen  by dawn
there he was stopped by french cavalry sentinels
a french noncommissioned officer of hussars  in crimson uniform and a shaggy cap  shouted to the approaching balashev to halt balashev did not do so at once  but continued to advance along the road at a walking pace
the noncommissioned officer frowned and  muttering words of abuse  advanced his horse s chest against balashev  put his hand to his saber  and shouted rudely at the russian general  asking  was he deaf that he did not do as he was told  balashev mentioned who he was
the noncommissioned officer began talking with his comrades about regimental matters without looking at the russian general after living at the seat of the highest authority and power  after conversing with the emperor less than three hours before  and in general being accustomed to the respect due to his rank in the service  balashev found it very strange here on russian soil to encounter this hostile  and still more this disrespectful  application of brute force to himself the sun was only just appearing from behind the clouds  the air was fresh and dewy
a herd of cattle was being driven along the road from the village  and over the fields the larks rose trilling  one after another  like bubbles rising in water
balashev looked around him  awaiting the arrival of an officer from the village
the russian cossacks and bugler and the french hussars looked silently at one another from time to time
a french colonel of hussars  who had evidently just left his bed  came riding from the village on a handsome sleek gray horse  accompanied by two hussars
the officer  the soldiers  and their horses all looked smart and well kept
it was that first period of a campaign when troops are still in full trim  almost like that of peacetime maneuvers  but with a shade of martial swagger in their clothes  and a touch of the gaiety and spirit of enterprise which always accompany the opening of a campaign
the french colonel with difficulty repressed a yawn  but was polite and evidently understood balashev s importance
he led him past his soldiers and behind the outposts and told him that his wish to be presented to the emperor would most likely be satisfied immediately  as the emperor s quarters were  he believed  not far off
they rode through the village of rykonty  past tethered french hussar horses  past sentinels and men who saluted their colonel and stared with curiosity at a russian uniform  and came out at the other end of the village
the colonel said that the commander of the division was a mile and a quarter away and would receive balashev and conduct him to his destination
the sun had by now risen and shone gaily on the bright verdure
they had hardly ridden up a hill  past a tavern  before they saw a group of horsemen coming toward them
in front of the group  on a black horse with trappings that glittered in the sun  rode a tall man with plumes in his hat and black hair curling down to his shoulders
he wore a red mantle  and stretched his long legs forward in french fashion this man rode toward balashev at a gallop  his plumes flowing and his gems and gold lace glittering in the bright june sunshine balashev was only two horses  length from the equestrian with the bracelets  plumes  necklaces  and gold embroidery  who was galloping toward him with a theatrically solemn countenance  when julner  the french colonel  whispered respectfully   the king of naples   it was  in fact  murat  now called  king of naples   though it was quite incomprehensible why he should be king of naples  he was called so  and was himself convinced that he was so  and therefore assumed a more solemn and important air than formerly he was so sure that he really was the king of naples that when  on the eve of his departure from that city  while walking through the streets with his wife  some italians called out to him   viva il re     he turned to his wife with a pensive smile and said   poor fellows  they don t know that i am leaving them tomorrow      long live the king   but though he firmly believed himself to be king of naples and pitied the grief felt by the subjects he was abandoning  latterly  after he had been ordered to return to military service and especially since his last interview with napoleon in danzig  when his august brother in law had told him   i made you king that you should reign in my way  but not in yours   he had cheerfully taken up his familiar business  and like a well fed but not overfat horse that feels himself in harness and grows skittish between the shafts he dressed up in clothes as variegated and expensive as possible  and gaily and contentedly galloped along the roads of poland  without himself knowing why or whither on seeing the russian general he threw back his head  with its long hair curling to his shoulders  in a majestically royal manner  and looked inquiringly at the french colonel
the colonel respectfully informed his majesty of balashev s mission  whose name he could not pronounce
 de bal macheve   said the king  overcoming by his assurance the difficulty that had presented itself to the colonel 
 charmed to make your acquaintance  general   he added  with a gesture of kingly condescension
as soon as the king began to speak loud and fast his royal dignity instantly forsook him  and without noticing it he passed into his natural tone of good  natured familiarity
he laid his hand on the withers of balashev s horse and said   well  general  it all looks like war   as if regretting a circumstance of which he was unable to judge  your majesty   replied balashev   my master  the emperor  does not desire war and as your majesty sees     said balashev  using the words your majesty at every opportunity  with the affectation unavoidable in frequently addressing one to whom the title was still a novelty
murat s face beamed with stupid satisfaction as he listened to  monsieur de bal macheve   but royaute oblige    and he felt it incumbent on him  as a king and an ally  to confer on state affairs with alexander s envoy
he dismounted  took balashev s arm  and moving a few steps away from his suite  which waited respectfully  began to pace up and down with him  trying to speak significantly
he referred to the fact that the emperor napoleon had resented the demand that he should withdraw his troops from prussia  especially when that demand became generally known and the dignity of france was thereby offended
   royalty has its obligations   balashev replied that there was  nothing offensive in the demand  because     but murat interrupted him
 then you don t consider the emperor alexander the aggressor   he asked unexpectedly  with a kindly and foolish smile
balashev told him why he considered napoleon to be the originator of the war
 oh  my dear general   murat again interrupted him   with all my heart i wish the emperors may arrange the affair between them  and that the war begun by no wish of mine may finish as quickly as possible   said he  in the tone of a servant who wants to remain good friends with another despite a quarrel between their masters
and he went on to inquiries about the grand duke and the state of his health  and to reminiscences of the gay and amusing times he had spent with him in naples
then suddenly  as if remembering his royal dignity  murat solemnly drew himself up  assumed the pose in which he had stood at his coronation  and  waving his right arm  said   i won t detain you longer  general i wish success to your mission   and with his embroidered red mantle  his flowing feathers  and his glittering ornaments  he rejoined his suite who were respectfully awaiting him
balashev rode on  supposing from murat s words that he would very soon be brought before napoleon himself but instead of that  at the next village the sentinels of davout s infantry corps detained him as the pickets of the vanguard had done  and an adjutant of the corps commander  who was fetched  conducted him into the village to marshal davout davout was to napoleon what arakcheev was to alexander though not a coward like arakcheev  he was as precise  as cruel  and as unable to express his devotion to his monarch except by cruelty
in the organism of states such men are necessary  as wolves are necessary in the organism of nature  and they always exist  always appear and hold their own  however incongruous their presence and their proximity to the head of the government may be
this inevitability alone can explain how the cruel arakcheev  who tore out a grenadier s mustache with his own hands  whose weak nerves rendered him unable to face danger  and who was neither an educated man nor a courtier  was able to maintain his powerful position with alexander  whose own character was chivalrous  noble  and gentle
balashev found davout seated on a barrel in the shed of a peasant s hut  writing he was auditing accounts
better quarters could have been found him  but marshal davout was one of those men who purposely put themselves in most depressing conditions to have a justification for being gloomy for the same reason they are always hard at work and in a hurry
 how can i think of the bright side of life when  as you see  i am sitting on a barrel and working in a dirty shed   the expression of his face seemed to say
the chief pleasure and necessity of such men  when they encounter anyone who shows animation  is to flaunt their own dreary  persistent activity
davout allowed himself that pleasure when balashev was brought in he became still more absorbed in his task when the russian general entered  and after glancing over his spectacles at balashev s face  which was animated by the beauty of the morning and by his talk with murat  he did not rise or even stir  but scowled still more and sneered malevolently
when he noticed in balashev s face the disagreeable impression this reception produced  davout raised his head and coldly asked what he wanted
thinking he could have been received in such a manner only because davout did not know that he was adjutant general to the emperor alexander and even his envoy to napoleon  balashev hastened to inform him of his rank and mission
contrary to his expectation  davout  after hearing him  became still surlier and ruder
 where is your dispatch   he inquired
 give it to me
i will send it to the emperor   balashev replied that he had been ordered to hand it personally to the emperor
 your emperor s orders are obeyed in your army  but here   said davout   you must do as you re told   and  as if to make the russian general still more conscious of his dependence on brute force  davout sent an adjutant to call the officer on duty
balashev took out the packet containing the emperor s letter and laid it on the table  made of a door with its hinges still hanging on it  laid across two barrels 
davout took the packet and read the inscription
 you are perfectly at liberty to treat me with respect or not   protested balashev   but permit me to observe that i have the honor to be adjutant general to his majesty      davout glanced at him silently and plainly derived pleasure from the signs of agitation and confusion which appeared on balashev s face
 you will be treated as is fitting   said he and  putting the packet in his pocket  left the shed
a minute later the marshal s adjutant  de castres  came in and conducted balashev to the quarters assigned him
that day he dined with the marshal  at the same board on the barrels
next day davout rode out early and  after asking balashev to come to him  peremptorily requested him to remain there  to move on with the baggage train should orders come for it to move  and to talk to no one except monsieur de castres
after four days of solitude  ennui  and consciousness of his impotence and insignificance particularly acute by contrast with the sphere of power in which he had so lately moved and after several marches with the marshal s baggage and the french army  which occupied the whole district  balashev was brought to vilna now occupied by the french through the very gate by which he had left it four days previously
next day the imperial gentleman in waiting  the comte de turenne  came to balashev and informed him of the emperor napoleon s wish to honor him with an audience
four days before  sentinels of the preobrazhensk regiment had stood in front of the house to which balashev was conducted  and now two french grenadiers stood there in blue uniforms unfastened in front and with shaggy caps on their heads  and an escort of hussars and uhlans and a brilliant suite of aides de camp  pages  and generals  who were waiting for napoleon to come out  were standing at the porch  round his saddle horse and his mameluke  rustan napoleon received balashev in the very house in vilna from which alexander had dispatched him on his mission
though balashev was used to imperial pomp  he was amazed at the luxury and magnificence of napoleon s court
the comte de turenne showed him into a big reception room where many generals  gentlemen in waiting  and polish magnates several of whom balashev had seen at the court of the emperor of russia were waiting
duroc said that napoleon would receive the russian general before going for his ride
after some minutes  the gentleman in waiting who was on duty came into the great reception room and  bowing politely  asked balashev to follow him
balashev went into a small reception room  one door of which led into a study  the very one from which the russian emperor had dispatched him on his mission
he stood a minute or two  waiting
he heard hurried footsteps beyond the door  both halves of it were opened rapidly  all was silent and then from the study the sound was heard of other steps  firm and resolute they were those of napoleon
he had just finished dressing for his ride  and wore a blue uniform  opening in front over a white waistcoat so long that it covered his rotund stomach  white leather breeches tightly fitting the fat thighs of his short legs  and hessian boots
his short hair had evidently just been brushed  but one lock hung down in the middle of his broad forehead
his plump white neck stood out sharply above the black collar of his uniform  and he smelled of eau de cologne
his full face  rather young looking  with its prominent chin  wore a gracious and majestic expression of imperial welcome
he entered briskly  with a jerk at every step and his head slightly thrown back
his whole short corpulent figure with broad thick shoulders  and chest and stomach involuntarily protruding  had that imposing and stately appearance one sees in men of forty who live in comfort
it was evident  too  that he was in the best of spirits that day
he nodded in answer to balashav s low and respectful bow  and coming up to him at once began speaking like a man who values every moment of his time and does not condescend to prepare what he has to say but is sure he will always say the right thing and say it well
 good day  general   said he
 i have received the letter you brought from the emperor alexander and am very glad to see you   he glanced with his large eyes into balashav s face and immediately looked past him
it was plain that balashev s personality did not interest him at all
evidently only what took place within his own mind interested him
nothing outside himself had any significance for him  because everything in the world  it seemed to him  depended entirely on his will  i do not  and did not  desire war   he continued   but it has been forced on me
even now   he emphasized the word   i am ready to receive any explanations you can give me   and he began clearly and concisely to explain his reasons for dissatisfaction with the russian government
judging by the calmly moderate and amicable tone in which the french emperor spoke  balashev was firmly persuaded that he wished for peace and intended to enter into negotiations
when napoleon  having finished speaking  looked inquiringly at the russian envoy  balashev began a speech he had prepared long before   sire  the emperor  my master     but the sight of the emperor s eyes bent on him confused him
 you are flurried compose yourself   napoleon seemed to say  as with a scarcely perceptible smile he looked at balashev s uniform and sword
balashev recovered himself and began to speak he said that the emperor alexander did not consider kurakin s demand for his passports a sufficient cause for war  that kurakin had acted on his own initiative and without his sovereign s assent  that the emperor alexander did not desire war  and had no relations with england
 not yet   interposed napoleon  and  as if fearing to give vent to his feelings  he frowned and nodded slightly as a sign that balashev might proceed
after saying all he had been instructed to say  balashev added that the emperor alexander wished for peace  but would not enter into negotiations except on condition that  
here balashev hesitated  he remembered the words the emperor alexander had not written in his letter  but had specially inserted in the rescript to saltykov and had told balashev to repeat to napoleon
balashev remembered these words   so long as a single armed foe remains on russian soil   but some complex feeling restrained him
he could not utter them  though he wished to do so
he grew confused and said   on condition that the french army retires beyond the niemen   napoleon noticed balashev s embarrassment when uttering these last words  his face twitched and the calf of his left leg began to quiver rhythmically
without moving from where he stood he began speaking in a louder tone and more hurriedly than before
during the speech that followed  balashev  who more than once lowered his eyes  involuntarily noticed the quivering of napoleon s left leg which increased the more napoleon raised his voice
 i desire peace  no less than the emperor alexander   he began
 have i not for eighteen months been doing everything to obtain it  i have waited eighteen months for explanations
but in order to begin negotiations  what is demanded of me   he said  frowning and making an energetic gesture of inquiry with his small white plump hand
 the withdrawal of your army beyond the niemen  sire   replied balashev
 the niemen   repeated napoleon
 so now you want me to retire beyond the niemen only the niemen   repeated napoleon  looking straight at balashev
the latter bowed his head respectfully
instead of the demand of four months earlier to withdraw from pomerania  only a withdrawal beyond the niemen was now demanded
napoleon turned quickly and began to pace the room
 you say the demand now is that i am to withdraw beyond the niemen before commencing negotiations  but in just the same way two months ago the demand was that i should withdraw beyond the vistula and the oder  and yet you are willing to negotiate   he went in silence from one corner of the room to the other and again stopped in front of balashev
balashev noticed that his left leg was quivering faster than before and his face seemed petrified in its stern expression
this quivering of his left leg was a thing napoleon was conscious of
 the vibration of my left calf is a great sign with me   he remarked at a later date
 such demands as to retreat beyond the vistula and oder may be made to a prince of baden  but not to me   napoleon almost screamed  quite to his own surprise
 if you gave me petersburg and moscow i could not accept such conditions
you say i have begun this war  but who first joined his army  the emperor alexander  not i  and you offer me negotiations when i have expended millions  when you are in alliance with england  and when your position is a bad one
you offer me negotiations  but what is the aim of your alliance with england  what has she given you   he continued hurriedly  evidently no longer trying to show the advantages of peace and discuss its possibility  but only to prove his own rectitude and power and alexander s errors and duplicity
the commencement of his speech had obviously been made with the intention of demonstrating the advantages of his position and showing that he was nevertheless willing to negotiate
but he had begun talking  and the more he talked the less could he control his words
the whole purport of his remarks now was evidently to exalt himself and insult alexander just what he had least desired at the commencement of the interview  i hear you have made peace with turkey   balashev bowed his head affirmatively
 peace has been concluded     he began
but napoleon did not let him speak
he evidently wanted to do all the talking himself  and continued to talk with the sort of eloquence and unrestrained irritability to which spoiled people are so prone  yes  i know you have made peace with the turks without obtaining moldavia and wallachia  i would have given your sovereign those provinces as i gave him finland
yes   he went on   i promised and would have given the emperor alexander moldavia and wallachia  and now he won t have those splendid provinces
yet he might have united them to his empire and in a single reign would have extended russia from the gulf of bothnia to the mouths of the danube
catherine the great could not have done more   said napoleon  growing more and more excited as he paced up and down the room  repeating to balashev almost the very words he had used to alexander himself at tilsit  all that  he would have owed to my friendship
oh  what a splendid reign   he repeated several times  then paused  drew from his pocket a gold snuffbox  lifted it to his nose  and greedily sniffed at it
 what a splendid reign the emperor alexander s might have been   he looked compassionately at balashev  and as soon as the latter tried to make some rejoinder hastily interrupted him
 what could he wish or look for that he would not have obtained through my friendship   demanded napoleon  shrugging his shoulders in perplexity
 but no  he has preferred to surround himself with my enemies  and with whom  with steins  armfeldts  bennigsens  and wintzingerodes  stein  a traitor expelled from his own country  armfeldt  a rake and an intriguer  wintzingerode  a fugitive french subject  bennigsen  rather more of a soldier than the others  but all the same an incompetent who was unable to do anything in 1807 and who should awaken terrible memories in the emperor alexander s mind    granted that were they competent they might be made use of   continued napoleon hardly able to keep pace in words with the rush of thoughts that incessantly sprang up  proving how right and strong he was  in his perception the two were one and the same   but they are not even that  they are neither fit for war nor peace  barclay is said to be the most capable of them all  but i cannot say so  judging by his first movements
and what are they doing  all these courtiers  pfuel proposes  armfeldt disputes  bennigsen considers  and barclay  called on to act  does not know what to decide on  and time passes bringing no result
bagration alone is a military man
he s stupid  but he has experience  a quick eye  and resolution   
and what role is your young monarch playing in that monstrous crowd  they compromise him and throw on him the responsibility for all that happens
a sovereign should not be with the army unless he is a general   said napoleon  evidently uttering these words as a direct challenge to the emperor
he knew how alexander desired to be a military commander
 the campaign began only a week ago  and you haven t even been able to defend vilna
you are cut in two and have been driven out of the polish provinces
your army is grumbling    on the contrary  your majesty   said balashev  hardly able to remember what had been said to him and following these verbal fireworks with difficulty   the troops are burning with eagerness      i know everything   napoleon interrupted him
 i know everything
i know the number of your battalions as exactly as i know my own
you have not two hundred thousand men  and i have three times that number
i give you my word of honor   said napoleon  forgetting that his word of honor could carry no weight  i give you my word of honor that i have five hundred and thirty thousand men this side of the vistula
the turks will be of no use to you  they are worth nothing and have shown it by making peace with you
as for the swedes it is their fate to be governed by mad kings
their king was insane and they changed him for another bernadotte  who promptly went mad for no swede would ally himself with russia unless he were mad   napoleon grinned maliciously and again raised his snuffbox to his nose balashev knew how to reply to each of napoleon s remarks  and would have done so  he continually made the gesture of a man wishing to say something  but napoleon always interrupted him
to the alleged insanity of the swedes  balashev wished to reply that when russia is on her side sweden is practically an island  but napoleon gave an angry exclamation to drown his voice
napoleon was in that state of irritability in which a man has to talk  talk  and talk  merely to convince himself that he is in the right balashev began to feel uncomfortable  as envoy he feared to demean his dignity and felt the necessity of replying  but  as a man  he shrank before the transport of groundless wrath that had evidently seized napoleon
he knew that none of the words now uttered by napoleon had any significance  and that napoleon himself would be ashamed of them when he came to his senses balashev stood with downcast eyes  looking at the movements of napoleon s stout legs and trying to avoid meeting his eyes
 but what do i care about your allies   said napoleon
 i have allies the poles
there are eighty thousand of them and they fight like lions
and there will be two hundred thousand of them   and probably still more perturbed by the fact that he had uttered this obvious falsehood  and that balashev still stood silently before him in the same attitude of submission to fate  napoleon abruptly turned round  drew close to balashev s face  and  gesticulating rapidly and energetically with his white hands  almost shouted   know that if you stir up prussia against me  i ll wipe it off the map of europe   he declared  his face pale and distorted by anger  and he struck one of his small hands energetically with the other
 yes  i will throw you back beyond the dvina and beyond the dnieper  and will re erect against you that barrier which it was criminal and blind of europe to allow to be destroyed
yes  that is what will happen to you
that is what you have gained by alienating me   and he walked silently several times up and down the room  his fat shoulders twitching
he put his snuffbox into his waistcoat pocket  took it out again  lifted it several times to his nose  and stopped in front of balashev
he paused  looked ironically straight into balashev s eyes  and said in a quiet voice   and yet what a splendid reign your master might have had   balashev  feeling it incumbent on him to reply  said that from the russian side things did not appear in so gloomy a light
napoleon was silent  still looking derisively at him and evidently not listening to him
balashev said that in russia the best results were expected from the war
napoleon nodded condescendingly  as if to say   i know it s your duty to say that  but you don t believe it yourself
i have convinced you   when balashev had ended  napoleon again took out his snuffbox  sniffed at it  and stamped his foot twice on the floor as a signal
the door opened  a gentleman in waiting  bending respectfully  handed the emperor his hat and gloves  another brought him a pocket handkerchief
napoleon  without giving them a glance  turned to balashev   assure the emperor alexander from me   said he  taking his hat   that i am as devoted to him as before  i know him thoroughly and very highly esteem his lofty qualities
i will detain you no longer  general  you shall receive my letter to the emperor   and napoleon went quickly to the door
everyone in the reception room rushed forward and descended the staircase
after all that napoleon had said to him those bursts of anger and the last dryly spoken words   i will detain you no longer  general  you shall receive my letter   balashev felt convinced that napoleon would not wish to see him  and would even avoid another meeting with him an insulted envoy  especially as he had witnessed his unseemly anger
but  to his surprise  balashev received  through duroc  an invitation to dine with the emperor that day
bessieres  caulaincourt  and berthier were present at that dinner
napoleon met balashev cheerfully and amiably
he not only showed no sign of constraint or self reproach on account of his outburst that morning  but  on the contrary  tried to reassure balashev
it was evident that he had long been convinced that it was impossible for him to make a mistake  and that in his perception whatever he did was right  not because it harmonized with any idea of right and wrong  but because he did it
the emperor was in very good spirits after his ride through vilna  where crowds of people had rapturously greeted and followed him
from all the windows of the streets through which he rode  rugs  flags  and his monogram were displayed  and the polish ladies  welcoming him  waved their handkerchiefs to him
at dinner  having placed balashev beside him  napoleon not only treated him amiably but behaved as if balashev were one of his own courtiers  one of those who sympathized with his plans and ought to rejoice at his success
in the course of conversation he mentioned moscow and questioned balashev about the russian capital  not merely as an interested traveler asks about a new city he intends to visit  but as if convinced that balashev  as a russian  must be flattered by his curiosity
 how many inhabitants are there in moscow  how many houses  is it true that moscow is called  holy moscow   how many churches are there in moscow   he asked
and receiving the reply that there were more than two hundred churches  he remarked   why such a quantity of churches    the russians are very devout   replied balashev
 but a large number of monasteries and churches is always a sign of the backwardness of a people   said napoleon  turning to caulaincourt for appreciation of this remark
balashev respectfully ventured to disagree with the french emperor
 every country has its own character   said he
 but nowhere in europe is there anything like that   said napoleon
 i beg your majesty s pardon   returned balashev   besides russia there is spain  where there are also many churches and monasteries   this reply of balashev s  which hinted at the recent defeats of the french in spain  was much appreciated when he related it at alexander s court  but it was not much appreciated at napoleon s dinner  where it passed unnoticed
the uninterested and perplexed faces of the marshals showed that they were puzzled as to what balashev s tone suggested
 if there is a point we don t see it  or it is not at all witty   their expressions seemed to say
so little was his rejoinder appreciated that napoleon did not notice it at all and naively asked balashev through what towns the direct road from there to moscow passed
balashev  who was on the alert all through the dinner  replied that just as  all roads lead to rome   so all roads lead to moscow  there were many roads  and  among them the road through poltava  which charles xii chose   balashev involuntarily flushed with pleasure at the aptitude of this reply  but hardly had he uttered the word poltava before caulaincourt began speaking of the badness of the road from petersburg to moscow and of his petersburg reminiscences
after dinner they went to drink coffee in napoleon s study  which four days previously had been that of the emperor alexander
napoleon sat down  toying with his sevres coffee cup  and motioned balashev to a chair beside him
napoleon was in that well known after dinner mood which  more than any reasoned cause  makes a man contented with himself and disposed to consider everyone his friend it seemed to him that he was surrounded by men who adored him  and he felt convinced that  after his dinner  balashev too was his friend and worshiper
napoleon turned to him with a pleasant  though slightly ironic  smile
 they tell me this is the room the emperor alexander occupied  strange  isn t it  general   he said  evidently not doubting that this remark would be agreeable to his hearer since it went to prove his  napoleon s  superiority to alexander
balashev made no reply and bowed his head in silence
 yes
four days ago in this room  wintzingerode and stein were deliberating   continued napoleon with the same derisive and self confident smile
 what i can t understand   he went on   is that the emperor alexander has surrounded himself with my personal enemies that i do not  
understand
has he not thought that i may do the same   and he turned inquiringly to balashev  and evidently this thought turned him back on to the track of his morning s anger  which was still fresh in him
 and let him know that i will do so   said napoleon  rising and pushing his cup away with his hand
 i ll drive all his wurttemberg  baden  and weimar relations out of germany   
yes
i ll drive them out
let him prepare an asylum for them in russia   balashev bowed his head with an air indicating that he would like to make his bow and leave  and only listened because he could not help hearing what was said to him
napoleon did not notice this expression  he treated balashev not as an envoy from his enemy  but as a man now fully devoted to him and who must rejoice at his former master s humiliation
 and why has the emperor alexander taken command of the armies  what is the good of that  war is my profession  but his business is to reign and not to command armies  why has he taken on himself such a responsibility   again napoleon brought out his snuffbox  paced several times up and down the room in silence  and then  suddenly and unexpectedly  went up to balashev and with a slight smile  as confidently  quickly  and simply as if he were doing something not merely important but pleasing to balashev  he raised his hand to the forty year old russian general s face and  taking him by the ear  pulled it gently  smiling with his lips only to have one s ear pulled by the emperor was considered the greatest honor and mark of favor at the french court
 well  adorer and courtier of the emperor alexander  why don t you say anything   said he  as if it was ridiculous  in his presence  to be the adorer and courtier of anyone but himself  napoleon  are the horses ready for the general   he added  with a slight inclination of his head in reply to balashev s bow
 let him have mine  he has a long way to go   the letter taken by balashev was the last napoleon sent to alexander
every detail of the interview was communicated to the russian monarch  and the war began  
after his interview with pierre in moscow  prince andrew went to petersburg  on business as he told his family  but really to meet anatole kuragin whom he felt it necessary to encounter
on reaching petersburg he inquired for kuragin but the latter had already left the city
pierre had warned his brother in law that prince andrew was on his track
anatole kuragin promptly obtained an appointment from the minister of war and went to join the army in moldavia
while in petersburg prince andrew met kutuzov  his former commander who was always well disposed toward him  and kutuzov suggested that he should accompany him to the army in moldavia  to which the old general had been appointed commander in chief
so prince andrew  having received an appointment on the headquarters staff  left for turkey
prince andrew did not think it proper to write and challenge kuragin
he thought that if he challenged him without some fresh cause it might compromise the young countess rostova and so he wanted to meet kuragin personally in order to find a fresh pretext for a duel
but he again failed to meet kuragin in turkey  for soon after prince andrew arrived  the latter returned to russia
in a new country  amid new conditions  prince andrew found life easier to bear
after his betrothed had broken faith with him which he felt the more acutely the more he tried to conceal its effects the surroundings in which he had been happy became trying to him  and the freedom and independence he had once prized so highly were still more so
not only could he no longer think the thoughts that had first come to him as he lay gazing at the sky on the field of austerlitz and had later enlarged upon with pierre  and which had filled his solitude at bogucharovo and then in switzerland and rome  but he even dreaded to recall them and the bright and boundless horizons they had revealed
he was now concerned only with the nearest practical matters unrelated to his past interests  and he seized on these the more eagerly the more those past interests were closed to him
it was as if that lofty  infinite canopy of heaven that had once towered above him had suddenly turned into a low  solid vault that weighed him down  in which all was clear  but nothing eternal or mysterious
of the activities that presented themselves to him  army service was the simplest and most familiar as a general on duty on kutuzov s staff  he applied himself to business with zeal and perseverance and surprised kutuzov by his willingness and accuracy in work not having found kuragin in turkey  prince andrew did not think it necessary to rush back to russia after him  but all the same he knew that however long it might be before he met kuragin  despite his contempt for him and despite all the proofs he deduced to convince himself that it was not worth stooping to a conflict with him he knew that when he did meet him he would not be able to resist calling him out  any more than a ravenous man can help snatching at food and the consciousness that the insult was not yet avenged  that his rancor was still unspent  weighed on his heart and poisoned the artificial tranquillity which he managed to obtain in turkey by means of restless  plodding  and rather vainglorious and ambitious activity
in the year 1812  when news of the war with napoleon reached bucharest  where kutuzov had been living for two months  passing his days and nights with a wallachian woman prince andrew asked kutuzov to transfer him to the western army
kutuzov  who was already weary of bolkonski s activity which seemed to reproach his own idleness  very readily let him go and gave him a mission to barclay de tolly
before joining the western army which was then  in may  encamped at drissa  prince andrew visited bald hills which was directly on his way  being only two miles off the smolensk highroad
during the last three years there had been so many changes in his life  he had thought  felt  and seen so much  having traveled both in the east and the west   that on reaching bald hills it struck him as strange and unexpected to find the way of life there unchanged and still the same in every detail
he entered through the gates with their stone pillars and drove up the avenue leading to the house as if he were entering an enchanted  sleeping castle
the same old stateliness  the same cleanliness  the same stillness reigned there  and inside there was the same furniture  the same walls  sounds  and smell  and the same timid faces  only somewhat older
princess mary was still the same timid  plain maiden getting on in years  uselessly and joylessly passing the best years of her life in fear and constant suffering
mademoiselle bourienne was the same coquettish  self satisfied girl  enjoying every moment of her existence and full of joyous hopes for the future
she had merely become more self confident  prince andrew thought
dessalles  the tutor he had brought from switzerland  was wearing a coat of russian cut and talking broken russian to the servants  but was still the same narrowly intelligent  conscientious  and pedantic preceptor
the old prince had changed in appearance only by the loss of a tooth  which left a noticeable gap on one side of his mouth  in character he was the same as ever  only showing still more irritability and skepticism as to what was happening in the world
little nicholas alone had changed
he had grown  become rosier  had curly dark hair  and  when merry and laughing  quite unconsciously lifted the upper lip of his pretty little mouth just as the little princess used to do
he alone did not obey the law of immutability in the enchanted  sleeping castle
but though externally all remained as of old  the inner relations of all these people had changed since prince andrew had seen them last
the household was divided into two alien and hostile camps  who changed their habits for his sake and only met because he was there
to the one camp belonged the old prince  mademoiselle bourienne  and the architect  to the other princess mary  dessalles  little nicholas  and all the old nurses and maids
during his stay at bald hills all the family dined together  but they were ill at ease and prince andrew felt that he was a visitor for whose sake an exception was being made and that his presence made them all feel awkward
involuntarily feeling this at dinner on the first day  he was taciturn  and the old prince noticing this also became morosely dumb and retired to his apartments directly after dinner
in the evening  when prince andrew went to him and  trying to rouse him  began to tell him of the young count kamensky s campaign  the old prince began unexpectedly to talk about princess mary  blaming her for her superstitions and her dislike of mademoiselle bourienne  who  he said  was the only person really attached to him
the old prince said that if he was ill it was only because of princess mary  that she purposely worried and irritated him  and that by indulgence and silly talk she was spoiling little prince nicholas
the old prince knew very well that he tormented his daughter and that her life was very hard  but he also knew that he could not help tormenting her and that she deserved it
 why does prince andrew  who sees this  say nothing to me about his sister  does he think me a scoundrel  or an old fool who  without any reason  keeps his own daughter at a distance and attaches this frenchwoman to himself  he doesn t understand  so i must explain it  and he must hear me out   thought the old prince and he began explaining why he could not put up with his daughter s unreasonable character
 if you ask me   said prince andrew  without looking up  he was censuring his father for the first time in his life    i did not wish to speak about it  but as you ask me i will give you my frank opinion
if there is any misunderstanding and discord between you and mary  i can t blame her for it at all
i know how she loves and respects you
since you ask me   continued prince andrew  becoming irritable as he was always liable to do of late  i can only say that if there are any misunderstandings they are caused by that worthless woman  who is not fit to be my sister s companion   the old man at first stared fixedly at his son  and an unnatural smile disclosed the fresh gap between his teeth to which prince andrew could not get accustomed
 what companion  my dear boy  eh  you ve already been talking it over  eh    father  i did not want to judge   said prince andrew  in a hard and bitter tone   but you challenged me  and i have said  and always shall say  that mary is not to blame  but those to blame the one to blame is that frenchwoman    ah  he has passed judgment  
passed judgement   said the old man in a low voice and  as it seemed to prince andrew  with some embarrassment  but then he suddenly jumped up and cried   be off  be off  let not a trace of you remain here      prince andrew wished to leave at once  but princess mary persuaded him to stay another day
that day he did not see his father  who did not leave his room and admitted no one but mademoiselle bourienne and tikhon  but asked several times whether his son had gone
next day  before leaving  prince andrew went to his son s rooms the boy  curly headed like his mother and glowing with health  sat on his knee  and prince andrew began telling him the story of bluebeard  but fell into a reverie without finishing the story
he thought not of this pretty child  his son whom he held on his knee  but of himself he sought in himself either remorse for having angered his father or regret at leaving home for the first time in his life on bad terms with him  and was horrified to find neither what meant still more to him was that he sought and did not find in himself the former tenderness for his son which he had hoped to reawaken by caressing the boy and taking him on his knee  well  go on   said his son
prince andrew  without replying  put him down from his knee and went out of the room
as soon as prince andrew had given up his daily occupations  and especially on returning to the old conditions of life amid which he had been happy  weariness of life overcame him with its former intensity  and he hastened to escape from these memories and to find some work as soon as possible
 so you ve decided to go  andrew   asked his sister
 thank god that i can   replied prince andrew
 i am very sorry you can t    why do you say that   replied princess mary
 why do you say that  when you are going to this terrible war  and he is so old  mademoiselle bourienne says he has been asking about you      as soon as she began to speak of that  her lips trembled and her tears began to fall
prince andrew turned away and began pacing the room
 ah  my god  my god  when one thinks who and what what trash can cause people misery   he said with a malignity that alarmed princess mary
she understood that when speaking of  trash  he referred not only to mademoiselle bourienne  the cause of her misery  but also to the man who had ruined his own happiness
 andrew  one thing i beg  i entreat of you   she said  touching his elbow and looking at him with eyes that shone through her tears
 i understand you   she looked down 
 don t imagine that sorrow is the work of men
men are his tools   she looked a little above prince andrew s head with the confident  accustomed look with which one looks at the place where a familiar portrait hangs
 sorrow is sent by him  not by men
men are his instruments  they are not to blame
if you think someone has wronged you  forget it and forgive  we have no right to punish
and then you will know the happiness of forgiving    if i were a woman i would do so  mary
that is a woman s virtue
but a man should not and cannot forgive and forget   he replied  and though till that moment he had not been thinking of kuragin  all his unexpended anger suddenly swelled up in his heart
 if mary is already persuading me to forgive  it means that i ought long ago to have punished him   he thought
and giving her no further reply  he began thinking of the glad vindictive moment when he would meet kuragin who he knew was now in the army
princess mary begged him to stay one day more  saying that she knew how unhappy her father would be if andrew left without being reconciled to him  but prince andrew replied that he would probably soon be back again from the army and would certainly write to his father  but that the longer he stayed now the more embittered their differences would become
 good bye  andrew  remember that misfortunes come from god  and men are never to blame   were the last words he heard from his sister when he took leave of her
 then it must be so   thought prince andrew as he drove out of the avenue from the house at bald hills
 she  poor innocent creature  is left to be victimized by an old man who has outlived his wits
the old man feels he is guilty  but cannot change himself my boy is growing up and rejoices in life  in which like everybody else he will deceive or be deceived
and i am off to the army
why  i myself don t know
i want to meet that man whom i despise  so as to give him a chance to kill and laugh at me   these conditions of life had been the same before  but then they were all connected  while now they had all tumbled to pieces
only senseless things  lacking coherence  presented themselves one after another to prince andrew s mind prince andrew reached the general headquarters of the army at the end of june
the first army  with which was the emperor  occupied the fortified camp at drissa  the second army was retreating  trying to effect a junction with the first one from which it was said to be cut off by large french forces
everyone was dissatisfied with the general course of affairs in the russian army  but no one anticipated any danger of invasion of the russian provinces  and no one thought the war would extend farther than the western  the polish  provinces
prince andrew found barclay de tolly  to whom he had been assigned  on the bank of the drissa
as there was not a single town or large village in the vicinity of the camp  the immense number of generals and courtiers accompanying the army were living in the best houses of the villages on both sides of the river  over a radius of six miles
barclay de tolly was quartered nearly three miles from the emperor
he received bolkonski stiffly and coldly and told him in his foreign accent that he would mention him to the emperor for a decision as to his employment  but asked him meanwhile to remain on his staff
anatole kuragin  whom prince andrew had hoped to find with the army  was not there
he had gone to petersburg  but prince andrew was glad to hear this
his mind was occupied by the interests of the center that was conducting a gigantic war  and he was glad to be free for a while from the distraction caused by the thought of kuragin
during the first four days  while no duties were required of him  prince andrew rode round the whole fortified camp and  by the aid of his own knowledge and by talks with experts  tried to form a definite opinion about it
but the question whether the camp was advantageous or disadvantageous remained for him undecided
already from his military experience and what he had seen in the austrian campaign  he had come to the conclusion that in war the most deeply considered plans have no significance and that all depends on the way unexpected movements of the enemy that cannot be foreseen are met  and on how and by whom the whole matter is handled
to clear up this last point for himself  prince andrew  utilizing his position and acquaintances  tried to fathom the character of the control of the army and of the men and parties engaged in it  and he deduced for himself the following of the state of affairs while the emperor had still been at vilna  the forces had been divided into three armies
first  the army under barclay de tolly  secondly  the army under bagration  and thirdly  the one commanded by tormasov
the emperor was with the first army  but not as commander in chief
in the orders issued it was stated  not that the emperor would take command  but only that he would be with the army
the emperor  moreover  had with him not a commander in  chief s staff but the imperial headquarters staff
in attendance on him was the head of the imperial staff  quartermaster general prince volkonski  as well as generals  imperial aides de camp  diplomatic officials  and a large number of foreigners  but not the army staff
besides these  there were in attendance on the emperor without any definite appointments  arakcheev  the ex minister of war  count bennigsen  the senior general in rank  the grand duke tsarevich constantine pavlovich  count rumyantsev  the chancellor  stein  a former prussian minister  armfeldt  a swedish general  pfuel  the chief author of the plan of campaign  paulucci  an adjutant general and sardinian emigre  wolzogen and many others
though these men had no military appointment in the army  their position gave them influence  and often a corps commander  or even the commander in chief  did not know in what capacity he was questioned by bennigsen  the grand duke  arakcheev  or prince volkonski  or was given this or that advice and did not know whether a certain order received in the form of advice emanated from the man who gave it or from the emperor and whether it had to be executed or not
but this was only the external condition  the essential significance of the presence of the emperor and of all these people  from a courtier s point of view  and in an emperor s vicinity all became courtiers   was clear to everyone
it was this  the emperor did not assume the title of commander in chief  but disposed of all the armies  the men around him were his assistants
arakcheev was a faithful custodian to enforce order and acted as the sovereign s bodyguard
bennigsen was a landlord in the vilna province who appeared to be doing the honors of the district  but was in reality a good general  useful as an adviser and ready at hand to replace barclay
the grand duke was there because it suited him to be
the ex minister stein was there because his advice was useful and the emperor alexander held him in high esteem personally
armfeldt virulently hated napoleon and was a general full of self confidence  a quality that always influenced alexander
paulucci was there because he was bold and decided in speech
the adjutants general were there because they always accompanied the emperor  and lastly and chiefly pfuel was there because he had drawn up the plan of campaign against napoleon and  having induced alexander to believe in the efficacy of that plan  was directing the whole business of the war
with pfuel was wolzogen  who expressed pfuel s thoughts in a more self confident to the point of despising everyone else  was able to do
besides these russians and foreigners who propounded new and unexpected ideas every day especially the foreigners  who did so with a boldness characteristic of people employed in a country not their own there were many secondary personages accompanying the army because their principals were there
among the opinions and voices in this immense  restless  brilliant  and proud sphere  prince andrew noticed the following sharply defined subdivisions of tendencies and parties  the first party consisted of pfuel and his adherents military theorists who believed in a science of war with immutable laws laws of oblique movements  outflankings  and so forth
pfuel and his adherents demanded a retirement into the depths of the country in accordance with precise laws defined by a pseudo theory of war  and they saw only barbarism  ignorance  or evil intention in every deviation from that theory
to this party belonged the foreign nobles  wolzogen  wintzingerode  and others  chiefly germans
the second party was directly opposed to the first  one extreme  as always happens  was met by representatives of the other
the members of this party were those who had demanded an advance from vilna into poland and freedom from all prearranged plans
besides being advocates of bold action  this section also represented nationalism  which made them still more one  sided in the dispute
they were russians  bagration  ermolov  who was beginning to come to the front   and others
at that time a famous joke of ermolov s was being circulated  that as a great favor he had petitioned the emperor to make him a german
the men of that party  remembering suvorov  said that what one had to do was not to reason  or stick pins into maps  but to fight  beat the enemy  keep him out of russia  and not let the army get discouraged
to the third party in which the emperor had most confidence belonged the courtiers who tried to arrange compromises between the other two
the members of this party  chiefly civilians and to whom arakcheev belonged  thought and said what men who have no convictions but wish to seem to have some generally say
they said that undoubtedly war  particularly against such a genius as bonaparte  they called him bonaparte now   needs most deeply devised plans and profound scientific knowledge and in that respect pfuel was a genius  but at the same time it had to be acknowledged that the theorists are often one sided  and therefore one should not trust them absolutely  but should also listen to what pfuel s opponents and practical men of experience in warfare had to say  and then choose a middle course
they insisted on the retention of the camp at drissa  according to pfuel s plan  but on changing the movements of the other armies
though  by this course  neither one aim nor the other could be attained  yet it seemed best to the adherents of this third party
of a fourth opinion the most conspicuous representative was the tsarevich  who could not forget his disillusionment at austerlitz  where he had ridden out at the head of the guards  in his casque and cavalry uniform as to a review  expecting to crush the french gallantly  but unexpectedly finding himself in the front line had narrowly escaped amid the general confusion the men of this party had both the quality and the defect of frankness in their opinions
they feared napoleon  recognized his strength and their own weakness  and frankly said so
they said   nothing but sorrow  shame  and ruin will come of all this  we have abandoned vilna and vitebsk and shall abandon drissa
the only reasonable thing left to do is to conclude peace as soon as possible  before we are turned out of petersburg   this view was very general in the upper army circles and found support also in petersburg and from the chancellor  rumyantsev  who  for other reasons of state  was in favor of peace
the fifth party consisted of those who were adherents of barclay de tolly  not so much as a man but as minister of war and commander in chief
 be he what he may   they always began like that    he is an honest  practical man and we have nobody better
give him real power  for war cannot be conducted successfully without unity of command  and he will show what he can do  as he did in finland
if our army is well organized and strong and has withdrawn to drissa without suffering any defeats  we owe this entirely to barclay
if barclay is now to be superseded by bennigsen all will be lost  for bennigsen showed his incapacity already in 1807   the sixth party  the bennigsenites  said  on the contrary  that at any rate there was no one more active and experienced than bennigsen   and twist about as you may  you will have to come to bennigsen eventually
let the others make mistakes now   said they  arguing that our retirement to drissa was a most shameful reverse and an unbroken series of blunders
 the more mistakes that are made the better
it will at any rate be understood all the sooner that things cannot go on like this
what is wanted is not some barclay or other  but a man like bennigsen  who made his mark in 1807  and to whom napoleon himself did justice a man whose authority would be willingly recognized  and bennigsen is the only such man   the seventh party consisted of the sort of people who are always to be found  especially around young sovereigns  and of whom there were particularly many round alexander generals and imperial aides de camp passionately devoted to the emperor  not merely as a monarch but as a man  adoring him sincerely and disinterestedly  as rostov had done in 1805  and who saw in him not only all the virtues but all human capabilities as well these men  though enchanted with the sovereign for refusing the command of the army  yet blamed him for such excessive modesty  and only desired and insisted that their adored sovereign should abandon his diffidence and openly announce that he would place himself at the head of the army  gather round him a commander in chief s staff  and  consulting experienced theoreticians and practical men where necessary  would himself lead the troops  whose spirits would thereby be raised to the highest pitch the eighth and largest group  which in its enormous numbers was to the others as ninety nine to one  consisted of men who desired neither peace nor war  neither an advance nor a defensive camp at the drissa or anywhere else  neither barclay nor the emperor  neither pfuel nor bennigsen  but only the one most essential thing as much advantage and pleasure for themselves as possible in the troubled waters of conflicting and intersecting intrigues that eddied about the emperor s headquarters  it was possible to succeed in many ways unthinkable at other times
a man who simply wished to retain his lucrative post would today agree with pfuel  tomorrow with his opponent  and the day after  merely to avoid responsibility or to please the emperor  would declare that he had no opinion at all on the matter
another who wished to gain some advantage would attract the emperor s attention by loudly advocating the very thing the emperor had hinted at the day before  and would dispute and shout at the council  beating his breast and challenging those who did not agree with him to duels  thereby proving that he was prepared to sacrifice himself for the common good a third  in the absence of opponents  between two councils would simply solicit a special gratuity for his faithful services  well knowing that at that moment people would be too busy to refuse him
a fourth while seemingly overwhelmed with work would often come accidentally under the emperor s eye
a fifth  to achieve his long cherished aim of dining with the emperor  would stubbornly insist on the correctness or falsity of some newly emerging opinion and for this object would produce arguments more or less forcible and correct
all the men of this party were fishing for rubles  decorations  and promotions  and in this pursuit watched only the weathercock of imperial favor  and directly they noticed it turning in any direction  this whole drone population of the army began blowing hard that way  so that it was all the harder for the emperor to turn it elsewhere
amid the uncertainties of the position  with the menace of serious danger giving a peculiarly threatening character to everything  amid this vortex of intrigue  egotism  conflict of views and feelings  and the diversity of race among these people this eighth and largest party of those preoccupied with personal interests imparted great confusion and obscurity to the common task
whatever question arose  a swarm of these drones  without having finished their buzzing on a previous theme  flew over to the new one and by their hum drowned and obscured the voices of those who were disputing honestly
from among all these parties  just at the time prince andrew reached the army  another  a ninth party  was being formed and was beginning to raise its voice
this was the party of the elders  reasonable men experienced and capable in state affairs  who  without sharing any of those conflicting opinions  were able to take a detached view of what was going on at the staff at headquarters and to consider means of escape from this muddle  indecision  intricacy  and weakness
the men of this party said and thought that what was wrong resulted chiefly from the emperor s presence in the army with his military court and from the consequent presence there of an indefinite  conditional  and unsteady fluctuation of relations  which is in place at court but harmful in an army  that a sovereign should reign but not command the army  and that the only way out of the position would be for the emperor and his court to leave the army  that the mere presence of the emperor paralyzed the action of fifty thousand men required to secure his personal safety  and that the worst commander in chief  if independent  would be better than the very best one trammeled by the presence and authority of the monarch
just at the time prince andrew was living unoccupied at drissa  shishkov  the secretary of state and one of the chief representatives of this party  wrote a letter to the emperor which arakcheev and balashev agreed to sign
in this letter  availing himself of permission given him by the emperor to discuss the general course of affairs  he respectfully suggested on the plea that it was necessary for the sovereign to arouse a warlike spirit in the people of the capital that the emperor should leave the army that arousing of the people by their sovereign and his call to them to defend their country the very incitement which was the chief cause of russia s triumph in so far as it was produced by the tsar s personal presence in moscow was suggested to the emperor  and accepted by him  as a pretext for quitting the army
this letter had not yet been presented to the emperor when barclay  one day at dinner  informed bolkonski that the sovereign wished to see him personally  to question him about turkey  and that prince andrew was to present himself at bennigsen s quarters at six that evening news was received at the emperor s quarters that very day of a fresh movement by napoleon which might endanger the army news subsequently found to be false
and that morning colonel michaud had ridden round the drissa fortifications with the emperor and had pointed out to him that this fortified camp constructed by pfuel  and till then considered a chef d oeuvre of tactical science which would ensure napoleon s destruction  was an absurdity  threatening the destruction of the russian army
prince andrew arrived at bennigsen s quarters a country gentleman s house of moderate size  situated on the very banks of the river
neither bennigsen nor the emperor was there  but chernyshev  the emperor s aide de camp  received bolkonski and informed him that the emperor  accompanied by general bennigsen and marquis paulucci  had gone a second time that day to inspect the fortifications of the drissa camp  of the suitability of which serious doubts were beginning to be felt
chernyshev was sitting at a window in the first room with a french novel in his hand
this room had probably been a music room  there was still an organ in it on which some rugs were piled  and in one corner stood the folding bedstead of bennigsen s adjutant
this adjutant was also there and sat dozing on the rolled up bedding  evidently exhausted by work or by feasting
two doors led from the room  one straight on into what had been the drawing room  and another  on the right  to the study
through the first door came the sound of voices conversing in german and occasionally in french
in that drawing room were gathered  by the emperor s wish  not a military council  the emperor preferred indefiniteness   but certain persons whose opinions he wished to know in view of the impending difficulties
it was not a council of war  but  as it were  a council to elucidate certain questions for the emperor personally
to this semicouncil had been invited the swedish general armfeldt  adjutant general wolzogen  wintzingerode  whom napoleon had referred to as a renegade french subject   michaud  toll  count stein who was not a military man at all  and pfuel himself  who  as prince andrew had heard  was the mainspring of the whole affair prince andrew had an opportunity of getting a good look at him  for pfuel arrived soon after himself and  in passing through to the drawing room  stopped a minute to speak to chernyshev at first sight  pfuel  in his ill made uniform of a russian general  which fitted him badly like a fancy costume  seemed familiar to prince andrew  though he saw him now for the first time
there was about him something of weyrother  mack  and schmidt  and many other german theorist generals whom prince andrew had seen in 1805  but he was more typical than any of them
prince andrew had never yet seen a german theorist in whom all the characteristics of those others were united to such an extent
pfuel was short and very thin but broad boned  of coarse  robust build  broad in the hips  and with prominent shoulder blades
his face was much wrinkled and his eyes deep set
his hair had evidently been hastily brushed smooth in front of the temples  but stuck up behind in quaint little tufts
he entered the room  looking restlessly and angrily around  as if afraid of everything in that large apartment
awkwardly holding up his sword  he addressed chernyshev and asked in german where the emperor was
one could see that he wished to pass through the rooms as quickly as possible  finish with the bows and greetings  and sit down to business in front of a map  where he would feel at home he nodded hurriedly in reply to chernyshev  and smiled ironically on hearing that the sovereign was inspecting the fortifications that he  pfuel  had planned in accord with his theory
he muttered something to himself abruptly and in a bass voice  as self assured germans do it might have been  stupid fellow    or  the whole affair will be ruined   or  something absurd will come of it    
prince andrew did not catch what he said and would have passed on  but chernyshev introduced him to pfuel  remarking that prince andrew was just back from turkey where the war had terminated so fortunately
pfuel barely glanced not so much at prince andrew as past him and said  with a laugh   that must have been a fine tactical war   and  laughing contemptuously  went on into the room from which the sound of voices was heard
pfuel  always inclined to be irritably sarcastic  was particularly disturbed that day  evidently by the fact that they had dared to inspect and criticize his camp in his absence
from this short interview with pfuel  prince andrew  thanks to his austerlitz experiences  was able to form a clear conception of the man
pfuel was one of those hopelessly and immutably self confident men  self  confident to the point of martyrdom as only germans are  because only germans are self confident on the basis of an abstract notion science  that is  the supposed knowledge of absolute truth
a frenchman is self assured because he regards himself personally  both in mind and body  as irresistibly attractive to men and women an englishman is self assured  as being a citizen of the best organized state in the world  and therefore as an englishman always knows what he should do and knows that all he does as an englishman is undoubtedly correct
an italian is self assured because he is excitable and easily forgets himself and other people a russian is self assured just because he knows nothing and does not want to know anything  since he does not believe that anything can be known
the german s self assurance is worst of all  stronger and more repulsive than any other  because he imagines that he knows the truth science which he himself has invented but which is for him the absolute truth pfuel was evidently of that sort
he had a science the theory of oblique movements deduced by him from the history of frederick the great s wars  and all he came across in the history of more recent warfare seemed to him absurd and barbarous monstrous collisions in which so many blunders were committed by both sides that these wars could not be called wars  they did not accord with the theory  and therefore could not serve as material for science
in 1806 pfuel had been one of those responsible  for the plan of campaign that ended in jena and auerstadt  but he did not see the least proof of the fallibility of his theory in the disasters of that war
on the contrary  the deviations made from his theory were  in his opinion  the sole cause of the whole disaster  and with characteristically gleeful sarcasm he would remark   there  i said the whole affair would go to the devil   pfuel was one of those theoreticians who so love their theory that they lose sight of the theory s object its practical application
his love of theory made him hate everything practical  and he would not listen to it
he was even pleased by failures  for failures resulting from deviations in practice from the theory only proved to him the accuracy of his theory
he said a few words to prince andrew and chernyshev about the present war  with the air of a man who knows beforehand that all will go wrong  and who is not displeased that it should be so
the unbrushed tufts of hair sticking up behind and the hastily brushed hair on his temples expressed this most eloquently
he passed into the next room  and the deep  querulous sounds of his voice were at once heard from there
prince andrew s eyes were still following pfuel out of the room when count bennigsen entered hurriedly  and nodding to bolkonski  but not pausing  went into the study  giving instructions to his adjutant as he went
the emperor was following him  and bennigsen had hastened on to make some preparations and to be ready to receive the sovereign
chernyshev and prince andrew went out into the porch  where the emperor  who looked fatigued  was dismounting
marquis paulucci was talking to him with particular warmth and the emperor  with his head bent to the left  was listening with a dissatisfied air
the emperor moved forward evidently wishing to end the conversation  but the flushed and excited italian  oblivious of decorum  followed him and continued to speak
 and as for the man who advised forming this camp the drissa camp   said paulucci  as the emperor mounted the steps and noticing prince andrew scanned his unfamiliar face   as to that person  sire     continued paulucci  desperately  apparently unable to restrain himself   the man who advised the drissa camp i see no alternative but the lunatic asylum or the gallows   without heeding the end of the italian s remarks  and as though not hearing them  the emperor  recognizing bolkonski  addressed him graciously  i am very glad to see you  go in there where they are meeting  and wait for me   the emperor went into the study
he was followed by prince peter mikhaylovich volkonski and baron stein  and the door closed behind them
prince andrew  taking advantage of the emperor s permission  accompanied paulucci  whom he had known in turkey  into the drawing room where the council was assembled
prince peter mikhaylovich volkonski occupied the position  as it were  of chief of the emperor s staff
he came out of the study into the drawing room with some maps which he spread on a table  and put questions on which he wished to hear the opinion of the gentlemen present
what had happened was that news  which afterwards proved to be false  had been received during the night of a movement by the french to outflank the drissa camp
the first to speak was general armfeldt who  to meet the difficulty that presented itself  unexpectedly proposed a perfectly new position away from the petersburg and moscow roads
the reason for this was inexplicable  unless he wished to show that he  too  could have an opinion   but he urged that at this point the army should unite and there await the enemy
it was plain that armfeldt had thought out that plan long ago and now expounded it not so much to answer the questions put which  in fact  his plan did not answer as to avail himself of the opportunity to air it it was one of the millions of proposals  one as good as another  that could be made as long as it was quite unknown what character the war would take
some disputed his arguments  others defended them
young count toll objected to the swedish general s views more warmly than anyone else  and in the course of the dispute drew to them
in these voluminous notes toll suggested another scheme  totally different from armfeldt s or pfuel s plan of campaign
in answer to toll  paulucci suggested an advance and an attack  which  he urged  could alone extricate us from the present uncertainty and from the trap  as he called the drissa camp  in which we were situated
during all these discussions pfuel and his interpreter  wolzogen  his  bridge  in court relations   were silent
pfuel only snorted contemptuously and turned away  to show that he would never demean himself by replying to such nonsense as he was now hearing so when prince volkonski  who was in the chair  called on him to give his opinion  he merely said   why ask me  general armfeldt has proposed a splendid position with an exposed rear  or why not this italian gentleman s attack very fine  or a retreat  also good  why ask me   said he
 why  you yourselves know everything better than i do   but when volkonski said  with a frown  that it was in the emperor s name that he asked his opinion  pfuel rose and  suddenly growing animated  began to speak   everything has been spoiled  everything muddled  everybody thought they knew better than i did  and now you come to me  how mend matters  there is nothing to mend  the principles laid down by me must be strictly adhered to   said he  drumming on the table with his bony fingers
 what is the difficulty  nonsense  childishness   he went up to the map and speaking rapidly began proving that no eventuality could alter the efficiency of the drissa camp  that everything had been foreseen  and that if the enemy were really going to outflank it  the enemy would inevitably be destroyed
paulucci  who did not know german  began questioning him in french
wolzogen came to the assistance of his chief  who spoke french badly  and began translating for him  hardly able to keep pace with pfuel  who was rapidly demonstrating that not only all that had happened  but all that could happen  had been foreseen in his scheme  and that if there were now any difficulties the whole fault lay in the fact that his plan had not been precisely executed
he kept laughing sarcastically  he demonstrated  and at last contemptuously ceased to demonstrate  like a mathematician who ceases to prove in various ways the accuracy of a problem that has already been proved
wolzogen took his place and continued to explain his views in french  every now and then turning to pfuel and saying   is it not so  your excellency   but pfuel  like a man heated in a fight who strikes those on his own side  shouted angrily at his own supporter  wolzogen   well  of course  what more is there to explain   paulucci and michaud both attacked wolzogen simultaneously in french
armfeldt addressed pfuel in german
toll explained to volkonski in russian
prince andrew listened and observed in silence
of all these men prince andrew sympathized most with pfuel  angry  determined  and absurdly self confident as he was
of all those present  evidently he alone was not seeking anything for himself  nursed no hatred against anyone  and only desired that the plan  formed on a theory arrived at by years of toil  should be carried out he was ridiculous  and unpleasantly sarcastic  but yet he inspired involuntary respect by his boundless devotion to an idea
besides this  the remarks of all except pfuel had one common trait that had not been noticeable at the council of war in 1805  there was now a panic fear of napoleon s genius  which  though concealed  was noticeable in every rejoinder
everything was assumed to be possible for napoleon  they expected him from every side  and invoked his terrible name to shatter each other s proposals
pfuel alone seemed to consider napoleon a barbarian like everyone else who opposed his theory
but besides this feeling of respect  pfuel evoked pity in prince andrew
from the tone in which the courtiers addressed him and the way paulucci had allowed himself to speak of him to the emperor  but above all from a certain desperation in pfuel s own expressions  it was clear that the others knew  and pfuel himself felt  that his fall was at hand and despite his self confidence and grumpy german sarcasm he was pitiable  with his hair smoothly brushed on the temples and sticking up in tufts behind
though he concealed the fact under a show of irritation and contempt  he was evidently in despair that the sole remaining chance of verifying his theory by a huge experiment and proving its soundness to the whole world was slipping away from him
the discussions continued a long time  and the longer they lasted the more heated became the disputes  culminating in shouts and personalities  and the less was it possible to arrive at any general conclusion from all that had been said
prince andrew  listening to this polyglot talk and to these surmises  plans  refutations  and shouts  felt nothing but amazement at what they were saying
a thought that had long since and often occurred to him during his military activities the idea that there is not and cannot be any science of war  and that therefore there can be no such thing as a military genius now appeared to him an obvious truth
 what theory and science is possible about a matter the conditions and circumstances of which are unknown and cannot be defined  especially when the strength of the acting forces cannot be ascertained  no one was or is able to foresee in what condition our or the enemy s armies will be in a day s time  and no one can gauge the force of this or that detachment sometimes when there is not a coward at the front to shout   we are cut off   and start running  but a brave and jolly lad who shouts   hurrah   a detachment of five thousand is worth thirty thousand  as at schon grabern  while at times fifty thousand run from eight thousand  as at austerlitz
what science can there be in a matter in which  as in all practical matters  nothing can be defined and everything depends on innumerable conditions  the significance of which is determined at a particular moment which arrives no one knows when  armfeldt says our army is cut in half  and paulucci says we have got the french army between two fires  michaud says that the worthlessness of the drissa camp lies in having the river behind it  and pfuel says that is what constitutes its strength  toll proposes one plan  armfeldt another  and they are all good and all bad  and the advantages of any suggestions can be seen only at the moment of trial
and why do they all speak of a  military genius   is a man a genius who can order bread to be brought up at the right time and say who is to go to the right and who to the left  it is only because military men are invested with pomp and power and crowds of sychophants flatter power  attributing to it qualities of genius it does not possess
the best generals i have known were  on the contrary  stupid or absent minded men
bagration was the best  napoleon himself admitted that and of bonaparte himself  i remember his limited  self satisfied face on the field of austerlitz not only does a good army commander not need any special qualities  on the contrary he needs the absence of the highest and best human attributes love  poetry  tenderness  and philosophic inquiring doubt
he should be limited  firmly convinced that what he is doing is very important  otherwise he will not have sufficient patience   and only then will he be a brave leader
god forbid that he should be humane  should love  or pity  or think of what is just and unjust
it is understandable that a theory of their  genius  was invented for them long ago because they have power  the success of a military action depends not on them  but on the man in the ranks who shouts   we are lost   or who shouts   hurrah   and only in the ranks can one serve with assurance of being useful   so thought prince andrew as he listened to the talking  and he roused himself only when paulucci called him and everyone was leaving at the review next day the emperor asked prince andrew where he would like to serve  and prince andrew lost his standing in court circles forever by not asking to remain attached to the sovereign s person  but for permission to serve in the army
before the beginning of the campaign  rostov had received a letter from his parents in which they told him briefly of natasha s illness and the breaking off of her engagement to prince andrew  which they explained by natasha s having rejected him  and again asked nicholas to retire from the army and return home
on receiving this letter  nicholas did not even make any attempt to get leave of absence or to retire from the army  but wrote to his parents that he was sorry natasha was ill and her engagement broken off  and that he would do all he could to meet their wishes
to sonya he wrote separately
 adored friend of my soul   he wrote
 nothing but honor could keep me from returning to the country
but now  at the commencement of the campaign  i should feel dishonored  not only in my comrades  eyes but in my own  if i preferred my own happiness to my love and duty to the fatherland but this shall be our last separation
believe me  directly the war is over  if i am still alive and still loved by you  i will throw up everything and fly to you  to press you forever to my ardent breast   it was  in fact  only the commencement of the campaign that prevented rostov from returning home as he had promised and marrying sonya
the autumn in otradnoe with the hunting  and the winter with the christmas holidays and sonya s love  had opened out to him a vista of tranquil rural joys and peace such as he had never known before  and which now allured him
 a splendid wife  children  a good pack of hounds  a dozen leashes of smart borzois  agriculture  neighbors  service by election     thought he
but now the campaign was beginning  and he had to remain with his regiment
and since it had to be so  nicholas rostov  as was natural to him  felt contented with the life he led in the regiment and was able to find pleasure in that life
on his return from his furlough nicholas  having been joyfully welcomed by his comrades  was sent to obtain remounts and brought back from the ukraine excellent horses which pleased him and earned him commendation from his commanders during his absence he had been promoted captain  and when the regiment was put on war footing with an increase in numbers  he was again allotted his old squadron
the campaign began  the regiment was moved into poland on double pay  new officers arrived  new men and horses  and above all everybody was infected with the merrily excited mood that goes with the commencement of a war  and rostov  conscious of his advantageous position in the regiment  devoted himself entirely to the pleasures and interests of military service  though he knew that sooner or later he would have to relinquish them the troops retired from vilna for various complicated reasons of state  political and strategic
each step of the retreat was accompanied by a complicated interplay of interests  arguments  and passions at headquarters
for the pavlograd hussars  however  the whole of this retreat during the finest period of summer and with sufficient supplies was a very simple and agreeable business
it was only at headquarters that there was depression  uneasiness  and intriguing  in the body of the army they did not ask themselves where they were going or why if they regretted having to retreat  it was only because they had to leave billets they had grown accustomed to  or some pretty young polish lady
if the thought that things looked bad chanced to enter anyone s head  he tried to be as cheerful as befits a good soldier and not to think of the general trend of affairs  but only of the task nearest to hand
first they camped gaily before vilna  making acquaintance with the polish landowners  preparing for reviews and being reviewed by the emperor and other high commanders
then came an order to retreat to sventsyani and destroy any provisions they could not carry away with them
sventsyani was remembered by the hussars only as the drunken camp  a name the whole army gave to their encampment there  and because many complaints were made against the troops  who  taking advantage of the order to collect provisions  took also horses  carriages  and carpets from the polish proprietors
rostov remembered sventsyani  because on the first day of their arrival at that small town he changed his sergeant major and was unable to manage all the drunken men of his squadron who  unknown to him  had appropriated five barrels of old beer
from sventsyani they retired farther and farther to drissa  and thence again beyond drissa  drawing near to the frontier of russia proper
on the thirteenth of july the pavlograds took part in a serious action for the first time
on the twelfth of july  on the eve of that action  there was a heavy storm of rain and hail
in general  the summer of 1812 was remarkable for its storms the two pavlograd squadrons were bivouacking on a field of rye  which was already in ear but had been completely trodden down by cattle and horses
the rain was descending in torrents  and rostov  with a young officer named ilyin  his protege  was sitting in a hastily constructed shelter
an officer of their regiment  with long mustaches extending onto his cheeks  who after riding to the staff had been overtaken by the rain  entered rostov s shelter
 i have come from the staff  count
have you heard of raevski s exploit   and the officer gave them details of the saltanov battle  which he had heard at the staff
rostov  smoking his pipe and turning his head about as the water trickled down his neck  listened inattentively  with an occasional glance at ilyin  who was pressing close to him
this officer  a lad of sixteen who had recently joined the regiment  was now in the same relation to nicholas that nicholas had been to denisov seven years before
ilyin tried to imitate rostov in everything and adored him as a girl might have done
zdrzhinski  the officer with the long mustache  spoke grandiloquently of the saltanov dam being  a russian thermopylae   and of how a deed worthy of antiquity had been performed by general raevski
he recounted how raevski had led his two sons onto the dam under terrific fire and had charged with them beside him
rostov heard the story and not only said nothing to encourage zdrzhinski s enthusiasm but  on the contrary  looked like a man ashamed of what he was hearing  though with no intention of contradicting it
since the campaigns of austerlitz and of 1807 rostov knew by experience that men always lie when describing military exploits  as he himself had done when recounting them  besides that  he had experience enough to know that nothing happens in war at all as we can imagine or relate it and so he did not like zdrzhinski s tale  nor did he like zdrzhinski himself who  with his mustaches extending over his cheeks  bent low over the face of his hearer  as was his habit  and crowded rostov in the narrow shanty rostov looked at him in silence
 in the first place  there must have been such a confusion and crowding on the dam that was being attacked that if raevski did lead his sons there  it could have had no effect except perhaps on some dozen men nearest to him   thought he   the rest could not have seen how or with whom raevski came onto the dam
and even those who did see it would not have been much stimulated by it  for what had they to do with raevski s tender paternal feelings when their own skins were in danger  and besides  the fate of the fatherland did not depend on whether they took the saltanov dam or not  as we are told was the case at thermopylae
so why should he have made such a sacrifice  and why expose his own children in the battle  i would not have taken my brother petya there  or even ilyin  who s a stranger to me but a nice lad  but would have tried to put them somewhere under cover   nicholas continued to think  as he listened to zdrzhinski
but he did not express his thoughts  for in such matters  too  he had gained experience
he knew that this tale redounded to the glory of our arms and so one had to pretend not to doubt it and he acted accordingly
 i can t stand this any more   said ilyin  noticing that rostov did not relish zdrzhinski s conversation
 my stockings and shirt  
and the water is running on my seat  i ll go and look for shelter
the rain seems less heavy   ilyin went out and zdrzhinski rode away five minutes later ilyin  splashing through the mud  came running back to the shanty
 hurrah  rostov  come quick  i ve found it  about two hundred yards away there s a tavern where ours have already gathered
we can at least get dry there  and mary hendrikhovna s there   mary hendrikhovna was the wife of the regimental doctor  a pretty young german woman he had married in poland
the doctor  whether from lack of means or because he did not like to part from his young wife in the early days of their marriage  took her about with him wherever the hussar regiment went and his jealousy had become a standing joke among the hussar officers
rostov threw his cloak over his shoulders  shouted to lavrushka to follow with the things  and now slipping in the mud  now splashing right through it  set off with ilyin in the lessening rain and the darkness that was occasionally rent by distant lightning
 rostov  where are you    here
what lightning   they called to one another
in the tavern  before which stood the doctor s covered cart  there were already some five officers
mary hendrikhovna  a plump little blonde german  in a dressing jacket and nightcap  was sitting on a broad bench in the front corner
her husband  the doctor  lay asleep behind her
rostov and ilyin  on entering the room  were welcomed with merry shouts and laughter
 dear me  how jolly we are   said rostov laughing
 and why do you stand there gaping    what swells they are  why  the water streams from them  don t make our drawing room so wet    don t mess mary hendrikhovna s dress   cried other voices rostov and ilyin hastened to find a corner where they could change into dry clothes without offending mary hendrikhovna s modesty
they were going into a tiny recess behind a partition to change  but found it completely filled by three officers who sat playing cards by the light of a solitary candle on an empty box  and these officers would on no account yield their position
mary hendrikhovna obliged them with the loan of a petticoat to be used as a curtain  and behind that screen rostov and ilyin  helped by lavrushka who had brought their kits  changed their wet things for dry ones
a fire was made up in the dilapidated brick stove
a board was found  fixed on two saddles and covered with a horsecloth  a small samovar was produced and a cellaret and half a bottle of rum  and having asked mary hendrikhovna to preside  they all crowded round her
one offered her a clean handkerchief to wipe her charming hands  another spread a jacket under her little feet to keep them from the damp  another hung his coat over the window to keep out the draft  and yet another waved the flies off her husband s face  lest he should wake up
 leave him alone   said mary hendrikhovna  smiling timidly and happily
 he is sleeping well as it is  after a sleepless night    oh  no  mary hendrikhovna   replied the officer   one must look after the doctor
perhaps he ll take pity on me someday  when it comes to cutting off a leg or an arm for me   there were only three tumblers  the water was so muddy that one could not make out whether the tea was strong or weak  and the samovar held only six tumblers of water  but this made it all the pleasanter to take turns in order of seniority to receive one s tumbler from mary hendrikhovna s plump little hands with their short and not overclean nails
all the officers appeared to be  and really were  in love with her that evening
even those playing cards behind the partition soon left their game and came over to the samovar  yielding to the general mood of courting mary hendrikhovna
she  seeing herself surrounded by such brilliant and polite young men  beamed with satisfaction  try as she might to hide it  and perturbed as she evidently was each time her husband moved in his sleep behind her
there was only one spoon  sugar was more plentiful than anything else  but it took too long to dissolve  so it was decided that mary hendrikhovna should stir the sugar for everyone in turn
rostov received his tumbler  and adding some rum to it asked mary hendrikhovna to stir it
 but you take it without sugar   she said  smiling all the time  as if everything she said and everything the others said was very amusing and had a double meaning
 it is not the sugar i want  but only that your little hand should stir my tea   mary hendrikhovna assented and began looking for the spoon which someone meanwhile had pounced on
 use your finger  mary hendrikhovna  it will be still nicer   said rostov
 too hot   she replied  blushing with pleasure
ilyin put a few drops of rum into the bucket of water and brought it to mary hendrikhovna  asking her to stir it with her finger
 this is my cup   said he
 only dip your finger in it and i ll drink it all up   when they had emptied the samovar  rostov took a pack of cards and proposed that they should play  kings  with mary hendrikhovna
they drew lots to settle who should make up her set
at rostov s suggestion it was agreed that whoever became  king  should have the right to kiss mary hendrikhovna s hand  and that the  booby  should go to refill and reheat the samovar for the doctor when the latter awoke
 well  but supposing mary hendrikhovna is  king    asked ilyin
 as it is  she is queen  and her word is law   they had hardly begun to play before the doctor s disheveled head suddenly appeared from behind mary hendrikhovna
he had been awake for some time  listening to what was being said  and evidently found nothing entertaining or amusing in what was going on
his face was sad and depressed
without greeting the officers  he scratched himself and asked to be allowed to pass as they were blocking the way as soon as he had left the room all the officers burst into loud laughter and mary hendrikhovna blushed till her eyes filled with tears and thereby became still more attractive to them
returning from the yard  the doctor told his wife  who had ceased to smile so happily  and looked at him in alarm  awaiting her sentence  that the rain had ceased and they must go to sleep in their covered cart  or everything in it would be stolen
 but i ll send an orderly   
two of them   said rostov
 what an idea  doctor    i ll stand guard on it myself   said ilyin
 no  gentlemen  you have had your sleep  but i have not slept for two nights   replied the doctor  and he sat down morosely beside his wife  waiting for the game to end
seeing his gloomy face as he frowned at his wife  the officers grew still merrier  and some of them could not refrain from laughter  for which they hurriedly sought plausible pretexts
when he had gone  taking his wife with him  and had settled down with her in their covered cart  the officers lay down in the tavern  covering themselves with their wet cloaks  but they did not sleep for a long time  now they exchanged remarks  recalling the doctor s uneasiness and his wife s delight  now they ran out into the porch and reported what was taking place in the covered trap several times rostov  covering his head  tried to go to sleep  but some remark would arouse him and conversation would be resumed  to the accompaniment of unreasoning  merry  childlike laughter
it was nearly three o clock but no one was yet asleep  when the quartermaster appeared with an order to move on to the little town of ostrovna
still laughing and talking  the officers began hurriedly getting ready and again boiled some muddy water in the samovar
but rostov went off to his squadron without waiting for tea
day was breaking  the rain had ceased  and the clouds were dispersing
it felt damp and cold  especially in clothes that were still moist
as they left the tavern in the twilight of the dawn  rostov and ilyin both glanced under the wet and glistening leather hood of the doctor s cart  from under the apron of which his feet were sticking out  and in the middle of which his wife s nightcap was visible and her sleepy breathing audible
 she really is a dear little thing   said rostov to ilyin  who was following him
 a charming woman   said ilyin  with all the gravity of a boy of sixteen
half an hour later the squadron was lined up on the road
the command was heard to  mount  and the soldiers crossed themselves and mounted rostov riding in front gave the order  forward   and the hussars  with clanking sabers and subdued talk  their horses  hoofs splashing in the mud  defiled in fours and moved along the broad road planted with birch trees on each side  following the infantry and a battery that had gone on in front
tattered  blue purple clouds  reddening in the east  were scudding before the wind
it was growing lighter and lighter
that curly grass which always grows by country roadsides became clearly visible  still wet with the night s rain  the drooping branches of the birches  also wet  swayed in the wind and flung down bright drops of water to one side
the soldiers  faces were more and more clearly visible
rostov  always closely followed by ilyin  rode along the side of the road between two rows of birch trees
when campaigning  rostov allowed himself the indulgence of riding not a regimental but a cossack horse a judge of horses and a sportsman  he had lately procured himself a large  fine  mettlesome  donets horse  dun colored  with light mane and tail  and when he rode it no one could outgallop him to ride this horse was a pleasure to him  and he thought of the horse  of the morning  of the doctor s wife  but not once of the impending danger
formerly  when going into action  rostov had felt afraid  now he had not the least feeling of fear
he was fearless  not because he had grown used to being under fire  one cannot grow used to danger   but because he had learned how to manage his thoughts when in danger
he had grown accustomed when going into action to think about anything but what would seem most likely to interest him the impending danger
during the first period of his service  hard as he tried and much as he reproached himself with cowardice  he had not been able to do this  but with time it had come of itself now he rode beside ilyin under the birch trees  occasionally plucking leaves from a branch that met his hand  sometimes touching his horse s side with his foot  or  without turning round  handing a pipe he had finished to an hussar riding behind him  with as calm and careless an air as though he were merely out for a ride
he glanced with pity at the excited face of ilyin  who talked much and in great agitation
he knew from experience the tormenting expectation of terror and death the cornet was suffering and knew that only time could help him
as soon as the sun appeared in a clear strip of sky beneath the clouds  the wind fell  as if it dared not spoil the beauty of the summer morning after the storm  drops still continued to fall  but vertically now  and all was still
the whole sun appeared on the horizon and disappeared behind a long narrow cloud that hung above it
a few minutes later it reappeared brighter still from behind the top of the cloud  tearing its edge
everything grew bright and glittered
and with that light  and as if in reply to it  came the sound of guns ahead of them
before rostov had had time to consider and determine the distance of that firing  count ostermann tolstoy s adjutant came galloping from vitebsk with orders to advance at a trot along the road
the squadron overtook and passed the infantry and the battery which had also quickened their pace rode down a hill  and passing through an empty and deserted village again ascended
the horses began to lather and the men to flush
 halt  dress your ranks   the order of the regimental commander was heard ahead
 forward by the left
walk  march   came the order from in front
and the hussars  passing along the line of troops on the left flank of our position  halted behind our uhlans who were in the front line
to the right stood our infantry in a dense column  they were the reserve
higher up the hill  on the very horizon  our guns were visible through the wonderfully clear air  brightly illuminated by slanting morning sunbeams in front  beyond a hollow dale  could be seen the enemy s columns and guns
our advanced line  already in action  could be heard briskly exchanging shots with the enemy in the dale
at these sounds  long unheard  rostov s spirits rose  as at the strains of the merriest music
trap ta ta tap  cracked the shots  now together  now several quickly one after another
again all was silent and then again it sounded as if someone were walking on detonators and exploding them
the hussars remained in the same place for about an hour
a cannonade began
count ostermann with his suite rode up behind the squadron  halted  spoke to the commander of the regiment  and rode up the hill to the guns
after ostermann had gone  a command rang out to the uhlans
 form column  prepare to charge   the infantry in front of them parted into platoons to allow the cavalry to pass
the uhlans started  the streamers on their spears fluttering  and trotted downhill toward the french cavalry which was seen below to the left
as soon as the uhlans descended the hill  the hussars were ordered up the hill to support the battery
as they took the places vacated by the uhlans  bullets came from the front  whining and whistling  but fell spent without taking effect
the sounds  which he had not heard for so long  had an even more pleasurable and exhilarating effect on rostov than the previous sounds of firing
drawing himself up  he viewed the field of battle opening out before him from the hill  and with his whole soul followed the movement of the uhlans they swooped down close to the french dragoons  something confused happened there amid the smoke  and five minutes later our uhlans were galloping back  not to the place they had occupied but more to the left  and among the orange colored uhlans on chestnut horses and behind them  in a large group  blue french dragoons on gray horses could be seen
rostov  with his keen sportsman s eye  was one of the first to catch sight of these blue french dragoons pursuing our uhlans
nearer and nearer in disorderly crowds came the uhlans and the french dragoons pursuing them
he could already see how these men  who looked so small at the foot of the hill  jostled and overtook one another  waving their arms and their sabers in the air rostov gazed at what was happening before him as at a hunt
he felt instinctively that if the hussars struck at the french dragoons now  the latter could not withstand them  but if a charge was to be made it must be done now  at that very moment  or it would be too late
he looked around
a captain  standing beside him  was gazing like himself with eyes fixed on the cavalry below them  andrew sevastyanych   said rostov
 you know  we could crush them       a fine thing too   replied the captain   and really     rostov  without waiting to hear him out  touched his horse  galloped to the front of his squadron  and before he had time to finish giving the word of command  the whole squadron  sharing his feeling  was following him
rostov himself did not know how or why he did it he acted as he did when hunting  without reflecting or considering
he saw the dragoons near and that they were galloping in disorder  he knew they could not withstand an attack knew there was only that moment and that if he let it slip it would not return
the bullets were whining and whistling so stimulatingly around him and his horse was so eager to go that he could not restrain himself he touched his horse  gave the word of command  and immediately  hearing behind him the tramp of the horses of his deployed squadron  rode at full trot downhill toward the dragoons
hardly had they reached the bottom of the hill before their pace instinctively changed to a gallop  which grew faster and faster as they drew nearer to our uhlans and the french dragoons who galloped after them
the dragoons were now close at hand
on seeing the hussars  the foremost began to turn  while those behind began to halt
with the same feeling with which he had galloped across the path of a wolf  rostov gave rein to his donets horse and galloped to intersect the path of the dragoons  disordered lines
one uhlan stopped  another who was on foot flung himself to the ground to avoid being knocked over  and a riderless horse fell in among the hussars nearly all the french dragoons were galloping back
rostov  picking out one on a gray horse  dashed after him
on the way he came upon a bush  his gallant horse cleared it  and almost before he had righted himself in his saddle he saw that he would immediately overtake the enemy he had selected that frenchman  by his uniform an officer  was going at a gallop  crouching on his gray horse and urging it on with his saber
in another moment rostov s horse dashed its breast against the hindquarters of the officer s horse  almost knocking it over  and at the same instant rostov  without knowing why  raised his saber and struck the frenchman with it
the instant he had done this  all rostov s animation vanished
the officer fell  not so much from the blow which had but slightly cut his arm above the elbow as from the shock to his horse and from fright
rostov reined in his horse  and his eyes sought his foe to see whom he had vanquished
the french dragoon officer was hopping with one foot on the ground  the other being caught in the stirrup
his eyes  screwed up with fear as if he every moment expected another blow  gazed up at rostov with shrinking terror
his pale and mud stained face fair and young  with a dimple in the chin and light blue eyes was not an enemy s face at all suited to a battlefield  but a most ordinary  homelike face
before rostov had decided what to do with him  the officer cried   i surrender   he hurriedly but vainly tried to get his foot out of the stirrup and did not remove his frightened blue eyes from rostov s face
some hussars who galloped up disengaged his foot and helped him into the saddle
on all sides  the hussars were busy with the dragoons  one was wounded  but though his face was bleeding  he would not give up his horse  another was perched up behind an hussar with his arms round him  a third was being helped by an hussar to mount his horse in front  the french infantry were firing as they ran
the hussars galloped hastily back with their prisoners
rostov galloped back with the rest  aware of an unpleasant feeling of depression in his heart
something vague and confused  which he could not at all account for  had come over him with the capture of that officer and the blow he had dealt him
count ostermann tolstoy met the returning hussars  sent for rostov  thanked him  and said he would report his gallant deed to the emperor and would recommend him for a st
george s cross
when sent for by count ostermann  rostov  remembering that he had charged without orders  felt sure his commander was sending for him to punish him for breach of discipline
ostermann s flattering words and promise of a reward should therefore have struck him all the more pleasantly  but he still felt that same vaguely disagreeable feeling of moral nausea
 but what on earth is worrying me   he asked himself as he rode back from the general  ilyin  no  he s safe
have i disgraced myself in any way  no  that s not it   something else  resembling remorse  tormented him
 yes  oh yes  that french officer with the dimple
and i remember how my arm paused when i raised it   rostov saw the prisoners being led away and galloped after them to have a look at his frenchman with the dimple on his chin
he was sitting in his foreign uniform on an hussar packhorse and looked anxiously about him  the sword cut on his arm could scarcely be called a wound
he glanced at rostov with a feigned smile and waved his hand in greeting
rostov still had the same indefinite feeling  as of shame
all that day and the next his friends and comrades noticed that rostov  without being dull or angry  was silent  thoughtful  and preoccupied he drank reluctantly  tried to remain alone  and kept turning something over in his mind
rostov was always thinking about that brilliant exploit of his  which to his amazement had gained him the st
george s cross and even given him a reputation for bravery  and there was something he could not at all understand
 so others are even more afraid than i am   he thought
 so that s all there is in what is called heroism  and did i do it for my country s sake  and how was he to blame  with his dimple and blue eyes  and how frightened he was  he thought that i should kill him
why should i kill him  my hand trembled
and they have given me a st
george s cross   
i can t make it out at all   but while nicholas was considering these questions and still could reach no clear solution of what puzzled him so  the wheel of fortune in the service  as often happens  turned in his favor
after the affair at ostrovna he was brought into notice  received command of an hussar battalion  and when a brave officer was needed he was chosen
on receiving news of natasha s illness  the countess  though not quite well yet and still weak  went to moscow with petya and the rest of the household  and the whole family moved from marya dmitrievna s house to their own and settled down in town
natasha s illness was so serious that  fortunately for her and for her parents  the consideration of all that had caused the illness  her conduct and the breaking off of her engagement  receded into the background
she was so ill that it was impossible for them to consider in how far she was to blame for what had happened
she could not eat or sleep  grew visibly thinner  coughed  and  as the doctors made them feel  was in danger
they could not think of anything but how to help her
doctors came to see her singly and in consultation  talked much in french  german  and latin  blamed one another  and prescribed a great variety of medicines for all the diseases known to them  but the simple idea never occurred to any of them that they could not know the disease natasha was suffering from  as no disease suffered by a live man can be known  for every living person has his own peculiarities and always has his own peculiar  personal  novel  complicated disease  unknown to medicine  not a disease of the lungs  liver  skin  heart  nerves  and so on mentioned in combinations of the maladies of those organs
this simple thought could not occur to the doctors  as it cannot occur to a wizard that he is unable to work his charms  because the business of their lives was to cure  and they received money for it and had spent the best years of their lives on that business but  above all  that thought was kept out of their minds by the fact that they saw they were really useful  as in fact they were to the whole rostov family
their usefulness did not depend on making the patient swallow substances for the most part harmful  the harm was scarcely perceptible  as they were given in small doses   but they were useful  necessary  and indispensable because they satisfied a mental need of the invalid and of those who loved her and that is why there are  and always will be  pseudo healers  wise women  homeopaths  and allopaths
they satisfied that eternal human need for hope of relief  for sympathy  and that something should be done  which is felt by those who are suffering
they satisfied the need seen in its most elementary form in a child  when it wants to have a place rubbed that has been hurt
a child knocks itself and runs at once to the arms of its mother or nurse to have the aching spot rubbed or kissed  and it feels better when this is done the child cannot believe that the strongest and wisest of its people have no remedy for its pain  and the hope of relief and the expression of its mother s sympathy while she rubs the bump comforts it
the doctors were of use to natasha because they kissed and rubbed her bump  assuring her that it would soon pass if only the coachman went to the chemist s in the arbat and got a powder and some pills in a pretty box for a ruble and seventy kopeks  and if she took those powders in boiled water at intervals of precisely two hours  neither more nor less
what would sonya and the count and countess have done  how would they have looked  if nothing had been done  if there had not been those pills to give by the clock  the warm drinks  the chicken cutlets  and all the other details of life ordered by the doctors  the carrying out of which supplied an occupation and consolation to the family circle  how would the count have borne his dearly loved daughter s illness had he not known that it was costing him a thousand rubles  and that he would not grudge thousands more to benefit her  or had he not known that if her illness continued he would not grudge yet other thousands and would take her abroad for consultations there  and had he not been able to explain the details of how metivier and feller had not understood the symptoms  but frise had  and mudrov had diagnosed them even better  what would the countess have done had she not been able sometimes to scold the invalid for not strictly obeying the doctor s orders   you ll never get well like that   she would say  forgetting her grief in her vexation   if you won t obey the doctor and take your medicine at the right time  you mustn t trifle with it  you know  or it may turn to pneumonia   she would go on  deriving much comfort from the utterance of that foreign word  incomprehensible to others as well as to herself what would sonya have done without the glad consciousness that she had not undressed during the first three nights  in order to be ready to carry out all the doctor s injunctions with precision  and that she still kept awake at night so as not to miss the proper time when the slightly harmful pills in the little gilt box had to be administered  even to natasha herself it was pleasant to see that so many sacrifices were being made for her sake  and to know that she had to take medicine at certain hours  though she declared that no medicine would cure her and that it was all nonsense
and it was even pleasant to be able to show  by disregarding the orders  that she did not believe in medical treatment and did not value her life
the doctor came every day  felt her pulse  looked at her tongue  and regardless of her grief stricken face joked with her
but when he had gone into another room  to which the countess hurriedly followed him  he assumed a grave air and thoughtfully shaking his head said that though there was danger  he had hopes of the effect of this last medicine and one must wait and see  that the malady was chiefly mental  but  
and the countess  trying to conceal the action from herself and from him  slipped a gold coin into his hand and always returned to the patient with a more tranquil mind
the symptoms of natasha s illness were that she ate little  slept little  coughed  and was always low spirited the doctors said that she could not get on without medical treatment  so they kept her in the stifling atmosphere of the town  and the rostovs did not move to the country that summer of 1812
in spite of the many pills she swallowed and the drops and powders out of the little bottles and boxes of which madame schoss who was fond of such things made a large collection  and in spite of being deprived of the country life to which she was accustomed  youth prevailed
natasha s grief began to be overlaid by the impressions of daily life  it ceased to press so painfully on her heart  it gradually faded into the past  and she began to recover physically
natasha was calmer but no happier
she not merely avoided all external forms of pleasure balls  promenades  concerts  and theaters but she never laughed without a sound of tears in her laughter she could not sing
as soon as she began to laugh  or tried to sing by herself  tears choked her  tears of remorse  tears at the recollection of those pure times which could never return  tears of vexation that she should so uselessly have ruined her young life which might have been so happy
laughter and singing in particular seemed to her like a blasphemy  in face of her sorrow
without any need of self restraint  no wish to coquet ever entered her head
she said and felt at that time that no man was more to her than nastasya ivanovna  the buffoon
something stood sentinel within her and forbade her every joy
besides  she had lost all the old interests of her carefree girlish life that had been so full of hope
the previous autumn  the hunting   uncle   and the christmas holidays spent with nicholas at otradnoe were what she recalled oftenest and most painfully
what would she not have given to bring back even a single day of that time  but it was gone forever
her presentiment at the time had not deceived her that that state of freedom and readiness for any enjoyment would not return again
yet it was necessary to live on
it comforted her to reflect that she was not better as she had formerly imagined  but worse  much worse  than anybody else in the world
but this was not enough
she knew that  and asked herself   what next   but there was nothing to come
there was no joy in life  yet life was passing
natasha apparently tried not to be a burden or a hindrance to anyone  but wanted nothing for herself
she kept away from everyone in the house and felt at ease only with her brother petya
she liked to be with him better than with the others  and when alone with him she sometimes laughed
she hardly ever left the house and of those who came to see them was glad to see only one person  pierre
it would have been impossible to treat her with more delicacy  greater care  and at the same time more seriously than did count bezukhov
natasha unconsciously felt this delicacy and so found great pleasure in his society
but she was not even grateful to him for it  nothing good on pierre s part seemed to her to be an effort  it seemed so natural for him to be kind to everyone that there was no merit in his kindness
sometimes natasha noticed embarrassment and awkwardness on his part in her presence  especially when he wanted to do something to please her  or feared that something they spoke of would awaken memories distressing to her
she noticed this and attributed it to his general kindness and shyness  which she imagined must be the same toward everyone as it was to her
after those involuntary words that if he were free he would have asked on his knees for her hand and her love uttered at a moment when she was so strongly agitated  pierre never spoke to natasha of his feelings  and it seemed plain to her that those words  which had then so comforted her  were spoken as all sorts of meaningless words are spoken to comfort a crying child
it was not because pierre was a married man  but because natasha felt very strongly with him that moral barrier the absence of which she had experienced with kuragin that it never entered her head that the relations between him and herself could lead to love on her part  still less on his  or even to the kind of tender  self conscious  romantic friendship between a man and a woman of which she had known several instances
before the end of the fast of st
peter  agrafena ivanovna belova  a country neighbor of the rostovs  came to moscow to pay her devotions at the shrines of the moscow saints
she suggested that natasha should fast and prepare for holy communion  and natasha gladly welcomed the idea
despite the doctor s orders that she should not go out early in the morning  natasha insisted on fasting and preparing for the sacrament  not as they generally prepared for it in the rostov family by attending three services in their own house  but as agrafena ivanovna did  by going to church every day for a week and not once missing vespers  matins  or mass
the countess was pleased with natasha s zeal  after the poor results of the medical treatment  in the depths of her heart she hoped that prayer might help her daughter more than medicines and  though not without fear and concealing it from the doctor  she agreed to natasha s wish and entrusted her to belova
agrafena ivanovna used to come to wake natasha at three in the morning  but generally found her already awake
she was afraid of being late for matins
hastily washing  and meekly putting on her shabbiest dress and an old mantilla  natasha  shivering in the fresh air  went out into the deserted streets lit by the clear light of dawn
by agrafena ivanovna s advice natasha prepared herself not in their own parish  but at a church where  according to the devout agrafena ivanovna  the priest was a man of very severe and lofty life
there were never many people in the church  natasha always stood beside belova in the customary place before an icon of the blessed virgin  let into the screen before the choir on the left side  and a feeling  new to her  of humility before something great and incomprehensible  seized her when at that unusual morning hour  gazing at the dark face of the virgin illuminated by the candles burning before it and by the morning light falling from the window  she listened to the words of the service which she tried to follow with understanding
when she understood them her personal feeling became interwoven in the prayers with shades of its own
when she did not understand  it was sweeter still to think that the wish to understand everything is pride  that it is impossible to understand all  that it is only necessary to believe and to commit oneself to god  whom she felt guiding her soul at those moments
she crossed herself  bowed low  and when she did not understand  in horror at her own vileness  simply asked god to forgive her everything  everything  to have mercy upon her
the prayers to which she surrendered herself most of all were those of repentance
on her way home at an early hour when she met no one but bricklayers going to work or men sweeping the street  and everybody within the houses was still asleep  natasha experienced a feeling new to her  a sense of the possibility of correcting her faults  the possibility of a new  clean life  and of happiness
during the whole week she spent in this way  that feeling grew every day
and the happiness of taking communion  or  communing  as agrafena ivanovna  joyously playing with the word  called it  seemed to natasha so great that she felt she should never live till that blessed sunday
but the happy day came  and on that memorable sunday  when  dressed in white muslin  she returned home after communion  for the first time for many months she felt calm and not oppressed by the thought of the life that lay before her
the doctor who came to see her that day ordered her to continue the powders he had prescribed a fortnight previously
 she must certainly go on taking them morning and evening   said he  evidently sincerely satisfied with his success
 only  please be particular about it
 be quite easy   he continued playfully  as he adroitly took the gold coin in his palm
 she will soon be singing and frolicking about
the last medicine has done her a very great deal of good
she has freshened up very much   the countess  with a cheerful expression on her face  looked down at her nails and spat a little for luck as she returned to the drawing room
at the beginning of july more and more disquieting reports about the war began to spread in moscow  people spoke of an appeal by the emperor to the people  and of his coming himself from the army to moscow and as up to the eleventh of july no manifesto or appeal had been received  exaggerated reports became current about them and about the position of russia
it was said that the emperor was leaving the army because it was in danger  it was said that smolensk had surrendered  that napoleon had an army of a million and only a miracle could save russia
on the eleventh of july  which was saturday  the manifesto was received but was not yet in print  and pierre  who was at the rostovs   promised to come to dinner next day  sunday  and bring a copy of the manifesto and appeal  which he would obtain from count rostopchin
that sunday  the rostovs went to mass at the razumovskis  private chapel as usual
it was a hot july day
even at ten o clock  when the rostovs got out of their carriage at the chapel  the sultry air  the shouts of hawkers  the light and gay summer clothes of the crowd  the dusty leaves of the trees on the boulevard  the sounds of the band and the white trousers of a battalion marching to parade  the rattling of wheels on the cobblestones  and the brilliant  hot sunshine were all full of that summer languor  that content and discontent with the present  which is most strongly felt on a bright  hot day in town
all the moscow notabilities  all the rostovs  acquaintances  were at the razumovskis  chapel  for  as if expecting something to happen  many wealthy families who usually left town for their country estates had not gone away that summer
as natasha  at her mother s side  passed through the crowd behind a liveried footman who cleared the way for them  she heard a young man speaking about her in too loud a whisper
 that s rostova  the one who      she s much thinner  but all the same she s pretty   she heard  or thought she heard  the names of kuragin and bolkonski
but she was always imagining that
it always seemed to her that everyone who looked at her was thinking only of what had happened to her
with a sinking heart  wretched as she always was now when she found herself in a crowd  natasha in her lilac silk dress trimmed with black lace walked as women can walk  with the more repose and stateliness the greater the pain and shame in her soul she knew for certain that she was pretty  but this no longer gave her satisfaction as it used to
on the contrary it tormented her more than anything else of late  and particularly so on this bright  hot summer day in town
 it s sunday again another week past   she thought  recalling that she had been here the sunday before   and always the same life that is no life  and the same surroundings in which it used to be so easy to live
i m pretty  i m young  and i know that now i am good
i used to be bad  but now i know i am good   she thought   but yet my best years are slipping by and are no good to anyone   she stood by her mother s side and exchanged nods with acquaintances near her
from habit she scrutinized the ladies  dresses  condemned the bearing of a lady standing close by who was not crossing herself properly but in a cramped manner  and again she thought with vexation that she was herself being judged and was judging others  and suddenly  at the sound of the service  she felt horrified at her own vileness  horrified that the former purity of her soul was again lost to her
a comely  fresh looking old man was conducting the service with that mild solemnity which has so elevating and soothing an effect on the souls of the worshipers
the gates of the sanctuary screen were closed  the curtain was slowly drawn  and from behind it a soft mysterious voice pronounced some words
tears  the cause of which she herself did not understand  made natasha s breast heave  and a joyous but oppressive feeling agitated her
 teach me what i should do  how to live my life  how i may grow good forever  forever   she pleaded
the deacon came out onto the raised space before the altar screen and  holding his thumb extended  drew his long hair from under his dalmatic and  making the sign of the cross on his breast  began in a loud and solemn voice to recite the words of the prayer  
 in peace let us pray unto the lord    as one community  without distinction of class  without enmity  united by brotherly love let us pray   thought natasha
 for the peace that is from above  and for the salvation of our souls    for the world of angels and all the spirits who dwell above us   prayed natasha
when they prayed for the warriors  she thought of her brother and denisov
when they prayed for all traveling by land and sea  she remembered prince andrew  prayed for him  and asked god to forgive her all the wrongs she had done him
when they prayed for those who love us  she prayed for the members of her own family  her father and mother and sonya  realizing for the first time how wrongly she had acted toward them  and feeling all the strength of her love for them
when they prayed for those who hate us  she tried to think of her enemies and people who hated her  in order to pray for them
she included among her enemies the creditors and all who had business dealings with her father  and always at the thought of enemies and those who hated her she remembered anatole who had done her so much harm and though he did not hate her she gladly prayed for him as for an enemy
only at prayer did she feel able to think clearly and calmly of prince andrew and anatole  as men for whom her feelings were as nothing compared with her awe and devotion to god
when they prayed for the imperial family and the synod  she bowed very low and made the sign of the cross  saying to herself that even if she did not understand  still she could not doubt  and at any rate loved the governing synod and prayed for it
when he had finished the litany the deacon crossed the stole over his breast and said   let us commit ourselves and our whole lives to christ the lord    commit ourselves to god   natasha inwardly repeated
 lord god  i submit myself to thy will   she thought
 i want nothing  wish for nothing  teach me what to do and how to use my will  take me  take me   prayed natasha  with impatient emotion in her heart  not crossing herself but letting her slender arms hang down as if expecting some invisible power at any moment to take her and deliver her from herself  from her regrets  desires  remorse  hopes  and sins the countess looked round several times at her daughter s softened face and shining eyes and prayed god to help her
unexpectedly  in the middle of the service  and not in the usual order natasha knew so well  the deacon brought out a small stool  the one he knelt on when praying on trinity sunday  and placed it before the doors of the sanctuary screen
the priest came out with his purple velvet biretta on his head  adjusted his hair  and knelt down with an effort
everybody followed his example and they looked at one another in surprise
then came the prayer just received from the synod a prayer for the deliverance of russia from hostile invasion
 lord god of might  god of our salvation   began the priest in that voice  clear  not grandiloquent but mild  in which only the slav clergy read and which acts so irresistibly on a russian heart
 lord god of might  god of our salvation  look this day in mercy and blessing on thy humble people  and graciously hear us  spare us  and have mercy upon us  this foe confounding thy land  desiring to lay waste the whole world  rises against us  these lawless men are gathered together to overthrow thy kingdom  to destroy thy dear jerusalem  thy beloved russia  to defile thy temples  to overthrow thine altars  and to desecrate our holy shrines
how long  o lord  how long shall the wicked triumph  how long shall they wield unlawful power   lord god  hear us when we pray to thee  strengthen with thy might our most gracious sovereign lord  the emperor alexander pavlovich  be mindful of his uprightness and meekness  reward him according to his righteousness  and let it preserve us  thy chosen israel  bless his counsels  his undertakings  and his work  strengthen his kingdom by thine almighty hand  and give him victory over his enemy  even as thou gavest moses the victory over amalek  gideon over midian  and david over goliath
preserve his army  put a bow of brass in the hands of those who have armed themselves in thy name  and gird their loins with strength for the fight take up the spear and shield and arise to help us  confound and put to shame those who have devised evil against us  may they be before the faces of thy faithful warriors as dust before the wind  and may thy mighty angel confound them and put them to flight  may they be ensnared when they know it not  and may the plots they have laid in secret be turned against them  let them fall before thy servants  feet and be laid low by our hosts  lord  thou art able to save both great and small  thou art god  and man cannot prevail against thee   god of our fathers  remember thy bounteous mercy and loving kindness which are from of old  turn not thy face from us  but be gracious to our unworthiness  and in thy great goodness and thy many mercies regard not our transgressions and iniquities  create in us a clean heart and renew a right spirit within us  strengthen us all in thy faith  fortify our hope  inspire us with true love one for another  arm us with unity of spirit in the righteous defense of the heritage thou gavest to us and to our fathers  and let not the scepter of the wicked be exalted against the destiny of those thou hast sanctified
 o lord our god  in whom we believe and in whom we put our trust  let us not be confounded in our hope of thy mercy  and give us a token of thy blessing  that those who hate us and our orthodox faith may see it and be put to shame and perish  and may all the nations know that thou art the lord and we are thy people
show thy mercy upon us this day  o lord  and grant us thy salvation  make the hearts of thy servants to rejoice in thy mercy  smite down our enemies and destroy them swiftly beneath the feet of thy faithful servants  for thou art the defense  the succor  and the victory of them that put their trust in thee  and to thee be all glory  to father  son  and holy ghost  now and forever  world without end
amen   in natasha s receptive condition of soul this prayer affected her strongly
she listened to every word about the victory of moses over amalek  of gideon over midian  and of david over goliath  and about the destruction of  thy jerusalem   and she prayed to god with the tenderness and emotion with which her heart was overflowing  but without fully understanding what she was asking of god in that prayer
she shared with all her heart in the prayer for the spirit of righteousness  for the strengthening of the heart by faith and hope  and its animation by love
but she could not pray that her enemies might be trampled under foot when but a few minutes before she had been wishing she had more of them that she might pray for them
but neither could she doubt the righteousness of the prayer that was being read on bended knees
she felt in her heart a devout and tremulous awe at the thought of the punishment that overtakes men for their sins  and especially of her own sins  and she prayed to god to forgive them all  and her too  and to give them all  and her too  peace and happiness
and it seemed to her that god heard her prayer
from the day when pierre  after leaving the rostovs  with natasha s grateful look fresh in his mind  had gazed at the comet that seemed to be fixed in the sky and felt that something new was appearing on his own horizon from that day the problem of the vanity and uselessness of all earthly things  that had incessantly tormented him  no longer presented itself
that terrible question  why    wherefore   which had come to him amid every occupation  was now replaced  not by another question or by a reply to the former question  but by her image
when he listened to  or himself took part in  trivial conversations  when he read or heard of human baseness or folly  he was not horrified as formerly  and did not ask himself why men struggled so about these things when all is so transient and incomprehensible but he remembered her as he had last seen her  and all his doubts vanished not because she had answered the questions that had haunted him  but because his conception of her transferred him instantly to another  a brighter  realm of spiritual activity in which no one could be justified or guilty a realm of beauty and love which it was worth living for whatever worldly baseness presented itself to him  he said to himself   well  supposing n n
swindled the country and the tsar  and the country and the tsar confer honors upon him  what does that matter  she smiled at me yesterday and asked me to come again  and i love her  and no one will ever know it   and his soul felt calm and peaceful
pierre still went into society  drank as much and led the same idle and dissipated life  because besides the hours he spent at the rostovs  there were other hours he had to spend somehow  and the habits and acquaintances he had made in moscow formed a current that bore him along irresistibly
but latterly  when more and more disquieting reports came from the seat of war and natasha s health began to improve and she no longer aroused in him the former feeling of careful pity  an ever increasing restlessness  which he could not explain  took possession of him
he felt that the condition he was in could not continue long  that a catastrophe was coming which would change his whole life  and he impatiently sought everywhere for signs of that approaching catastrophe
one of his brother masons had revealed to pierre the following prophecy concerning napoleon  drawn from the revelation of st
john
here is wisdom
let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast  for it is the number of a man  and his number is six hundred threescore and six
and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies  and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months
the french alphabet  written out with the same numerical values as the hebrew  in which the first nine letters denote units and the others tens  will have the following significance  writing the words l empereur napoleon in numbers  it appears that the sum of them is 666  and that napoleon was therefore the beast foretold in the apocalypse
moreover  by applying the same system to the words quarantedeux  which was the term allowed to the beast that  spoke great things and blasphemies   the same number 666 was obtained  from which it followed that the limit fixed for napoleon s power had come in the year 1812 when the french emperor was forty two
this prophecy pleased pierre very much and he often asked himself what would put an end to the power of the beast  that is  of napoleon  and tried by the same system of using letters as numbers and adding them up  to find an answer to the question that engrossed him he wrote the words l empereur alexandre  la nation russe and added up their numbers  but the sums were either more or less than 666 once when making such calculations he wrote down his own name in french  comte pierre besouhoff  but the sum of the numbers did not come right
then he changed the spelling  substituting a z for the s and adding de and the article le  still without obtaining the desired result
then it occurred to him  if the answer to the question were contained in his name  his nationality would also be given in the answer
so he wrote le russe besuhof and adding up the numbers got 671
this was only five too much  and five was represented by e  the very letter elided from the article le before the word empereur
by omitting the e  though incorrectly  pierre got the answer he sought
l russe besuhof made 666
this discovery excited him
how  or by what means  he was connected with the great event foretold in the apocalypse he did not know  but he did not doubt that connection for a moment
his love for natasha  antichrist  napoleon  the invasion  the comet  666  l empereur napoleon  and l russe besuhof all this had to mature and culminate  to lift him out of that spellbound  petty sphere of moscow habits in which he felt himself held captive and lead him to a great achievement and great happiness   forty two
on the eve of the sunday when the special prayer was read  pierre had promised the rostovs to bring them  from count rostopchin whom he knew well  both the appeal to the people and the news from the army
in the morning  when he went to call at rostopchin s he met there a courier fresh from the army  an acquaintance of his own  who often danced at moscow balls
 do  please  for heaven s sake  relieve me of something   said the courier
 i have a sackful of letters to parents   among these letters was one from nicholas rostov to his father
pierre took that letter  and rostopchin also gave him the emperor s appeal to moscow  which had just been printed  the last army orders  and his own most recent bulletin
glancing through the army orders  pierre found in one of them  in the lists of killed  wounded  and rewarded  the name of nicholas rostov  awarded a st
george s cross of the fourth class for courage shown in the ostrovna affair  and in the same order the name of prince andrew bolkonski  appointed to the command of a regiment of chasseurs
though he did not want to remind the rostovs of bolkonski  pierre could not refrain from making them happy by the news of their son s having received a decoration  so he sent that printed army order and nicholas  letter to the rostovs  keeping the appeal  the bulletin  and the other orders to take with him when he went to dinner
his conversation with count rostopchin and the latter s tone of anxious hurry  the meeting with the courier who talked casually of how badly things were going in the army  the rumors of the discovery of spies in moscow and of a leaflet in circulation stating that napoleon promised to be in both the russian capitals by the autumn  and the talk of the emperor s being expected to arrive next day all aroused with fresh force that feeling of agitation and expectation in pierre which he had been conscious of ever since the appearance of the comet  and especially since the beginning of the war
he had long been thinking of entering the army and would have done so had he not been hindered  first  by his membership of the society of freemasons to which he was bound by oath and which preached perpetual peace and the abolition of war  and secondly  by the fact that when he saw the great mass of muscovites who had donned uniform and were talking patriotism  he somehow felt ashamed to take the step
but the chief reason for not carrying out his intention to enter the army lay in the vague idea that he was l russe besuhof who had the number of the beast  666  that his part in the great affair of setting a limit to the power of the beast that spoke great and blasphemous things had been predestined from eternity  and that therefore he ought not to undertake anything  but wait for what was bound to come to pass
a few intimate friends were dining with the rostovs that day  as usual on sundays
pierre came early so as to find them alone
he had grown so stout this year that he would have been abnormal had he not been so tall  so broad of limb  and so strong that he carried his bulk with evident ease
he went up the stairs  puffing and muttering something
his coachman did not even ask whether he was to wait
he knew that when his master was at the rostovs  he stayed till midnight
the rostovs  footman rushed eagerly forward to help him off with his cloak and take his hat and stick
pierre  from club habit  always left both hat and stick in the anteroom
the first person he saw in the house was natasha
even before he saw her  while taking off his cloak  he heard her
she was practicing solfa exercises in the music room
he knew that she had not sung since her illness  and so the sound of her voice surprised and delighted him
he opened the door softly and saw her  in the lilac dress she had worn at church  walking about the room singing
she had her back to him when he opened the door  but when  turning quickly  she saw his broad  surprised face  she blushed and came rapidly up to him
 i want to try to sing again   she said  adding as if by way of excuse   it is  at least  something to do    that s capital    how glad i am you ve come  i am so happy today   she said  with the old animation pierre had not seen in her for a long time
 you know nicholas has received a st
george s cross  i am so proud of him    oh yes  i sent that announcement
but i don t want to interrupt you   he added  and was about to go to the drawing room
natasha stopped him
 count  is it wrong of me to sing   she said blushing  and fixing her eyes inquiringly on him
 no  
why should it be  on the contrary  
but why do you ask me    i don t know myself   natasha answered quickly   but i should not like to do anything you disapproved of
i believe in you completely
you don t know how important you are to me  how much you ve done for me      she spoke rapidly and did not notice how pierre flushed at her words
 i saw in that same army order that he  bolkonski   she whispered the name hastily    is in russia  and in the army again
what do you think   she was speaking hurriedly  evidently afraid her strength might fail her  will he ever forgive me  will he not always have a bitter feeling toward me  what do you think  what do you think    i think     pierre replied   that he has nothing to forgive   
if i were in his place     by association of ideas  pierre was at once carried back to the day when  trying to comfort her  he had said that if he were not himself but the best man in the world and free  he would ask on his knees for her hand  and the same feeling of pity  tenderness  and love took possession of him and the same words rose to his lips but she did not give him time to say them
 yes  you  
you     she said  uttering the word you rapturously  that s a different thing
i know no one kinder  more generous  or better than you  nobody could be  had you not been there then  and now too  i don t know what would have become of me  because     tears suddenly rose in her eyes  she turned away  lifted her music before her eyes  began singing again  and again began walking up and down the room
just then petya came running in from the drawing room
petya was now a handsome rosy lad of fifteen with full red lips and resembled natasha
he was preparing to enter the university  but he and his friend obolenski had lately  in secret  agreed to join the hussars
petya had come rushing out to talk to his namesake about this affair
he had asked pierre to find out whether he would be accepted in the hussars
pierre walked up and down the drawing room  not listening to what petya was saying
petya pulled him by the arm to attract his attention
 well  what about my plan  peter kirilych  for heaven s sake  you are my only hope   said petya
 oh yes  your plan
to join the hussars  i ll mention it  i ll bring it all up today    well  mon cher  have you got the manifesto   asked the old count
 the countess has been to mass at the razumovskis  and heard the new prayer
she says it s very fine    yes  i ve got it   said pierre
 the emperor is to be here tomorrow  
there s to be an extraordinary meeting of the nobility  and they are talking of a levy of ten men per thousand
oh yes  let me congratulate you    yes  yes  thank god  well  and what news from the army    we are again retreating
they say we re already near smolensk   replied pierre
 o lord  o lord   exclaimed the count
 where is the manifesto    the emperor s appeal  oh yes   pierre began feeling in his pockets for the papers  but could not find them
still slapping his pockets  he kissed the hand of the countess who entered the room and glanced uneasily around  evidently expecting natasha  who had left off singing but had not yet come into the drawing room
 on my word  i don t know what i ve done with it   he said
 there he is  always losing everything   remarked the countess
natasha entered with a softened and agitated expression of face and sat down looking silently at pierre
as soon as she entered  pierre s features  which had been gloomy  suddenly lighted up  and while still searching for the papers he glanced at her several times
 no  really  i ll drive home  i must have left them there
i ll certainly      but you ll be late for dinner    oh  and my coachman has gone   but sonya  who had gone to look for the papers in the anteroom  had found them in pierre s hat  where he had carefully tucked them under the lining
pierre was about to begin reading
 no  after dinner   said the old count  evidently expecting much enjoyment from that reading
at dinner  at which champagne was drunk to the health of the new chevalier of st
george  shinshin told them the town news  of the illness of the old georgian princess  of metivier s disappearance from moscow  and of how some german fellow had been brought to rostopchin and accused of being a french  spyer   so count rostopchin had told the story   and how rostopchin let him go and assured the people that he was  not a spire at all  but only an old german ruin    people are being arrested     said the count
 i ve told the countess she should not speak french so much
it s not the time for it now    and have you heard   shinshin asked
 prince golitsyn has engaged a master to teach him russian
it is becoming dangerous to speak french in the streets    and how about you  count peter kirilych  if they call up the militia  you too will have to mount a horse   remarked the old count  addressing pierre
pierre had been silent and preoccupied all through dinner  seeming not to grasp what was said
he looked at the count
 oh yes  the war   he said
 no  what sort of warrior should i make  and yet everything is so strange  so strange  i can t make it out
i don t know  i am very far from having military tastes  but in these times no one can answer for himself   after dinner the count settled himself comfortably in an easy chair and with a serious face asked sonya  who was considered an excellent reader  to read the appeal  to moscow  our ancient capital   the enemy has entered the borders of russia with immense forces
he comes to despoil our beloved country   sonya read painstakingly in her high pitched voice
the count listened with closed eyes  heaving abrupt sighs at certain passages
natasha sat erect  gazing with a searching look now at her father and now at pierre
pierre felt her eyes on him and tried not to look round
the countess shook her head disapprovingly and angrily at every solemn expression in the manifesto
in all these words she saw only that the danger threatening her son would not soon be over
shinshin  with a sarcastic smile on his lips  was evidently preparing to make fun of anything that gave him the opportunity  sonya s reading  any remark of the count s  or even the manifesto itself should no better pretext present itself
after reading about the dangers that threatened russia  the hopes the emperor placed on moscow and especially on its illustrious nobility  sonya  with a quiver in her voice due chiefly to the attention that was being paid to her  read the last words   we ourselves will not delay to appear among our people in that capital and in other parts of our realm for consultation  and for the direction of all our levies  both those now barring the enemy s path and those freshly formed to defeat him wherever he may appear
may the ruin he hopes to bring upon us recoil on his own head  and may europe delivered from bondage glorify the name of russia    yes  that s it   cried the count  opening his moist eyes and sniffing repeatedly  as if a strong vinaigrette had been held to his nose  and he added   let the emperor but say the word and we ll sacrifice everything and begrudge nothing   before shinshin had time to utter the joke he was ready to make on the count s patriotism  natasha jumped up from her place and ran to her father
 what a darling our papa is   she cried  kissing him  and she again looked at pierre with the unconscious coquetry that had returned to her with her better spirits
 there  here s a patriot for you   said shinshin
 not a patriot at all  but simply     natasha replied in an injured tone
 everything seems funny to you  but this isn t at all a joke       a joke indeed   put in the count  let him but say the word and we ll all go   
we re not germans    but did you notice  it says   for consultation    said pierre
 never mind what it s for      at this moment  petya  to whom nobody was paying any attention  came up to his father with a very flushed face and said in his breaking voice that was now deep and now shrill   well  papa  i tell you definitely  and mamma too  it s as you please  but i say definitely that you must let me enter the army  because i can t  
that s all      the countess  in dismay  looked up to heaven  clasped her hands  and turned angrily to her husband
 that comes of your talking   said she
but the count had already recovered from his excitement
 come  come   said he
 here s a fine warrior  no  nonsense  you must study    it s not nonsense  papa
fedya obolenski is younger than i  and he s going too
besides  all the same i can t study now when     petya stopped short  flushed till he perspired  but still got out the words   when our fatherland is in danger    that ll do  that ll do nonsense       but you said yourself that we would sacrifice everything    petya  be quiet  i tell you   cried the count  with a glance at his wife  who had turned pale and was staring fixedly at her son
 and i tell you peter kirilych here will also tell you      nonsense  i tell you
your mother s milk has hardly dried on your lips and you want to go into the army  there  there  i tell you   and the count moved to go out of the room  taking the papers  probably to reread them in his study before having a nap
 well  peter kirilych  let s go and have a smoke   he said
pierre was agitated and undecided
natasha s unwontedly brilliant eyes  continually glancing at him with a more than cordial look  had reduced him to this condition
 no  i think i ll go home    home  why  you meant to spend the evening with us   
you don t often come nowadays as it is  and this girl of mine   said the count good naturedly  pointing to natasha   only brightens up when you re here    yes  i had forgotten  
i really must go home  
business     said pierre hurriedly
 well  then  au revoir   said the count  and went out of the room
 why are you going  why are you upset   asked natasha  and she looked challengingly into pierre s eyes
 because i love you   was what he wanted to say  but he did not say it  and only blushed till the tears came  and lowered his eyes
 because it is better for me to come less often  
because  
no  simply i have business       why  no  tell me   natasha began resolutely and suddenly stopped
they looked at each other with dismayed and embarrassed faces
he tried to smile but could not  his smile expressed suffering  and he silently kissed her hand and went out
pierre made up his mind not to go to the rostovs  any more
after the definite refusal he had received  petya went to his room and there locked himself in and wept bitterly when he came in to tea  silent  morose  and with tear stained face  everybody pretended not to notice anything
next day the emperor arrived in moscow  and several of the rostovs  domestic serfs begged permission to go to have a look at him
that morning petya was a long time dressing and arranging his hair and collar to look like a grown up man
he frowned before his looking glass  gesticulated  shrugged his shoulders  and finally  without saying a word to anyone  took his cap and left the house by the back door  trying to avoid notice
petya decided to go straight to where the emperor was and to explain frankly to some gentleman  in waiting  he imagined the emperor to be always surrounded by gentlemenin waiting  that he  count rostov  in spite of his youth wished to serve his country  that youth could be no hindrance to loyalty  and that he was ready to  
while dressing  petya had prepared many fine things he meant to say to the gentleman in waiting
it was on the very fact of being so young that petya counted for success in reaching the emperor he even thought how surprised everyone would be at his youthfulness and yet in the arrangement of his collar and hair and by his sedate deliberate walk he wished to appear a grown up man
but the farther he went and the more his attention was diverted by the ever increasing crowds moving toward the kremlin  the less he remembered to walk with the sedateness and deliberation of a man
as he approached the kremlin he even began to avoid being crushed and resolutely stuck out his elbows in a menacing way
but within the trinity gateway he was so pressed to the wall by people who probably were unaware of the patriotic intentions with which he had come that in spite of all his determination he had to give in  and stop while carriages passed in  rumbling beneath the archway
beside petya stood a peasant woman  a footman  two tradesmen  and a discharged soldier
after standing some time in the gateway  petya tried to move forward in front of the others without waiting for all the carriages to pass  and he began resolutely working his way with his elbows  but the woman just in front of him  who was the first against whom he directed his efforts  angrily shouted at him   what are you shoving for  young lordling  don t you see we re all standing still  then why push    anybody can shove   said the footman  and also began working his elbows to such effect that he pushed petya into a very filthy corner of the gateway
petya wiped his perspiring face with his hands and pulled up the damp collar which he had arranged so well at home to seem like a man s
he felt that he no longer looked presentable  and feared that if he were now to approach the gentlemen in waiting in that plight he would not be admitted to the emperor
but it was impossible to smarten oneself up or move to another place  because of the crowd
one of the generals who drove past was an acquaintance of the rostovs   and petya thought of asking his help  but came to the conclusion that that would not be a manly thing to do
when the carriages had all passed in  the crowd  carrying petya with it  streamed forward into the kremlin square which was already full of people
there were people not only in the square  but everywhere on the slopes and on the roofs
as soon as petya found himself in the square he clearly heard the sound of bells and the joyous voices of the crowd that filled the whole kremlin for a while the crowd was less dense  but suddenly all heads were bared  and everyone rushed forward in one direction
petya was being pressed so that he could scarcely breathe  and everybody shouted   hurrah  hurrah  hurrah   petya stood on tiptoe and pushed and pinched  but could see nothing except the people about him
all the faces bore the same expression of excitement and enthusiasm
a tradesman s wife standing beside petya sobbed  and the tears ran down her cheeks
 father  angel  dear one   she kept repeating  wiping away her tears with her fingers
 hurrah   was heard on all sides
for a moment the crowd stood still  but then it made another rush forward
quite beside himself  petya  clinching his teeth and rolling his eyes ferociously  pushed forward  elbowing his way and shouting  hurrah   as if he were prepared that instant to kill himself and everyone else  but on both sides of him other people with similarly ferocious faces pushed forward and everybody shouted  hurrah    so this is what the emperor is   thought petya  no  i can t petition him myself that would be too bold   but in spite of this he continued to struggle desperately forward  and from between the backs of those in front he caught glimpses of an open space with a strip of red cloth spread out on it  but just then the crowd swayed back the police in front were pushing back those who had pressed too close to the procession  the emperor was passing from the palace to the cathedral of the assumption and petya unexpectedly received such a blow on his side and ribs and was squeezed so hard that suddenly everything grew dim before his eyes and he lost consciousness
when he came to himself  a man of clerical appearance with a tuft of gray hair at the back of his head and wearing a shabby blue cassock probably a church clerk and chanter was holding him under the arm with one hand while warding off the pressure of the crowd with the other  you ve crushed the young gentleman   said the clerk
 what are you up to  gently   
they ve crushed him  crushed him   the emperor entered the cathedral of the assumption
the crowd spread out again more evenly  and the clerk led petya pale and breathless to the tsarcannon
several people were sorry for petya  and suddenly a crowd turned toward him and pressed round him
those who stood nearest him attended to him  unbuttoned his coat  seated him on the raised platform of the cannon  and reproached those others  whoever they might be  who had crushed him
 one might easily get killed that way  what do they mean by it  killing people  poor dear  he s as white as a sheet   various voices were heard saying
petya soon came to himself  the color returned to his face  the pain had passed  and at the cost of that temporary unpleasantness he had obtained a place by the cannon from where he hoped to see the emperor who would be returning that way petya no longer thought of presenting his petition
if he could only see the emperor he would be happy  while the service was proceeding in the cathedral of the assumption it was a combined service of prayer on the occasion of the emperor s arrival and of thanksgiving for the conclusion of peace with the turks the crowd outside spread out and hawkers appeared  selling kvas  gingerbread  and poppyseed sweets  of which petya was particularly fond   and ordinary conversation could again be heard
a tradesman s wife was showing a rent in her shawl and telling how much the shawl had cost  another was saying that all silk goods had now got dear
the clerk who had rescued petya was talking to a functionary about the priests who were officiating that day with the bishop
the clerk several times used the word  plenary   of the service   a word petya did not understand
two young citizens were joking with some serf girls who were cracking nuts
all these conversations  especially the joking with the girls  were such as might have had a particular charm for petya at his age  but they did not interest him now
he sat on his elevation the pedestal of the cannon still agitated as before by the thought of the emperor and by his love for him
the feeling of pain and fear he had experienced when he was being crushed  together with that of rapture  still further intensified his sense of the importance of the occasion
suddenly the sound of a firing of cannon was heard from the embankment  to celebrate the signing of peace with the turks  and the crowd rushed impetuously toward the embankment to watch the firing
petya too would have run there  but the clerk who had taken the young gentleman under his protection stopped him
the firing was still proceeding when officers  generals  and gentlemen in waiting came running out of the cathedral  and after them others in a more leisurely manner  caps were again raised  and those who had run to look at the cannon ran back again
at last four men in uniforms and sashes emerged from the cathedral doors  hurrah  hurrah   shouted the crowd again
 which is he  which   asked petya in a tearful voice  of those around him  but no one answered him  everybody was too excited  and petya  fixing on one of those four men  whom he could not clearly see for the tears of joy that filled his eyes  concentrated all his enthusiasm on him though it happened not to be the emperor frantically shouted  hurrah   and resolved that tomorrow  come what might  he would join the army
the crowd ran after the emperor  followed him to the palace  and began to disperse
it was already late  and petya had not eaten anything and was drenched with perspiration  yet he did not go home but stood with that diminishing  but still considerable  crowd before the palace while the emperor dined looking in at the palace windows  expecting he knew not what  and envying alike the notables he saw arriving at the entrance to dine with the emperor and the court footmen who served at table  glimpses of whom could be seen through the windows
while the emperor was dining  valuev  looking out of the window  said   the people are still hoping to see your majesty again   the dinner was nearly over  and the emperor  munching a biscuit  rose and went out onto the balcony
the people  with petya among them  rushed toward the balcony
 angel  dear one  hurrah  father      cried the crowd  and petya with it  and again the women and men of weaker mold  petya among them  wept with joy
a largish piece of the biscuit the emperor was holding in his hand broke off  fell on the balcony parapet  and then to the ground
a coachman in a jerkin  who stood nearest  sprang forward and snatched it up
several people in the crowd rushed at the coachman
seeing this the emperor had a plateful of biscuits brought him and began throwing them down from the balcony
petya s eyes grew bloodshot  and still more excited by the danger of being crushed  he rushed at the biscuits
he did not know why  but he had to have a biscuit from the tsar s hand and he felt that he must not give way
he sprang forward and upset an old woman who was catching at a biscuit  the old woman did not consider herself defeated though she was lying on the ground she grabbed at some biscuits but her hand did not reach them
petya pushed her hand away with his knee  seized a biscuit  and as if fearing to be too late  again shouted  hurrah   with a voice already hoarse
the emperor went in  and after that the greater part of the crowd began to disperse
 there  i said if only we waited and so it was   was being joyfully said by various people
happy as petya was  he felt sad at having to go home knowing that all the enjoyment of that day was over
he did not go straight home from the kremlin  but called on his friend obolenski  who was fifteen and was also entering the regiment
on returning home petya announced resolutely and firmly that if he was not allowed to enter the service he would run away
and next day  count ilya rostov though he had not yet quite yielded went to inquire how he could arrange for petya to serve where there would be least danger
two days later  on the fifteenth of july  an immense number of carriages were standing outside the sloboda palace
the great halls were full
in the first were the nobility and gentry in their uniforms  in the second bearded merchants in full skirted coats of blue cloth and wearing medals in the noblemen s hall there was an incessant movement and buzz of voices
the chief magnates sat on high backed chairs at a large table under the portrait of the emperor  but most of the gentry were strolling about the room
all these nobles  whom pierre met every day at the club or in their own houses  were in uniform some in that of catherine s day  others in that of emperor paul  others again in the new uniforms of alexander s time or the ordinary uniform of the nobility  and the general characteristic of being in uniform imparted something strange and fantastic to these diverse and familiar personalities  both old and young the old men  dim eyed  toothless  bald  sallow  and bloated  or gaunt and wrinkled  were especially striking
for the most part they sat quietly in their places and were silent  or  if they walked about and talked  attached themselves to someone younger on all these faces  as on the faces of the crowd petya had seen in the square  there was a striking contradiction  the general expectation of a solemn event  and at the same time the everyday interests in a boston card party  peter the cook  zinaida dmitrievna s health  and so on
pierre was there too  buttoned up since early morning in a nobleman s uniform that had become too tight for him
he was agitated  this extraordinary gathering not only of nobles but also of the merchant class les etats generaux  states general  evoked in him a whole series of ideas he had long laid aside but which were deeply graven in his soul  thoughts of the contrat social and the french revolution
the words that had struck him in the emperor s appeal  that the sovereign was coming to the capital for consultation with his people  strengthened this idea
and imagining that in this direction something important which he had long awaited was drawing near  he strolled about watching and listening to conversations  but nowhere finding any confirmation of the ideas that occupied him
the emperor s manifesto was read  evoking enthusiasm  and then all moved about discussing it
besides the ordinary topics of conversation  pierre heard questions of where the marshals of the nobility were to stand when the emperor entered  when a ball should be given in the emperor s honor  whether they should group themselves by districts or by whole provinces   and so on  but as soon as the war was touched on  or what the nobility had been convened for  the talk became undecided and indefinite
then all preferred listening to speaking
a middle aged man  handsome and virile  in the uniform of a retired naval officer  was speaking in one of the rooms  and a small crowd was pressing round him pierre went up to the circle that had formed round the speaker and listened
count ilya rostov  in a military uniform of catherine s time  was sauntering with a pleasant smile among the crowd  with all of whom he was acquainted
he too approached that group and listened with a kindly smile and nods of approval  as he always did  to what the speaker was saying
the retired naval man was speaking very boldly  as was evident from the expression on the faces of the listeners and from the fact that some people pierre knew as the meekest and quietest of men walked away disapprovingly or expressed disagreement with him
pierre pushed his way into the middle of the group  listened  and convinced himself that the man was indeed a liberal  but of views quite different from his own the naval officer spoke in a particularly sonorous  musical  and aristocratic baritone voice  pleasantly swallowing his r s and generally slurring his consonants  the voice of a man calling out to his servant   heah  bwing me my pipe   it was indicative of dissipation and the exercise of authority
 what if the smolensk people have offahd to waise militia for the empewah  ah we to take smolensk as our patte n  if the noble awistocwacy of the pwovince of moscow thinks fit  it can show its loyalty to our sov weign the empewah in other ways
have we fo gotten the waising of the militia in the yeah  seven  all that did was to enwich the pwiests  sons and thieves and wobbahs      count ilya rostov smiled blandly and nodded approval
 and was our militia of any use to the empia  not at all  it only wuined our farming  bettah have another conscwiption  
o  ou  men will wetu n neithah soldiers no  peasants  and we ll get only depwavity fwom them
the nobility don t gwudge theah lives evewy one of us will go and bwing in more wecwuits  and the sov weign   that was the way he referred to the emperor   need only say the word and we ll all die fo  him   added the orator with animation
count rostov s mouth watered with pleasure and he nudged pierre  but pierre wanted to speak himself he pushed forward  feeling stirred  but not yet sure what stirred him or what he would say
scarcely had he opened his mouth when one of the senators  a man without a tooth in his head  with a shrewd though angry expression  standing near the first speaker  interrupted him
evidently accustomed to managing debates and to maintaining an argument  he began in low but distinct tones   i imagine  sir   said he  mumbling with his toothless mouth   that we have been summoned here not to discuss whether it s best for the empire at the present moment to adopt conscription or to call out the militia
we have been summoned to reply to the appeal with which our sovereign the emperor has honored us
but to judge what is best conscription or the militia we can leave to the supreme authority      pierre suddenly saw an outlet for his excitement
he hardened his heart against the senator who was introducing this set and narrow attitude into the deliberations of the nobility
pierre stepped forward and interrupted him
he himself did not yet know what he would say  but he began to speak eagerly   excuse me  your excellency   he began  he was well acquainted with the senator  but thought it necessary on this occasion to address him formally    though i don t agree with the gentleman      he hesitated  he wished to say   mon tres honorable preopinant   my very honorable opponent    with the gentleman  
whom i have not the honor of knowing  i suppose that the nobility have been summoned not merely to express their sympathy and enthusiasm but also to consider the means by which we can assist our fatherland  i imagine   he went on  warming to his subject   that the emperor himself would not be satisfied to find in us merely owners of serfs whom we are willing to devote to his service  and chair a canon   we are ready to make of ourselves and not to obtain from us any co co counsel      food for cannon   many persons withdrew from the circle  noticing the senator s sarcastic smile and the freedom of pierre s remarks only count rostov was pleased with them as he had been pleased with those of the naval officer  the senator  and in general with whatever speech he had last heard
 i think that before discussing these questions   pierre continued   we should ask the emperor most respectfully ask his majesty to let us know the number of our troops and the position in which our army and our forces now are  and then     but scarcely had pierre uttered these words before he was attacked from three sides
the most vigorous attack came from an old acquaintance  a boston player who had always been well disposed toward him  stepan stepanovich adraksin
adraksin was in uniform  and whether as a result of the uniform or from some other cause pierre saw before him quite a different man
with a sudden expression of malevolence on his aged face  adraksin shouted at pierre   in the first place  i tell you we have no right to question the emperor about that  and secondly  if the russian nobility had that right  the emperor could not answer such a question
the troops are moved according to the enemy s movements and the number of men increases and decreases     another voice  that of a nobleman of medium height and about forty years of age  whom pierre had formerly met at the gypsies  and knew as a bad cardplayer  and who  also transformed by his uniform  came up to pierre  interrupted adraksin
 yes  and this is not a time for discussing   he continued   but for acting  there is war in russia  the enemy is advancing to destroy russia  to desecrate the tombs of our fathers  to carry off our wives and children   the nobleman smote his breast
 we will all arise  every one of us will go  for our father the tsar   he shouted  rolling his bloodshot eyes
several approving voices were heard in the crowd
 we are russians and will not grudge our blood in defense of our faith  the throne  and the fatherland  we must cease raving if we are sons of our fatherland  we will show europe how russia rises to the defense of russia   pierre wished to reply  but could not get in a word
he felt that his words  apart from what meaning they conveyed  were less audible than the sound of his opponent s voice
count rostov at the back of the crowd was expressing approval  several persons  briskly turning a shoulder to the orator at the end of a phrase  said   that s right  quite right  just so   pierre wished to say that he was ready to sacrifice his money  his serfs  or himself  only one ought to know the state of affairs in order to be able to improve it  but he was unable to speak many voices shouted and talked at the same time  so that count rostov had not time to signify his approval of them all  and the group increased  dispersed  re formed  and then moved with a hum of talk into the largest hall and to the big table
not only was pierre s attempt to speak unsuccessful  but he was rudely interrupted  pushed aside  and people turned away from him as from a common enemy
this happened not because they were displeased by the substance of his speech  which had even been forgotten after the many subsequent speeches  but to animate it the crowd needed a tangible object to love and a tangible object to hate
pierre became the latter
many other orators spoke after the excited nobleman  and all in the same tone
many spoke eloquently and with originality
glinka  the editor of the russian messenger  who was recognized  cries of  author  author   were heard in the crowd   said that  hell must be repulsed by hell   and that he had seen a child smiling at lightning flashes and thunderclaps  but  we will not be that child    yes  yes  at thunderclaps   was repeated approvingly in the back rows of the crowd
the crowd drew up to the large table  at which sat gray haired or bald seventy  year old magnates  uniformed and besashed almost all of whom pierre had seen in their own homes with their buffoons  or playing boston at the clubs
with an incessant hum of voices the crowd advanced to the table
pressed by the throng against the high backs of the chairs  the orators spoke one after another and sometimes two together
those standing behind noticed what a speaker omitted to say and hastened to supply it
others in that heat and crush racked their brains to find some thought and hastened to utter it
the old magnates  whom pierre knew  sat and turned to look first at one and then at another  and their faces for the most part only expressed the fact that they found it very hot
pierre  however  felt excited  and the general desire to show that they were ready to go to all lengths which found expression in the tones and looks more than in the substance of the speeches infected him too
he did not renounce his opinions  but felt himself in some way to blame and wished to justify himself  i only said that it would be more to the purpose to make sacrifices when we know what is needed   said he  trying to be heard above the other voices
one of the old men nearest to him looked round  but his attention was immediately diverted by an exclamation at the other side of the table
 yes  moscow will be surrendered  she will be our expiation   shouted one man
 he is the enemy of mankind   cried another
 allow me to speak       gentlemen  you are crushing me      at that moment count rostopchin with his protruding chin and alert eyes  wearing the uniform of a general with sash over his shoulder  entered the room  stepping briskly to the front of the crowd of gentry
 our sovereign the emperor will be here in a moment   said rostopchin
 i am straight from the palace
seeing the position we are in  i think there is little need for discussion
the emperor has deigned to summon us and the merchants
millions will pour forth from there  he pointed to the merchants  hall  but our business is to supply men and not spare ourselves  
that is the least we can do   a conference took place confined to the magnates sitting at the table
the whole consultation passed more than quietly
after all the preceding noise the sound of their old voices saying one after another   i agree   or for variety   i too am of that opinion   and so on had even a mournful effect
the secretary was told to write down the resolution of the moscow nobility and gentry  that they would furnish ten men  fully equipped  out of every thousand serfs  as the smolensk gentry had done
their chairs made a scraping noise as the gentlemen who had conferred rose with apparent relief  and began walking up and down  arm in arm  to stretch their legs and converse in couples  the emperor  the emperor   a sudden cry resounded through the halls and the whole throng hurried to the entrance
the emperor entered the hall through a broad path between two lines of nobles
every face expressed respectful  awe struck curiosity
pierre stood rather far off and could not hear all that the emperor said
from what he did hear he understood that the emperor spoke of the danger threatening the empire and of the hopes he placed on the moscow nobility
he was answered by a voice which informed him of the resolution just arrived at
 gentlemen   said the emperor with a quivering voice
there was a rustling among the crowd and it again subsided  so that pierre distinctly heard the pleasantly human voice of the emperor saying with emotion   i never doubted the devotion of the russian nobles  but today it has surpassed my expectations
i thank you in the name of the fatherland  gentlemen  let us act  time is most precious     the emperor ceased speaking  the crowd began pressing round him  and rapturous exclamations were heard from all sides
 yes  most precious  
a royal word   said count rostov  with a sob
he stood at the back  and  though he had heard hardly anything  understood everything in his own way
from the hall of the nobility the emperor went to that of the merchants
there he remained about ten minutes
pierre was among those who saw him come out from the merchants  hall with tears of emotion in his eyes
as became known later  he had scarcely begun to address the merchants before tears gushed from his eyes and he concluded in a trembling voice
when pierre saw the emperor he was coming out accompanied by two merchants  one of whom pierre knew  a fat otkupshchik
the other was the mayor  a man with a thin sallow face and narrow beard
both were weeping
tears filled the thin man s eyes  and the fat otkupshchik sobbed outright like a child and kept repeating   our lives and property take them  your majesty   pierre s one feeling at the moment was a desire to show that he was ready to go all lengths and was prepared to sacrifice everything
he now felt ashamed of his speech with its constitutional tendency and sought an opportunity of effacing it
having heard that count mamonov was furnishing a regiment  bezukhov at once informed rostopchin that he would give a thousand men and their maintenance
old rostov could not tell his wife of what had passed without tears  and at once consented to petya s request and went himself to enter his name next day the emperor left moscow
the assembled nobles all took off their uniforms and settled down again in their homes and clubs  and not without some groans gave orders to their stewards about the enrollment  feeling amazed themselves at what they had done t help donning a polish uniform and yielding to the stimulating influence of a june morning  and could not refrain from bursts of anger in the presence of kurakin and then of balashev
alexander refused negotiations because he felt himself to be personally insulted barclay de tolly tried to command the army in the best way  because he wished to fulfill his duty and earn fame as a great commander
rostov charged the french because he could not restrain his wish for a gallop across a level field  and in the same way the innumerable people who took part in the war acted in accord with their personal characteristics  habits  circumstances  and aims they were moved by fear or vanity  rejoiced or were indignant  reasoned  imagining that they knew what they were doing and did it of their own free will  but they all were involuntary tools of history  carrying on a work concealed from them but comprehensible to us
such is the inevitable fate of men of action  and the higher they stand in the social hierarchy the less are they free
the actors of 1812 have long since left the stage  their personal interests have vanished leaving no trace  and nothing remains of that time but its historic results
providence compelled all these men  striving to attain personal aims  to further the accomplishment of a stupendous result no one of them at all expected  neither napoleon  nor alexander  nor still less any of those who did the actual fighting the cause of the destruction of the french army in 1812 is clear to us now
no one will deny that that cause was  on the one hand  its advance into the heart of russia late in the season without any preparation for a winter campaign and  on the other  the character given to the war by the burning of russian towns and the hatred of the foe this aroused among the russian people
but no one at the time foresaw  what now seems so evident  that this was the only way an army of eight hundred thousand men the best in the world and led by the best general could be destroyed in conflict with a raw army of half its numerical strength  and led by inexperienced commanders as the russian army was not only did no one see this  but on the russian side every effort was made to hinder the only thing that could save russia  while on the french side  despite napoleon s experience and so called military genius  every effort was directed to pushing on to moscow at the end of the summer  that is  to doing the very thing that was bound to lead to destruction
in historical works on the year 1812 french writers are very fond of saying that napoleon felt the danger of extending his line  that he sought a battle and that his marshals advised him to stop at smolensk  and of making similar statements to show that the danger of the campaign was even then understood
russian authors are still fonder of telling us that from the commencement of the campaign a scythian war plan was adopted to lure napoleon into the depths of russia  and this plan some of them attribute to pfuel  others to a certain frenchman  others to toll  and others again to alexander himself  pointing to notes  projects  and letters which contain hints of such a line of action but all these hints at what happened  both from the french side and the russian  are advanced only because they fit in with the event
had that event not occurred these hints would have been forgotten  as we have forgotten the thousands and millions of hints and expectations to the contrary which were current then but have now been forgotten because the event falsified them
there are always so many conjectures as to the issue of any event that however it may end there will always be people to say   i said then that it would be so   quite forgetting that amid their innumerable conjectures many were to quite the contrary effect
conjectures as to napoleon s awareness of the danger of extending his line  and  on the russian side  as to luring the enemy into the depths of russia  are evidently of that kind  and only by much straining can historians attribute such conceptions to napoleon and his marshals  or such plans to the russian commanders
all the facts are in flat contradiction to such conjectures
during the whole period of the war not only was there no wish on the russian side to draw the french into the heart of the country  but from their first entry into russia everything was done to stop them
and not only was napoleon not afraid to extend his line  but he welcomed every step forward as a triumph and did not seek battle as eagerly as in former campaigns  but very lazily
at the very beginning of the war our armies were divided  and our sole aim was to unite them  though uniting the armies was no advantage if we meant to retire and lure the enemy into the depths of the country
our emperor joined the army to encourage it to defend every inch of russian soil and not to retreat
the enormous drissa camp was formed on pfuel s plan  and there was no intention of retiring farther
the emperor reproached the commanders in chief for every step they retired
he could not bear the idea of letting the enemy even reach smolensk  still less could he contemplate the burning of moscow  and when our armies did unite he was displeased that smolensk was abandoned and burned without a general engagement having been fought under its walls
so thought the emperor  and the russian commanders and people were still more provoked at the thought that our forces were retreating into the depths of the country
napoleon having cut our armies apart advanced far into the country and missed several chances of forcing an engagement
in august he was at smolensk and thought only of how to advance farther  though as we now see that advance was evidently ruinous to him
the facts clearly show that napoleon did not foresee the danger of the advance on moscow  nor did alexander and the russian commanders then think of luring napoleon on  but quite the contrary
the luring of napoleon into the depths of the country was not the result of any plan  for no one believed it to be possible  it resulted from a most complex interplay of intrigues  aims  and wishes among those who took part in the war and had no perception whatever of the inevitable  or of the one way of saving russia everything came about fortuitously
the armies were divided at the commencement of the campaign
we tried to unite them  with the evident intention of giving battle and checking the enemy s advance  and by this effort to unite them while avoiding battle with a much stronger enemy  and necessarily withdrawing the armies at an acute angle we led the french on to smolensk
but we withdrew at an acute angle not only because the french advanced between our two armies  the angle became still more acute and we withdrew still farther  because barclay de tolly was an unpopular foreigner disliked by bagration  who would come under his command   and bagration  being in command of the second army tried to postpone joining up and coming under barclay s command as long as he could
bagration was slow in effecting the junction though that was the chief aim of all at headquarters  because  as he alleged  he exposed his army to danger on this march  and it was best for him to retire more to the left and more to the south  worrying the enemy from flank and rear and securing from the ukraine recruits for his army  and it looks as if he planned this in order not to come under the command of the detested foreigner barclay  whose rank was inferior to his own
the emperor was with the army to encourage it  but his presence and ignorance of what steps to take  and the enormous number of advisers and plans  destroyed the first army s energy and it retired
the intention was to make a stand at the drissa camp  but paulucci  aiming at becoming commander in chief  unexpectedly employed his energy to influence alexander  and pfuel s whole plan was abandoned and the command entrusted to barclay
but as barclay did not inspire confidence his power was limited
the armies were divided  there was no unity of command  and barclay was unpopular  but from this confusion  division  and the unpopularity of the foreign commander in chief  there resulted on the one hand indecision and the avoidance of a battle  which we could not have refrained from had the armies been united and had someone else  instead of barclay  been in command  and on the other an ever increasing indignation against the foreigners and an increase in patriotic zeal
at last the emperor left the army  and as the most convenient and indeed the only pretext for his departure it was decided that it was necessary for him to inspire the people in the capitals and arouse the nation in general to a patriotic war
and by this visit of the emperor to moscow the strength of the russian army was trebled
he left in order not to obstruct the commander in chief s undivided control of the army  and hoping that more decisive action would then be taken  but the command of the armies became still more confused and enfeebled
bennigsen  the tsarevich  and a swarm of adjutants general remained with the army to keep the commander in chief under observation and arouse his energy  and barclay  feeling less free than ever under the observation of all these  eyes of the emperor   became still more cautious of undertaking any decisive action and avoided giving battle
barclay stood for caution
the tsarevich hinted at treachery and demanded a general engagement
lubomirski  bronnitski  wlocki  and the others of that group stirred up so much trouble that barclay  under pretext of sending papers to the emperor  dispatched these polish adjutants general to petersburg and plunged into an open struggle with bennigsen and the tsarevich
at smolensk the armies at last reunited  much as bagration disliked it
bagration drove up in a carriage to the house occupied by barclay
barclay donned his sash and came out to meet and report to his senior officer bagration
despite his seniority in rank bagration  in this contest of magnanimity  took his orders from barclay  but  having submitted  agreed with him less than ever
by the emperor s orders bagration reported direct to him
he wrote to arakcheev  the emperor s confidant   it must be as my sovereign pleases  but i cannot work with the minister  meaning barclay 
for god s sake send me somewhere else if only in command of a regiment
i cannot stand it here
headquarters are so full of germans that a russian cannot exist and there is no sense in anything
i thought i was really serving my sovereign and the fatherland  but it turns out that i am serving barclay
i confess i do not want to   the swarm of bronnitskis and wintzingerodes and their like still further embittered the relations between the commanders in chief  and even less unity resulted
preparations were made to fight the french before smolensk
a general was sent to survey the position
this general  hating barclay  rode to visit a friend of his own  a corps commander  and  having spent the day with him  returned to barclay and condemned  as unsuitable from every point of view  the battleground he had not seen
while disputes and intrigues were going on about the future field of battle  and while we were looking for the french having lost touch with them the french stumbled upon neverovski s division and reached the walls of smolensk
it was necessary to fight an unexpected battle at smolensk to save our lines of communication
the battle was fought and thousands were killed on both sides
smolensk was abandoned contrary to the wishes of the emperor and of the whole people
but smolensk was burned by its own inhabitants who had been misled by their governor
and these ruined inhabitants  setting an example to other russians  went to moscow thinking only of their own losses but kindling hatred of the foe
napoleon advanced farther and we retired  thus arriving at the very result which caused his destruction
the day after his son had left  prince nicholas sent for princess mary to come to his study
 well  are you satisfied now   said he
 you ve made me quarrel with my son  satisfied  are you  that s all you wanted  satisfied   
it hurts me  it hurts
i m old and weak and this is what you wanted
well then  gloat over it  gloat over it   after that princess mary did not see her father for a whole week
he was ill and did not leave his study
princess mary noticed to her surprise that during this illness the old prince not only excluded her from his room  but did not admit mademoiselle bourienne either
tikhon alone attended him
at the end of the week the prince reappeared and resumed his former way of life  devoting himself with special activity to building operations and the arrangement of the gardens and completely breaking off his relations with mademoiselle bourienne his looks and cold tone to his daughter seemed to say   there  you see  you plotted against me  you lied to prince andrew about my relations with that frenchwoman and made me quarrel with him  but you see i need neither her nor you   princess mary spent half of every day with little nicholas  watching his lessons  teaching him russian and music herself  and talking to dessalles  the folk  who sometimes came by the back door to see her
of the war princess mary thought as women do think about wars
she feared for her brother who was in it  was horrified by and amazed at the strange cruelty that impels men to kill one another  but she did not understand the significance of this war  which seemed to her like all previous wars
she did not realize the significance of this war  though dessalles with whom she constantly conversed was passionately interested in its progress and tried to explain his own conception of it to her  and though the  god s folk  who came to see her reported  in their own way  the rumors current among the people of an invasion by antichrist  and though julie  now princess drubetskaya   who had resumed correspondence with her  wrote patriotic letters from moscow
 i write you in russian  my good friend   wrote julie in her frenchified russian   because i have a detestation for all the french  and the same for their language which i cannot support to hear spoken   
we in moscow are elated by enthusiasm for our adored emperor
 my poor husband is enduring pains and hunger in jewish taverns  but the news which i have inspires me yet more
 you heard probably of the heroic exploit of raevski  embracing his two sons and saying   i will perish with them but we will not be shaken   and truly though the enemy was twice stronger than we  we were unshakable
we pass the time as we can  but in war as in war  the princesses aline and sophie sit whole days with me  and we  unhappy widows of live men  make beautiful conversations over our  charpie   only you  my friend  are missing     and so on
the chief reason princess mary did not realize the full significance of this war was that the old prince never spoke of it  did not recognize it  and laughed at dessalles when he mentioned it at dinner
the prince s tone was so calm and confident that princess mary unhesitatingly believed him
all that july the old prince was exceedingly active and even animated
he planned another garden and began a new building for the domestic serfs
the only thing that made princess mary anxious about him was that he slept very little and  instead of sleeping in his study as usual  changed his sleeping place every day
one day he would order his camp bed to be set up in the glass gallery  another day he remained on the couch or on the lounge chair in the drawing room and dozed there without undressing  while instead of mademoiselle bourienne a serf boy read to him
then again he would spend a night in the dining room
on august 1  a second letter was received from prince andrew
in his first letter which came soon after he had left home  prince andrew had dutifully asked his father s forgiveness for what he had allowed himself to say and begged to be restored to his favor to this letter the old prince had replied affectionately  and from that time had kept the frenchwoman at a distance
prince andrew s second letter  written near vitebsk after the french had occupied that town  gave a brief account of the whole campaign  enclosed for them a plan he had drawn and forecasts as to the further progress of the war
in this letter prince andrew pointed out to his father the danger of staying at bald hills  so near the theater of war and on the army s direct line of march  and advised him to move to moscow
at dinner that day  on dessalles  mentioning that the french were said to have already entered vitebsk  the old prince remembered his son s letter
 there was a letter from prince andrew today   he said to princess mary   haven t you read it    no  father   she replied in a frightened voice
she could not have read the letter as she did not even know it had arrived
 he writes about this war   said the prince  with the ironic smile that had become habitual to him in speaking of the present war
 that must be very interesting   said dessalles
 prince andrew is in a position to know      oh  very interesting   said mademoiselle bourienne
 go and get it for me   said the old prince to mademoiselle bourienne
 you know under the paperweight on the little table   mademoiselle bourienne jumped up eagerly
 no  don t   he exclaimed with a frown
 you go  michael ivanovich   michael ivanovich rose and went to the study
but as soon as he had left the room the old prince  looking uneasily round  threw down his napkin and went himself  they can t do anything  
always make some muddle   he muttered
while he was away princess mary  dessalles  mademoiselle bourienne  and even little nicholas exchanged looks in silence
the old prince returned with quick steps  accompanied by michael ivanovich  bringing the letter and a plan
these he put down beside him not letting anyone read them at dinner
on moving to the drawing room he handed the letter to princess mary and  spreading out before him the plan of the new building and fixing his eyes upon it  told her to read the letter aloud
when she had done so princess mary looked inquiringly at her father
he was examining the plan  evidently engrossed in his own ideas
 what do you think of it  prince   dessalles ventured to ask
 i  i      said the prince as if unpleasantly awakened  and not taking his eyes from the plan of the building
 very possibly the theater of war will move so near to us that      ha ha ha  the theater of war   said the prince
 i have said and still say that the theater of war is poland and the enemy will never get beyond the niemen   dessalles looked in amazement at the prince  who was talking of the niemen when the enemy was already at the dnieper  but princess mary  forgetting the geographical position of the niemen  thought that what her father was saying was correct
 when the snow melts they ll sink in the polish swamps
only they could fail to see it   the prince continued  evidently thinking of the campaign of 1807 which seemed to him so recent
 bennigsen should have advanced into prussia sooner  then things would have taken a different turn      but  prince   dessalles began timidly   the letter mentions vitebsk       ah  the letter  yes     replied the prince peevishly
 yes  
yes     his face suddenly took on a morose expression
he paused
 yes  he writes that the french were beaten at  
at  
what river is it   dessalles dropped his eyes
 the prince says nothing about that   he remarked gently
 doesn t he  but i didn t invent it myself   no one spoke for a long time
 yes  
yes  
well  michael ivanovich   he suddenly went on  raising his head and pointing to the plan of the building   tell me how you mean to alter it      michael ivanovich went up to the plan  and the prince after speaking to him about the building looked angrily at princess mary and dessalles and went to his own room
princess mary saw dessalles  embarrassed and astonished look fixed on her father  noticed his silence  and was struck by the fact that her father had forgotten his son s letter on the drawing room table  but she was not only afraid to speak of it and ask dessalles the reason of his confusion and silence  but was afraid even to think about it
in the evening michael ivanovich  sent by the prince  came to princess mary for prince andrew s letter which had been forgotten in the drawing room
she gave it to him and  unpleasant as it was to her to do so  ventured to ask him what her father was doing
 always busy   replied michael ivanovich with a respectfully ironic smile which caused princess mary to turn pale
 he s worrying very much about the new building
he has been reading a little  but now  michael ivanovich went on  lowering his voice  now he s at his desk  busy with his will  i expect    one of the prince s favorite occupations of late had been the preparation of some papers he meant to leave at his death and which he called his  will     and alpatych is being sent to smolensk   asked princess mary
 oh  yes  he has been waiting to start for some time   when michael ivanovich returned to the study with the letter  the old prince  with spectacles on and a shade over his eyes  was sitting at his open bureau with screened candles  holding a paper in his outstretched hand  and in a somewhat dramatic attitude was reading his manuscript his  remarks  as he termed it which was to be transmitted to the emperor after his death when michael ivanovich went in there were tears in the prince s eyes evoked by the memory of the time when the paper he was now reading had been written
he took the letter from michael ivanovich s hand  put it in his pocket  folded up his papers  and called in alpatych who had long been waiting
the prince had a list of things to be bought in smolensk and  walking up and down the room past alpatych who stood by the door  he gave his instructions
 first  notepaper do you hear  eight quires  like this sample  gilt edged  
it must be exactly like the sample
varnish  sealing wax  as in michael ivanovich s list   he paced up and down for a while and glanced at his notes
 then hand to the governor in person a letter about the deed   next  bolts for the doors of the new building were wanted and had to be of a special shape the prince had himself designed  and a leather case had to be ordered to keep the  will  in the instructions to alpatych took over two hours and still the prince did not let him go
he sat down  sank into thought  closed his eyes  and dozed off
alpatych made a slight movement
 well  go  go  if anything more is wanted i ll send after you   alpatych went out
the prince again went to his bureau  glanced into it  fingered his papers  closed the bureau again  and sat down at the table to write to the governor
it was already late when he rose after sealing the letter
he wished to sleep  but he knew he would not be able to and that most depressing thoughts came to him in bed
so he called tikhon and went through the rooms with him to show him where to set up the bed for that night he went about looking at every corner
every place seemed unsatisfactory  but worst of all was his customary couch in the study
that couch was dreadful to him  probably because of the oppressive thoughts he had had when lying there
it was unsatisfactory everywhere  but the corner behind the piano in the sitting room was better than other places  he had never slept there yet
with the help of a footman tikhon brought in the bedstead and began putting it up
 that s not right  that s not right   cried the prince  and himself pushed it a few inches from the corner and then closer in again  well  at last i ve finished  now i ll rest   thought the prince  and let tikhon undress him
frowning with vexation at the effort necessary to divest himself of his coat and trousers  the prince undressed  sat down heavily on the bed  and appeared to be meditating as he looked contemptuously at his withered yellow legs he was not meditating  but only deferring the moment of making the effort to lift those legs up and turn over on the bed
 ugh  how hard it is  oh  that this toil might end and you would release me   thought he
pressing his lips together he made that effort for the twenty thousandth time and lay down
but hardly had he done so before he felt the bed rocking backwards and forwards beneath him as if it were breathing heavily and jolting
this happened to him almost every night
he opened his eyes as they were closing
 no peace  damn them   he muttered  angry he knew not with whom
 ah yes  there was something else important  very important  that i was keeping till i should be in bed
the bolts  no  i told him about them
no  it was something  something in the drawing room
princess mary talked some nonsense
dessalles  that fool  said something
something in my pocket can t remember      tikhon  what did we talk about at dinner    about prince michael      be quiet  quiet   the prince slapped his hand on the table
 yes  i know  prince andrew s letter  princess mary read it
dessalles said something about vitebsk
now i ll read it   he had the letter taken from his pocket and the table on which stood a glass of lemonade and a spiral wax candle moved close to the bed  and putting on his spectacles he began reading
only now in the stillness of the night  reading it by the faint light under the green shade  did he grasp its meaning for a moment
 the french at vitebsk  in four days  march they may be at smolensk  perhaps are already there  tikhon   tikhon jumped up
 no  no  i don t want anything   he shouted
he put the letter under the candlestick and closed his eyes
and there rose before him the danube at bright noonday  reeds  the russian camp  and himself a young general without a wrinkle on his ruddy face  vigorous and alert  entering potemkin s gaily colored tent  and a burning sense of jealousy of  the favorite  agitated him now as strongly as it had done then he recalled all the words spoken at that first meeting with potemkin
and he saw before him a plump  rather sallow faced  short  stout woman  the empress mother  with her smile and her words at her first gracious reception of him  and then that same face on the catafalque  and the encounter he had with zubov over her coffin about his right to kiss her hand
 oh  quicker  quicker  to get back to that time and have done with all the present  quicker  quicker and that they should leave me in peace   bald hills  prince nicholas bolkonski s estate  lay forty miles east from smolensk and two miles from the main road to moscow
the same evening that the prince gave his instructions to alpatych  dessalles  having asked to see princess mary  told her that  as the prince was not very well and was taking no steps to secure his safety  though from prince andrew s letter it was evident that to remain at bald hills might be dangerous  he respectfully advised her to send a letter by alpatych to the provincial governor at smolensk  asking him to let her know the state of affairs and the extent of the danger to which bald hills was exposed
dessalles wrote this letter to the governor for princess mary  she signed it  and it was given to alpatych with instructions to hand it to the governor and to come back as quickly as possible if there was danger
having received all his orders alpatych  wearing a white beaver hat a present from the prince and carrying a stick as the prince did  went out accompanied by his family
three well fed roans stood ready harnessed to a small conveyance with a leather hood
the larger bell was muffled and the little bells on the harness stuffed with paper
the prince allowed no one at bald hills to drive with ringing bells  but on a long journey alpatych liked to have them
his satellites the senior clerk  a countinghouse clerk  a scullery maid  a cook  two old women  a little pageboy  the coachman  and various domestic serfs were seeing him off
his daughter placed chintz covered down cushions for him to sit on and behind his back
his old sister in law popped in a small bundle  and one of the coachmen helped him into the vehicle
 there  there  women s fuss  women  women   said alpatych  puffing and speaking rapidly just as the prince did  and he climbed into the trap
after giving the clerk orders about the work to be done  alpatych  not trying to imitate the prince now  lifted the hat from his bald head and crossed himself three times  if there is anything  
come back  yakov alpatych  for christ s sake think of us   cried his wife  referring to the rumors of war and the enemy
 women  women  women s fuss   muttered alpatych to himself and started on his journey  looking round at the fields of yellow rye and the still green  thickly growing oats  and at other quite black fields just being plowed a second time as he went along he looked with pleasure at the year s splendid crop of corn  scrutinized the strips of ryefield which here and there were already being reaped  made his calculations as to the sowing and the harvest  and asked himself whether he had not forgotten any of the prince s orders having baited the horses twice on the way  he arrived at the town toward evening on the fourth of august
alpatych kept meeting and overtaking baggage trains and troops on the road
as he approached smolensk he heard the sounds of distant firing  but these did not impress him
what struck him most was the sight of a splendid field of oats in which a camp had been pitched and which was being mown down by the soldiers  evidently for fodder
this fact impressed alpatych  but in thinking about his own business he soon forgot it
all the interests of his life for more than thirty years had been bounded by the will of the prince  and he never went beyond that limit
everything not connected with the execution of the prince s orders did not interest and did not even exist for alpatych
on reaching smolensk on the evening of the fourth of august he put up in the gachina suburb across the dnieper  at the inn kept by ferapontov  where he had been in the habit of putting up for the last thirty years
some thirty years ago ferapontov  by alpatych s advice  had bought a wood from the prince  had begun to trade  and now had a house  an inn  and a corn dealer s shop in that province
he was a stout  dark  red faced peasant in the forties  with thick lips  a broad knob of a nose  similar knobs over his black frowning brows  and a round belly
wearing a waistcoat over his cotton shirt  ferapontov was standing before his shop which opened onto the street
on seeing alpatych he went up to him
 you re welcome  yakov alpatych
folks are leaving the town  but you have come to it   said he
 why are they leaving the town   asked alpatych
 that s what i say
folks are foolish  always afraid of the french    women s fuss  women s fuss   said alpatych
 just what i think  yakov alpatych
what i say is  orders have been given not to let them in  so that must be right
and the peasants are asking three rubles for carting it isn t christian   yakov alpatych heard without heeding
he asked for a samovar and for hay for his horses  and when he had had his tea he went to bed
all night long troops were moving past the inn
next morning alpatych donned a jacket he wore only in town and went out on business
it was a sunny morning and by eight o clock it was already hot
 a good day for harvesting   thought alpatych
from beyond the town firing had been heard since early morning
at eight o clock the booming of cannon was added to the sound of musketry
many people were hurrying through the streets and there were many soldiers  but cabs were still driving about  tradesmen stood at their shops  and service was being held in the churches as usual
alpatych went to the shops  to government offices  to the post office  and to the governor s
in the offices and shops and at the post office everyone was talking about the army and about the enemy who was already attacking the town  everybody was asking what should be done  and all were trying to calm one another
in front of the governor s house alpatych found a large number of people  cossacks  and a traveling carriage of the governor s
at the porch he met two of the landed gentry  one of whom he knew
this man  an ex captain of police  was saying angrily   it s no joke  you know  it s all very well if you re single
 one man though undone is but one   as the proverb says  but with thirteen in your family and all the property  
they ve brought us to utter ruin  what sort of governors are they to do that  they ought to be hanged the brigands       oh come  that s enough   said the other
 what do i care  let him hear  we re not dogs   said the ex captain of police  and looking round he noticed alpatych
 oh  yakov alpatych  what have you come for    to see the governor by his excellency s order   answered alpatych  lifting his head and proudly thrusting his hand into the bosom of his coat as he always did when he mentioned the prince   
 he has ordered me to inquire into the position of affairs   he added
 yes  go and find out   shouted the angry gentleman
 they ve brought things to such a pass that there are no carts or anything   
there it is again  do you hear   said he  pointing in the direction whence came the sounds of firing
 they ve brought us all to ruin  
the brigands   he repeated  and descended the porch steps
alpatych swayed his head and went upstairs
in the waiting room were tradesmen  women  and officials  looking silently at one another
the door of the governor s room opened and they all rose and moved forward
an official ran out  said some words to a merchant  called a stout official with a cross hanging on his neck to follow him  and vanished again  evidently wishing to avoid the inquiring looks and questions addressed to him
alpatych moved forward and next time the official came out addressed him  one hand placed in the breast of his buttoned coat  and handed him two letters
 to his honor baron asch  from general in chief prince bolkonski   he announced with such solemnity and significance that the official turned to him and took the letters
a few minutes later the governor received alpatych and hurriedly said to him   inform the prince and princess that i knew nothing  i acted on the highest instructions here     and he handed a paper to alpatych
 still  as the prince is unwell my advice is that they should go to moscow
i am just starting myself
inform them     but the governor did not finish  a dusty perspiring officer ran into the room and began to say something in french
the governor s face expressed terror
 go   he said  nodding his head to alpatych  and began questioning the officer
eager  frightened  helpless glances were turned on alpatych when he came out of the governor s room
involuntarily listening now to the firing  which had drawn nearer and was increasing in strength  alpatych hurried to his inn
the paper handed to him by the governor said this   i assure you that the town of smolensk is not in the slightest danger as yet and it is unlikely that it will be threatened with any
i from the one side and prince bagration from the other are marching to unite our forces before smolensk  which junction will be effected on the 22nd instant  and both armies with their united forces will defend our compatriots of the province entrusted to your care till our efforts shall have beaten back the enemies of our fatherland  or till the last warrior in our valiant ranks has perished
from this you will see that you have a perfect right to reassure the inhabitants of smolensk  for those defended by two such brave armies may feel assured of victory    instructions from barclay de tolly to baron asch  the civil governor of smolensk  1812   people were anxiously roaming about the streets
carts piled high with household utensils  chairs  and cupboards kept emerging from the gates of the yards and moving along the streets
loaded carts stood at the house next to ferapontov s and women were wailing and lamenting as they said good by
a small watchdog ran round barking in front of the harnessed horses
alpatych entered the innyard at a quicker pace than usual and went straight to the shed where his horses and trap were
the coachman was asleep
he woke him up  told him to harness  and went into the passage
from the host s room came the sounds of a child crying  the despairing sobs of a woman  and the hoarse angry shouting of ferapontov
the cook began running hither and thither in the passage like a frightened hen  just as alpatych entered
 he s done her to death
killed the mistress   
beat her  
dragged her about so       what for   asked alpatych
 she kept begging to go away
she s a woman   take me away   says she   don t let me perish with my little children  folks   she says   are all gone  so why   she says   don t we go   and he began beating and pulling her about so   at these words alpatych nodded as if in approval  and not wishing to hear more went to the door of the room opposite the innkeeper s  where he had left his purchases
 you brute  you murderer   screamed a thin  pale woman who  with a baby in her arms and her kerchief torn from her head  burst through the door at that moment and down the steps into the yard ferapontov came out after her  but on seeing alpatych adjusted his waistcoat  smoothed his hair  yawned  and followed alpatych into the opposite room
 going already   said he
alpatych  without answering or looking at his host  sorted his packages and asked how much he owed
 we ll reckon up  well  have you been to the governor s   asked ferapontov
 what has been decided   alpatych replied that the governor had not told him anything definite
 with our business  how can we get away   said ferapontov
 we d have to pay seven rubles a cartload to dorogobuzh and i tell them they re not christians to ask it  selivanov  now  did a good stroke last thursday sold flour to the army at nine rubles a sack
will you have some tea   he added
while the horses were being harnessed alpatych and ferapontov over their tea talked of the price of corn  the crops  and the good weather for harvesting
 well  it seems to be getting quieter   remarked ferapontov  finishing his third cup of tea and getting up  ours must have got the best of it
the orders were not to let them in
so we re in force  it seems    they say the other day matthew ivanych platov drove them into the river marina and drowned some eighteen thousand in one day   alpatych collected his parcels  handed them to the coachman who had come in  and settled up with the innkeeper
the noise of wheels  hoofs  and bells was heard from the gateway as a little trap passed out
it was by now late in the afternoon
half the street was in shadow  the other half brightly lit by the sun
alpatych looked out of the window and went to the door
suddenly the strange sound of a far off whistling and thud was heard  followed by a boom of cannon blending into a dull roar that set the windows rattling
he went out into the street  two men were running past toward the bridge
from different sides came whistling sounds and the thud of cannon balls and bursting shells falling on the town
but these sounds were hardly heard in comparison with the noise of the firing outside the town and attracted little attention from the inhabitants
the town was being bombarded by a hundred and thirty guns which napoleon had ordered up after four o clock
the people did not at once realize the meaning of this bombardment
at first the noise of the falling bombs and shells only aroused curiosity
ferapontov s wife  who till then had not ceased wailing under the shed  became quiet and with the baby in her arms went to the gate  listening to the sounds and looking in silence at the people the cook and a shop assistant came to the gate
with lively curiosity everyone tried to get a glimpse of the projectiles as they flew over their heads
several people came round the corner talking eagerly
 what force   remarked one
 knocked the roof and ceiling all to splinters    routed up the earth like a pig   said another
 that s grand  it bucks one up   laughed the first
 lucky you jumped aside  or it would have wiped you out   others joined those men and stopped and told how cannon balls had fallen on a house close to them
meanwhile still more projectiles  now with the swift sinister whistle of a cannon ball  now with the agreeable intermittent whistle of a shell  flew over people s heads incessantly  but not one fell close by  they all flew over
alpatych was getting into his trap
the innkeeper stood at the gate
 what are you staring at   he shouted to the cook  who in her red skirt  with sleeves rolled up  swinging her bare elbows  had stepped to the corner to listen to what was being said
 what marvels   she exclaimed  but hearing her master s voice she turned back  pulling down her tucked up skirt
once more something whistled  but this time quite close  swooping downwards like a little bird  a flame flashed in the middle of the street  something exploded  and the street was shrouded in smoke
 scoundrel  what are you doing   shouted the innkeeper  rushing to the cook
at that moment the pitiful wailing of women was heard from different sides  the frightened baby began to cry  and people crowded silently with pale faces round the cook
the loudest sound in that crowd was her wailing
 oh h h  dear souls  dear kind souls  don t let me die  my good souls      five minutes later no one remained in the street
the cook  with her thigh broken by a shell splinter  had been carried into the kitchen
alpatych  his coachman  ferapontov s wife and children and the house porter were all sitting in the cellar  listening
the roar of guns  the whistling of projectiles  and the piteous moaning of the cook  which rose above the other sounds  did not cease for a moment
the mistress rocked and hushed her baby and when anyone came into the cellar asked in a pathetic whisper what had become of her husband who had remained in the street
a shopman who entered told her that her husband had gone with others to the cathedral  whence they were fetching the wonder working icon of smolensk toward dusk the cannonade began to subside
alpatych left the cellar and stopped in the doorway
the evening sky that had been so clear was clouded with smoke  through which  high up  the sickle of the new moon shone strangely
now that the terrible din of the guns had ceased a hush seemed to reign over the town  broken only by the rustle of footsteps  the moaning  the distant cries  and the crackle of fires which seemed widespread everywhere
the cook s moans had now subsided
on two sides black curling clouds of smoke rose and spread from the fires
through the streets soldiers in various uniforms walked or ran confusedly in different directions like ants from a ruined ant hill several of them ran into ferapontov s yard before alpatych s eyes
alpatych went out to the gate
a retreating regiment  thronging and hurrying  blocked the street
noticing him  an officer said   the town is being abandoned
get away  get away   and then  turning to the soldiers  shouted   i ll teach you to run into the yards   alpatych went back to the house  called the coachman  and told him to set off
ferapontov s whole household came out too  following alpatych and the coachman
the women  who had been silent till then  suddenly began to wail as they looked at the fires the smoke and even the flames of which could be seen in the failing twilight and as if in reply the same kind of lamentation was heard from other parts of the street
inside the shed alpatych and the coachman arranged the tangled reins and traces of their horses with trembling hands
as alpatych was driving out of the gate he saw some ten soldiers in ferapontov s open shop  talking loudly and filling their bags and knapsacks with flour and sunflower seeds
just then ferapontov returned and entered his shop
on seeing the soldiers he was about to shout at them  but suddenly stopped and  clutching at his hair  burst into sobs and laughter   loot everything  lads  don t let those devils get it   he cried  taking some bags of flour himself and throwing them into the street some of the soldiers were frightened and ran away  others went on filling their bags
on seeing alpatych  ferapontov turned to him   russia is done for   he cried
 alpatych  i ll set the place on fire myself
we re done for      and ferapontov ran into the yard
soldiers were passing in a constant stream along the street blocking it completely  so that alpatych could not pass out and had to wait
ferapontov s wife and children were also sitting in a cart waiting till it was possible to drive out
night had come
there were stars in the sky and the new moon shone out amid the smoke that screened it
on the sloping descent to the dnieper alpatych s cart and that of the innkeeper s wife  which were slowly moving amid the rows of soldiers and of other vehicles  had to stop
in a side street near the crossroads where the vehicles had stopped  a house and some shops were on fire
this fire was already burning itself out
the flames now died down and were lost in the black smoke  now suddenly flared up again brightly  lighting up with strange distinctness the faces of the people crowding at the crossroads
black figures flitted about before the fire  and through the incessant crackling of the flames talking and shouting could be heard
seeing that his trap would not be able to move on for some time  alpatych got down and turned into the side street to look at the fire
soldiers were continually rushing backwards and forwards near it  and he saw two of them and a man in a frieze coat dragging burning beams into another yard across the street  while others carried bundles of hay alpatych went up to a large crowd standing before a high barn which was blazing briskly
the walls were all on fire and the back wall had fallen in  the wooden roof was collapsing  and the rafters were alight
the crowd was evidently watching for the roof to fall in  and alpatych watched for it too
 alpatych   a familiar voice suddenly hailed the old man
 mercy on us  your excellency   answered alpatych  immediately recognizing the voice of his young prince
prince andrew in his riding cloak  mounted on a black horse  was looking at alpatych from the back of the crowd
 why are you here   he asked
 your  
your excellency   stammered alpatych and broke into sobs
 are we really lost  master       why are you here   prince andrew repeated
at that moment the flames flared up and showed his young master s pale worn face
alpatych told how he had been sent there and how difficult it was to get away
 are we really quite lost  your excellency   he asked again
began writing in pencil on a page he tore out
he wrote to his sister   smolensk is being abandoned
bald hills will be occupied by the enemy within a week
set off immediately for moscow
let me know at once when you will start
send by special messenger to usvyazh   having written this and given the paper to alpatych  he told him how to arrange for departure of the prince  the princess  his son  and the boy s tutor  and how and where to let him know immediately
before he had had time to finish giving these instructions  a chief of staff followed by a suite galloped up to him
 you are a colonel   shouted the chief of staff with a german accent  in a voice familiar to prince andrew
 houses are set on fire in your presence and you stand by  what does this mean  you will answer for it   shouted berg  who was now assistant to the chief of staff of the commander of the left flank of the infantry of the first army  a place  as berg said   very agreeable and well en evidence   prince andrew looked at him and without replying went on speaking to alpatych
 so tell them that i shall await a reply till the tenth  and if by the tenth i don t receive news that they have all got away i shall have to throw up everything and come myself to bald hills    prince   said berg  recognizing prince andrew   i only spoke because i have to obey orders  because i always do obey exactly   
you must please excuse me   he went on apologetically
something cracked in the flames
the fire died down for a moment and wreaths of black smoke rolled from under the roof
there was another terrible crash and something huge collapsed
 ou rou rou   yelled the crowd  echoing the crash of the collapsing roof of the barn  the burning grain in which diffused a cakelike aroma all around
the flames flared up again  lighting the animated  delighted  exhausted faces of the spectators
the man in the frieze coat raised his arms and shouted   it s fine  lads  now it s raging   it s fine    that s the owner himself   cried several voices  well then   continued prince andrew to alpatych   report to them as i have told you   and not replying a word to berg who was now mute beside him  he touched his horse and rode down the side street
from smolensk the troops continued to retreat  followed by the enemy
on the tenth of august the regiment prince andrew commanded was marching along the highroad past the avenue leading to bald hills
heat and drought had continued for more than three weeks
each day fleecy clouds floated across the sky and occasionally veiled the sun  but toward evening the sky cleared again and the sun set in reddish brown mist
heavy night dews alone refreshed the earth
the unreaped corn was scorched and shed its grain
the marshes dried up
the cattle lowed from hunger  finding no food on the sun parched meadows
only at night and in the forests while the dew lasted was there any freshness
but on the road  the highroad along which the troops marched  there was no such freshness even at night or when the road passed through the forest  the dew was imperceptible on the sandy dust churned up more than six inches deep
as soon as day dawned the march began
the artillery and baggage wagons moved noiselessly through the deep dust that rose to the very hubs of the wheels  and the infantry sank ankle deep in that soft  choking  hot dust that never cooled even at night
some of this dust was kneaded by the feet and wheels  while the rest rose and hung like a cloud over the troops  settling in eyes  ears  hair  and nostrils  and worst of all in the lungs of the men and beasts as they moved along that road
the higher the sun rose the higher rose that cloud of dust  and through the screen of its hot fine particles one could look with naked eye at the sun  which showed like a huge crimson ball in the unclouded sky there was no wind  and the men choked in that motionless atmosphere
they marched with handkerchiefs tied over their noses and mouths
when they passed through a village they all rushed to the wells and fought for the water and drank it down to the mud
prince andrew was in command of a regiment  and the management of that regiment  the welfare of the men and the necessity of receiving and giving orders  engrossed him
the burning of smolensk and its abandonment made an epoch in his life
a novel feeling of anger against the foe made him forget his own sorrow
he was entirely devoted to the affairs of his regiment and was considerate and kind to his men and officers
in the regiment they called him  our prince   were proud of him and loved him
but he was kind and gentle only to those of his regiment  to timokhin and the like people quite new to him  belonging to a different world and who could not know and understand his past
as soon as he came across a former acquaintance or anyone from the staff  he bristled up immediately and grew spiteful  ironical  and contemptuous
everything that reminded him of his past was repugnant to him  and so in his relations with that former circle he confined himself to trying to do his duty and not to be unfair in truth everything presented itself in a dark and gloomy light to prince andrew  especially after the abandonment of smolensk on the sixth of august  he considered that it could and should have been defended  and after his sick father had had to flee to moscow  abandoning to pillage his dearly beloved bald hills which he had built and peopled
but despite this  thanks to his regiment  prince andrew had something to think about entirely apart from general questions
two days previously he had received news that his father  son  and sister had left for moscow  and though there was nothing for him to do at bald hills  prince andrew with a characteristic desire to foment his own grief decided that he must ride there
he ordered his horse to be saddled and  leaving his regiment on the march  rode to his father s estate where he had been born and spent his childhood
riding past the pond where there used always to be dozens of women chattering as they rinsed their linen or beat it with wooden beetles  prince andrew noticed that there was not a soul about and that the little washing wharf  torn from its place and half submerged  was floating on its side in the middle of the pond
he rode to the keeper s lodge
no one at the stone entrance gates of the drive and the door stood open
grass had already begun to grow on the garden paths  and horses and calves were straying in the english park
prince andrew rode up to the hothouse  some of the glass panes were broken  and of the trees in tubs some were overturned and others dried up
he called for taras the gardener  but no one replied
having gone round the corner of the hothouse to the ornamental garden  he saw that the carved garden fence was broken and branches of the plum trees had been torn off with the fruit
an old peasant whom prince andrew in his childhood had often seen at the gate was sitting on a green garden seat  plaiting a bast shoe
he was deaf and did not hear prince andrew ride up
he was sitting on the seat the old prince used to like to sit on  and beside him strips of bast were hanging on the broken and withered branch of a magnolia
prince andrew rode up to the house
several limes in the old garden had been cut down and a piebald mare and her foal were wandering in front of the house among the rosebushes
the shutters were all closed  except at one window which was open
a little serf boy  seeing prince andrew  ran into the house
alpatych  having sent his family away  was alone at bald hills and was sitting indoors reading the lives of the saints
on hearing that prince andrew had come  he went out with his spectacles on his nose  buttoning his coat  and  hastily stepping up  without a word began weeping and kissing prince andrew s knee
then  vexed at his own weakness  he turned away and began to report on the position of affairs
everything precious and valuable had been removed to bogucharovo
seventy quarters of grain had also been carted away
the hay and the spring corn  of which alpatych said there had been a remarkable crop that year  had been commandeered by the troops and mown down while still green
the peasants were ruined  some of them too had gone to bogucharovo  only a few remained
without waiting to hear him out  prince andrew asked   when did my father and sister leave   meaning when did they leave for moscow
alpatych  understanding the question to refer to their departure for bogucharovo  replied that they had left on the seventh and again went into details concerning the estate management  asking for instructions
 am i to let the troops have the oats  and to take a receipt for them  we have still six hundred quarters left   he inquired
 what am i to say to him   thought prince andrew  looking down on the old man s bald head shining in the sun and seeing by the expression on his face that the old man himself understood how untimely such questions were and only asked them to allay his grief  yes  let them have it   replied prince andrew
 if you noticed some disorder in the garden   said alpatych   it was impossible to prevent it
three regiments have been here and spent the night  dragoons mostly
i took down the name and rank of their commanding officer  to hand in a complaint about it    well  and what are you going to do  will you stay here if the enemy occupies the place   asked prince andrew
alpatych turned his face to prince andrew  looked at him  and suddenly with a solemn gesture raised his arm
 he is my refuge  his will be done   he exclaimed
a group of bareheaded peasants was approaching across the meadow toward the prince
 well  good by   said prince andrew  bending over to alpatych
 you must go away too  take away what you can and tell the serfs to go to the ryazan estate or to the one near moscow   alpatych clung to prince andrew s leg and burst into sobs
gently disengaging himself  the prince spurred his horse and rode down the avenue at a gallop the old man was still sitting in the ornamental garden  like a fly impassive on the face of a loved one who is dead  tapping the last on which he was making the bast shoe  and two little girls  running out from the hot house carrying in their skirts plums they had plucked from the trees there  came upon prince andrew on seeing the young master  the elder one with frightened look clutched her younger companion by the hand and hid with her behind a birch tree  not stopping to pick up some green plums they had dropped prince andrew turned away with startled haste  unwilling to let them see that they had been observed
he was sorry for the pretty frightened little girl  was afraid of looking at her  and yet felt an irresistible desire to do so
a new sensation of comfort and relief came over him when  seeing these girls  he realized the existence of other human interests entirely aloof from his own and just as legitimate as those that occupied him
evidently these girls passionately desired one thing to carry away and eat those green plums without being caught and prince andrew shared their wish for the success of their enterprise he could not resist looking at them once more
believing their danger past  they sprang from their ambush and  chirruping something in their shrill little voices and holding up their skirts  their bare little sunburned feet scampered merrily and quickly across the meadow grass
prince andrew was somewhat refreshed by having ridden off the dusty highroad along which the troops were moving
but not far from bald hills he again came out on the road and overtook his regiment at its halting place by the dam of a small pond
it was past one o clock
the sun  a red ball through the dust  burned and scorched his back intolerably through his black coat
the dust always hung motionless above the buzz of talk that came from the resting troops
there was no wind
as he crossed the dam prince andrew smelled the ooze and freshness of the pond
he longed to get into that water  however dirty it might be  and he glanced round at the pool from whence came sounds of shrieks and laughter
the small  muddy  green pond had risen visibly more than a foot  flooding the dam  because it was full of the naked white bodies of soldiers with brick red hands  necks  and faces  who were splashing about in it
all this naked white human flesh  laughing and shrieking  floundered about in that dirty pool like carp stuffed into a watering can  and the suggestion of merriment in that floundering mass rendered it specially pathetic
one fair haired young soldier of the third company  whom prince andrew knew and who had a strap round the calf of one leg  crossed himself  stepped back to get a good run  and plunged into the water  another  a dark noncommissioned officer who was always shaggy  stood up to his waist in the water joyfully wriggling his muscular figure and snorted with satisfaction as he poured the water over his head with hands blackened to the wrists there were sounds of men slapping one another  yelling  and puffing
everywhere on the bank  on the dam  and in the pond  there was healthy  white  muscular flesh
the officer  timokhin  with his red little nose  standing on the dam wiping himself with a towel  felt confused at seeing the prince  but made up his mind to address him nevertheless  it s very nice  your excellency  wouldn t you like to   said he
 it s dirty   replied prince andrew  making a grimace
 we ll clear it out for you in a minute   said timokhin  and  still undressed  ran off to clear the men out of the pond
 the prince wants to bathe    what prince  ours   said many voices  and the men were in such haste to clear out that the prince could hardly stop them
he decided that he would rather wash himself with water in the barn  flesh  bodies  cannon fodder   he thought  and he looked at his own naked body and shuddered  not from cold but from a sense of disgust and horror he did not himself understand  aroused by the sight of that immense number of bodies splashing about in the dirty pond on the seventh of august prince bagration wrote as follows from his quarters at mikhaylovna on the smolensk road  dear count alexis andreevich  he was writing to arakcheev but knew that his letter would be read by the emperor  and therefore weighed every word in it to the best of his ability   i expect the minister  barclay de tolly  has already reported the abandonment of smolensk to the enemy
it is pitiable and sad  and the whole army is in despair that this most important place has been wantonly abandoned
i  for my part  begged him personally most urgently and finally wrote him  but nothing would induce him to consent
i swear to you on my honor that napoleon was in such a fix as never before and might have lost half his army but could not have taken smolensk
our troops fought  and are fighting  as never before
with fifteen thousand men i held the enemy at bay for thirty five hours and beat him  but he would not hold out even for fourteen hours
it is disgraceful  a stain on our army  and as for him  he ought  it seems to me  not to live if he reports that our losses were great  it is not true  perhaps about four thousand  not more  and not even that  but even were they ten thousand  that s war  but the enemy has lost masses  
what would it have cost him to hold out for another two days  they would have had to retire of their own accord  for they had no water for men or horses
he gave me his word he would not retreat  but suddenly sent instructions that he was retiring that night
we cannot fight in this way  or we may soon bring the enemy to moscow  
there is a rumor that you are thinking of peace
god forbid that you should make peace after all our sacrifices and such insane retreats  you would set all russia against you and every one of us would feel ashamed to wear the uniform
if it has come to this we must fight as long as russia can and as long as there are men able to stand  
one man ought to be in command  and not two
your minister may perhaps be good as a minister  but as a general he is not merely bad but execrable  yet to him is entrusted the fate of our whole country   
i am really frantic with vexation  forgive my writing boldly
it is clear that the man who advocates the conclusion of a peace  and that the minister should command the army  does not love our sovereign and desires the ruin of us all
so i write you frankly  call out the militia
for the minister is leading these visitors after him to moscow in a most masterly way
the whole army feels great suspicion of the imperial aide de camp wolzogen
he is said to be more napoleon s man than ours  and he is always advising the minister
i am not merely civil to him but obey him like a corporal  though i am his senior
this is painful  but  loving my benefactor and sovereign  i submit
only i am sorry for the emperor that he entrusts our fine army to such as he
consider that on our retreat we have lost by fatigue and left in the hospital more than fifteen thousand men  and had we attacked this would not have happened
tell me  for god s sake  what will russia  our mother russia  say to our being so frightened  and why are we abandoning our good and gallant fatherland to such rabble and implanting feelings of hatred and shame in all our subjects  what are we scared at and of whom are we afraid  i am not to blame that the minister is vacillating  a coward  dense  dilatory  and has all bad qualities
the whole army bewails it and calls down curses upon him  
among the innumerable categories applicable to the phenomena of human life one may discriminate between those in which substance prevails and those in which form prevails
to the latter as distinguished from village  country  provincial  or even moscow life we may allot petersburg life  and especially the life of its salons
that life of the salons is unchanging
since the year 1805 we had made peace and had again quarreled with bonaparte and had made constitutions and unmade them again  but the salons of anna pavlovna and helene remained just as they had been the one seven and the other five years before
at anna pavlovna s they talked with perplexity of bonaparte s successes just as before and saw in them and in the subservience shown to him by the european sovereigns a malicious conspiracy  the sole object of which was to cause unpleasantness and anxiety to the court circle of which anna pavlovna was the representative
and in helene s salon  which rumyantsev himself honored with his visits  regarding helene as a remarkably intelligent woman  they talked with the same ecstasy in 1812 as in 1808 of the  great nation  and the  great man   and regretted our rupture with france  a rupture which  according to them  ought to be promptly terminated by peace of late  since the emperor s return from the army  there had been some excitement in these conflicting salon circles and some demonstrations of hostility to one another  but each camp retained its own tendency
in anna pavlovna s circle only those frenchmen were admitted who were deep rooted legitimists  and patriotic views were expressed to the effect that one ought not to go to the french theater and that to maintain the french troupe was costing the government as much as a whole army corps
the progress of the war was eagerly followed  and only the reports most flattering to our army were circulated
in the french circle of helene and rumyantsev the reports of the cruelty of the enemy and of the war were contradicted and all napoleon s attempts at conciliation were discussed
in that circle they discountenanced those who advised hurried preparations for a removal to kazan of the court and the girls  educational establishments under the patronage of the dowager empress
in helene s circle the war in general was regarded as a series of formal demonstrations which would very soon end in peace  and the view prevailed expressed by bilibin who now in petersburg was quite at home in helene s house  which every clever man was obliged to visit that not by gunpowder but by those who invented it would matters be settled
in that circle the moscow enthusiasm news of which had reached petersburg simultaneously with the emperor s return was ridiculed sarcastically and very cleverly  though with much caution
anna pavlovna s circle on the contrary was enraptured by this enthusiasm and spoke of it as plutarch speaks of the deeds of the ancients
prince vasili  who still occupied his former important posts  formed a connecting link between these two circles
he visited his  good friend anna pavlovna  as well as his daughter s  diplomatic salon   and often in his constant comings and goings between the two camps became confused and said at helene s what he should have said at anna pavlovna s and vice versa
soon after the emperor s return prince vasili in a conversation about the war at anna pavlovna s severely condemned barclay de tolly  but was undecided as to who ought to be appointed commander in chief
one of the visitors  usually spoken of as  a man of great merit   having described how he had that day seen kutuzov  the newly chosen chief of the petersburg militia  presiding over the enrollment of recruits at the treasury  cautiously ventured to suggest that kutuzov would be the man to satisfy all requirements
anna pavlovna remarked with a melancholy smile that kutuzov had done nothing but cause the emperor annoyance
 i have talked and talked at the assembly of the nobility   prince vasili interrupted   but they did not listen to me
i told them his election as chief of the militia would not please the emperor
they did not listen to me
 it s all this mania for opposition   he went on
 and who for  it is all because we want to ape the foolish enthusiasm of those muscovites   prince vasili continued  forgetting for a moment that though at helene s one had to ridicule the moscow enthusiasm  at anna pavlovna s one had to be ecstatic about it
but he retrieved his mistake at once
 now  is it suitable that count kutuzov  the oldest general in russia  should preside at that tribunal  he will get nothing for his pains  how could they make a man commander in chief who cannot mount a horse  who drops asleep at a council  and has the very worst morals  a good reputation he made for himself at bucharest  i don t speak of his capacity as a general  but at a time like this how they appoint a decrepit  blind old man  positively blind  a fine idea to have a blind general  he can t see anything to play blindman s bluff  he can t see at all   no one replied to his remarks
this was quite correct on the twenty fourth of july
but on the twenty ninth of july kutuzov received the title of prince
this might indicate a wish to get rid of him  and therefore prince vasili s opinion continued to be correct though he was not now in any hurry to express it
but on the eighth of august a committee  consisting of field marshal saltykov  arakcheev  vyazmitinov  lopukhin  and kochubey met to consider the progress of the war
this committee came to the conclusion that our failures were due to a want of unity in the command and though the members of the committee were aware of the emperor s dislike of kutuzov  after a short deliberation they agreed to advise his appointment as commander in chief
that same day kutuzov was appointed commander in chief with full powers over the armies and over the whole region occupied by them
on the ninth of august prince vasili at anna pavlovna s again met the  man of great merit   the latter was very attentive to anna pavlovna because he wanted to be appointed director of one of the educational establishments for young ladies
prince vasili entered the room with the air of a happy conqueror who has attained the object of his desires
 well  have you heard the great news  prince kutuzov is field marshal  all dissensions are at an end  i am so glad  so delighted  at last we have a man   said he  glancing sternly and significantly round at everyone in the drawing room
the  man of great merit   despite his desire to obtain the post of director  could not refrain from reminding prince vasili of his former opinion
though this was impolite to prince vasili in anna pavlovna s drawing room  and also to anna pavlovna herself who had received the news with delight  he could not resist the temptation
 but  prince  they say he is blind   said he  reminding prince vasili of his own words
 eh  nonsense  he sees well enough   said prince vasili rapidly  in a deep voice and with a slight cough the voice and cough with which he was wont to dispose of all difficulties
 he sees well enough   he added
 and what i am so pleased about   he went on   is that our sovereign has given him full powers over all the armies and the whole region powers no commander in chief ever had before
he is a second autocrat   he concluded with a victorious smile
 god grant it  god grant it   said anna pavlovna
the  man of great merit   who was still a novice in court circles  wishing to flatter anna pavlovna by defending her former position on this question  observed   it is said that the emperor was reluctant to give kutuzov those powers
they say he blushed like a girl to whom joconde is read  when he said to kutuzov   your emperor and the fatherland award you this honor     perhaps the heart took no part in that speech   said anna pavlovna
 oh  no  no   warmly rejoined prince vasili  who would not now yield kutuzov to anyone  in his opinion kutuzov was not only admirable himself  but was adored by everybody  no  that s impossible   said he   for our sovereign appreciated him so highly before    god grant only that prince kutuzov assumes real power and does not allow anyone to put a spoke in his wheel   observed anna pavlovna
understanding at once to whom she alluded  prince vasili said in a whisper   i know for a fact that kutuzov made it an absolute condition that the tsarevich should not be with the army
do you know what he said to the emperor   and prince vasili repeated the words supposed to have been spoken by kutuzov to the emperor
 i can neither punish him if he does wrong nor reward him if he does right    oh  a very wise man is prince kutuzov  i have known him a long time    they even say   remarked the  man of great merit  who did not yet possess courtly tact   that his excellency made it an express condition that the sovereign himself should not be with the army   as soon as he said this both prince vasili and anna pavlovna turned away from him and glanced sadly at one another with a sigh at his naivete while this was taking place in petersburg the french had already passed smolensk and were drawing nearer and nearer to moscow
napoleon s historian thiers  like other of his historians  trying to justify his hero says that he was drawn to the walls of moscow against his will
he is as right as other historians who look for the explanation of historic events in the will of one man  he is as right as the russian historians who maintain that napoleon was drawn to moscow by the skill of the russian commanders
here besides the law of retrospection  which regards all the past as a preparation for events that subsequently occur  the law of reciprocity comes in  confusing the whole matter
a good chessplayer having lost a game is sincerely convinced that his loss resulted from a mistake he made and looks for that mistake in the opening  but forgets that at each stage of the game there were similar mistakes and that none of his moves were perfect
he only notices the mistake to which he pays attention  because his opponent took advantage of it
how much more complex than this is the game of war  which occurs under certain limits of time  and where it is not one will that manipulates lifeless objects  but everything results from innumerable conflicts of various wills  after smolensk napoleon sought a battle beyond dorogobuzh at vyazma  and then at tsarevo zaymishche  but it happened that owing to a conjunction of innumerable circumstances the russians could not give battle till they reached borodino  seventy miles from moscow from vyazma napoleon ordered a direct advance on moscow
moscou  la capitale asiatique de ce grand empire  la ville sacree des peuples d alexandre  moscou avec ses innombrables eglises en forme de pagodes chinoises    this moscow gave napoleon s imagination no rest
on the march from vyazma to tsarevo zaymishche he rode his light bay bobtailed ambler accompanied by his guards  his bodyguard  his pages  and aides de camp
berthier  his chief of staff  dropped behind to question a russian prisoner captured by the cavalry
followed by lelorgne d ideville  an interpreter  he overtook napoleon at a gallop and reined in his horse with an amused expression
   moscow  the asiatic capital of this great empire  the sacred city of alexander s people  moscow with its innumerable churches shaped like chinese pagodas    well   asked napoleon
 one of platov s cossacks says that platov s corps is joining up with the main army and that kutuzov has been appointed commander in chief
he is a very shrewd and garrulous fellow   napoleon smiled and told them to give the cossack a horse and bring the man to him
he wished to talk to him himself several adjutants galloped off  and an hour later  lavrushka  the serf denisov had handed over to rostov  rode up to napoleon in an orderly s jacket and on a french cavalry saddle  with a merry  and tipsy face
napoleon told him to ride by his side and began questioning him
 you are a cossack    yes  a cossack  your honor    the cossack  not knowing in what company he was  for napoleon s plain appearance had nothing about it that would reveal to an oriental mind the presence of a monarch  talked with extreme familiarity of the incidents of the war   says thiers  narrating this episode
in reality lavrushka  having got drunk the day before and left his master dinnerless  had been whipped and sent to the village in quest of chickens  where he engaged in looting till the french took him prisoner
lavrushka was one of those coarse  bare faced lackeys who have seen all sorts of things  consider it necessary to do everything in a mean and cunning way  are ready to render any sort of service to their master  and are keen at guessing their master s baser impulses  especially those prompted by vanity and pettiness
finding himself in the company of napoleon  whose identity he had easily and surely recognized  lavrushka was not in the least abashed but merely did his utmost to gain his new master s favor he knew very well that this was napoleon  but napoleon s presence could no more intimidate him than rostov s  or a sergeant major s with the rods  would have done  for he had nothing that either the sergeant major or napoleon could deprive him of
so he rattled on  telling all the gossip he had heard among the orderlies
much of it true
but when napoleon asked him whether the russians thought they would beat bonaparte or not  lavrushka screwed up his eyes and considered
in this question he saw subtle cunning  as men of his type see cunning in everything  so he frowned and did not answer immediately
 it s like this   he said thoughtfully   if there s a battle soon  yours will win
that s right
but if three days pass  then after that  well  then that same battle will not soon be over   lelorgne d ideville smilingly interpreted this speech to napoleon thus   if a battle takes place within the next three days the french will win  but if later  god knows what will happen   napoleon did not smile  though he was evidently in high good humor  and he ordered these words to be repeated
lavrushka noticed this and to entertain him further  pretending not to know who napoleon was  added   we know that you have bonaparte and that he has beaten everybody in the world  but we are a different matter     without knowing why or how this bit of boastful patriotism slipped out at the end
the interpreter translated these words without the last phrase  and bonaparte smiled
 the young cossack made his mighty interlocutor smile   says thiers
after riding a few paces in silence  napoleon turned to berthier and said he wished to see how the news that he was talking to the emperor himself  to that very emperor who had written his immortally victorious name on the pyramids  would affect this enfant du don      child of the don   the fact was accordingly conveyed to lavrushka
lavrushka  understanding that this was done to perplex him and that napoleon expected him to be frightened  to gratify his new masters promptly pretended to be astonished and awe struck  opened his eyes wide  and assumed the expression he usually put on when taken to be whipped
 as soon as napoleon s interpreter had spoken   says thiers   the cossack  seized by amazement  did not utter another word  but rode on  his eyes fixed on the conqueror whose fame had reached him across the steppes of the east
all his loquacity was suddenly arrested and replaced by a naive and silent feeling of admiration
napoleon  after making the cossack a present  had him set free like a bird restored to its native fields   napoleon rode on  dreaming of the moscow that so appealed to his imagination  and  the bird restored to its native fields  galloped to our outposts  inventing on the way all that had not taken place but that he meant to relate to his comrades what had really taken place he did not wish to relate because it seemed to him not worth telling
he found the cossacks  inquired for the regiment operating with platov s detachment and by evening found his master  nicholas rostov  quartered at yankovo
rostov was just mounting to go for a ride round the neighboring villages with ilyin  he let lavrushka have another horse and took him along with him
princess mary was not in moscow and out of danger as prince andrew supposed
after the return of alpatych from smolensk the old prince suddenly seemed to awake as from a dream
he ordered the militiamen to be called up from the villages and armed  and wrote a letter to the commander in chief informing him that he had resolved to remain at bald hills to the last extremity and to defend it  leaving to the commander in chief s discretion to take measures or not for the defense of bald hills  where one of russia s oldest generals would be captured or killed  and he announced to his household that he would remain at bald hills
but while himself remaining  he gave instructions for the departure of the princess and dessalles with the little prince to bogucharovo and thence to moscow princess mary  alarmed by her father s feverish and sleepless activity after his previous apathy  could not bring herself to leave him alone and for the first time in her life ventured to disobey him
she refused to go away and her father s fury broke over her in a terrible storm
he repeated every injustice he had ever inflicted on her
trying to convict her  he told her she had worn him out  had caused his quarrel with his son  had harbored nasty suspicions of him  making it the object of her life to poison his existence  and he drove her from his study telling her that if she did not go away it was all the same to him
he declared that he did not wish to remember her existence and warned her not to dare to let him see her
the fact that he did not  as she had feared  order her to be carried away by force but only told her not to let him see her cheered princess mary
she knew it was a proof that in the depth of his soul he was glad she was remaining at home and had not gone away
the morning after little nicholas had left  the old prince donned his full uniform and prepared to visit the commander in chief
his caleche was already at the door
princess mary saw him walk out of the house in his uniform wearing all his orders and go down the garden to review his armed peasants and domestic serfs
she sat by the window listening to his voice which reached her from the garden
suddenly several men came running up the avenue with frightened faces
princess mary ran out to the porch  down the flower bordered path  and into the avenue
a large crowd of militiamen and domestics were moving toward her  and in their midst several men were supporting by the armpits and dragging along a little old man in a uniform and decorations
she ran up to him and  in the play of the sunlight that fell in small round spots through the shade of the lime tree avenue  could not be sure what change there was in his face
all she could see was that his former stern and determined expression had altered to one of timidity and submission
on seeing his daughter he moved his helpless lips and made a hoarse sound
it was impossible to make out what he wanted
he was lifted up  carried to his study  and laid on the very couch he had so feared of late
the doctor  who was fetched that same night  bled him and said that the prince had had a seizure paralyzing his right side it was becoming more and more dangerous to remain at bald hills  and next day they moved the prince to bogucharovo  the doctor accompanying him
by the time they reached bogucharovo  dessalles and the little prince had already left for moscow
for three weeks the old prince lay stricken by paralysis in the new house prince andrew had built at bogucharovo  ever in the same state  getting neither better nor worse
he was unconscious and lay like a distorted corpse
he muttered unceasingly  his eyebrows and lips twitching  and it was impossible to tell whether he understood what was going on around him or not
one thing was certain that he was suffering and wished to say something
but what it was  no one could tell  it might be some caprice of a sick and half crazy man  or it might relate to public affairs  or possibly to family concerns
the doctor said this restlessness did not mean anything and was due to physical causes  but princess mary thought he wished to tell her something  and the fact that her presence always increased his restlessness confirmed her opinion
he was evidently suffering both physically and mentally
there was no hope of recovery
it was impossible for him to travel  it would not do to let him die on the road
 would it not be better if the end did come  the very end   princess mary sometimes thought
night and day  hardly sleeping at all  she watched him and  terrible to say  often watched him not with hope of finding signs of improvement but wishing to find symptoms of the approach of the end strange as it was to her to acknowledge this feeling in herself  yet there it was
and what seemed still more terrible to her was that since her father s illness began  perhaps even sooner  when she stayed with him expecting something to happen   all the personal desires and hopes that had been forgotten or sleeping within her had awakened
thoughts that had not entered her mind for years  thoughts of a life free from the fear of her father  and even the possibility of love and of family happiness floated continually in her imagination like temptations of the devil
thrust them aside as she would  questions continually recurred to her as to how she would order her life now  after that
these were temptations of the devil and princess mary knew it
she knew that the sole weapon against him was prayer  and she tried to pray
she assumed an attitude of prayer  looked at the icons  repeated the words of a prayer  but she could not pray
she felt that a different world had now taken possession of her the life of a world of strenuous and free activity  quite opposed to the spiritual world in which till now she had been confined and in which her greatest comfort had been prayer
she could not pray  could not weep  and worldly cares took possession of her
it was becoming dangerous to remain in bogucharovo
news of the approach of the french came from all sides  and in one village  ten miles from bogucharovo  a homestead had been looted by french marauders
the doctor insisted on the necessity of moving the prince  the provincial marshal of the nobility sent an official to princess mary to persuade her to get away as quickly as possible  and the head of the rural police having come to bogucharovo urged the same thing  saying that the french were only some twenty five miles away  that french proclamations were circulating in the villages  and that if the princess did not take her father away before the fifteenth  he could not answer for the consequences
the princess decided to leave on the fifteenth
the cares of preparation and giving orders  for which everyone came to her  occupied her all day
she spent the night of the fourteenth as usual  without undressing  in the room next to the one where the prince lay
several times  waking up  she heard his groans and muttering  the creak of his bed  and the steps of tikhon and the doctor when they turned him over
several times she listened at the door  and it seemed to her that his mutterings were louder than usual and that they turned him over oftener
she could not sleep and several times went to the door and listened  wishing to enter but not deciding to do so
though he did not speak  princess mary saw and knew how unpleasant every sign of anxiety on his account was to him
she had noticed with what dissatisfaction he turned from the look she sometimes involuntarily fixed on him
she knew that her going in during the night at an unusual hour would irritate him
but never had she felt so grieved for him or so much afraid of losing him
she recalled all her life with him and in every word and act of his found an expression of his love of her
occasionally amid these memories temptations of the devil would surge into her imagination  thoughts of how things would be after his death  and how her new  liberated life would be ordered
but she drove these thoughts away with disgust
toward morning he became quiet and she fell asleep
she woke late
that sincerity which often comes with waking showed her clearly what chiefly concerned her about her father s illness
on waking she listened to what was going on behind the door and  hearing him groan  said to herself with a sigh that things were still the same
 but what could have happened  what did i want  i want his death   she cried with a feeling of loathing for herself
she washed  dressed  said her prayers  and went out to the porch
in front of it stood carriages without horses and things were being packed into the vehicles
it was a warm  gray morning
princess mary stopped at the porch  still horrified by her spiritual baseness and trying to arrange her thoughts before going to her father
the doctor came downstairs and went out to her
 he is a little better today   said he
 i was looking for you
one can make out something of what he is saying
his head is clearer
come in  he is asking for you     princess mary s heart beat so violently at this news that she grew pale and leaned against the wall to keep from falling
to see him  talk to him  feel his eyes on her now that her whole soul was overflowing with those dreadful  wicked temptations  was a torment of joy and terror
 come   said the doctor
princess mary entered her father s room and went up to his bed
he was lying on his back propped up high  and his small bony hands with their knotted purple veins were lying on the quilt  his left eye gazed straight before him  his right eye was awry  and his brows and lips motionless
he seemed altogether so thin  small  and pathetic
his face seemed to have shriveled or melted  his features had grown smaller
princess mary went up and kissed his hand
his left hand pressed hers so that she understood that he had long been waiting for her to come
he twitched her hand  and his brows and lips quivered angrily
she looked at him in dismay trying to guess what he wanted of her
when she changed her position so that his left eye could see her face he calmed down  not taking his eyes off her for some seconds
then his lips and tongue moved  sounds came  and he began to speak  gazing timidly and imploringly at her  evidently afraid that she might not understand
straining all her faculties princess mary looked at him
the comic efforts with which he moved his tongue made her drop her eyes and with difficulty repress the sobs that rose to her throat
he said something  repeating the same words several times
she could not understand them  but tried to guess what he was saying and inquiringly repeated the words he uttered
 mmm   ar   ate   ate     he repeated several times
it was quite impossible to understand these sounds
the doctor thought he had guessed them  and inquiringly repeated   mary  are you afraid   the prince shook his head  again repeated the same sounds
 my mind  my mind aches   questioned princess mary
he made a mumbling sound in confirmation of this  took her hand  and began pressing it to different parts of his breast as if trying to find the right place for it
 always thoughts  
about you  
thoughts     he then uttered much more clearly than he had done before  now that he was sure of being understood
princess mary pressed her head against his hand  trying to hide her sobs and tears
he moved his hand over her hair
 i have been calling you all night     he brought out
 if only i had known     she said through her tears
 i was afraid to come in   he pressed her hand
 weren t you asleep    no  i did not sleep   said princess mary  shaking her head
unconsciously imitating her father  she now tried to express herself as he did  as much as possible by signs  and her tongue too seemed to move with difficulty
 dear one  
dearest     princess mary could not quite make out what he had said  but from his look it was clear that he had uttered a tender caressing word such as he had never used to her before
 why didn t you come in    and i was wishing for his death   thought princess mary
he was silent awhile
 thank you  
daughter dear   
for all  for all  
forgive   
thank you   
forgive   
thank you      and tears began to flow from his eyes
 call andrew   he said suddenly  and a childish  timid expression of doubt showed itself on his face as he spoke
he himself seemed aware that his demand was meaningless so at least it seemed to princess mary
 i have a letter from him   she replied
he glanced at her with timid surprise
 where is he    he s with the army  father  at smolensk   he closed his eyes and remained silent a long time
then as if in answer to his doubts and to confirm the fact that now he understood and remembered everything  he nodded his head and reopened his eyes
 yes   he said  softly and distinctly
 russia has perished
they ve destroyed her   and he began to sob  and again tears flowed from his eyes
princess mary could no longer restrain herself and wept while she gazed at his face
again he closed his eyes
his sobs ceased  he pointed to his eyes  and tikhon  understanding him  wiped away the tears
then he again opened his eyes and said something none of them could understand for a long time  till at last tikhon understood and repeated it
princess mary had sought the meaning of his words in the mood in which he had just been speaking
she thought he was speaking of russia  or prince andrew  of herself  of his grandson  or of his own death  and so she could not guess his words
 put on your white dress
i like it   was what he said
having understood this princess mary sobbed still louder  and the doctor taking her arm led her out to the veranda  soothing her and trying to persuade her to prepare for her journey
when she had left the room the prince again began speaking about his son  about the war  and about the emperor  angrily twitching his brows and raising his hoarse voice  and then he had a second and final stroke
princess mary stayed on the veranda
the day had cleared  it was hot and sunny
she could understand nothing  think of nothing and feel nothing  except passionate love for her father  love such as she thought she had never felt till that moment
she ran out sobbing into the garden and as far as the pond  along the avenues of young lime trees prince andrew had planted
 yes  
i  
i  
i wished for his death  yes  i wanted it to end quicker   
i wished to be at peace   
and what will become of me  what use will peace be when he is no longer here   princess mary murmured  pacing the garden with hurried steps and pressing her hands to her bosom which heaved with convulsive sobs
when she had completed the tour of the garden  which brought her again to the house  she saw mademoiselle bourienne who had remained at bogucharovo and did not wish to leave it coming toward her with a stranger
this was the marshal of the nobility of the district  who had come personally to point out to the princess the necessity for her prompt departure
princess mary listened without understanding him  she led him to the house  offered him lunch  and sat down with him
then  excusing herself  she went to the door of the old prince s room
the doctor came out with an agitated face and said she could not enter
 go away  princess  go away  
go away   she returned to the garden and sat down on the grass at the foot of the slope by the pond  where no one could see her
she did not know how long she had been there when she was aroused by the sound of a woman s footsteps running along the path
she rose and saw dunyasha her maid  who was evidently looking for her  and who stopped suddenly as if in alarm on seeing her mistress
 please come  princess  
the prince   said dunyasha in a breaking voice
 immediately  i m coming  i m coming   replied the princess hurriedly  not giving dunyasha time to finish what she was saying  and trying to avoid seeing the girl she ran toward the house
 princess  it s god s will  you must be prepared for everything   said the marshal  meeting her at the house door
 let me alone  it s not true   she cried angrily to him
the doctor tried to stop her
she pushed him aside and ran to her father s door
 why are these people with frightened faces stopping me  i don t want any of them  and what are they doing here   she thought
she opened the door and the bright daylight in that previously darkened room startled her
in the room were her nurse and other women
they all drew back from the bed  making way for her
he was still lying on the bed as before  but the stern expression of his quiet face made princess mary stop short on the threshold
 no  he s not dead it s impossible   she told herself and approached him  and repressing the terror that seized her  she pressed her lips to his cheek
but she stepped back immediately
all the force of the tenderness she had been feeling for him vanished instantly and was replaced by a feeling of horror at what lay there before her
 no  he is no more  he is not  but here where he was is something unfamiliar and hostile  some dreadful  terrifying  and repellent mystery   and hiding her face in her hands  princess mary sank into the arms of the doctor  who held her up in the presence of tikhon and the doctor the women washed what had been the prince  tied his head up with a handkerchief that the mouth should not stiffen while open  and with another handkerchief tied together the legs that were already spreading apart
then they dressed him in uniform with his decorations and placed his shriveled little body on a table
heaven only knows who arranged all this and when  but it all got done as if of its own accord
toward night candles were burning round his coffin  a pall was spread over it  the floor was strewn with sprays of juniper  a printed band was tucked in under his shriveled head  and in a corner of the room sat a chanter reading the psalms just as horses shy and snort and gather about a dead horse  so the inmates of the house and strangers crowded into the drawing room round the coffin the marshal  the village elder  peasant women and all with fixed and frightened eyes  crossing themselves  bowed and kissed the old prince s cold and stiffened hand until prince andrew settled in bogucharovo its owners had always been absentees  and its peasants were of quite a different character from those of bald hills
they differed from them in speech  dress  and disposition
they were called steppe peasants
the old prince used to approve of them for their endurance at work when they came to bald hills to help with the harvest or to dig ponds  and ditches  but he disliked them for their boorishness
prince andrew s last stay at bogucharovo  when he introduced hospitals and schools and reduced the quitrent the peasants had to pay  had not softened their disposition but had on the contrary strengthened in them the traits of character the old prince called boorishness
various obscure rumors were always current among them  at one time a rumor that they would all be enrolled as cossacks  at another of a new religion to which they were all to be converted  then of some proclamation of the tsar s and of an oath to the tsar paul in 1797  in connection with which it was rumored that freedom had been granted them but the landowners had stopped it   then of peter fedorovich s return to the throne in seven years  time  when everything would be made free and so  simple  that there would be no restrictions
rumors of the war with bonaparte and his invasion were connected in their minds with the same sort of vague notions of antichrist  the end of the world  and  pure freedom   in the vicinity of bogucharovo were large villages belonging to the crown or to owners whose serfs paid quitrent and could work where they pleased
there were very few resident landlords in the neighborhood and also very few domestic or literate serfs  and in the lives of the peasantry of those parts the mysterious undercurrents in the life of the russian people  the causes and meaning of which are so baffling to contemporaries  were more clearly and strongly noticeable than among others
one instance  which had occurred some twenty years before  was a movement among the peasants to emigrate to some unknown  warm rivers   hundreds of peasants  among them the bogucharovo folk  suddenly began selling their cattle and moving in whole families toward the southeast
as birds migrate to somewhere beyond the sea  so these men with their wives and children streamed to the southeast  to parts where none of them had ever been
they set off in caravans  bought their freedom one by one or ran away  and drove or walked toward the  warm rivers   many of them were punished  some sent to siberia  many died of cold and hunger on the road  many returned of their own accord  and the movement died down of itself just as it had sprung up  without apparent reason
but such undercurrents still existed among the people and gathered new forces ready to manifest themselves just as strangely  unexpectedly  and at the same time simply  naturally  and forcibly now in 1812  to anyone living in close touch with these people it was apparent that these undercurrents were acting strongly and nearing an eruption
alpatych  who had reached bogucharovo shortly before the old prince s death  noticed an agitation among the peasants  and that contrary to what was happening in the bald hills district  where over a radius of forty miles all the peasants were moving away and leaving their villages to be devastated by the cossacks  the peasants in the steppe region round bogucharovo were  it was rumored  in touch with the french  received leaflets from them that passed from hand to hand  and did not migrate
he learned from domestic serfs loyal to him that the peasant karp  who possessed great influence in the village commune and had recently been away driving a government transport  had returned with news that the cossacks were destroying deserted villages  but that the french did not harm them
alpatych also knew that on the previous day another peasant had even brought from the village of visloukhovo  which was occupied by the french  a proclamation by a french general that no harm would be done to the inhabitants  and if they remained they would be paid for anything taken from them
as proof of this the peasant had brought from visloukhovo a hundred rubles in notes  he did not know that they were false  paid to him in advance for hay
more important still  alpatych learned that on the morning of the very day he gave the village elder orders to collect carts to move the princess  luggage from bogucharovo  there had been a village meeting at which it had been decided not to move but to wait
yet there was no time to waste
on the fifteenth  the day of the old prince s death  the marshal had insisted on princess mary s leaving at once  as it was becoming dangerous
he had told her that after the sixteenth he could not be responsible for what might happen
on the evening of the day the old prince died the marshal went away  promising to return next day for the funeral
but this he was unable to do  for he received tidings that the french had unexpectedly advanced  and had barely time to remove his own family and valuables from his estate
for some thirty years bogucharovo had been managed by the village elder  dron  whom the old prince called by the diminutive  dronushka   dron was one of those physically and mentally vigorous peasants who grow big beards as soon as they are of age and go on unchanged till they are sixty or seventy  without a gray hair or the loss of a tooth  as straight and strong at sixty as at thirty
soon after the migration to the  warm rivers   in which he had taken part like the rest  dron was made village elder and overseer of bogucharovo  and had since filled that post irreproachably for twenty three years
the peasants feared him more than they did their master
the masters  both the old prince and the young  and the steward respected him and jestingly called him  the minister   during the whole time of his service dron had never been drunk or ill  never after sleepless nights or the hardest tasks had he shown the least fatigue  and though he could not read he had never forgotten a single money account or the number of quarters of flour in any of the endless cartloads he sold for the prince  nor a single shock of the whole corn crop on any single acre of the bogucharovo fields
alpatych  arriving from the devastated bald hills estate  sent for his dron on the day of the prince s funeral and told him to have twelve horses got ready for the princess  carriages and eighteen carts for the things to be removed from bogucharovo
though the peasants paid quitrent  alpatych thought no difficulty would be made about complying with this order  for there were two hundred and thirty households at work in bogucharovo and the peasants were well to do
but on hearing the order dron lowered his eyes and remained silent
alpatych named certain peasants he knew  from whom he told him to take the carts
dron replied that the horses of these peasants were away carting
alpatych named others  but they too  according to dron  had no horses available  some horses were carting for the government  others were too weak  and others had died for want of fodder
it seemed that no horses could be had even for the carriages  much less for the carting
alpatych looked intently at dron and frowned
just as dron was a model village elder  so alpatych had not managed the prince s estates for twenty years in vain
he was a model steward  possessing in the highest degree the faculty of divining the needs and instincts of those he dealt with
having glanced at dron he at once understood that his answers did not express his personal views but the general mood of the bogucharovo commune  by which the elder had already been carried away
but he also knew that dron  who had acquired property and was hated by the commune  must be hesitating between the two camps  the masters  and the serfs 
he noticed this hesitation in dron s look and therefore frowned and moved closer up to him
 now just listen  dronushka   said he
 don t talk nonsense to me
his excellency prince andrew himself gave me orders to move all the people away and not leave them with the enemy  and there is an order from the tsar about it too anyone who stays is a traitor to the tsar
do you hear    i hear   dron answered without lifting his eyes
alpatych was not satisfied with this reply
 eh  dron  it will turn out badly   he said  shaking his head
 the power is in your hands   dron rejoined sadly
 eh  dron  drop it   alpatych repeated  withdrawing his hand from his bosom and solemnly pointing to the floor at dron s feet
 i can see through you and three yards into the ground under you   he continued  gazing at the floor in front of dron
dron was disconcerted  glanced furtively at alpatych and again lowered his eyes
 you drop this nonsense and tell the people to get ready to leave their homes and go to moscow and to get carts ready for tomorrow morning for the princess  things
and don t go to any meeting yourself  do you hear   dron suddenly fell on his knees
 yakov alpatych  discharge me  take the keys from me and discharge me  for christ s sake    stop that   cried alpatych sternly
 i see through you and three yards under you   he repeated  knowing that his skill in beekeeping  his knowledge of the right time to sow the oats  and the fact that he had been able to retain the old prince s favor for twenty years had long since gained him the reputation of being a wizard  and that the power of seeing three yards under a man is considered an attribute of wizards
dron got up and was about to say something  but alpatych interrupted him
 what is it you have got into your heads  eh   
what are you thinking of  eh    what am i to do with the people   said dron
 they re quite beside themselves  i have already told them       told them   i dare say   said alpatych  are they drinking   he asked abruptly
 quite beside themselves  yakov alpatych  they ve fetched another barrel    well  then  listen  i ll go to the police officer  and you tell them so  and that they must stop this and the carts must be got ready    i understand   alpatych did not insist further he had managed people for a long time and knew that the chief way to make them obey is to show no suspicion that they can possibly disobey having wrung a submissive  i understand  from dron  alpatych contented himself with that  though he not only doubted but felt almost certain that without the help of troops the carts would not be forthcoming and so it was  for when evening came no carts had been provided
in the village  outside the drink shop  another meeting was being held  which decided that the horses should be driven out into the woods and the carts should not be provided
without saying anything of this to the princess  alpatych had his own belongings taken out of the carts which had arrived from bald hills and had those horses got ready for the princess  carriages
meanwhile he went himself to the police authorities after her father s funeral princess mary shut herself up in her room and did not admit anyone
a maid came to the door to say that alpatych was asking for orders about their departure
 this was before his talk with dron   princess mary raised herself on the sofa on which she had been lying and replied through the closed door that she did not mean to go away and begged to be left in peace
the windows of the room in which she was lying looked westward
she lay on the sofa with her face to the wall  fingering the buttons of the leather cushion and seeing nothing but that cushion  and her confused thoughts were centered on one subject the irrevocability of death and her own spiritual baseness  which she had not suspected  but which had shown itself during her father s illness
she wished to pray but did not dare to  dared not in her present state of mind address herself to god
she lay for a long time in that position
the sun had reached the other side of the house  and its slanting rays shone into the open window  lighting up the room and part of the morocco cushion at which princess mary was looking
the flow of her thoughts suddenly stopped
unconsciously she sat up  smoothed her hair  got up  and went to the window  involuntarily inhaling the freshness of the clear but windy evening
 yes  you can well enjoy the evening now  he is gone and no one will hinder you   she said to herself  and sinking into a chair she let her head fall on the window sill
someone spoke her name in a soft and tender voice from the garden and kissed her head
she looked up
it was mademoiselle bourienne in a black dress and weepers
she softly approached princess mary  sighed  kissed her  and immediately began to cry
the princess looked up at her
all their former disharmony and her own jealousy recurred to her mind
but she remembered too how he had changed of late toward mademoiselle bourienne and could not bear to see her  thereby showing how unjust were the reproaches princess mary had mentally addressed to her
 besides  is it for me  for me who desired his death  to condemn anyone   she thought
princess mary vividly pictured to herself the position of mademoiselle bourienne  whom she had of late kept at a distance  but who yet was dependent on her and living in her house
she felt sorry for her and held out her hand with a glance of gentle inquiry
mademoiselle bourienne at once began crying again and kissed that hand  speaking of the princess  sorrow and making herself a partner in it
she said her only consolation was the fact that the princess allowed her to share her sorrow  that all the old misunderstandings should sink into nothing but this great grief  that she felt herself blameless in regard to everyone  and that he  from above  saw her affection and gratitude
the princess heard her  not heeding her words but occasionally looking up at her and listening to the sound of her voice
 your position is doubly terrible  dear princess   said mademoiselle bourienne after a pause
 i understand that you could not  and cannot  think of yourself  but with my love for you i must do so   
has alpatych been to you  has he spoken to you of going away   she asked
princess mary did not answer
she did not understand who was to go or where to
 is it possible to plan or think of anything now  is it not all the same   she thought  and did not reply
 you know  chere marie   said mademoiselle bourienne   that we are in danger are surrounded by the french
it would be dangerous to move now
if we go we are almost sure to be taken prisoners  and god knows     princess mary looked at her companion without understanding what she was talking about
 oh  if anyone knew how little anything matters to me now   she said
 of course i would on no account wish to go away from him   
alpatych did say something about going   
speak to him  i can do nothing  nothing  and don t want to       i ve spoken to him
he hopes we should be in time to get away tomorrow  but i think it would now be better to stay here   said mademoiselle bourienne
 because  you will agree  chere marie  to fall into the hands of the soldiers or of riotous peasants would be terrible   mademoiselle bourienne took from her reticule a proclamation  not printed on ordinary russian paper  of general rameau s  telling people not to leave their homes and that the french authorities would afford them proper protection
she handed this to the princess
 i think it would be best to appeal to that general   she continued   and i am sure that all due respect would be shown you   princess mary read the paper  and her face began to quiver with stifled sobs
 from whom did you get this   she asked
 they probably recognized that i am french  by my name   replied mademoiselle bourienne blushing
princess mary  with the paper in her hand  rose from the window and with a pale face went out of the room and into what had been prince andrew s study
 dunyasha  send alpatych  or dronushka  or somebody to me   she said   and tell mademoiselle bourienne not to come to me   she added  hearing mademoiselle bourienne s voice
 we must go at once  at once   she said  appalled at the thought of being left in the hands of the french
 if prince andrew heard that i was in the power of the french  that i  the daughter of prince nicholas bolkonski  asked general rameau for protection and accepted his favor   this idea horrified her  made her shudder  blush  and feel such a rush of anger and pride as she had never experienced before
all that was distressing  and especially all that was humiliating  in her position rose vividly to her mind
 they  the french  would settle in this house  m
le general rameau would occupy prince andrew s study and amuse himself by looking through and reading his letters and papers mademoiselle bourienne would do the honors of bogucharovo for him
i should be given a small room as a favor  the soldiers would violate my father s newly dug grave to steal his crosses and stars  they would tell me of their victories over the russians  and would pretend to sympathize with my sorrow     thought princess mary  not thinking her own thoughts but feeling bound to think like her father and her brother
for herself she did not care where she remained or what happened to her  but she felt herself the representative of her dead father and of prince andrew
involuntarily she thought their thoughts and felt their feelings
what they would have said and what they would have done she felt bound to say and do
she went into prince andrew s study  trying to enter completely into his ideas  and considered her position
the demands of life  which had seemed to her annihilated by her father s death  all at once rose before her with a new  previously unknown force and took possession of her
agitated and flushed she paced the room  sending now for michael ivanovich and now for tikhon or dron
dunyasha  the nurse  and the other maids could not say in how far mademoiselle bourienne s statement was correct
alpatych was not at home  he had gone to the police
neither could the architect michael ivanovich  who on being sent for came in with sleepy eyes  tell princess mary anything
with just the same smile of agreement with which for fifteen years he had been accustomed to answer the old prince without expressing views of his own  he now replied to princess mary  so that nothing definite could be got from his answers
the old valet tikhon  with sunken  emaciated face that bore the stamp of inconsolable grief  replied   yes  princess  to all princess mary s questions and hardly refrained from sobbing as he looked at her
at length dron  the village elder  entered the room and with a deep bow to princess mary came to a halt by the doorpost
princess mary walked up and down the room and stopped in front of him
 dronushka   she said  regarding as a sure friend this dronushka who always used to bring a special kind of gingerbread from his visit to the fair at vyazma every year and smilingly offer it to her   dronushka  now since our misfortune     she began  but could not go on
 we are all in god s hands   said he  with a sigh
they were silent for a while
 dronushka  alpatych has gone off somewhere and i have no one to turn to
is it true  as they tell me  that i can t even go away    why shouldn t you go away  your excellency  you can go   said dron
 i was told it would be dangerous because of the enemy
dear friend  i can do nothing
i understand nothing
i have nobody  i want to go away tonight or early tomorrow morning   dron paused
he looked askance at princess mary and said   there are no horses  i told yakov alpatych so    why are there none   asked the princess
 it s all god s scourge   said dron
 what horses we had have been taken for the army or have died this is such a year  it s not a case of feeding horses  we may die of hunger ourselves  as it is  some go three days without eating
we ve nothing  we ve been ruined   princess mary listened attentively to what he told her
 the peasants are ruined  they have no bread   she asked
 they re dying of hunger   said dron
 it s not a case of carting    but why didn t you tell me  dronushka  isn t it possible to help them  i ll do all i can      to princess mary it was strange that now  at a moment when such sorrow was filling her soul  there could be rich people and poor  and the rich could refrain from helping the poor
she had heard vaguely that there was such a thing as  landlord s corn  which was sometimes given to the peasants
she also knew that neither her father nor her brother would refuse to help the peasants in need  she only feared to make some mistake in speaking about the distribution of the grain she wished to give
she was glad such cares presented themselves  enabling her without scruple to forget her own grief she began asking dron about the peasants  needs and what there was in bogucharovo that belonged to the landlord
 but we have grain belonging to my brother   she said
 the landlord s grain is all safe   replied dron proudly
 our prince did not order it to be sold    give it to the peasants  let them have all they need  i give you leave in my brother s name   said she
dron made no answer but sighed deeply
 give them that corn if there is enough of it
distribute it all
i give this order in my brother s name  and tell them that what is ours is theirs
we do not grudge them anything
tell them so   dron looked intently at the princess while she was speaking
 discharge me  little mother  for god s sake  order the keys to be taken from me   said he
 i have served twenty three years and have done no wrong
discharge me  for god s sake   princess mary did not understand what he wanted of her or why he was asking to be discharged
she replied that she had never doubted his devotion and that she was ready to do anything for him and for the peasants
an hour later dunyasha came to tell the princess that dron had come  and all the peasants had assembled at the barn by the princess  order and wished to have word with their mistress
 but i never told them to come   said princess mary
 i only told dron to let them have the grain    only  for god s sake  princess dear  have them sent away and don t go out to them
it s all a trick   said dunyasha   and when yakov alpatych returns let us get away  
and please don t      what is a trick   asked princess mary in surprise
 i know it is  only listen to me for god s sake  ask nurse too
they say they don t agree to leave bogucharovo as you ordered    you re making some mistake
i never ordered them to go away   said princess mary
 call dronushka   dron came and confirmed dunyasha s words  the peasants had come by the princess  order
 but i never sent for them   declared the princess
 you must have given my message wrong
i only said that you were to give them the grain   dron only sighed in reply
 if you order it they will go away   said he
 no  no
i ll go out to them   said princess mary  and in spite of the nurse s and dunyasha s protests she went out into the porch  dron  dunyasha  the nurse  and michael ivanovich following her
 they probably think i am offering them the grain to bribe them to remain here  while i myself go away leaving them to the mercy of the french   thought princess mary
 i will offer them monthly rations and housing at our moscow estate
i am sure andrew would do even more in my place   she thought as she went out in the twilight toward the crowd standing on the pasture by the barn
the men crowded closer together  stirred  and rapidly took off their hats
princess mary lowered her eyes and  tripping over her skirt  came close up to them
so many different eyes  old and young  were fixed on her  and there were so many different faces  that she could not distinguish any of them and  feeling that she must speak to them all at once  did not know how to do it
but again the sense that she represented her father and her brother gave her courage  and she boldly began her speech
 i am very glad you have come   she said without raising her eyes  and feeling her heart beating quickly and violently
 dronushka tells me that the war has ruined you
that is our common misfortune  and i shall grudge nothing to help you
i am myself going away because it is dangerous here  
the enemy is near  
because  
i am giving you everything  my friends  and i beg you to take everything  all our grain  so that you may not suffer want  and if you have been told that i am giving you the grain to keep you here that is not true
on the contrary  i ask you to go with all your belongings to our estate near moscow  and i promise you i will see to it that there you shall want for nothing
you shall be given food and lodging   the princess stopped
sighs were the only sound heard in the crowd
 i am not doing this on my own account   she continued   i do it in the name of my dead father  who was a good master to you  and of my brother and his son   again she paused
no one broke the silence
 ours is a common misfortune and we will share it together
all that is mine is yours   she concluded  scanning the faces before her
all eyes were gazing at her with one and the same expression
she could not fathom whether it was curiosity  devotion  gratitude  or apprehension and distrust but the expression on all the faces was identical
 we are all very thankful for your bounty  but it won t do for us to take the landlord s grain   said a voice at the back of the crowd
 but why not   asked the princess
no one replied and princess mary  looking round at the crowd  found that every eye she met now was immediately dropped
 but why don t you want to take it   she asked again
no one answered
the silence began to oppress the princess and she tried to catch someone s eye
 why don t you speak   she inquired of a very old man who stood just in front of her leaning on his stick
 if you think something more is wanted  tell me  i will do anything   said she  catching his eye
but as if this angered him  he bent his head quite low and muttered   why should we agree  we don t want the grain    why should we give up everything  we don t agree
don t agree   
we are sorry for you  but we re not willing
go away yourself  alone     came from various sides of the crowd
and again all the faces in that crowd bore an identical expression  though now it was certainly not an expression of curiosity or gratitude  but of angry resolve
 but you can t have understood me   said princess mary with a sad smile
 why don t you want to go  i promise to house and feed you  while here the enemy would ruin you     but her voice was drowned by the voices of the crowd
 we re not willing
let them ruin us  we won t take your grain
we don t agree   again princess mary tried to catch someone s eye  but not a single eye in the crowd was turned to her  evidently they were all trying to avoid her look
she felt strange and awkward
 oh yes  an artful tale  follow her into slavery  pull down your houses and go into bondage  i dare say   i ll give you grain  indeed   she says   voices in the crowd were heard saying
with drooping head princess mary left the crowd and went back to the house
having repeated her order to dron to have horses ready for her departure next morning  she went to her room and remained alone with her own thoughts
for a long time that night princess mary sat by the open window of her room hearing the sound of the peasants  voices that reached her from the village  but it was not of them she was thinking
she felt that she could not understand them however much she might think about them
she thought only of one thing  her sorrow  which  after the break caused by cares for the present  seemed already to belong to the past
now she could remember it and weep or pray
after sunset the wind had dropped
the night was calm and fresh
toward midnight the voices began to subside  a cock crowed  the full moon began to show from behind the lime trees  a fresh white dewy mist began to rise  and stillness reigned over the village and the house
pictures of the near past her father s illness and last moments rose one after another to her memory
with mournful pleasure she now lingered over these images  repelling with horror only the last one  the picture of his death  which she felt she could not contemplate even in imagination at this still and mystic hour of night
and these pictures presented themselves to her so clearly and in such detail that they seemed now present  now past  and now future she vividly recalled the moment when he had his first stroke and was being dragged along by his armpits through the garden at bald hills  muttering something with his helpless tongue  twitching his gray eyebrows and looking uneasily and timidly at her
 even then he wanted to tell me what he told me the day he died   she thought
 he had always thought what he said then   and she recalled in all its detail the night at bald hills before he had the last stroke  when with a foreboding of disaster she had remained at home against his will
she had not slept and had stolen downstairs on tiptoe  and going to the door of the conservatory where he slept that night had listened at the door
in a suffering and weary voice he was saying something to tikhon  speaking of the crimea and its warm nights and of the empress
evidently he had wanted to talk
 and why didn t he call me  why didn t he let me be there instead of tikhon   princess mary had thought and thought again now
 now he will never tell anyone what he had in his soul
never will that moment return for him or for me when he might have said all he longed to say  and not tikhon but i might have heard and understood him
why didn t i enter the room   she thought
 perhaps he would then have said to me what he said the day he died
while talking to tikhon he asked about me twice
he wanted to see me  and i was standing close by  outside the door
it was sad and painful for him to talk to tikhon who did not understand him
i remember how he began speaking to him about lise as if she were alive he had forgotten she was dead and tikhon reminded him that she was no more  and he shouted   fool   he was greatly depressed
from behind the door i heard how he lay down on his bed groaning and loudly exclaimed   my god   why didn t i go in then  what could he have done to me  what could i have lost  and perhaps he would then have been comforted and would have said that word to me   and princess mary uttered aloud the caressing word he had said to her on the day of his death
 dear est   she repeated  and began sobbing  with tears that relieved her soul
she now saw his face before her
and not the face she had known ever since she could remember and had always seen at a distance  but the timid  feeble face she had seen for the first time quite closely  with all its wrinkles and details  when she stooped near to his mouth to catch what he said
 dear est   she repeated again
 what was he thinking when he uttered that word  what is he thinking now   this question suddenly presented itself to her  and in answer she saw him before her with the expression that was on his face as he lay in his coffin with his chin bound up with a white handkerchief
and the horror that had seized her when she touched him and convinced herself that that was not he  but something mysterious and horrible  seized her again
she tried to think of something else and to pray  but could do neither
with wide open eyes she gazed at the moonlight and the shadows  expecting every moment to see his dead face  and she felt that the silence brooding over the house and within it held her fast
 dunyasha   she whispered
 dunyasha   she screamed wildly  and tearing herself out of this silence she ran to the servants  quarters to meet her old nurse and the maidservants who came running toward her
on the seventeenth of august rostov and ilyin  accompanied by lavrushka who had just returned from captivity and by an hussar orderly  left their quarters at yankovo  ten miles from bogucharovo  and went for a ride to try a new horse ilyin had bought and to find out whether there was any hay to be had in the villages
for the last three days bogucharovo had lain between the two hostile armies  so that it was as easy for the russian rearguard to get to it as for the french vanguard  rostov  as a careful squadron commander  wished to take such provisions as remained at bogucharovo before the french could get them
rostov and ilyin were in the merriest of moods
on the way to bogucharovo  a princely estate with a dwelling house and farm where they hoped to find many domestic serfs and pretty girls  they questioned lavrushka about napoleon and laughed at his stories  and raced one another to try ilyin s horse
rostov had no idea that the village he was entering was the property of that very bolkonski who had been engaged to his sister
rostov and ilyin gave rein to their horses for a last race along the incline before reaching bogucharovo  and rostov  outstripping ilyin  was the first to gallop into the village street
 you re first   cried ilyin  flushed
 yes  always first both on the grassland and here   answered rostov  stroking his heated donets horse
 and i d have won on my frenchy  your excellency   said lavrushka from behind  alluding to his shabby cart horse   only i didn t wish to mortify you   they rode at a footpace to the barn  where a large crowd of peasants was standing
some of the men bared their heads  others stared at the new arrivals without doffing their caps
two tall old peasants with wrinkled faces and scanty beards emerged from the tavern  smiling  staggering  and singing some incoherent song  and approached the officers
 fine fellows   said rostov laughing
 is there any hay here    and how like one another   said ilyin
 a mo o st me r r y co o m pa      sang one of the peasants with a blissful smile
one of the men came out of the crowd and went up to rostov
 who do you belong to   he asked
 the french   replied ilyin jestingly   and here is napoleon himself  and he pointed to lavrushka  then you are russians   the peasant asked again
 and is there a large force of you here   said another  a short man  coming up
 very large   answered rostov
 but why have you collected here   he added
 is it a holiday    the old men have met to talk over the business of the commune   replied the peasant  moving away
at that moment  on the road leading from the big house  two women and a man in a white hat were seen coming toward the officers
 the one in pink is mine  so keep off   said ilyin on seeing dunyasha running resolutely toward him
 she ll be ours   said lavrushka to ilyin  winking
 what do you want  my pretty   said ilyin with a smile
 the princess ordered me to ask your regiment and your name    this is count rostov  squadron commander  and i am your humble servant    co o om pa ny   roared the tipsy peasant with a beatific smile as he looked at ilyin talking to the girl
following dunyasha  alpatych advanced to rostov  having bared his head while still at a distance
 may i make bold to trouble your honor   said he respectfully  but with a shade of contempt for the youthfulness of this officer and with a hand thrust into his bosom
 my mistress  daughter of general in chief prince nicholas bolkonski who died on the fifteenth of this month  finding herself in difficulties owing to the boorishness of these people  he pointed to the peasants  asks you to come up to the house   
won t you  please  ride on a little farther   said alpatych with a melancholy smile   as it is not convenient in the presence of      he pointed to the two peasants who kept as close to him as horseflies to a horse
 ah   
alpatych  
ah  yakov alpatych  
grand  forgive us for christ s sake  eh   said the peasants  smiling joyfully at him
rostov looked at the tipsy peasants and smiled
 or perhaps they amuse your honor   remarked alpatych with a staid air  as he pointed at the old men with his free hand
 no  there s not much to be amused at here   said rostov  and rode on a little way
 what s the matter   he asked
 i make bold to inform your honor that the rude peasants here don t wish to let the mistress leave the estate  and threaten to unharness her horses  so that though everything has been packed up since morning  her excellency cannot get away    impossible   exclaimed rostov
 i have the honor to report to you the actual truth   said alpatych
rostov dismounted  gave his horse to the orderly  and followed alpatych to the house  questioning him as to the state of affairs
it appeared that the princess  offer of corn to the peasants the previous day  and her talk with dron and at the meeting  had actually had so bad an effect that dron had finally given up the keys and joined the peasants and had not appeared when alpatych sent for him  and that in the morning when the princess gave orders to harness for her journey  the peasants had come in a large crowd to the barn and sent word that they would not let her leave the village  that there was an order not to move  and that they would unharness the horses
alpatych had gone out to admonish them  but was told  it was chiefly karp who did the talking  dron not showing himself in the crowd  that they could not let the princess go  that there was an order to the contrary  but that if she stayed they would serve her as before and obey her in everything at the moment when rostov and ilyin were galloping along the road  princess mary  despite the dissuasions of alpatych  her nurse  and the maids  had given orders to harness and intended to start  but when the cavalrymen were espied they were taken for frenchmen  the coachman ran away  and the women in the house began to wail
 father  benefactor  god has sent you   exclaimed deeply moved voices as rostov passed through the anteroom
princess mary was sitting helpless and bewildered in the large sitting room  when rostov was shown in
she could not grasp who he was and why he had come  or what was happening to her
when she saw his russian face  and by his walk and the first words he uttered recognized him as a man of her own class  she glanced at him with her deep radiant look and began speaking in a voice that faltered and trembled with emotion
this meeting immediately struck rostov as a romantic event
 a helpless girl overwhelmed with grief  left to the mercy of coarse  rioting peasants  and what a strange fate sent me here  what gentleness and nobility there are in her features and expression   thought he as he looked at her and listened to her timid story
when she began to tell him that all this had happened the day after her father s funeral  her voice trembled
she turned away  and then  as if fearing he might take her words as meant to move him to pity  looked at him with an apprehensive glance of inquiry
there were tears in rostov s eyes
princess mary noticed this and glanced gratefully at him with that radiant look which caused the plainness of her face to be forgotten
 i cannot express  princess  how glad i am that i happened to ride here and am able to show my readiness to serve you   said rostov  rising
 go when you please  and i give you my word of honor that no one shall dare to cause you annoyance if only you will allow me to act as your escort   and bowing respectfully  as if to a lady of royal blood  he moved toward the door
rostov s deferential tone seemed to indicate that though he would consider himself happy to be acquainted with her  he did not wish to take advantage of her misfortunes to intrude upon her princess mary understood this and appreciated his delicacy
 i am very  very grateful to you   she said in french   but i hope it was all a misunderstanding and that no one is to blame for it   she suddenly began to cry
 excuse me   she said
rostov  knitting his brows  left the room with another low bow
 well  is she pretty  ah  friend my pink one is delicious  her name is dunyasha      but on glancing at rostov s face ilyin stopped short
he saw that his hero and commander was following quite a different train of thought
rostov glanced angrily at ilyin and without replying strode off with rapid steps to the village
 i ll show them  i ll give it to them  the brigands   said he to himself alpatych at a gliding trot  only just managing not to run  kept up with him with difficulty
 what decision have you been pleased to come to   said he
rostov stopped and  clenching his fists  suddenly and sternly turned on alpatych
 decision  what decision  old dotard      cried he
 what have you been about  eh  the peasants are rioting  and you can t manage them  you re a traitor yourself  i know you
i ll flay you all alive      and as if afraid of wasting his store of anger  he left alpatych and went rapidly forward
alpatych  mastering his offended feelings  kept pace with rostov at a gliding gait and continued to impart his views
he said the peasants were obdurate and that at the present moment it would be imprudent to  overresist  them without an armed force  and would it not be better first to send for the military   i ll give them armed force  
i ll  overresist  them   uttered rostov meaninglessly  breathless with irrational animal fury and the need to vent it
without considering what he would do he moved unconciously with quick  resolute steps toward the crowd
and the nearer he drew to it the more alpatych felt that this unreasonable action might produce good results
the peasants in the crowd were similarly impressed when they saw rostov s rapid  firm steps and resolute  frowning face
after the hussars had come to the village and rostov had gone to see the princess  a certain confusion and dissension had arisen among the crowd
some of the peasants said that these new arrivals were russians and might take it amiss that the mistress was being detained
dron was of this opinion  but as soon as he expressed it karp and others attacked their ex elder
 how many years have you been fattening on the commune   karp shouted at him
 it s all one to you  you ll dig up your pot of money and take it away with you   
what does it matter to you whether our homes are ruined or not    we ve been told to keep order  and that no one is to leave their homes or take away a single grain  and that s all about it   cried another
 it was your son s turn to be conscripted  but no fear  you begrudged your lump of a son   a little old man suddenly began attacking dron  and so they took my vanka to be shaved for a soldier  but we all have to die    to be sure  we all have to die
i m not against the commune   said dron
 that s it not against it  you ve filled your belly      the two tall peasants had their say
as soon as rostov  followed by ilyin  lavrushka  and alpatych  came up to the crowd  karp  thrusting his fingers into his belt and smiling a little  walked to the front
dron on the contrary retired to the rear and the crowd drew closer together
 who is your elder here  hey   shouted rostov  coming up to the crowd with quick steps
 the elder  what do you want with him      asked karp
but before the words were well out of his mouth  his cap flew off and a fierce blow jerked his head to one side
 caps off  traitors   shouted rostov in a wrathful voice
 where s the elder   he cried furiously
 the elder   
he wants the elder   
dron zakharych  you   meek and flustered voices here and there were heard calling and caps began to come off their heads
 we don t riot  we re following the orders   declared karp  and at that moment several voices began speaking together
 it s as the old men have decided there s too many of you giving orders    arguing  mutiny   
brigands  traitors   cried rostov unmeaningly in a voice not his own  gripping karp by the collar
 bind him  bind him   he shouted  though there was no one to bind him but lavrushka and alpatych
lavrushka  however  ran up to karp and seized him by the arms from behind  shall i call up our men from beyond the hill   he called out
alpatych turned to the peasants and ordered two of them by name to come and bind karp
the men obediently came out of the crowd and began taking off their belts
 where s the elder   demanded rostov in a loud voice
with a pale and frowning face dron stepped out of the crowd
 are you the elder  bind him  lavrushka   shouted rostov  as if that order  too  could not possibly meet with any opposition
and in fact two more peasants began binding dron  who took off his own belt and handed it to them  as if to aid them
 and you all listen to me   said rostov to the peasants
 be off to your houses at once  and don t let one of your voices be heard    why  we ve not done any harm  we did it just out of foolishness
it s all nonsense  
i said then that it was not in order   voices were heard bickering with one another
 there  what did i say   said alpatych  coming into his own again
 it s wrong  lads    all our stupidity  yakov alpatych   came the answers  and the crowd began at once to disperse through the village
the two bound men were led off to the master s house
the two drunken peasants followed them
 aye  when i look at you      said one of them to karp
 how can one talk to the masters like that  what were you thinking of  you fool   added the other  a real fool   two hours later the carts were standing in the courtyard of the bogucharovo house
the peasants were briskly carrying out the proprietor s goods and packing them on the carts  and dron  liberated at princess mary s wish from the cupboard where he had been confined  was standing in the yard directing the men
 don t put it in so carelessly   said one of the peasants  a man with a round smiling face  taking a casket from a housemaid
 you know it has cost money  how can you chuck it in like that or shove it under the cord where it ll get rubbed  i don t like that way of doing things
let it all be done properly  according to rule
look here  put it under the bast matting and cover it with hay that s the way    yes  they worked all day and didn t play   remarked the tall  round faced peasant gravely  pointing with a significant wink at the dictionaries that were on the top
unwilling to obtrude himself on the princess  rostov did not go back to the house but remained in the village awaiting her departure when her carriage drove out of the house  he mounted and accompanied her eight miles from bogucharovo to where the road was occupied by our troops
at the inn at yankovo he respectfully took leave of her  for the first time permitting himself to kiss her hand  how can you speak so   he blushingly replied to princess mary s expressions of gratitude for her deliverance  as she termed what had occurred
 any police officer would have done as much  if we had had only peasants to fight  we should not have let the enemy come so far   said he with a sense of shame and wishing to change the subject
 i am only happy to have had the opportunity of making your acquaintance
good bye  princess
i wish you happiness and consolation and hope to meet you again in happier circumstances if you don t want to make me blush  please don t thank me   but the princess  if she did not again thank him in words  thanked him with the whole expression of her face  radiant with gratitude and tenderness
she could not believe that there was nothing to thank him for
on the contrary  it seemed to her certain that had he not been there she would have perished at the hands of the mutineers and of the french  and that he had exposed himself to terrible and obvious danger to save her  and even more certain was it that he was a man of lofty and noble soul  able to understand her position and her sorrow his kind  honest eyes  with the tears rising in them when she herself had begun to cry as she spoke of her loss  did not leave her memory
when she had taken leave of him and remained alone she suddenly felt her eyes filling with tears  and then not for the first time the strange question presented itself to her  did she love him  on the rest of the way to moscow  though the princess  position was not a cheerful one  dunyasha  who went with her in the carriage  more than once noticed that her mistress leaned out of the window and smiled at something with an expression of mingled joy and sorrow
 well  supposing i do love him   thought princess mary
ashamed as she was of acknowledging to herself that she had fallen in love with a man who would perhaps never love her  she comforted herself with the thought that no one would ever know it and that she would not be to blame if  without ever speaking of it to anyone  she continued to the end of her life to love the man with whom she had fallen in love for the first and last time in her life
sometimes when she recalled his looks  his sympathy  and his words  happiness did not appear impossible to her
it was at those moments that dunyasha noticed her smiling as she looked out of the carriage window
 was it not fate that brought him to bogucharovo  and at that very moment   thought princess mary
 and that caused his sister to refuse my brother   and in all this princess mary saw the hand of providence
the impression the princess made on rostov was a very agreeable one
to remember her gave him pleasure  and when his comrades  hearing of his adventure at bogucharovo  rallied him on having gone to look for hay and having picked up one of the wealthiest heiresses in russia  he grew angry it made him angry just because the idea of marrying the gentle princess mary  who was attractive to him and had an enormous fortune  had against his will more than once entered his head
for himself personally nicholas could not wish for a better wife  by marrying her he would make the countess his mother happy  would be able to put his father s affairs in order  and would even he felt it ensure princess mary s happiness but sonya  and his plighted word  that was why rostov grew angry when he was rallied about princess bolkonskaya
on receiving command of the armies kutuzov remembered prince andrew and sent an order for him to report at headquarters
prince andrew arrived at tsarevo zaymishche on the very day and at the very hour that kutuzov was reviewing the troops for the first time
he stopped in the village at the priest s house in front of which stood the commander in  chief s carriage  and he sat down on the bench at the gate awaiting his serene highness  as everyone now called kutuzov
from the field beyond the village came now sounds of regimental music and now the roar of many voices shouting  hurrah   to the new commander in chief
two orderlies  a courier and a major domo  stood near by  some ten paces from prince andrew  availing themselves of kutuzov s absence and of the fine weather a short  swarthy lieutenant colonel of hussars with thick mustaches and whiskers rode up to the gate and  glancing at prince andrew  inquired whether his serene highness was putting up there and whether he would soon be back
prince andrew replied that he was not on his serene highness  staff but was himself a new arrival the lieutenant colonel turned to a smart orderly  who  with the peculiar contempt with which a commander in chief s orderly speaks to officers  replied   what  his serene highness  i expect he ll be here soon
what do you want   the lieutenant colonel of hussars smiled beneath his mustache at the orderly s tone  dismounted  gave his horse to a dispatch runner  and approached bolkonski with a slight bow
bolkonski made room for him on the bench and the lieutenant colonel sat down beside him
 you re also waiting for the commander in chief   said he
 they say he weceives evewyone  thank god   
it s awful with those sausage eaters  ermolov had weason to ask to be pwomoted to be a german  now p waps wussians will get a look in
as it was  devil only knows what was happening
we kept wetweating and wetweating
did you take part in the campaign   he asked
 i had the pleasure   replied prince andrew   not only of taking part in the retreat but of losing in that retreat all i held dear not to mention the estate and home of my birth my father  who died of grief
i belong to the province of smolensk    ah  you re pwince bolkonski  vewy glad to make your acquaintance  i m lieutenant colonel denisov  better known as  vaska    said denisov  pressing prince andrew s hand and looking into his face with a particularly kindly attention
 yes  i heard   said he sympathetically  and after a short pause added   yes  it s scythian warfare
it s all vewy well only not for those who get it in the neck
so you are pwince andwew bolkonski   he swayed his head
 vewy pleased  pwince  to make your acquaintance   he repeated again  smiling sadly  and he again pressed prince andrew s hand
prince andrew knew denisov from what natasha had told him of her first suitor
this memory carried him sadly and sweetly back to those painful feelings of which he had not thought lately  but which still found place in his soul
of late he had received so many new and very serious impressions  such as the retreat from smolensk  his visit to bald hills  and the recent news of his father s death and had experienced so many emotions  that for a long time past those memories had not entered his mind  and now that they did  they did not act on him with nearly their former strength
for denisov  too  the memories awakened by the name of bolkonski belonged to a distant  romantic past  when after supper and after natasha s singing he had proposed to a little girl of fifteen without realizing what he was doing
he smiled at the recollection of that time and of his love for natasha  and passed at once to what now interested him passionately and exclusively
this was a plan of campaign he had devised while serving at the outposts during the retreat
he had proposed that plan to barclay de tolly and now wished to propose it to kutuzov
the plan was based on the fact that the french line of operation was too extended  and it proposed that instead of  or concurrently with  action on the front to bar the advance of the french  we should attack their line of communication
he began explaining his plan to prince andrew
 they can t hold all that line
it s impossible
i will undertake to bweak thwough
give me five hundwed men and i will bweak the line  that s certain  there s only one way guewilla warfare   denisov rose and began gesticulating as he explained his plan to bolkonski
in the midst of his explanation shouts were heard from the army  growing more incoherent and more diffused  mingling with music and songs and coming from the field where the review was held
sounds of hoofs and shouts were nearing the village
 he s coming  he s coming   shouted a cossack standing at the gate
bolkonski and denisov moved to the gate  at which a knot of soldiers  a guard of honor  was standing  and they saw kutuzov coming down the street mounted on a rather small sorrel horse
a huge suite of generals rode behind him
barclay was riding almost beside him  and a crowd of officers ran after and around them shouting   hurrah   his adjutants galloped into the yard before him
kutuzov was impatiently urging on his horse  which ambled smoothly under his weight  and he raised his hand to his white horse guard s cap with a red band and no peak  nodding his head continually
when he came up to the guard of honor  a fine set of grenadiers mostly wearing decorations  who were giving him the salute  he looked at them silently and attentively for nearly a minute with the steady gaze of a commander and then turned to the crowd of generals and officers surrounding him
suddenly his face assumed a subtle expression  he shrugged his shoulders with an air of perplexity
 and with such fine fellows to retreat and retreat  well  good by  general   he added  and rode into the yard past prince andrew and denisov
 hurrah  hurrah  hurrah   shouted those behind him
since prince andrew had last seen him kutuzov had grown still more corpulent  flaccid  and fat
but the bleached eyeball  the scar  and the familiar weariness of his expression were still the same
he was wearing the white horse guard s cap and a military overcoat with a whip hanging over his shoulder by a thin strap
he sat heavily and swayed limply on his brisk little horse
 whew  
whew  
whew   he whistled just audibly as he rode into the yard
his face expressed the relief of relaxed strain felt by a man who means to rest after a ceremony
he drew his left foot out of the stirrup and  lurching with his whole body and puckering his face with the effort  raised it with difficulty onto the saddle  leaned on his knee  groaned  and slipped down into the arms of the cossacks and adjutants who stood ready to assist him he pulled himself together  looked round  screwing up his eyes  glanced at prince andrew  and  evidently not recognizing him  moved with his waddling gait to the porch  whew  
whew  
whew   he whistled  and again glanced at prince andrew
as often occurs with old men  it was only after some seconds that the impression produced by prince andrew s face linked itself up with kutuzov s remembrance of his personality
 ah  how do you do  my dear prince  how do you do  my dear boy  come along     said he  glancing wearily round  and he stepped onto the porch which creaked under his weight
he unbuttoned his coat and sat down on a bench in the porch
 and how s your father    i received news of his death  yesterday   replied prince andrew abruptly
kutuzov looked at him with eyes wide open with dismay and then took off his cap and crossed himself   may the kingdom of heaven be his  god s will be done to us all   he sighed deeply  his whole chest heaving  and was silent for a while  i loved him and respected him  and sympathize with you with all my heart   he embraced prince andrew  pressing him to his fat breast  and for some time did not let him go
when he released him prince andrew saw that kutuzov s flabby lips were trembling and that tears were in his eyes
he sighed and pressed on the bench with both hands to raise himself  come  come with me  we ll have a talk   said he
but at that moment denisov  no more intimidated by his superiors than by the enemy  came with jingling spurs up the steps of the porch  despite the angry whispers of the adjutants who tried to stop him
kutuzov  his hands still pressed on the seat  glanced at him glumly
denisov  having given his name  announced that he had to communicate to his serene highness a matter of great importance for their country s welfare
kutuzov looked wearily at him and  lifting his hands with a gesture of annoyance  folded them across his stomach  repeating the words   for our country s welfare  well  what is it  speak   denisov blushed like a girl  it was strange to see the color rise in that shaggy  bibulous  time worn face  and boldly began to expound his plan of cutting the enemy s lines of communication between smolensk and vyazma
denisov came from those parts and knew the country well
his plan seemed decidedly a good one  especially from the strength of conviction with which he spoke
kutuzov looked down at his own legs  occasionally glancing at the door of the adjoining hut as if expecting something unpleasant to emerge from it
and from that hut  while denisov was speaking  a general with a portfolio under his arm really did appear
 what   said kutuzov  in the midst of denisov s explanations   are you ready so soon    ready  your serene highness   replied the general
kutuzov swayed his head  as much as to say   how is one man to deal with it all   and again listened to denisov
 i give my word of honor as a wussian officer   said denisov   that i can bweak napoleon s line of communication    what relation are you to intendant general kiril andreevich denisov   asked kutuzov  interrupting him
 he is my uncle  your sewene highness    ah  we were friends   said kutuzov cheerfully
 all right  all right  friend  stay here at the staff and tomorrow we ll have a talk   with a nod to denisov he turned away and put out his hand for the papers konovnitsyn had brought him
 would not your serene highness like to come inside   said the general on duty in a discontented voice   the plans must be examined and several papers have to be signed   an adjutant came out and announced that everything was in readiness within
but kutuzov evidently did not wish to enter that room till he was disengaged
he made a grimace  
 no  tell them to bring a small table out here  my dear boy
i ll look at them here   said he
 don t go away   he added  turning to prince andrew  who remained in the porch and listened to the general s report
while this was being given  prince andrew heard the whisper of a woman s voice and the rustle of a silk dress behind the door
several times on glancing that way he noticed behind that door a plump  rosy  handsome woman in a pink dress with a lilac silk kerchief on her head  holding a dish and evidently awaiting the entrance of the commander in chief
kutuzov s adjutant whispered to prince andrew that this was the wife of the priest whose home it was  and that she intended to offer his serene highness bread and salt
 her husband has welcomed his serene highness with the cross at the church  and she intends to welcome him in the house   
she s very pretty   added the adjutant with a smile
at those words kutuzov looked round
he was listening to the general s report which consisted chiefly of a criticism of the position at tsarevo zaymishche as he had listened to denisov  and seven years previously had listened to the discussion at the austerlitz council of war
he evidently listened only because he had ears which  though there was a piece of tow in one of them  could not help hearing  but it was evident that nothing the general could say would surprise or even interest him  that he knew all that would be said beforehand  and heard it all only because he had to  as one has to listen to the chanting of a service of prayer
all that denisov had said was clever and to the point
what the general was saying was even more clever and to the point  but it was evident that kutuzov despised knowledge and cleverness  and knew of something else that would decide the matter  something independent of cleverness and knowledge
prince andrew watched the commander in chief s face attentively  and the only expression he could see there was one of boredom  curiosity as to the meaning of the feminine whispering behind the door  and a desire to observe propriety
it was evident that kutuzov despised cleverness and learning and even the patriotic feeling shown by denisov  but despised them not because of his own intellect  feelings  or knowledge he did not try to display any of these but because of something else
he despised them because of his old age and experience of life
the only instruction kutuzov gave of his own accord during that report referred to looting by the russian troops
at the end of the report the general put before him for signature a paper relating to the recovery of payment from army commanders for green oats mown down by the soldiers  when landowners lodged petitions for compensation
after hearing the matter  kutuzov smacked his lips together and shook his head
 into the stove  
into the fire with it  i tell you once for all  my dear fellow   said he   into the fire with all such things  let them cut the crops and burn wood to their hearts  content
i don t order it or allow it  but i don t exact compensation either
one can t get on without it
 when wood is chopped the chips will fly    he looked at the paper again
 oh  this german precision   he muttered  shaking his head
 well  that s all   said kutuzov as he signed the last of the documents  and rising heavily and smoothing out the folds in his fat white neck he moved toward the door with a more cheerful expression
the priest s wife  flushing rosy red  caught up the dish she had after all not managed to present at the right moment  though she had so long been preparing for it  and with a low bow offered it to kutuzov
he screwed up his eyes  smiled  lifted her chin with his hand  and said   ah  what a beauty  thank you  sweetheart   he took some gold pieces from his trouser pocket and put them on the dish for her
 well  my dear  and how are we getting on   he asked  moving to the door of the room assigned to him
the priest s wife smiled  and with dimples in her rosy cheeks followed him into the room
the adjutant came out to the porch and asked prince andrew to lunch with him
half an hour later prince andrew was again called to kutuzov
he found him reclining in an armchair  still in the as prince andrew entered  marking the place with a knife
prince andrew saw by the cover that it was les chevaliers du cygne by madame de genlis
 well  sit down  sit down here
let s have a talk   said kutuzov
 it s sad  very sad
but remember  my dear fellow  that i am a father to you  a second father      prince andrew told kutuzov all he knew of his father s death  and what he had seen at bald hills when he passed through it
 what  
what they have brought us to   kutuzov suddenly cried in an agitated voice  evidently picturing vividly to himself from prince andrew s story the condition russia was in  but give me time  give me time   he said with a grim look  evidently not wishing to continue this agitating conversation  and added   i sent for you to keep you with me    i thank your serene highness  but i fear i am no longer fit for the staff   replied prince andrew with a smile which kutuzov noticed
kutuzov glanced inquiringly at him
 but above all   added prince andrew   i have grown used to my regiment  am fond of the officers  and i fancy the men also like me
i should be sorry to leave the regiment
if i decline the honor of being with you  believe me     a shrewd  kindly  yet subtly derisive expression lit up kutuzov s podgy face
he cut bolkonski short
 i am sorry  for i need you
but you re right  you re right  it s not here that men are needed
advisers are always plentiful  but men are not
the regiments would not be what they are if the would be advisers served there as you do
i remember you at austerlitz   
i remember  yes  i remember you with the standard   said kutuzov  and a flush of pleasure suffused prince andrew s face at this recollection
taking his hand and drawing him downwards  kutuzov offered his cheek to be kissed  and again prince andrew noticed tears in the old man s eyes
though prince andrew knew that kutuzov s tears came easily  and that he was particularly tender to and considerate of him from a wish to show sympathy with his loss  yet this reminder of austerlitz was both pleasant and flattering to him
 go your way and god be with you
i know your path is the path of honor   he paused
 i missed you at bucharest  but i needed someone to send   and changing the subject  kutuzov began to speak of the turkish war and the peace that had been concluded
 yes  i have been much blamed   he said   both for that war and the peace  
but everything came at the right time
tout vient a point a celui qui sait attendre
  and there were as many advisers there as here     he went on  returning to the subject of  advisers  which evidently occupied him
 ah  those advisers   said he
 if we had listened to them all we should not have made peace with turkey and should not have been through with that war
everything in haste  but more haste  less speed
kamenski would have been lost if he had not died
he stormed fortresses with thirty thousand men
it is not difficult to capture a fortress but it is difficult to win a campaign
for that  not storming and attacking but patience and time are wanted
kamenski sent soldiers to rustchuk  but i only employed these two things and took more fortresses than kamenski and made them turks eat horseflesh   he swayed his head
 and the french shall too  believe me   he went on  growing warmer and beating his chest   i ll make them eat horseflesh   and tears again dimmed his eyes
   everything comes in time to him who knows how to wait    but shan t we have to accept battle   remarked prince andrew
 we shall if everybody wants it  it can t be helped   
but believe me  my dear boy  there is nothing stronger than those two  patience and time  they will do it all
but the advisers n entendent pas de cette oreille  voila le mal
  some want a thing others don t
what s one to do   he asked  evidently expecting an answer
 well  what do you want us to do   he repeated and his eye shone with a deep  shrewd look
 i ll tell you what to do   he continued  as prince andrew still did not reply   i will tell you what to do  and what i do
dans le doute  mon cher   he paused   abstiens toi    2  he articulated the french proverb deliberately
   don t see it that way  that s the trouble      2   when in doubt  my dear fellow  do nothing    well  good by  my dear fellow  remember that with all my heart i share your sorrow  and that for you i am not a serene highness  nor a prince  nor a commander in chief  but a father  if you want anything come straight to me
good bye  my dear boy   again he embraced and kissed prince andrew  but before the latter had left the room kutuzov gave a sigh of relief and went on with his unfinished novel  les chevaliers du cygne by madame de genlis
prince andrew could not have explained how or why it was  but after that interview with kutuzov he went back to his regiment reassured as to the general course of affairs and as to the man to whom it had been entrusted
the more he realized the absence of all personal motive in that old man in whom there seemed to remain only the habit of passions  and in place of an intellect  grouping events and drawing conclusions  only the capacity calmly to contemplate the course of events the more reassured he was that everything would be as it should
 he will not bring in any plan of his own
he will not devise or undertake anything   thought prince andrew   but he will hear everything  remember everything  and put everything in its place
he will not hinder anything useful nor allow anything harmful
he understands that there is something stronger and more important than his own will the inevitable course of events  and he can see them and grasp their significance  and seeing that significance can refrain from meddling and renounce his personal wish directed to something else
and above all   thought prince andrew   one believes in him because he s russian  despite the novel by genlis and the french proverbs  and because his voice shook when he said   what they have brought us to   and had a sob in it when he said he would  make them eat horseflesh    on such feelings  more or less dimly shared by all  the unanimity and general approval were founded with which  despite court influences  the popular choice of kutuzov as commander in chief was received
after the emperor had left moscow  life flowed on there in its usual course  and its course was so very usual that it was difficult to remember the recent days of patriotic elation and ardor  hard to believe that russia was really in danger and that the members of the english club were also sons of the fatherland ready to sacrifice everything for it
the one thing that recalled the patriotic fervor everyone had displayed during the emperor s stay was the call for contributions of men and money  a necessity that as soon as the promises had been made assumed a legal  official form and became unavoidable
with the enemy s approach to moscow  the moscovites  view of their situation did not grow more serious but on the contrary became even more frivolous  as always happens with people who see a great danger approaching
at the approach of danger there are always two voices that speak with equal power in the human soul  one very reasonably tells a man to consider the nature of the danger and the means of escaping it  the other  still more reasonably  says that it is too depressing and painful to think of the danger  since it is not in man s power to foresee everything and avert the general course of events  and it is therefore better to disregard what is painful till it comes  and to think about what is pleasant
in solitude a man generally listens to the first voice  but in society to the second
so it was now with the inhabitants of moscow
it was long since people had been as gay in moscow as that year
rostopchin s broadsheets  headed by woodcuts of a drink shop  a potman  and a moscow burgher called karpushka chigirin   who having been a militiaman and having had rather too much at the pub heard that napoleon wished to come to moscow  grew angry  abused the french in very bad language  came out of the drink shop  and  under the sign of the eagle  began to address the assembled people   were read and discussed  together with the latest of vasili lvovich pushkin s bouts rimes
in the corner room at the club  members gathered to read these broadsheets  and some liked the way karpushka jeered at the french  saying   they will swell up with russian cabbage  burst with our buckwheat porridge  and choke themselves with cabbage soup they are all dwarfs and one peasant woman will toss three of them with a hayfork   others did not like that tone and said it was stupid and vulgar
it was said that rostopchin had expelled all frenchmen and even all foreigners from moscow  and that there had been some spies and agents of napoleon among them  but this was told chiefly to introduce rostopchin s witty remark on that occasion
the foreigners were deported to nizhni by boat  and rostopchin had said to them in french   rentrez en vousmemes  entrez dans la barque  et n en faites pas une barque de charon     there was talk of all the government offices having been already removed from moscow  and to this shinshin s witticism was added that for that alone moscow ought to be grateful to napoleon
it was said that mamonov s regiment would cost him eight hundred thousand rubles  and that bezukhov had spent even more on his  but that the best thing about bezukhov s action was that he himself was going to don a uniform and ride at the head of his regiment without charging anything for the show    think it over  get into the barque  and take care not to make it a barque of charon    you don t spare anyone   said julie drubetskaya as she collected and pressed together a bunch of raveled lint with her thin  beringed fingers
julie was preparing to leave moscow next day and was giving a farewell soiree
 bezukhov est ridicule  but he is so kind and good natured
what pleasure is there to be so caustique    a forfeit   cried a young man in militia uniform whom julie called  mon chevalier   and who was going with her to nizhni
in julie s set  as in many other circles in moscow  it had been agreed that they would speak nothing but russian and that those who made a slip and spoke french should pay fines to the committee of voluntary contributions
 another forfeit for a gallicism   said a russian writer who was present
  what pleasure is there to be  is not russian    you spare no one   continued julie to the young man without heeding the author s remark
 for caustique i am guilty and will pay  and i am prepared to pay again for the pleasure of telling you the truth
for gallicisms i won t be responsible   she remarked  turning to the author   i have neither the money nor the time  like prince galitsyn  to engage a master to teach me russian    ah  here he is   she added  quand on  
no  no   she said to the militia officer   you won t catch me
speak of the sun and you see its rays   and she smiled amiably at pierre
 we were just talking of you   she said with the facility in lying natural to a society woman
 we were saying that your regiment would be sure to be better than mamonov s    oh  don t talk to me of my regiment   replied pierre  kissing his hostess  hand and taking a seat beside her
 i am so sick of it    you will  of course  command it yourself   said julie  directing a sly  sarcastic glance toward the militia officer
the latter in pierre s presence had ceased to be caustic  and his face expressed perplexity as to what julie s smile might mean
in spite of his absentmindedness and good nature  pierre s personality immediately checked any attempt to ridicule him to his face
 no   said pierre  with a laughing glance at his big  stout body
 i should make too good a target for the french  besides i am afraid i should hardly be able to climb onto a horse   among those whom julie s guests happened to choose to gossip about were the rostovs
 i hear that their affairs are in a very bad way   said julie
 and he is so unreasonable  the count himself i mean the razumovskis wanted to buy his house and his estate near moscow  but it drags on and on
he asks too much    no  i think the sale will come off in a few days   said someone
 though it is madness to buy anything in moscow now    why   asked julie
 you don t think moscow is in danger    then why are you leaving    i  what a question  i am going because  
well  because everyone is going  and besides i am not joan of arc or an amazon    well  of course  of course  let me have some more strips of linen    if he manages the business properly he will be able to pay off all his debts   said the militia officer  speaking of rostov
 a kindly old man but not up to much
and why do they stay on so long in moscow  they meant to leave for the country long ago
natalie is quite well again now  isn t she   julie asked pierre with a knowing smile
 they are waiting for their younger son   pierre replied
 he joined obolenski s cossacks and went to belaya tserkov where the regiment is being formed
but now they have had him transferred to my regiment and are expecting him every day
the count wanted to leave long ago  but the countess won t on any account leave moscow till her son returns    i met them the day before yesterday at the arkharovs 
natalie has recovered her looks and is brighter
she sang a song
how easily some people get over everything    get over what   inquired pierre  looking displeased
julie smiled
 you know  count  such knights as you are only found in madame de souza s novels    what knights  what do you mean   demanded pierre  blushing
 oh  come  my dear count  c est la fable de tout moscou
je vous admire  ma parole d honneur        it is the talk of all moscow
my word  i admire you    forfeit  forfeit   cried the militia officer
 all right  one can t talk how tiresome    what is  the talk of all moscow    pierre asked angrily  rising to his feet
 come now  count  you know    i don t know anything about it   said pierre
 i know you were friendly with natalie  and so  
but i was always more friendly with vera that dear vera    no  madame   pierre continued in a tone of displeasure   i have not taken on myself the role of natalie rostova s knight at all  and have not been to their house for nearly a month
but i cannot understand the cruelty      qui s excuse s accuse     said julie  smiling and waving the lint triumphantly  and to have the last word she promptly changed the subject
 do you know what i heard today  poor mary bolkonskaya arrived in moscow yesterday
do you know that she has lost her father      who excuses himself  accuses himself    really  where is she  i should like very much to see her   said pierre  i spent the evening with her yesterday
she is going to their estate near moscow either today or tomorrow morning  with her nephew    well  and how is she   asked pierre
 she is well  but sad
but do you know who rescued her  it is quite a romance
nicholas rostov  she was surrounded  and they wanted to kill her and had wounded some of her people
he rushed in and saved her       another romance   said the militia officer
 really  this general flight has been arranged to get all the old maids married off
catiche is one and princess bolkonskaya another    do you know  i really believe she is un petit peu amoureuse du jeune homme        a little bit in love with the young man    forfeit  forfeit  forfeit    but how could one say that in russian   when pierre returned home he was handed two of rostopchin s broadsheets that had been brought that day
the first declared that the report that count rostopchin had forbidden people to leave moscow was false  on the contrary he was glad that ladies and tradesmen s wives were leaving the city
 there will be less panic and less gossip   ran the broadsheet  but i will stake my life on it that scoundrel will not enter moscow   these words showed pierre clearly for the first time that the french would enter moscow
the second broadsheet stated that our headquarters were at vyazma  that count wittgenstein had defeated the french  but that as many of the inhabitants of moscow wished to be armed  weapons were ready for them at the arsenal  sabers  pistols  and muskets which could be had at a low price
the tone of the proclamation was not as jocose as in the former chigirin talks
pierre pondered over these broadsheets
evidently the terrible stormcloud he had desired with the whole strength of his soul but which yet aroused involuntary horror in him was drawing near
 shall i join the army and enter the service  or wait   he asked himself for the hundredth time he took a pack of cards that lay on the table and began to lay them out for a game of patience
 if this patience comes out   he said to himself after shuffling the cards  holding them in his hand  and lifting his head   if it comes out  it means   what does it mean   he had not decided what it should mean when he heard the voice of the eldest princess at the door asking whether she might come in
 then it will mean that i must go to the army   said pierre to himself  come in  come in   he added to the princess
only the eldest princess  the one with the stony face and long waist  was still living in pierre s house
the two younger ones had both married
 excuse my coming to you  cousin   she said in a reproachful and agitated voice
 you know some decision must be come to
what is going to happen  everyone has left moscow and the people are rioting
how is it that we are staying on    on the contrary  things seem satisfactory  ma cousine   said pierre in the bantering tone he habitually adopted toward her  always feeling uncomfortable in the role of her benefactor
 satisfactory  indeed  very satisfactory  barbara ivanovna told me today how our troops are distinguishing themselves it certainly does them credit  and the people too are quite mutinous they no longer obey  even my maid has taken to being rude
at this rate they will soon begin beating us
one can t walk in the streets
but  above all  the french will be here any day now  so what are we waiting for  i ask just one thing of you  cousin   she went on   arrange for me to be taken to petersburg
whatever i may be  i can t live under bonaparte s rule    oh  come  ma cousine  where do you get your information from  on the contrary      i won t submit to your napoleon  others may if they please   
if you don t want to do this      but i will  i ll give the order at once   the princess was apparently vexed at not having anyone to be angry with
muttering to herself  she sat down on a chair
 but you have been misinformed   said pierre
 everything is quiet in the city and there is not the slightest danger
see  i ve just been reading     he showed her the broadsheet
 count rostopchin writes that he will stake his life on it that the enemy will not enter moscow    oh  that count of yours   said the princess malevolently
 he is a hypocrite  a rascal who has himself roused the people to riot didn t he write in those idiotic broadsheets that anyone   whoever it might be  should be dragged to the lockup by his hair    how silly    and honor and glory to whoever captures him   he says
this is what his cajolery has brought us to  barbara ivanovna told me the mob near killed her because she said something in french    oh  but it s so  
you take everything so to heart   said pierre  and began laying out his cards for patience
although that patience did come out  pierre did not join the army  but remained in deserted moscow ever in the same state of agitation  irresolution  and alarm  yet at the same time joyfully expecting something terrible
next day toward evening the princess set off  and pierre s head steward came to inform him that the money needed for the equipment of his regiment could not be found without selling one of the estates
in general the head steward made out to pierre that his project of raising a regiment would ruin him
pierre listened to him  scarcely able to repress a smile
 well then  sell it   said he
 what s to be done  i can t draw back now   the worse everything became  especially his own affairs  the better was pierre pleased and the more evident was it that the catastrophe he expected was approaching
hardly anyone he knew was left in town
julie had gone  and so had princess mary
of his intimate friends only the rostovs remained  but he did not go to see them
to distract his thoughts he drove that day to the village of vorontsovo to see the great balloon leppich was constructing to destroy the foe  and a trial balloon that was to go up next day
the balloon was not yet ready  but pierre learned that it was being constructed by the emperor s desire
the emperor had written to count rostopchin as follows  as soon as leppich is ready  get together a crew of reliable and intelligent men for his car and send a courier to general kutuzov to let him know
i have informed him of the matter
please impress upon leppich to be very careful where he descends for the first time  that he may not make a mistake and fall into the enemy s hands
it is essential for him to combine his movements with those of the commander inchief
on his way home from vorontsovo  as he was passing the bolotnoe place pierre  seeing a large crowd round the lobnoe place  stopped and got out of his trap
a french cook accused of being a spy was being flogged
the flogging was only just over  and the executioner was releasing from the flogging bench a stout man with red whiskers  in blue stockings and a green jacket  who was moaning piteously
another criminal  thin and pale  stood near
judging by their faces they were both frenchmen
with a frightened and suffering look resembling that on the thin frenchman s face  pierre pushed his way in through the crowd
 what is it  who is it  what is it for   he kept asking
but the attention of the crowd officials  burghers  shopkeepers  peasants  and women in cloaks and in pelisses was so eagerly centered on what was passing in lobnoe place that no one answered him
the stout man rose  frowned  shrugged his shoulders  and evidently trying to appear firm began to pull on his jacket without looking about him  but suddenly his lips trembled and he began to cry  in the way full blooded grown up men cry  though angry with himself for doing so in the crowd people began talking loudly  to stifle their feelings of pity as it seemed to pierre
 he s cook to some prince    eh  mounseer  russian sauce seems to be sour to a frenchman   sets his teeth on edge   said a wrinkled clerk who was standing behind pierre  when the frenchman began to cry
the clerk glanced round  evidently hoping that his joke would be appreciated
some people began to laugh  others continued to watch in dismay the executioner who was undressing the other man
pierre choked  his face puckered  and he turned hastily away  went back to his trap muttering something to himself as he went  and took his seat as they drove along he shuddered and exclaimed several times so audibly that the coachman asked him   what is your pleasure    where are you going   shouted pierre to the man  who was driving to lubyanka street
 to the governor s  as you ordered   answered the coachman
 fool  idiot   shouted pierre  abusing his coachman a thing he rarely did
 home  i told you  and drive faster  blockhead    i must get away this very day   he murmured to himself at the sight of the tortured frenchman and the crowd surrounding the lobnoe place  pierre had so definitely made up his mind that he could no longer remain in moscow and would leave for the army that very day that it seemed to him that either he had told the coachman this or that the man ought to have known it for himself on reaching home pierre gave orders to evstafey his head coachman who knew everything  could do anything  and was known to all moscow that he would leave that night for the army at mozhaysk  and that his saddle horses should be sent there
this could not all be arranged that day  so on evstafey s representation pierre had to put off his departure till next day to allow time for the relay horses to be sent on in advance
on the twenty fourth the weather cleared up after a spell of rain  and after dinner pierre left moscow
when changing horses that night in perkhushkovo  he learned that there had been a great battle that evening
 this was the battle of shevardino   he was told that there in perkhushkovo the earth trembled from the firing  but nobody could answer his questions as to who had won
at dawn next day pierre was approaching mozhaysk
every house in mozhaysk had soldiers quartered in it  and at the hostel where pierre was met by his groom and coachman there was no room to be had
it was full of officers
everywhere in mozhaysk and beyond it  troops were stationed or on the march
cossacks  foot and horse soldiers  wagons  caissons  and cannon were everywhere
pierre pushed forward as fast as he could  and the farther he left moscow behind and the deeper he plunged into that sea of troops the more was he overcome by restless agitation and a new and joyful feeling he had not experienced before
it was a feeling akin to what he had felt at the sloboda palace during the emperor s visit a sense of the necessity of undertaking something and sacrificing something
he now experienced a glad consciousness that everything that constitutes men s happiness the comforts of life  wealth  even life itself is rubbish it is pleasant to throw away  compared with something  
with what  pierre could not say  and he did not try to determine for whom and for what he felt such particular delight in sacrificing everything
he was not occupied with the question of what to sacrifice for  the fact of sacrificing in itself afforded him a new and joyous sensation
on the twenty fourth of august the battle of the shevardino redoubt was fought  on the twenty fifth not a shot was fired by either side  and on the twenty sixth the battle of borodino itself took place
why and how were the battles of shevardino and borodino given and accepted  why was the battle of borodino fought  there was not the least sense in it for either the french or the russians
its immediate result for the russians was  and was bound to be  that we were brought nearer to the destruction of moscow which we feared more than anything in the world  and for the french its immediate result was that they were brought nearer to the destruction of their whole army which they feared more than anything in the world
what the result must be was quite obvious  and yet napoleon offered and kutuzov accepted that battle
if the commanders had been guided by reason  it would seem that it must have been obvious to napoleon that by advancing thirteen hundred miles and giving battle with a probability of losing a quarter of his army  he was advancing to certain destruction  and it must have been equally clear to kutuzov that by accepting battle and risking the loss of a quarter of his army he would certainly lose moscow
for kutuzov this was mathematically clear  as it is that if when playing draughts i have one man less and go on exchanging  i shall certainly lose  and therefore should not exchange
when my opponent has sixteen men and i have fourteen  i am only one eighth weaker than he  but when i have exchanged thirteen more men he will be three times as strong as i am
before the battle of borodino our strength in proportion to the french was about as five to six  but after that battle it was little more than one to two  previously we had a hundred thousand against a hundred and twenty thousand  afterwards little more than fifty thousand against a hundred thousand
yet the shrewd and experienced kutuzov accepted the battle  while napoleon  who was said to be a commander of genius  gave it  losing a quarter of his army and lengthening his lines of communication still more
if it is said that he expected to end the campaign by occupying moscow as he had ended a previous campaign by occupying vienna  there is much evidence to the contrary
napoleon s historians themselves tell us that from smolensk onwards he wished to stop  knew the danger of his extended position  and knew that the occupation of moscow would not be the end of the campaign  for he had seen at smolensk the state in which russian towns were left to him  and had not received a single reply to his repeated announcements of his wish to negotiate in giving and accepting battle at borodino  kutuzov acted involuntarily and irrationally
but later on  to fit what had occurred  the historians provided cunningly devised evidence of the foresight and genius of the generals who  of all the blind tools of history were the most enslaved and involuntary
the ancients have left us model heroic poems in which the heroes furnish the whole interest of the story  and we are still unable to accustom ourselves to the fact that for our epoch histories of that kind are meaningless on the other question  how the battle of borodino and the preceding battle of shevardino were fought  there also exists a definite and well known  but quite false  conception
all the historians describe the affair as follows  the russian army  they say  in its retreat from smolensk sought out for itself the best position for a general engagement and found such a position at borodino
the russians  they say  fortified this position in advance on the left of the highroad  from moscow to smolensk  and almost at a right angle to it  from borodino to utitsa  at the very place where the battle was fought
in front of this position  they say  a fortified outpost was set up on the shevardino mound to observe the enemy
on the twenty fourth  we are told  napoleon attacked this advanced post and took it  and  on the twenty sixth  attacked the whole russian army  which was in position on the field of borodino
so the histories say  and it is all quite wrong  as anyone who cares to look into the matter can easily convince himself the russians did not seek out the best position but  on the contrary  during the retreat passed many positions better than borodino
they did not stop at any one of these positions because kutuzov did not wish to occupy a position he had not himself chosen  because the popular demand for a battle had not yet expressed itself strongly enough  and because miloradovich had not yet arrived with the militia  and for many other reasons the fact is that other positions they had passed were stronger  and that the position at borodino  the one where the battle was fought   far from being strong  was no more a position than any other spot one might find in the russian empire by sticking a pin into the map at hazard
not only did the russians not fortify the position on the field of borodino to the left of  and at a right angle to  the highroad  that is  the position on which the battle took place   but never till the twenty fifth of august  1812  did they think that a battle might be fought there
this was shown first by the fact that there were no entrenchments there by the twenty fifth and that those begun on the twenty fifth and twenty sixth were not completed  and secondly  by the position of the shevardino redoubt
that redoubt was quite senseless in front of the position where the battle was accepted
why was it more strongly fortified than any other post  and why were all efforts exhausted and six thousand men sacrificed to defend it till late at night on the twenty fourth  a cossack patrol would have sufficed to observe the enemy
thirdly  as proof that the position on which the battle was fought had not been foreseen and that the shevardino redoubt was not an advanced post of that position  we have the fact that up to the twenty fifth  barclay de tolly and bagration were convinced that the shevardino redoubt was the left flank of the position  and that kutuzov himself in his report  written in hot haste after the battle  speaks of the shevardino redoubt as the left flank of the position it was much later  when reports on the battle of borodino were written at leisure  that the incorrect and extraordinary statement was invented  probably to justify the mistakes of a commander in chief who had to be represented as infallible  that the shevardino redoubt was an advanced post whereas in reality it was simply a fortified point on the left flank and that the battle of borodino was fought by us on an entrenched position previously selected  where as it was fought on a quite unexpected spot which was almost unentrenched
the case was evidently this  a position was selected along the river kolocha  which crosses the highroad not at a right angle but at an acute angle so that the left flank was at shevardino  the right flank near the village of novoe  and the center at borodino at the confluence of the rivers kolocha and voyna
to anyone who looks at the field of borodino without thinking of how the battle was actually fought  this position  protected by the river kolocha  presents itself as obvious for an army whose object was to prevent an enemy from advancing along the smolensk road to moscow
napoleon  riding to valuevo on the twenty fourth  did not see  as the history could not have seen that position because it did not exist   nor did he see an advanced post of the russian army  but while pursuing the russian rearguard he came upon the left flank of the russian position at the shevardino redoubt and unexpectedly for the russians moved his army across the kolocha
and the russians  not having time to begin a general engagement  withdrew their left wing from the position they had intended to occupy and took up a new position which had not been foreseen and was not fortified
by crossing to the other side of the kolocha to the left of the highroad  napoleon shifted the whole forthcoming battle from right to left  looking from the russian side  and transferred it to the plain between utitsa  semenovsk  and borodino a plain no more advantageous as a position than any other plain in russia and there the whole battle of the twenty sixth of august took place
had napoleon not ridden out on the evening of the twenty fourth to the kolocha  and had he not then ordered an immediate attack on the redoubt but had begun the attack next morning  no one would have doubted that the shevardino redoubt was the left flank of our position  and the battle would have taken place where we expected it
in that case we should probably have defended the shevardino redoubt our left flank still more obstinately
we should have attacked napoleon in the center or on the right  and the engagement would have taken place on the twenty fifth  in the position we intended and had fortified
but as the attack on our left flank took place in the evening after the retreat of our rear guard  that is  immediately after the fight at gridneva   and as the russian commanders did not wish  or were not in time  to begin a general engagement then on the evening of the twenty fourth  the first and chief action of the battle of borodino was already lost on the twenty fourth  and obviously led to the loss of the one fought on the twentysixth
after the loss of the shevardino redoubt  we found ourselves on the morning of the twenty fifth without a position for our left flank  and were forced to bend it back and hastily entrench it where it chanced to be
not only was the russian army on the twenty sixth defended by weak  unfinished entrenchments  but the disadvantage of that position was increased by the fact that the russian commanders not having fully realized what had happened  namely the loss of our position on the left flank and the shifting of the whole field of the forthcoming battle from right to left maintained their extended position from the village of novoe to utitsa  and consequently had to move their forces from right to left during the battle
so it happened that throughout the whole battle the russians opposed the entire french army launched against our left flank with but half as many men
 poniatowski s action against utitsa  and uvarov s on the right flank against the french  were actions distinct from the main course of the battle   so the battle of borodino did not take place at all as  in an effort to conceal our commanders  mistakes even at the cost of diminishing the glory due to the russian army and people  it has been described
the battle of borodino was not fought on a chosen and entrenched position with forces only slightly weaker than those of the enemy  but  as a result of the loss of the shevardino redoubt  the russians fought the battle of borodino on an open and almost unentrenched position  with forces only half as numerous as the french  that is to say  under conditions in which it was not merely unthinkable to fight for ten hours and secure an indecisive result  but unthinkable to keep an army even from complete disintegration and flight
on the morning of the twenty fifth pierre was leaving mozhaysk
at the descent of the high steep hill  down which a winding road led out of the town past the cathedral on the right  where a service was being held and the bells were ringing  pierre got out of his vehicle and proceeded on foot
behind him a cavalry regiment was coming down the hill preceded by its singers
coming up toward him was a train of carts carrying men who had been wounded in the engagement the day before
the peasant drivers  shouting and lashing their horses  kept crossing from side to side
the carts  in each of which three or four wounded soldiers were lying or sitting  jolted over the stones that had been thrown on the steep incline to make it something like a road
the wounded  bandaged with rags  with pale cheeks  compressed lips  and knitted brows  held on to the sides of the carts as they were jolted against one another
almost all of them stared with naive  childlike curiosity at pierre s white hat and green swallow tail coat
pierre s coachman shouted angrily at the convoy of wounded to keep to one side of the road
the cavalry regiment  as it descended the hill with its singers  surrounded pierre s carriage and blocked the road
pierre stopped  being pressed against the side of the cutting in which the road ran
the sunshine from behind the hill did not penetrate into the cutting and there it was cold and damp  but above pierre s head was the bright august sunshine and the bells sounded merrily
one of the carts with wounded stopped by the side of the road close to pierre
the driver in his bast shoes ran panting up to it  placed a stone under one of its tireless hind wheels  and began arranging the breechband on his little horse
one of the wounded  an old soldier with a bandaged arm who was following the cart on foot  caught hold of it with his sound hand and turned to look at pierre
 i say  fellow countryman  will they set us down here or take us on to moscow   he asked
pierre was so deep in thought that he did not hear the question
he was looking now at the cavalry regiment that had met the convoy of wounded  now at the cart by which he was standing  in which two wounded men were sitting and one was lying
one of those sitting up in the cart had probably been wounded in the cheek
his whole head was wrapped in rags and one cheek was swollen to the size of a baby s head
his nose and mouth were twisted to one side
this soldier was looking at the cathedral and crossing himself another  a young lad  a fair haired recruit as white as though there was no blood in his thin face  looked at pierre kindly  with a fixed smile
the third lay prone so that his face was not visible
the cavalry singers were passing close by  ah lost  quite lost  
is my head so keen  living in a foreign land
they sang their soldiers  dance song
as if responding to them but with a different sort of merriment  the metallic sound of the bells reverberated high above and the hot rays of the sun bathed the top of the opposite slope with yet another sort of merriment
but beneath the slope  by the cart with the wounded near the panting little nag where pierre stood  it was damp  somber  and sad
the soldier with the swollen cheek looked angrily at the cavalry singers
 oh  the coxcombs   he muttered reproachfully
 it s not the soldiers only  but i ve seen peasants today  too   
the peasants  even they have to go   said the soldier behind the cart  addressing pierre with a sad smile
 no distinctions made nowadays   
they want the whole nation to fall on them in a word  it s moscow  they want to make an end of it   in spite of the obscurity of the soldier s words pierre understood what he wanted to say and nodded approval
the road was clear again  pierre descended the hill and drove on
he kept looking to either side of the road for familiar faces  but only saw everywhere the unfamiliar faces of various military men of different branches of the service  who all looked with astonishment at his white hat and green tail coat
having gone nearly three miles he at last met an acquaintance and eagerly addressed him
this was one of the head army doctors
he was driving toward pierre in a covered gig  sitting beside a young surgeon  and on recognizing pierre he told the cossack who occupied the driver s seat to pull up
 count  your excellency  how come you to be here   asked the doctor
 well  you know  i wanted to see      yes  yes  there will be something to see      pierre got out and talked to the doctor  explaining his intention of taking part in a battle
the doctor advised him to apply direct to kutuzov
 why should you be god knows where out of sight  during the battle   he said  exchanging glances with his young companion
 anyhow his serene highness knows you and will receive you graciously
that s what you must do   the doctor seemed tired and in a hurry
 you think so   
ah  i also wanted to ask you where our position is exactly   said pierre
 the position   repeated the doctor
 well  that s not my line
drive past tatarinova  a lot of digging is going on there
go up the hillock and you ll see    can one see from there   
if you would     but the doctor interrupted him and moved toward his gig
 i would go with you but on my honor i m up to here  and he pointed to his throat
 i m galloping to the commander of the corps
how do matters stand   
you know  count  there ll be a battle tomorrow
out of an army of a hundred thousand we must expect at least twenty thousand wounded  and we haven t stretchers  or bunks  or dressers  or doctors enough for six thousand we have ten thousand carts  but we need other things as well we must manage as best we can   the strange thought that of the thousands of men  young and old  who had stared with merry surprise at his hat  perhaps the very men he had noticed   twenty thousand were inevitably doomed to wounds and death amazed pierre
 they may die tomorrow  why are they thinking of anything but death   and by some latent sequence of thought the descent of the mozhaysk hill  the carts with the wounded  the ringing bells  the slanting rays of the sun  and the songs of the cavalrymen vividly recurred to his mind
 the cavalry ride to battle and meet the wounded and do not for a moment think of what awaits them  but pass by  winking at the wounded
yet from among these men twenty thousand are doomed to die  and they wonder at my hat  strange   thought pierre  continuing his way to tatarinova
in front of a landowner s house to the left of the road stood carriages  wagons  and crowds of orderlies and sentinels
the commander in chief was putting up there  but just when pierre arrived he was not in and hardly any of the staff were there they had gone to the church service
pierre drove on toward gorki
when he had ascended the hill and reached the little village street  he saw for the first time peasant militiamen in their white shirts and with crosses on their caps  who  talking and laughing loudly  animated and perspiring  were at work on a huge knoll overgrown with grass to the right of the road
some of them were digging  others were wheeling barrowloads of earth along planks  while others stood about doing nothing
two officers were standing on the knoll  directing the men
on seeing these peasants  who were evidently still amused by the novelty of their position as soldiers  pierre once more thought of the wounded men at mozhaysk and understood what the soldier had meant when he said   they want the whole nation to fall on them   the sight of these bearded peasants at work on the battlefield  with their queer  clumsy boots and perspiring necks  and their shirts opening from the left toward the middle  unfastened  exposing their sunburned collarbones  impressed pierre more strongly with the solemnity and importance of the moment than anything he had yet seen or heard pierre stepped out of his carriage and  passing the toiling militiamen  ascended the knoll from which  according to the doctor  the battlefield could be seen
it was about eleven o clock
the sun shone somewhat to the left and behind him and brightly lit up the enormous panorama which  rising like an amphitheater  extended before him in the clear rarefied atmosphere
from above on the left  bisecting that amphitheater  wound the smolensk highroad  passing through a village with a white church some five hundred paces in front of the knoll and below it
this was borodino
below the village the road crossed the river by a bridge and  winding down and up  rose higher and higher to the village of valuevo visible about four miles away  where napoleon was then stationed
beyond valuevo the road disappeared into a yellowing forest on the horizon
far in the distance in that birch and fir forest to the right of the road  the cross and belfry of the kolocha monastery gleamed in the sun
here and there over the whole of that blue expanse  to right and left of the forest and the road  smoking campfires could be seen and indefinite masses of troops ours and the enemy s
the ground to the right  along the course of the kolocha and moskva rivers was broken and hilly
between the hollows the villages of bezubova and zakharino showed in the distance
on the left the ground was more level  there were fields of grain  and the smoking ruins of semenovsk  which had been burned down  could be seen
all that pierre saw was so indefinite that neither the left nor the right side of the field fully satisfied his expectations
nowhere could he see the battlefield he had expected to find  but only fields  meadows  troops  woods  the smoke of campfires  villages  mounds  and streams  and try as he would he could descry no military  position  in this place which teemed with life  nor could he even distinguish our troops from the enemy s  i must ask someone who knows   he thought  and addressed an officer who was looking with curiosity at his huge unmilitary figure
 may i ask you   said pierre   what village that is in front    burdino  isn t it   said the officer  turning to his companion
 borodino   the other corrected him
the officer  evidently glad of an opportunity for a talk  moved up to pierre
 are those our men there   pierre inquired
 yes  and there  further on  are the french   said the officer
 there they are  there  
you can see them    where  where   asked pierre
 one can see them with the naked eye  
why  there   the officer pointed with his hand to the smoke visible on the left beyond the river  and the same stern and serious expression that pierre had noticed on many of the faces he had met came into his face
 ah  those are the french  and over there      pierre pointed to a knoll on the left  near which some troops could be seen
 those are ours    ah  ours  and there      pierre pointed to another knoll in the distance with a big tree on it  near a village that lay in a hollow where also some campfires were smoking and something black was visible
 that s his again   said the officer
 it was the shevardino redoubt    it was ours yesterday  but now it is his    then how about our position    our position   replied the officer with a smile of satisfaction
 i can tell you quite clearly  because i constructed nearly all our entrenchments
there  you see  there s our center  at borodino  just there   and he pointed to the village in front of them with the white church
 that s where one crosses the kolocha
you see down there where the rows of hay are lying in the hollow  there s the bridge
that s our center
our right flank is over there  he pointed sharply to the right  far away in the broken ground  that s where the moskva river is  and we have thrown up three redoubts there  very strong ones
the left flank     here the officer paused
 well  you see  that s difficult to explain   
yesterday our left flank was there at shevardino  you see  where the oak is  but now we have withdrawn our left wing now it is over there  do you see that village and the smoke  that s semenovsk  yes  there   he pointed to raevski s knoll
 but the battle will hardly be there
his having moved his troops there is only a ruse  he will probably pass round to the right of the moskva
but wherever it may be  many a man will be missing tomorrow   he remarked
an elderly sergeant who had approached the officer while he was giving these explanations had waited in silence for him to finish speaking  but at this point  evidently not liking the officer s remark  interrupted him
 gabions must be sent for   said he sternly
the officer appeared abashed  as though he understood that one might think of how many men would be missing tomorrow but ought not to speak of it
 well  send number three company again   the officer replied hurriedly
 and you  are you one of the doctors    no  i ve come on my own   answered pierre  and he went down the hill again  passing the militiamen
 oh  those damned fellows   muttered the officer who followed him  holding his nose as he ran past the men at work
 there they are  
bringing her  coming  
there they are  
they ll be here in a minute     voices were suddenly heard saying  and officers  soldiers  and militiamen began running forward along the road
a church procession was coming up the hill from borodino
first along the dusty road came the infantry in ranks  bareheaded and with arms reversed from behind them came the sound of church singing
soldiers and militiamen ran bareheaded past pierre toward the procession
 they are bringing her  our protectress   
the iberian mother of god   someone cried
 the smolensk mother of god   another corrected him
the militiamen  both those who had been in the village and those who had been at work on the battery  threw down their spades and ran to meet the church procession
following the battalion that marched along the dusty road came priests in their vestments one little old man in a hood with attendants and singers
behind them soldiers and officers bore a large  dark faced icon with an embossed metal cover
this was the icon that had been brought from smolensk and had since accompanied the army
behind  before  and on both sides  crowds of militiamen with bared heads walked  ran  and bowed to the ground
at the summit of the hill they stopped with the icon  the men who had been holding it up by the linen bands attached to it were relieved by others  the chanters relit their censers  and service began
the hot rays of the sun beat down vertically and a fresh soft wind played with the hair of the bared heads and with the ribbons decorating the icon
the singing did not sound loud under the open sky
an immense crowd of bareheaded officers  soldiers  and militiamen surrounded the icon
behind the priest and a chanter stood the notabilities on a spot reserved for them
a bald general with a st
george s cross on his neck stood just behind the priest s back  and without crossing himself  he was evidently a german  patiently awaited the end of the service  which he considered it necessary to hear to the end  probably to arouse the patriotism of the russian people another general stood in a martial pose  crossing himself by shaking his hand in front of his chest while looking about him standing among the crowd of peasants  pierre recognized several acquaintances among these notables  but did not look at them his whole attention was absorbed in watching the serious expression on the faces of the crowd of soldiers and militiamen who were all gazing eagerly at the icon
as soon as the tired chanters  who were singing the service for the twentieth time that day  began lazily and mechanically to sing   save from calamity thy servants  o mother of god   and the priest and deacon chimed in   for to thee under god we all flee as to an inviolable bulwark and protection   there again kindled in all those faces the same expression of consciousness of the solemnity of the impending moment that pierre had seen on the faces at the foot of the hill at mozhaysk and momentarily on many and many faces he had met that morning  and heads were bowed more frequently and hair tossed back  and sighs and the sound men made as they crossed themselves were heard the crowd round the icon suddenly parted and pressed against pierre
someone  a very important personage judging by the haste with which way was made for him  was approaching the icon
it was kutuzov  who had been riding round the position and on his way back to tatarinova had stopped where the service was being held
pierre recognized him at once by his peculiar figure  which distinguished him from everybody else
with a long overcoat on his exceedingly stout  round shouldered body  with uncovered white head and puffy face showing the white ball of the eye he had lost  kutuzov walked with plunging  swaying gait into the crowd and stopped behind the priest
he crossed himself with an accustomed movement  bent till he touched the ground with his hand  and bowed his white head with a deep sigh behind kutuzov was bennigsen and the suite
despite the presence of the commander in chief  who attracted the attention of all the superior officers  the militiamen and soldiers continued their prayers without looking at him
when the service was over  kutuzov stepped up to the icon  sank heavily to his knees  bowed to the ground  and for a long time tried vainly to rise  but could not do so on account of his weakness and weight
his white head twitched with the effort
at last he rose  kissed the icon as a child does with naively pouting lips  and again bowed till he touched the ground with his hand
the other generals followed his example  then the officers  and after them with excited faces  pressing on one another  crowding  panting  and pushing  scrambled the soldiers and militiamen
staggering amid the crush  pierre looked about him
 count peter kirilovich  how did you get here   said a voice
pierre looked round
boris drubetskoy  brushing his knees with his hand  he had probably soiled them when he  too  had knelt before the icon   came up to him smiling
boris was elegantly dressed  with a slightly martial touch appropriate to a campaign
he wore a long coat and like kutuzov had a whip slung across his shoulder
meanwhile kutuzov had reached the village and seated himself in the shade of the nearest house  on a bench which one cossack had run to fetch and another had hastily covered with a rug an immense and brilliant suite surrounded him the icon was carried further  accompanied by the throng
pierre stopped some thirty paces from kutuzov  talking to boris
he explained his wish to be present at the battle and to see the position
 this is what you must do   said boris
 i will do the honors of the camp to you
you will see everything best from where count bennigsen will be
i am in attendance on him  you know  i ll mention it to him
but if you want to ride round the position  come along with us
we are just going to the left flank
then when we get back  do spend the night with me and we ll arrange a game of cards
of course you know dmitri sergeevich  those are his quarters   and he pointed to the third house in the village of gorki
 but i should like to see the right flank
they say it s very strong   said pierre
 i should like to start from the moskva river and ride round the whole position    well  you can do that later  but the chief thing is the left flank    yes  yes
but where is prince bolkonski s regiment  can you point it out to me    prince andrew s  we shall pass it and i ll take you to him    what about the left flank   asked pierre  to tell you the truth  between ourselves  god only knows what state our left flank is in   said boris confidentially lowering his voice
 it is not at all what count bennigsen intended
he meant to fortify that knoll quite differently  but     boris shrugged his shoulders   his serene highness would not have it  or someone persuaded him
you see     but boris did not finish  for at that moment kaysarov  kutuzov s adjutant  came up to pierre
 ah  kaysarov   said boris  addressing him with an unembarrassed smile   i was just trying to explain our position to the count
it is amazing how his serene highness could so foresee the intentions of the french    you mean the left flank   asked kaysarov
 yes  exactly  the left flank is now extremely strong   though kutuzov had dismissed all unnecessary men from the staff  boris had contrived to remain at headquarters after the changes
he had established himself with count bennigsen  who  like all on whom boris had been in attendance  considered young prince drubetskoy an invaluable man in the higher command there were two sharply defined parties  kutuzov s party and that of bennigsen  the chief of staff
boris belonged to the latter and no one else  while showing servile respect to kutuzov  could so create an impression that the old fellow was not much good and that bennigsen managed everything
now the decisive moment of battle had come when kutuzov would be destroyed and the power pass to bennigsen  or even if kutuzov won the battle it would be felt that everything was done by bennigsen
in any case many great rewards would have to be given for tomorrow s action  and new men would come to the front
so boris was full of nervous vivacity all day
after kaysarov  others whom pierre knew came up to him  and he had not time to reply to all the questions about moscow that were showered upon him  or to listen to all that was told him
the faces all expressed animation and apprehension  but it seemed to pierre that the cause of the excitement shown in some of these faces lay chiefly in questions of personal success  his mind  however  was occupied by the different expression he saw on other faces an expression that spoke not of personal matters but of the universal questions of life and death
kutuzov noticed pierre s figure and the group gathered round him
 call him to me   said kutuzov
an adjutant told pierre of his serene highness  wish  and pierre went toward kutuzov s bench
but a militiaman got there before him
it was dolokhov
 how did that fellow get here   asked pierre
 he s a creature that wriggles in anywhere   was the answer
 he has been degraded  you know
now he wants to bob up again
he s been proposing some scheme or other and has crawled into the enemy s picket line at night   
he s a brave fellow   pierre took off his hat and bowed respectfully to kutuzov
 i concluded that if i reported to your serene highness you might send me away or say that you knew what i was reporting  but then i shouldn t lose anything     dolokhov was saying
 yes  yes    but if i were right  i should be rendering a service to my fatherland for which i am ready to die    yes  yes    and should your serene highness require a man who will not spare his skin  please think of me   
perhaps i may prove useful to your serene highness    yes  
yes     kutuzov repeated  his laughing eye narrowing more and more as he looked at pierre
just then boris  with his courtierlike adroitness  stepped up to pierre s side near kutuzov and in a most natural manner  without raising his voice  said to pierre  as though continuing an interrupted conversation   the militia have put on clean white shirts to be ready to die
what heroism  count   boris evidently said this to pierre in order to be overheard by his serene highness
he knew kutuzov s attention would be caught by those words  and so it was
 what are you saying about the militia   he asked boris
 preparing for tomorrow  your serene highness for death they have put on clean shirts    ah  
a wonderful  a matchless people   said kutuzov  and he closed his eyes and swayed his head
 a matchless people   he repeated with a sigh
 so you want to smell gunpowder   he said to pierre
 yes  it s a pleasant smell
i have the honor to be one of your wife s adorers
is she well  my quarters are at your service   and as often happens with old people  kutuzov began looking about absentmindedly as if forgetting all he wanted to say or do
then  evidently remembering what he wanted  he beckoned to andrew kaysarov  his adjutant s brother
 those verses  
those verses of marin s  
how do they go  eh  those he wrote about gerakov   lectures for the corps inditing   
recite them  recite them   said he  evidently preparing to laugh
kaysarov recited   
kutuzov smilingly nodded his head to the rhythm of the verses
when pierre had left kutuzov  dolokhov came up to him and took his hand
 i am very glad to meet you here  count   he said aloud  regardless of the presence of strangers and in a particularly resolute and solemn tone
 on the eve of a day when god alone knows who of us is fated to survive  i am glad of this opportunity to tell you that i regret the misunderstandings that occurred between us and should wish you not to have any ill feeling for me
i beg you to forgive me   pierre looked at dolokhov with a smile  not knowing what to say to him
with tears in his eyes dolokhov embraced pierre and kissed him
boris said a few words to his general  and count bennigsen turned to pierre and proposed that he should ride with him along the line
 it will interest you   said he
 yes  very much   replied pierre
half an hour later kutuzov left for tatarinova  and bennigsen and his suite  with pierre among them  set out on their ride along the line
from gorki  bennigsen descended the highroad to the bridge which  when they had looked at it from the hill  the officer had pointed out as being the center of our position and where rows of fragrant new mown hay lay by the riverside
they rode across that bridge into the village of borodino and thence turned to the left  passing an enormous number of troops and guns  and came to a high knoll where militiamen were digging
this was the redoubt  as yet unnamed  which afterwards became known as the raevski redoubt  or the knoll battery  but pierre paid no special attention to it
he did not know that it would become more memorable to him than any other spot on the plain of borodino
they then crossed the hollow to semenovsk  where the soldiers were dragging away the last logs from the huts and barns
then they rode downhill and uphill  across a ryefield trodden and beaten down as if by hail  following a track freshly made by the artillery over the furrows of the plowed land  and reached some fleches   which were still being dug
  a kind of entrenchment
at the fleches bennigsen stopped and began looking at the shevardino redoubt opposite  which had been ours the day before and where several horsemen could be descried
the officers said that either napoleon or murat was there  and they all gazed eagerly at this little group of horsemen
pierre also looked at them  trying to guess which of the scarcely discernible figures was napoleon
at last those mounted men rode away from the mound and disappeared
bennigsen spoke to a general who approached him  and began explaining the whole position of our troops
pierre listened to him  straining each faculty to understand the essential points of the impending battle  but was mortified to feel that his mental capacity was inadequate for the task
he could make nothing of it
bennigsen stopped speaking and  noticing that pierre was listening  suddenly said to him   i don t think this interests you    on the contrary it s very interesting   replied pierre not quite truthfully
from the fleches they rode still farther to the left  along a road winding through a thick  low growing birch wood
in the middle of the wood a brown hare with white feet sprang out and  scared by the tramp of the many horses  grew so confused that it leaped along the road in front of them for some time  arousing general attention and laughter  and only when several voices shouted at it did it dart to one side and disappear in the thicket
after going through the wood for about a mile and a half they came out on a glade where troops of tuchkov s corps were stationed to defend the left flank
here  at the extreme left flank  bennigsen talked a great deal and with much heat  and  as it seemed to pierre  gave orders of great military importance
in front of tuchkov s troops was some high ground not occupied by troops
bennigsen loudly criticized this mistake  saying that it was madness to leave a height which commanded the country around unoccupied and to place troops below it
some of the generals expressed the same opinion
one in particular declared with martial heat that they were put there to be slaughtered
bennigsen on his own authority ordered the troops to occupy the high ground
this disposition on the left flank increased pierre s doubt of his own capacity to understand military matters
listening to bennigsen and the generals criticizing the position of the troops behind the hill  he quite understood them and shared their opinion  but for that very reason he could not understand how the man who put them there behind the hill could have made so gross and palpable a blunder
pierre did not know that these troops were not  as bennigsen supposed  put there to defend the position  but were in a concealed position as an ambush  that they should not be seen and might be able to strike an approaching enemy unexpectedly
bennigsen did not know this and moved the troops forward according to his own ideas without mentioning the matter to the commanderin chief
on that bright evening of august 25  prince andrew lay leaning on his elbow in a broken down shed in the village of knyazkovo at the further end of his regiment s encampment
through a gap in the broken wall he could see  beside the wooden fence  a row of thirty year old birches with their lower branches lopped off  a field on which shocks of oats were standing  and some bushes near which rose the smoke of campfires the soldiers  kitchens
narrow and burdensome and useless to anyone as his life now seemed to him  prince andrew on the eve of battle felt agitated and irritable as he had done seven years before at austerlitz
he had received and given the orders for next day s battle and had nothing more to do
but his thoughts the simplest  clearest  and therefore most terrible thoughts would give him no peace
he knew that tomorrow s battle would be the most terrible of all he had taken part in  and for the first time in his life the possibility of death presented itself to him not in relation to any worldly matter or with reference to its effect on others  but simply in relation to himself  to his own soul vividly  plainly  terribly  and almost as a certainty and from the height of this perception all that had previously tormented and preoccupied him suddenly became illumined by a cold white light without shadows  without perspective  without distinction of outline
all life appeared to him like magic lantern pictures at which he had long been gazing by artificial light through a glass
now he suddenly saw those badly daubed pictures in clear daylight and without a glass
 yes  yes  there they are  those false images that agitated  enraptured  and tormented me   said he to himself  passing in review the principal pictures of the magic lantern of life and regarding them now in the cold white daylight of his clear perception of death  there they are  those rudely painted figures that once seemed splendid and mysterious
glory  the good of society  love of a woman  the fatherland itself  how important these pictures appeared to me  with what profound meaning they seemed to be filled  and it is all so simple  pale  and crude in the cold white light of this morning which i feel is dawning for me   the three great sorrows of his life held his attention in particular  his love for a woman  his father s death  and the french invasion which had overrun half russia
 love  
that little girl who seemed to me brimming over with mystic forces  yes  indeed  i loved her
i made romantic plans of love and happiness with her  oh  what a boy i was   he said aloud bitterly
 ah me  i believed in some ideal love which was to keep her faithful to me for the whole year of my absence  like the gentle dove in the fable she was to pine apart from me   
but it was much simpler really   
it was all very simple and horrible    when my father built bald hills he thought the place was his  his land  his air  his peasants
but napoleon came and swept him aside  unconscious of his existence  as he might brush a chip from his path  and his bald hills and his whole life fell to pieces
princess mary says it is a trial sent from above
what is the trial for  when he is not here and will never return  he is not here  for whom then is the trial intended  the fatherland  the destruction of moscow  and tomorrow i shall be killed  perhaps not even by a frenchman but by one of our own men  by a soldier discharging a musket close to my ear as one of them did yesterday  and the french will come and take me by head and heels and fling me into a hole that i may not stink under their noses  and new conditions of life will arise  which will seem quite ordinary to others and about which i shall know nothing
i shall not exist     he looked at the row of birches shining in the sunshine  with their motionless green and yellow foliage and white bark
 to die  
to be killed tomorrow  
that i should not exist  
that all this should still be  but no me      and the birches with their light and shade  the curly clouds  the smoke of the campfires  and all that was around him changed and seemed terrible and menacing
a cold shiver ran down his spine
he rose quickly  went out of the shed  and began to walk about
after he had returned  voices were heard outside the shed
 who s that   he cried
the red nosed captain timokhin  formerly dolokhov s squadron commander  but now from lack of officers a battalion commander  shyly entered the shed followed by an adjutant and the regimental paymaster
prince andrew rose hastily  listened to the business they had come about  gave them some further instructions  and was about to dismiss them when he heard a familiar  lisping  voice behind the shed
 devil take it   said the voice of a man stumbling over something
prince andrew looked out of the shed and saw pierre  who had tripped over a pole on the ground and had nearly fallen  coming his way
it was unpleasant to prince andrew to meet people of his own set in general  and pierre especially  for he reminded him of all the painful moments of his last visit to moscow
 you  what a surprise   said he
 what brings you here  this is unexpected   as he said this his eyes and face expressed more than coldness they expressed hostility  which pierre noticed at once
he had approached the shed full of animation  but on seeing prince andrew s face he felt constrained and ill at ease
 i have come  
simply  
you know  
come  
it interests me   said pierre  who had so often that day senselessly repeated that word  interesting    i wish to see the battle    oh yes  and what do the masonic brothers say about war  how would they stop it   said prince andrew sarcastically
 well  and how s moscow  and my people  have they reached moscow at last   he asked seriously
 yes  they have
julie drubetskaya told me so
i went to see them  but missed them
they have gone to your estate near moscow   the officers were about to take leave  but prince andrew  apparently reluctant to be left alone with his friend  asked them to stay and have tea
seats were brought in and so was the tea
the officers gazed with surprise at pierre s huge stout figure and listened to his talk of moscow and the position of our army  round which he had ridden
prince andrew remained silent  and his expression was so forbidding that pierre addressed his remarks chiefly to the goodnatured battalion commander
 so you understand the whole position of our troops   prince andrew interrupted him
 yes that is  how do you mean   said pierre
 not being a military man i can t say i have understood it fully  but i understand the general position    well  then  you know more than anyone else  be it who it may   said prince andrew
 oh   said pierre  looking over his spectacles in perplexity at prince andrew
 well  and what do you think of kutuzov s appointment   he asked
 i was very glad of his appointment  that s all i know   replied prince andrew
 and tell me your opinion of barclay de tolly
in moscow they are saying heaven knows what about him   
what do you think of him    ask them   replied prince andrew  indicating the officers
pierre looked at timokhin with the condescendingly interrogative smile with which everybody involuntarily addressed that officer
 we see light again  since his serenity has been appointed  your excellency   said timokhin timidly  and continually turning to glance at his colonel
 why so   asked pierre
 well  to mention only firewood and fodder  let me inform you
why  when we were retreating from sventsyani we dare not touch a stick or a wisp of hay or anything
you see  we were going away  so he would get it all  wasn t it so  your excellency   and again timokhin turned to the prince
 but we daren t
in our regiment two officers were court martialed for that kind of thing
but when his serenity took command everything became straight forward
now we see light      then why was it forbidden   timokhin looked about in confusion  not knowing what or how to answer such a question
pierre put the same question to prince andrew
 why  so as not to lay waste the country we were abandoning to the enemy   said prince andrew with venomous irony
 it is very sound  one can t permit the land to be pillaged and accustom the troops to marauding
at smolensk too he judged correctly that the french might outflank us  as they had larger forces
but he could not understand this   cried prince andrew in a shrill voice that seemed to escape him involuntarily   he could not understand that there  for the first time  we were fighting for russian soil  and that there was a spirit in the men such as i had never seen before  that we had held the french for two days  and that that success had increased our strength tenfold
he ordered us to retreat  and all our efforts and losses went for nothing
he had no thought of betraying us  he tried to do the best he could  he thought out everything  and that is why he is unsuitable
he is unsuitable now  just because he plans out everything very thoroughly and accurately as every german has to
how can i explain   
well  say your father has a german valet  and he is a splendid valet and satisfies your father s requirements better than you could  then it s all right to let him serve
but if your father is mortally sick you ll send the valet away and attend to your father with your own unpracticed  awkward hands  and will soothe him better than a skilled man who is a stranger could
so it has been with barclay
while russia was well  a foreigner could serve her and be a splendid minister  but as soon as she is in danger she needs one of her own kin
but in your club they have been making him out a traitor  they slander him as a traitor  and the only result will be that afterwards  ashamed of their false accusations  they will make him out a hero or a genius instead of a traitor  and that will be still more unjust
he is an honest and very punctilious german    and they say he s a skillful commander   rejoined pierre
 i don t understand what is meant by  a skillful commander    replied prince andrew ironically
 a skillful commander   replied pierre
 why  one who foresees all contingencies  
and foresees the adversary s intentions    but that s impossible   said prince andrew as if it were a matter settled long ago
pierre looked at him in surprise
 and yet they say that war is like a game of chess   he remarked
 yes   replied prince andrew   but with this little difference  that in chess you may think over each move as long as you please and are not limited for time  and with this difference too  that a knight is always stronger than a pawn  and two pawns are always stronger than one  while in war a battalion is sometimes stronger than a division and sometimes weaker than a company
the relative strength of bodies of troops can never be known to anyone
believe me   he went on   if things depended on arrangements made by the staff  i should be there making arrangements  but instead of that i have the honor to serve here in the regiment with these gentlemen  and i consider that on us tomorrow s battle will depend and not on those others   
success never depends  and never will depend  on position  or equipment  or even on numbers  and least of all on position    but on what then    on the feeling that is in me and in him   he pointed to timokhin   and in each soldier   prince andrew glanced at timokhin  who looked at his commander in alarm and bewilderment
in contrast to his former reticent taciturnity prince andrew now seemed excited
he could apparently not refrain from expressing the thoughts that had suddenly occurred to him
 a battle is won by those who firmly resolve to win it  why did we lose the battle at austerlitz  the french losses were almost equal to ours  but very early we said to ourselves that we were losing the battle  and we did lose it
and we said so because we had nothing to fight for there  we wanted to get away from the battlefield as soon as we could
 we ve lost  so let us run   and we ran
if we had not said that till the evening  heaven knows what might not have happened
but tomorrow we shan t say it  you talk about our position  the left flank weak and the right flank too extended   he went on
 that s all nonsense  there s nothing of the kind
but what awaits us tomorrow  a hundred million most diverse chances which will be decided on the instant by the fact that our men or theirs run or do not run  and that this man or that man is killed  but all that is being done at present is only play
the fact is that those men with whom you have ridden round the position not only do not help matters  but hinder
they are only concerned with their own petty interests    at such a moment   said pierre reproachfully
 at such a moment   prince andrew repeated
 to them it is only a moment affording opportunities to undermine a rival and obtain an extra cross or ribbon
for me tomorrow means this  a russian army of a hundred thousand and a french army of a hundred thousand have met to fight  and the thing is that these two hundred thousand men will fight and the side that fights more fiercely and spares itself least will win
and if you like i will tell you that whatever happens and whatever muddles those at the top may make  we shall win tomorrow s battle
tomorrow  happen what may  we shall win    there now  your excellency  that s the truth  the real truth   said timokhin
 who would spare himself now  the soldiers in my battalion  believe me  wouldn t drink their vodka   it s not the day for that   they say   all were silent the officers rose
prince andrew went out of the shed with them  giving final orders to the adjutant
after they had gone pierre approached prince andrew and was about to start a conversation when they heard the clatter of three horses  hoofs on the road not far from the shed  and looking in that direction prince andrew recognized wolzogen and clausewitz accompanied by a cossack
they rode close by continuing to converse  and prince andrew involuntarily heard these words   der krieg muss in raum verlegt werden
der ansicht kann ich nicht genug preis geben     said one of them
   the war must be extended widely
i cannot sufficiently commend that view    oh  ja   said the other   der zweck ist nur den feind zu schwächen  so kann man gewiss nicht den verlust der privat personen in achtung nehmen        oh  yes  the only aim is to weaken the enemy  so of course one cannot take into account the loss of private individuals    oh  no   agreed the other
 extend widely   said prince andrew with an angry snort  when they had ridden past
 in that  extend  were my father  son  and sister  at bald hills
that s all the same to him  that s what i was saying to you those german gentlemen won t win the battle tomorrow but will only make all the mess they can  because they have nothing in their german heads but theories not worth an empty eggshell and haven t in their hearts the one thing needed tomorrow  that which timokhin has
they have yielded up all europe to him  and have now come to teach us
fine teachers   and again his voice grew shrill
 so you think we shall win tomorrow s battle   asked pierre
 yes  yes   answered prince andrew absently
 one thing i would do if i had the power   he began again   i would not take prisoners
why take prisoners  it s chivalry  the french have destroyed my home and are on their way to destroy moscow  they have outraged and are outraging me every moment
they are my enemies
in my opinion they are all criminals
and so thinks timokhin and the whole army
they should be executed  since they are my foes they cannot be my friends  whatever may have been said at tilsit    yes  yes   muttered pierre  looking with shining eyes at prince andrew
 i quite agree with you   the question that had perturbed pierre on the mozhaysk hill and all that day now seemed to him quite clear and completely solved
he now understood the whole meaning and importance of this war and of the impending battle
all he had seen that day  all the significant and stern expressions on the faces he had seen in passing  were lit up for him by a new light
he understood that latent heat  as they say in physics  of patriotism which was present in all these men he had seen  and this explained to him why they all prepared for death calmly  and as it were lightheartedly
 not take prisoners   prince andrew continued   that by itself would quite change the whole war and make it less cruel
as it is we have played at war  that s what s vile  we play at magnanimity and all that stuff
such magnanimity and sensibility are like the magnanimity and sensibility of a lady who faints when she sees a calf being killed  she is so kindhearted that she can t look at blood  but enjoys eating the calf served up with sauce
they talk to us of the rules of war  of chivalry  of flags of truce  of mercy to the unfortunate and so on
it s all rubbish  i saw chivalry and flags of truce in 1805  they humbugged us and we humbugged them
they plunder other people s houses  issue false paper money  and worst of all they kill my children and my father  and then talk of rules of war and magnanimity to foes  take no prisoners  but kill and be killed  he who has come to this as i have through the same sufferings     prince andrew  who had thought it was all the same to him whether or not moscow was taken as smolensk had been  was suddenly checked in his speech by an unexpected cramp in his throat
he paced up and down a few times in silence  but his eyes glittered feverishly and his lips quivered as he began speaking
 if there was none of this magnanimity in war  we should go to war only when it was worth while going to certain death  as now
then there would not be war because paul ivanovich had offended michael ivanovich
and when there was a war  like this one  it would be war  and then the determination of the troops would be quite different
then all these westphalians and hessians whom napoleon is leading would not follow him into russia  and we should not go to fight in austria and prussia without knowing why
war is not courtesy but the most horrible thing in life  and we ought to understand that and not play at war
we ought to accept this terrible necessity sternly and seriously
it all lies in that  get rid of falsehood and let war be war and not a game
as it is now  war is the favorite pastime of the idle and frivolous
the military calling is the most highly honored
 but what is war  what is needed for success in warfare  what are the habits of the military  the aim of war is murder  the methods of war are spying  treachery  and their encouragement  the ruin of a country s inhabitants  robbing them or stealing to provision the army  and fraud and falsehood termed military craft
the habits of the military class are the absence of freedom  that is  discipline  idleness  ignorance  cruelty  debauchery  and drunkenness
and in spite of all this it is the highest class  respected by everyone
all the kings  except the chinese  wear military uniforms  and he who kills most people receives the highest rewards  they meet  as we shall meet tomorrow  to murder one another  they kill and maim tens of thousands  and then have thanksgiving services for having killed so many people  they even exaggerate the number   and they announce a victory  supposing that the more people they have killed the greater their achievement
how does god above look at them and hear them   exclaimed prince andrew in a shrill  piercing voice
 ah  my friend  it has of late become hard for me to live
i see that i have begun to understand too much
and it doesn t do for man to taste of the tree of knowledge of good and evil   
ah  well  it s not for long   he added
 however  you re sleepy  and it s time for me to sleep
go back to gorki   said prince andrew suddenly
 oh no   pierre replied  looking at prince andrew with frightened  compassionate eyes
 go  go  before a battle one must have one s sleep out   repeated prince andrew
he came quickly up to pierre and embraced and kissed him
 good bye  be off   he shouted
 whether we meet again or not     and turning away hurriedly he entered the shed
it was already dark  and pierre could not make out whether the expression of prince andrew s face was angry or tender
for some time he stood in silence considering whether he should follow him or go away
 no  he does not want it   pierre concluded
 and i know that this is our last meeting   he sighed deeply and rode back to gorki
on re entering the shed prince andrew lay down on a rug  but he could not sleep
he closed his eyes
one picture succeeded another in his imagination
on one of them he dwelt long and joyfully
he vividly recalled an evening in petersburg
natasha with animated and excited face was telling him how she had gone to look for mushrooms the previous summer and had lost her way in the big forest she incoherently described the depths of the forest  her feelings  and a talk with a beekeeper she met  and constantly interrupted her story to say   no  i can t  i m not telling it right  no  you don t understand   though he encouraged her by saying that he did understand  and he really had understood all she wanted to say
but natasha was not satisfied with her own words  she felt that they did not convey the passionately poetic feeling she had experienced that day and wished to convey
 he was such a delightful old man  and it was so dark in the forest  
and he had such kind  
no  i can t describe it   she had said  flushed and excited
prince andrew smiled now the same happy smile as then when he had looked into her eyes
 i understood her   he thought
 i not only understood her  but it was just that inner  spiritual force  that sincerity  that frankness of soul that very soul of hers which seemed to be fettered by her body it was that soul i loved in her  
loved so strongly and happily     and suddenly he remembered how his love had ended
 he did not need anything of that kind
he neither saw nor understood anything of the sort
he only saw in her a pretty and fresh young girl  with whom he did not deign to unite his fate
and i   
and he is still alive and gay   prince andrew jumped up as if someone had burned him  and again began pacing up and down in front of the shed
on august 25  the eve of the battle of borodino  m
de beausset  prefect of the french emperor s palace  arrived at napoleon s quarters at valuevo with colonel fabvier  the former from paris and the latter from madrid
donning his court uniform  m
de beausset ordered a box he had brought for the emperor to be carried before him and entered the first compartment of napoleon s tent  where he began opening the box while conversing with napoleon s aides de camp who surrounded him
fabvier  not entering the tent  remained at the entrance talking to some generals of his acquaintance
the emperor napoleon had not yet left his bedroom and was finishing his toilet
slightly snorting and grunting  he presented now his back and now his plump hairy chest to the brush with which his valet was rubbing him down
another valet  with his finger over the mouth of a bottle  was sprinkling eau de cologne on the emperor s pampered body with an expression which seemed to say that he alone knew where and how much eau de cologne should be sprinkled
napoleon s short hair was wet and matted on the forehead  but his face  though puffy and yellow  expressed physical satisfaction
 go on  harder  go on   he muttered to the valet who was rubbing him  slightly twitching and grunting
an aide de camp  who had entered the bedroom to report to the emperor the number of prisoners taken in yesterday s action  was standing by the door after delivering his message  awaiting permission to withdraw
napoleon  frowning  looked at him from under his brows
 no prisoners   said he  repeating the aide de camp s words
 they are forcing us to exterminate them
so much the worse for the russian army   
go on  
harder  harder   he muttered  hunching his back and presenting his fat shoulders
 all right
let monsieur de beausset enter  and fabvier too   he said  nodding to the aide de camp
 yes  sire   and the aide de camp disappeared through the door of the tent
two valets rapidly dressed his majesty  and wearing the blue uniform of the guards he went with firm quick steps to the reception room
de beausset s hands meanwhile were busily engaged arranging the present he had brought from the empress  on two chairs directly in front of the entrance
but napoleon had dressed and come out with such unexpected rapidity that he had not time to finish arranging the surprise
napoleon noticed at once what they were about and guessed that they were not ready
he did not wish to deprive them of the pleasure of giving him a surprise  so he pretended not to see de beausset and called fabvier to him  listening silently and with a stern frown to what fabvier told him of the heroism and devotion of his troops fighting at salamanca  at the other end of europe  with but one thought to be worthy of their emperor and but one fear to fail to please him
the result of that battle had been deplorable
napoleon made ironic remarks during fabvier s account  as if he had not expected that matters could go otherwise in his absence
 i must make up for that in moscow   said napoleon
 i ll see you later   he added  and summoned de beausset  who by that time had prepared the surprise  having placed something on the chairs and covered it with a cloth
de beausset bowed low  with that courtly french bow which only the old retainers of the bourbons knew how to make  and approached him  presenting an envelope
napoleon turned to him gaily and pulled his ear
 you have hurried here
i am very glad
well  what is paris saying   he asked  suddenly changing his former stern expression for a most cordial tone
 sire  all paris regrets your absence   replied de beausset as was proper
but though napoleon knew that de beausset had to say something of this kind  and though in his lucid moments he knew it was untrue  he was pleased to hear it from him
again he honored him by touching his ear
 i am very sorry to have made you travel so far   said he
 sire  i expected nothing less than to find you at the gates of moscow   replied de beausset
napoleon smiled and  lifting his head absent mindedly  glanced to the right
an aide de camp approached with gliding steps and offered him a gold snuffbox  which he took
 yes  it has happened luckily for you   he said  raising the open snuffbox to his nose
 you are fond of travel  and in three days you will see moscow
you surely did not expect to see that asiatic capital
you will have a pleasant journey   de beausset bowed gratefully at this regard for his taste for travel  of which he had not till then been aware 
 ha  what s this   asked napoleon  noticing that all the courtiers were looking at something concealed under a cloth
with courtly adroitness de beausset half turned and without turning his back to the emperor retired two steps  twitching off the cloth at the same time  and said   a present to your majesty from the empress   it was a portrait  painted in bright colors by gerard  of the son borne to napoleon by the daughter of the emperor of austria  the boy whom for some reason everyone called  the king of rome   a very pretty curly headed boy with a look of the christ in the sistine madonna was depicted playing at stick and ball
the ball represented the terrestrial globe and the stick in his other hand a scepter
though it was not clear what the artist meant to express by depicting the so  called king of rome spiking the earth with a stick  the allegory apparently seemed to napoleon  as it had done to all who had seen it in paris  quite clear and very pleasing
 the king of rome   he said  pointing to the portrait with a graceful gesture
 admirable   with the natural capacity of an italian for changing the expression of his face at will  he drew nearer to the portrait and assumed a look of pensive tenderness
he felt that what he now said and did would be historical  and it seemed to him that it would now be best for him whose grandeur enabled his son to play stick and ball with the terrestrial globe to show  in contrast to that grandeur  the simplest paternal tenderness
his eyes grew dim  he moved forward  glanced round at a chair  which seemed to place itself under him   and sat down on it before the portrait
at a single gesture from him everyone went out on tiptoe  leaving the great man to himself and his emotion having sat still for a while he touched himself not knowing why the thick spot of paint representing the highest light in the portrait  rose  and recalled de beausset and the officer on duty he ordered the portrait to be carried outside his tent  that the old guard  stationed round it  might not be deprived of the pleasure of seeing the king of rome  the son and heir of their adored monarch
and while he was doing m
de beausset the honor of breakfasting with him  they heard  as napoleon had anticipated  the rapturous cries of the officers and men of the old guard who had run up to see the portrait
 vive l empereur  vive le roi de rome  vive l empereur   came those ecstatic cries
after breakfast napoleon in de beausset s presence dictated his order of the day to the army
 short and energetic   he remarked when he had read over the proclamation which he had dictated straight off without corrections
it ran  soldiers  this is the battle you have so longed for
victory depends on you
it is essential for us  it will give us all we need  comfortable quarters and a speedy return to our country
behave as you did at austerlitz  friedland  vitebsk  and smolensk
let our remotest posterity recall your achievements this day with pride
let it be said of each of you   he was in the great battle before moscow    before moscow   repeated napoleon  and inviting m
de beausset  who was so fond of travel  to accompany him on his ride  he went out of the tent to where the horses stood saddled
 your majesty is too kind   replied de beausset to the invitation to accompany the emperor  he wanted to sleep  did not know how to ride and was afraid of doing so
but napoleon nodded to the traveler  and de beausset had to mount
when napoleon came out of the tent the shouting of the guards before his son s portrait grew still louder
napoleon frowned
 take him away   he said  pointing with a gracefully majestic gesture to the portrait
 it is too soon for him to see a field of battle   de beausset closed his eyes  bowed his head  and sighed deeply  to indicate how profoundly he valued and comprehended the emperor s words
on the twenty fifth of august  so his historians tell us  napoleon spent the whole day on horseback inspecting the locality  considering plans submitted to him by his marshals  and personally giving commands to his generals
the original line of the russian forces along the river kolocha had been dislocated by the capture of the shevardino redoubt on the twenty fourth  and part of the line the left flank had been drawn back
that part of the line was not entrenched and in front of it the ground was more open and level than elsewhere
it was evident to anyone  military or not  that it was here the french should attack
it would seem that not much consideration was needed to reach this conclusion  nor any particular care or trouble on the part of the emperor and his marshals  nor was there any need of that special and supreme quality called genius that people are so apt to ascribe to napoleon  yet the historians who described the event later and the men who then surrounded napoleon  and he himself  thought otherwise napoleon rode over the plain and surveyed the locality with a profound air and in silence  nodded with approval or shook his head dubiously  and without communicating to the generals around him the profound course of ideas which guided his decisions merely gave them his final conclusions in the form of commands
having listened to a suggestion from davout  who was now called prince d eckmuhl  to turn the russian left wing  napoleon said it should not be done  without explaining why not
to a proposal made by general campan  who was to attack the fleches  to lead his division through the woods  napoleon agreed  though the so called duke of elchingen  ney  ventured to remark that a movement through the woods was dangerous and might disorder the division
having inspected the country opposite the shevardino redoubt  napoleon pondered a little in silence and then indicated the spots where two batteries should be set up by the morrow to act against the russian entrenchments  and the places where  in line with them  the field artillery should be placed
after giving these and other commands he returned to his tent  and the dispositions for the battle were written down from his dictation
these dispositions  of which the french historians write with enthusiasm and other historians with profound respect  were as follows  at dawn the two new batteries established during the night on the plain occupied by the prince d eckmuhl will open fire on the opposing batteries of the enemy
at the same time the commander of the artillery of the 1st corps  general pernetti  with thirty cannon of campan s division and all the howitzers of dessaix s and friant s divisions  will move forward  open fire  and overwhelm with shellfire the enemy s battery  against which will operate  24 guns of the artillery of the guards 30 guns of campan s division and 8 guns of friant s and dessaix s divisions   in all 62 guns
the commander of the artillery of the 3rd corps  general fouche  will place the howitzers of the 3rd and 8th corps  sixteen in all  on the flanks of the battery that is to bombard the entrenchment on the left  which will have forty guns in all directed against it
general sorbier must be ready at the first order to advance with all the howitzers of the guard s artillery against either one or other of the entrenchments
during the cannonade prince poniatowski is to advance through the wood on the village and turn the enemy s position
general campan will move through the wood to seize the first fortification
after the advance has begun in this manner  orders will be given in accordance with the enemy s movements
the cannonade on the left flank will begin as soon as the guns of the right wing are heard
the sharpshooters of morand s division and of the vice king s division will open a heavy fire on seeing the attack commence on the right wing
the vice king will occupy the village and cross by its three bridges  advancing to the same heights as morand s and gibrard s divisions  which under his leadership will be directed against the redoubt and come into line with the rest of the forces
all this must be done in good order  le tout se fera avec ordre et methode  as far as possible retaining troops in reserve
the imperial camp near mozhaysk  september  6  1812
these dispositions  which are very obscure and confused if one allows oneself to regard the arrangements without religious awe of his genius  related to napoleon s orders to deal with four points four different orders
not one of these was  or could be  carried out
in the disposition it is said first that the batteries placed on the spot chosen by napoleon  with the guns of pernetti and fouche  which were to come in line with them  102 guns in all  were to open fire and shower shells on the russian fleches and redoubts
this could not be done  as from the spots selected by napoleon the projectiles did not carry to the russian works  and those 102 guns shot into the air until the nearest commander  contrary to napoleon s instructions  moved them forward
the second order was that poniatowski  moving to the village through the wood  should turn the russian left flank
this could not be done and was not done  because poniatowski  advancing on the village through the wood  met tuchkov there barring his way  and could not and did not turn the russian position
the third order was  general campan will move through the wood to seize the first fortification
general campan s division did not seize the first fortification but was driven back  for on emerging from the wood it had to reform under grapeshot  of which napoleon was unaware
the fourth order was  the vice king will occupy the village  borodino  and cross by its three bridges  advancing to the same heights as morand s and gibrard s divisions  for whose movements no directions are given   which under his leadership will be directed against the redoubt and come into line with the rest of the forces
as far as one can make out  not so much from this unintelligible sentence as from the attempts the vice king made to execute the orders given him  he was to advance from the left through borodino to the redoubt while the divisions of morand and gerard were to advance simultaneously from the front
all this  like the other parts of the disposition  was not and could not be executed
after passing through borodino the vice king was driven back to the kolocha and could get no farther  while the divisions of morand and gerard did not take the redoubt but were driven back  and the redoubt was only taken at the end of the battle by the cavalry  a thing probably unforeseen and not heard of by napoleon 
so not one of the orders in the disposition was  or could be  executed
but in the disposition it is said that  after the fight has commenced in this manner  orders will be given in accordance with the enemy s movements  and so it might be supposed that all necessary arrangements would be made by napoleon during the battle
but this was not and could not be done  for during the whole battle napoleon was so far away that  as appeared later  he could not know the course of the battle and not one of his orders during the fight could be executed
many historians say that the french did not win the battle of borodino because napoleon had a cold  and that if he had not had a cold the orders he gave before and during the battle would have been still more full of genius and russia would have been lost and the face of the world have been changed
to historians who believe that russia was shaped by the will of one man peter the great and that france from a republic became an empire and french armies went to russia at the will of one man napoleon to say that russia remained a power because napoleon had a bad cold on the twenty fourth of august may seem logical and convincing
if it had depended on napoleon s will to fight or not to fight the battle of borodino  and if this or that other arrangement depended on his will  then evidently a cold affecting the manifestation of his will might have saved russia  and consequently the valet who omitted to bring napoleon his waterproof boots on the twenty fourth would have been the savior of russia
along that line of thought such a deduction is indubitable  as indubitable as the deduction voltaire made in jest  without knowing what he was jesting at  when he saw that the massacre of st
bartholomew was due to charles ix s stomach being deranged
but to men who do not admit that russia was formed by the will of one man  peter i  or that the french empire was formed and the war with russia begun by the will of one man  napoleon  that argument seems not merely untrue and irrational  but contrary to all human reality to the question of what causes historic events another answer presents itself  namely  that the course of human events is predetermined from on high depends on the coincidence of the wills of all who take part in the events  and that a napoleon s influence on the course of these events is purely external and fictitious
strange as at first glance it may seem to suppose that the massacre of st
bartholomew was not due to charles ix s will  though he gave the order for it and thought it was done as a result of that order  and strange as it may seem to suppose that the slaughter of eighty thousand men at borodino was not due to napoleon s will  though he ordered the commencement and conduct of the battle and thought it was done because he ordered it  strange as these suppositions appear  yet human dignity which tells me that each of us is  if not more at least not less a man than the great napoleon demands the acceptance of that solution of the question  and historic investigation abundantly confirms it at the battle of borodino napoleon shot at no one and killed no one
that was all done by the soldiers
therefore it was not he who killed people
the french soldiers went to kill and be killed at the battle of borodino not because of napoleon s orders but by their own volition
the whole army  french  italian  german  polish  and dutch hungry  ragged  and weary of the campaign  felt at the sight of an army blocking their road to moscow that the wine was drawn and must be drunk
had napoleon then forbidden them to fight the russians  they would have killed him and have proceeded to fight the russians because it was inevitable
when they heard napoleon s proclamation offering them  as compensation for mutilation and death  the words of posterity about their having been in the battle before moscow  they cried  vive l empereur   just as they had cried  vive l empereur   at the sight of the portrait of the boy piercing the terrestrial globe with a toy stick  and just as they would have cried  vive l empereur   at any nonsense that might be told them
there was nothing left for them to do but cry  vive l empereur   and go to fight  in order to get food and rest as conquerors in moscow
so it was not because of napoleon s commands that they killed their fellow men
and it was not napoleon who directed the course of the battle  for none of his orders were executed and during the battle he did not know what was going on before him
so the way in which these people killed one another was not decided by napoleon s will but occurred independently of him  in accord with the will of hundreds of thousands of people who took part in the common action
it only seemed to napoleon that it all took place by his will
and so the question whether he had or had not a cold has no more historic interest than the cold of the least of the transport soldiers
moreover  the assertion made by various writers that his cold was the cause of his dispositions not being as well planned as on former occasions  and of his orders during the battle not being as good as previously  is quite baseless  which again shows that napoleon s cold on the twenty sixth of august was unimportant
the dispositions cited above are not at all worse  but are even better  than previous dispositions by which he had won victories
his pseudo orders during the battle were also no worse than formerly  but much the same as usual
these dispositions and orders only seem worse than previous ones because the battle of borodino was the first napoleon did not win
the profoundest and most excellent dispositions and orders seem very bad  and every learned militarist criticizes them with looks of importance  when they relate to a battle that has been lost  and the very worst dispositions and orders seem very good  and serious people fill whole volumes to demonstrate their merits  when they relate to a battle that has been won
the dispositions drawn up by weyrother for the battle of austerlitz were a model of perfection for that kind of composition  but still they were criticized  criticized for their very perfection  for their excessive minuteness
napoleon at the battle of borodino fulfilled his office as representative of authority as well as  and even better than  at other battles
he did nothing harmful to the progress of the battle  he inclined to the most reasonable opinions  he made no confusion  did not contradict himself  did not get frightened or run away from the field of battle  but with his great tact and military experience carried out his role of appearing to command  calmly and with dignity on returning from a second inspection of the lines  napoleon remarked   the chessmen are set up  the game will begin tomorrow   having ordered punch and summoned de beausset  he began to talk to him about paris and about some changes he meant to make in the empress  household  surprising the prefect by his memory of minute details relating to the court
he showed an interest in trifles  joked about de beausset s love of travel  and chatted carelessly  as a famous  self confident surgeon who knows his job does when turning up his sleeves and putting on his apron while a patient is being strapped to the operating table
 the matter is in my hands and is clear and definite in my head
when the time comes to set to work i shall do it as no one else could  but now i can jest  and the more i jest and the calmer i am the more tranquil and confident you ought to be  and the more amazed at my genius   having finished his second glass of punch  napoleon went to rest before the serious business which  he considered  awaited him next day
he was so much interested in that task that he was unable to sleep  and in spite of his cold which had grown worse from the dampness of the evening  he went into the large division of the tent at three o clock in the morning  loudly blowing his nose
he asked whether the russians had not withdrawn  and was told that the enemy s fires were still in the same places
he nodded approval
the adjutant in attendance came into the tent
 well  rapp  do you think we shall do good business today   napoleon asked him
 without doubt  sire   replied rapp
napoleon looked at him
 do you remember  sire  what you did me the honor to say at smolensk   continued rapp
 the wine is drawn and must be drunk   napoleon frowned and sat silent for a long time leaning his head on his hand
 this poor army   he suddenly remarked
 it has diminished greatly since smolensk
fortune is frankly a courtesan  rapp
i have always said so and i am beginning to experience it
but the guards  rapp  the guards are intact   he remarked interrogatively
 yes  sire   replied rapp
napoleon took a lozenge  put it in his mouth  and glanced at his watch
he was not sleepy and it was still not nearly morning
it was impossible to give further orders for the sake of killing time  for the orders had all been given and were now being executed
 have the biscuits and rice been served out to the regiments of the guards   asked napoleon sternly
 yes  sire    the rice too   rapp replied that he had given the emperor s order about the rice  but napoleon shook his head in dissatisfaction as if not believing that his order had been executed
an attendant came in with punch
napoleon ordered another glass to be brought for rapp  and silently sipped his own
 i have neither taste nor smell   he remarked  sniffing at his glass
 this cold is tiresome
they talk about medicine what is the good of medicine when it can t cure a cold  corvisart gave me these lozenges but they don t help at all
what can doctors cure  one can t cure anything
our body is a machine for living
it is organized for that  it is its nature
let life go on in it unhindered and let it defend itself  it will do more than if you paralyze it by encumbering it with remedies
our body is like a perfect watch that should go for a certain time  the watchmaker cannot open it  he can only adjust it by fumbling  and that blindfold   
yes  our body is just a machine for living  that is all   and having entered on the path of definition  of which he was fond  napoleon suddenly and unexpectedly gave a new one
 do you know  rapp  what military art is   asked he
 it is the art of being stronger than the enemy at a given moment
that s all   rapp made no reply
 tomorrow we shall have to deal with kutuzov   said napoleon
 we shall see  do you remember at braunau he commanded an army for three weeks and did not once mount a horse to inspect his entrenchments   
we shall see   he looked at his watch
it was still only four o clock
he did not feel sleepy
the punch was finished and there was still nothing to do
he rose  walked to and fro  put on a warm overcoat and a hat  and went out of the tent
the night was dark and damp  a scarcely perceptible moisture was descending from above
near by  the campfires were dimly burning among the french guards  and in the distance those of the russian line shone through the smoke
the weather was calm  and the rustle and tramp of the french troops already beginning to move to take up their positions were clearly audible
napoleon walked about in front of his tent  looked at the fires and listened to these sounds  and as he was passing a tall guardsman in a shaggy cap  who was standing sentinel before his tent and had drawn himself up like a black pillar at sight of the emperor  napoleon stopped in front of him  what year did you enter the service   he asked with that affectation of military bluntness and geniality with which he always addressed the soldiers
the man answered the question
 ah  one of the old ones  has your regiment had its rice    it has  your majesty   napoleon nodded and walked away
at half past five napoleon rode to the village of shevardino
it was growing light  the sky was clearing  only a single cloud lay in the east
the abandoned campfires were burning themselves out in the faint morning light on the right a single deep report of a cannon resounded and died away in the prevailing silence
some minutes passed
a second and a third report shook the air  then a fourth and a fifth boomed solemnly near by on the right
the first shots had not yet ceased to reverberate before others rang out and yet more were heard mingling with and overtaking one another
napoleon with his suite rode up to the shevardino redoubt where he dismounted
the game had begun
on returning to gorki after having seen prince andrew  pierre ordered his groom to get the horses ready and to call him early in the morning  and then immediately fell asleep behind a partition in a corner boris had given up to him
before he was thoroughly awake next morning everybody had already left the hut
the panes were rattling in the little windows and his groom was shaking him
 your excellency  your excellency  your excellency   he kept repeating pertinaciously while he shook pierre by the shoulder without looking at him  having apparently lost hope of getting him to wake up
 what  has it begun  is it time   pierre asked  waking up
 hear the firing   said the groom  a discharged soldier
 all the gentlemen have gone out  and his serene highness himself rode past long ago   pierre dressed hastily and ran out to the porch outside all was bright  fresh  dewy  and cheerful
the sun  just bursting forth from behind a cloud that had concealed it  was shining  with rays still half broken by the clouds  over the roofs of the street opposite  on the dew besprinkled dust of the road  on the walls of the houses  on the windows  the fence  and on pierre s horses standing before the hut
the roar of guns sounded more distinct outside
an adjutant accompanied by a cossack passed by at a sharp trot
 it s time  count  it s time   cried the adjutant
telling the groom to follow him with the horses  pierre went down the street to the knoll from which he had looked at the field of battle the day before
a crowd of military men was assembled there  members of the staff could be heard conversing in french  and kutuzov s gray head in a white cap with a red band was visible  his gray nape sunk between his shoulders
he was looking through a field glass down the highroad before him
mounting the steps to the knoll pierre looked at the scene before him  spellbound by beauty
it was the same panorama he had admired from that spot the day before  but now the whole place was full of troops and covered by smoke clouds from the guns  and the slanting rays of the bright sun  rising slightly to the left behind pierre  cast upon it through the clear morning air penetrating streaks of rosy  golden tinted light and long dark shadows
the forest at the farthest extremity of the panorama seemed carved in some precious stone of a yellowish green color  its undulating outline was silhouetted against the horizon and was pierced beyond valuevo by the smolensk highroad crowded with troops
nearer at hand glittered golden cornfields interspersed with copses
there were troops to be seen everywhere  in front and to the right and left
all this was vivid  majestic  and unexpected  but what impressed pierre most of all was the view of the battlefield itself  of borodino and the hollows on both sides of the kolocha
above the kolocha  in borodino and on both sides of it  especially to the left where the voyna flowing between its marshy banks falls into the kolocha  a mist had spread which seemed to melt  to dissolve  and to become translucent when the brilliant sun appeared and magically colored and outlined everything
the smoke of the guns mingled with this mist  and over the whole expanse and through that mist the rays of the morning sun were reflected  flashing back like lightning from the water  from the dew  and from the bayonets of the troops crowded together by the riverbanks and in borodino
a white church could be seen through the mist  and here and there the roofs of huts in borodino as well as dense masses of soldiers  or green ammunition chests and ordnance
and all this moved  or seemed to move  as the smoke and mist spread out over the whole space
just as in the mist enveloped hollow near borodino  so along the entire line outside and above it and especially in the woods and fields to the left  in the valleys and on the summits of the high ground  clouds of powder smoke seemed continually to spring up out of nothing  now singly  now several at a time  some translucent  others dense  which  swelling  growing  rolling  and blending  extended over the whole expanse
these puffs of smoke and  strange to say  the sound of the firing produced the chief beauty of the spectacle
 puff   suddenly a round compact cloud of smoke was seen merging from violet into gray and milky white  and  boom   came the report a second later
 puff  puff   and two clouds arose pushing one another and blending together  and  boom  boom   came the sounds confirming what the eye had seen
pierre glanced round at the first cloud  which he had seen as a round compact ball  and in its place already were balloons of smoke floating to one side  and   puff   with a pause   puff  puff   three and then four more appeared and then from each  with the same interval  boom boom  boom   came the fine  firm  precise sounds in reply
it seemed as if those smoke clouds sometimes ran and sometimes stood still while woods  fields  and glittering bayonets ran past them
from the left  over fields and bushes  those large balls of smoke were continually appearing followed by their solemn reports  while nearer still  in the hollows and woods  there burst from the muskets small cloudlets that had no time to become balls  but had their little echoes in just the same way
 trakh ta ta takh   came the frequent crackle of musketry  but it was irregular and feeble in comparison with the reports of the cannon
pierre wished to be there with that smoke  those shining bayonets  that movement  and those sounds
he turned to look at kutuzov and his suite  to compare his impressions with those of others
they were all looking at the field of battle as he was  and  as it seemed to him  with the same feelings
all their faces were now shining with that latent warmth of feeling pierre had noticed the day before and had fully understood after his talk with prince andrew
 go  my dear fellow  go  
and christ be with you   kutuzov was saying to a general who stood beside him  not taking his eye from the battlefield
having received this order the general passed by pierre on his way down the knoll
 to the crossing   said the general coldly and sternly in reply to one of the staff who asked where he was going
 i ll go there too  i too   thought pierre  and followed the general
the general mounted a horse a cossack had brought him
pierre went to his groom who was holding his horses and  asking which was the quietest  clambered onto it  seized it by the mane  and turning out his toes pressed his heels against its sides and  feeling that his spectacles were slipping off but unable to let go of the mane and reins  he galloped after the general  causing the staff officers to smile as they watched him from the knoll
having descended the hill the general after whom pierre was galloping turned sharply to the left  and pierre  losing sight of him  galloped in among some ranks of infantry marching ahead of him
he tried to pass either in front of them or to the right or left  but there were soldiers everywhere  all with the same preoccupied expression and busy with some unseen but evidently important task
they all gazed with the same dissatisfied and inquiring expression at this stout man in a white hat  who for some unknown reason threatened to trample them under his horse s hoofs
 why ride into the middle of the battalion   one of them shouted at him
another prodded his horse with the butt end of a musket  and pierre  bending over his saddlebow and hardly able to control his shying horse  galloped ahead of the soldiers where there was a free space
there was a bridge ahead of him  where other soldiers stood firing
pierre rode up to them
without being aware of it he had come to the bridge across the kolocha between gorki and borodino  which the french  having occupied borodino  were attacking in the first phase of the battle
pierre saw that there was a bridge in front of him and that soldiers were doing something on both sides of it and in the meadow  among the rows of new mown hay which he had taken no notice of amid the smoke of the campfires the day before  but despite the incessant firing going on there he had no idea that this was the field of battle
he did not notice the sound of the bullets whistling from every side  or the projectiles that flew over him  did not see the enemy on the other side of the river  and for a long time did not notice the killed and wounded  though many fell near him
he looked about him with a smile which did not leave his face
 why s that fellow in front of the line   shouted somebody at him again
 to the left   
keep to the right   the men shouted to him
pierre went to the right  and unexpectedly encountered one of raevski s adjutants whom he knew
the adjutant looked angrily at him  evidently also intending to shout at him  but on recognizing him he nodded
 how have you got here   he said  and galloped on
pierre  feeling out of place there  having nothing to do  and afraid of getting in someone s way again  galloped after the adjutant
 what s happening here  may i come with you   he asked
 one moment  one moment   replied the adjutant  and riding up to a stout colonel who was standing in the meadow  he gave him some message and then addressed pierre
 why have you come here  count   he asked with a smile
 still inquisitive    yes  yes   assented pierre
but the adjutant turned his horse about and rode on
 here it s tolerable   said he   but with bagration on the left flank they re getting it frightfully hot    really   said pierre
 where is that    come along with me to our knoll
we can get a view from there and in our battery it is still bearable   said the adjutant
 will you come    yes  i ll come with you   replied pierre  looking round for his groom
it was only now that he noticed wounded men staggering along or being carried on stretchers on that very meadow he had ridden over the day before  a soldier was lying athwart the rows of scented hay  with his head thrown awkwardly back and his shako off
 why haven t they carried him away   pierre was about to ask  but seeing the stern expression of the adjutant who was also looking that way  he checked himself pierre did not find his groom and rode along the hollow with the adjutant to raevski s redoubt
his horse lagged behind the adjutant s and jolted him at every step
 you don t seem to be used to riding  count   remarked the adjutant
 no it s not that  but her action seems so jerky   said pierre in a puzzled tone  why  
she s wounded   said the adjutant
 in the off foreleg above the knee
a bullet  no doubt
i congratulate you  count  on your baptism of fire   having ridden in the smoke past the sixth corps  behind the artillery which had been moved forward and was in action  deafening them with the noise of firing  they came to a small wood
there it was cool and quiet  with a scent of autumn
pierre and the adjutant dismounted and walked up the hill on foot
 is the general here   asked the adjutant on reaching the knoll
 he was here a minute ago but has just gone that way   someone told him  pointing to the right
the adjutant looked at pierre as if puzzled what to do with him now
 don t trouble about me   said pierre
 i ll go up onto the knoll if i may    yes  do
you ll see everything from there and it s less dangerous  and i ll come for you   pierre went to the battery and the adjutant rode on
they did not meet again  and only much later did pierre learn that he lost an arm that day
the knoll to which pierre ascended was that famous one afterwards known to the russians as the knoll battery or raevski s redoubt  and to the french as la grande redoute  la fatale redoute  la redoute du centre  around which tens of thousands fell  and which the french regarded as the key to the whole position
this redoubt consisted of a knoll  on three sides of which trenches had been dug
within the entrenchment stood ten guns that were being fired through openings in the earthwork
in line with the knoll on both sides stood other guns which also fired incessantly
a little behind the guns stood infantry
when ascending that knoll pierre had no notion that this spot  on which small trenches had been dug and from which a few guns were firing  was the most important point of the battle
on the contrary  just because he happened to be there he thought it one of the least significant parts of the field
having reached the knoll  pierre sat down at one end of a trench surrounding the battery and gazed at what was going on around him with an unconsciously happy smile
occasionally he rose and walked about the battery still with that same smile  trying not to obstruct the soldiers who were loading  hauling the guns  and continually running past him with bags and charges
the guns of that battery were being fired continually one after another with a deafening roar  enveloping the whole neighborhood in powder smoke
in contrast with the dread felt by the infantrymen placed in support  here in the battery where a small number of men busy at their work were separated from the rest by a trench  everyone experienced a common and as it were family feeling of animation
the intrusion of pierre s nonmilitary figure in a white hat made an unpleasant impression at first
the soldiers looked askance at him with surprise and even alarm as they went past him
the senior artillery officer  a tall  long legged  pockmarked man  moved over to pierre as if to see the action of the farthest gun and looked at him with curiosity
a young round faced officer  quite a boy still and evidently only just out of the cadet college  who was zealously commanding the two guns entrusted to him  addressed pierre sternly
 sir   he said   permit me to ask you to stand aside
you must not be here   the soldiers shook their heads disapprovingly as they looked at pierre
but when they had convinced themselves that this man in the white hat was doing no harm  but either sat quietly on the slope of the trench with a shy smile or  politely making way for the soldiers  paced up and down the battery under fire as calmly as if he were on a boulevard  their feeling of hostile distrust gradually began to change into a kindly and bantering sympathy  such as soldiers feel for their dogs  cocks  goats  and in general for the animals that live with the regiment the men soon accepted pierre into their family  adopted him  gave him a nickname   our gentleman    and made kindly fun of him among themselves a shell tore up the earth two paces from pierre and he looked around with a smile as he brushed from his clothes some earth it had thrown up
 and how s it you re not afraid  sir  really now   a red faced  broad shouldered soldier asked pierre  with a grin that disclosed a set of sound  white teeth
 are you afraid  then   said pierre
 what else do you expect   answered the soldier
 she has no mercy  you know  when she comes spluttering down  out go your innards
one can t help being afraid   he said laughing
several of the men  with bright kindly faces  stopped beside pierre
they seemed not to have expected him to talk like anybody else  and the discovery that he did so delighted them
 it s the business of us soldiers
but in a gentleman it s wonderful  there s a gentleman for you    to your places   cried the young officer to the men gathered round pierre
the young officer was evidently exercising his duties for the first or second time and therefore treated both his superiors and the men with great precision and formality
the booming cannonade and the fusillade of musketry were growing more intense over the whole field  especially to the left where bagration s fleches were  but where pierre was the smoke of the firing made it almost impossible to distinguish anything
moreover  his whole attention was engrossed by watching the family circle separated from all else formed by the men in the battery
his first unconscious feeling of joyful animation produced by the sights and sounds of the battlefield was now replaced by another  especially since he had seen that soldier lying alone in the hayfield
now  seated on the slope of the trench  he observed the faces of those around him
by ten o clock some twenty men had already been carried away from the battery  two guns were smashed and cannon balls fell more and more frequently on the battery and spent bullets buzzed and whistled around
but the men in the battery seemed not to notice this  and merry voices and jokes were heard on all sides
 a live one   shouted a man as a whistling shell approached
 not this way  to the infantry   added another with loud laughter  seeing the shell fly past and fall into the ranks of the supports
 are you bowing to a friend  eh   remarked another  chaffing a peasant who ducked low as a cannon ball flew over
several soldiers gathered by the wall of the trench  looking out to see what was happening in front
 they ve withdrawn the front line  it has retired   said they  pointing over the earthwork
 mind your own business   an old sergeant shouted at them
 if they ve retired it s because there s work for them to do farther back   and the sergeant  taking one of the men by the shoulders  gave him a shove with his knee
this was followed by a burst of laughter
 to the fifth gun  wheel it up   came shouts from one side
 now then  all together  like bargees   rose the merry voices of those who were moving the gun
 oh  she nearly knocked our gentleman s hat off   cried the red faced humorist  showing his teeth chaffing pierre
 awkward baggage   he added reproachfully to a cannon ball that struck a cannon wheel and a man s leg
 now then  you foxes   said another  laughing at some militiamen who  stooping low  entered the battery to carry away the wounded man
 so this gruel isn t to your taste  oh  you crows  you re scared   they shouted at the militiamen who stood hesitating before the man whose leg had been torn off
 there  lads  
oh  oh   they mimicked the peasants   they don t like it at all   pierre noticed that after every ball that hit the redoubt  and after every loss  the liveliness increased more and more
as the flames of the fire hidden within come more and more vividly and rapidly from an approaching thundercloud  so  as if in opposition to what was taking place  the lightning of hidden fire growing more and more intense glowed in the faces of these men
pierre did not look out at the battlefield and was not concerned to know what was happening there  he was entirely absorbed in watching this fire which burned ever more brightly and which he felt was flaming up in the same way in his own soul
at ten o clock the infantry that had been among the bushes in front of the battery and along the kamenka streamlet retreated
from the battery they could be seen running back past it carrying their wounded on their muskets
a general with his suite came to the battery  and after speaking to the colonel gave pierre an angry look and went away again having ordered the infantry supports behind the battery to lie down  so as to be less exposed to fire
after this from amid the ranks of infantry to the right of the battery came the sound of a drum and shouts of command  and from the battery one saw how those ranks of infantry moved forward
pierre looked over the wall of the trench and was particularly struck by a pale young officer who  letting his sword hang down  was walking backwards and kept glancing uneasily around
the ranks of the infantry disappeared amid the smoke but their long drawn shout and rapid musketry firing could still be heard
a few minutes later crowds of wounded men and stretcher bearers came back from that direction projectiles began to fall still more frequently in the battery
several men were lying about who had not been removed
around the cannon the men moved still more briskly and busily
no one any longer took notice of pierre
once or twice he was shouted at for being in the way
the senior officer moved with big  rapid strides from one gun to another with a frowning face
the young officer  with his face still more flushed  commanded the men more scrupulously than ever
the soldiers handed up the charges  turned  loaded  and did their business with strained smartness
they gave little jumps as they walked  as though they were on springs
the stormcloud had come upon them  and in every face the fire which pierre had watched kindle burned up brightly
pierre standing beside the commanding officer
the young officer  his hand to his shako  ran up to his superior
 i have the honor to report  sir  that only eight rounds are left
are we to continue firing   he asked
 grapeshot   the senior shouted  without answering the question  looking over the wall of the trench
suddenly something happened  the young officer gave a gasp and bending double sat down on the ground like a bird shot on the wing
everything became strange  confused  and misty in pierre s eyes
one cannon ball after another whistled by and struck the earthwork  a soldier  or a gun
pierre  who had not noticed these sounds before  now heard nothing else
on the right of the battery soldiers shouting  hurrah   were running not forwards but backwards  it seemed to pierre
a cannon ball struck the very end of the earth work by which he was standing  crumbling down the earth  a black ball flashed before his eyes and at the same instant plumped into something
some militiamen who were entering the battery ran back
 all with grapeshot   shouted the officer
the sergeant ran up to the officer and in a frightened whisper informed him  as a butler at dinner informs his master that there is no more of some wine asked for  that there were no more charges  the scoundrels  what are they doing   shouted the officer  turning to pierre
the officer s face was red and perspiring and his eyes glittered under his frowning brow
 run to the reserves and bring up the ammunition boxes   he yelled  angrily avoiding pierre with his eyes and speaking to his men
 i ll go   said pierre
the officer  without answering him  strode across to the opposite side
 don t fire   
wait   he shouted
the man who had been ordered to go for ammunition stumbled against pierre
 eh  sir  this is no place for you   said he  and ran down the slope
pierre ran after him  avoiding the spot where the young officer was sitting
one cannon ball  another  and a third flew over him  falling in front  beside  and behind him
pierre ran down the slope
 where am i going   he suddenly asked himself when he was already near the green ammunition wagons he halted irresolutely  not knowing whether to return or go on
suddenly a terrible concussion threw him backwards to the ground
at the same instant he was dazzled by a great flash of flame  and immediately a deafening roar  crackling  and whistling made his ears tingle
when he came to himself he was sitting on the ground leaning on his hands  the ammunition wagons he had been approaching no longer existed  only charred green boards and rags littered the scorched grass  and a horse  dangling fragments of its shaft behind it  galloped past  while another horse lay  like pierre  on the ground  uttering prolonged and piercing cries beside himself with terror pierre jumped up and ran back to the battery  as to the only refuge from the horrors that surrounded him on entering the earthwork he noticed that there were men doing something there but that no shots were being fired from the battery
he had no time to realize who these men were
he saw the senior officer lying on the earth wall with his back turned as if he were examining something down below and that one of the soldiers he had noticed before was struggling forward shouting  brothers   and trying to free himself from some men who were holding him by the arm he also saw something else that was strange
but he had not time to realize that the colonel had been killed  that the soldier shouting  brothers   was a prisoner  and that another man had been bayoneted in the back before his eyes  for hardly had he run into the redoubt before a thin  sallow faced  perspiring man in a blue uniform rushed on him sword in hand  shouting something
instinctively guarding against the shock for they had been running together at full speed before they saw one another pierre put out his hands and seized the man  a french officer  by the shoulder with one hand and by the throat with the other
the officer  dropping his sword  seized pierre by his collar
for some seconds they gazed with frightened eyes at one another s unfamiliar faces and both were perplexed at what they had done and what they were to do next
 am i taken prisoner or have i taken him prisoner   each was thinking
but the french officer was evidently more inclined to think he had been taken prisoner because pierre s strong hand  impelled by instinctive fear  squeezed his throat ever tighter and tighter
the frenchman was about to say something  when just above their heads  terrible and low  a cannon ball whistled  and it seemed to pierre that the french officer s head had been torn off  so swiftly had he ducked it
pierre too bent his head and let his hands fall
without further thought as to who had taken whom prisoner  the frenchman ran back to the battery and pierre ran down the slope stumbling over the dead and wounded who  it seemed to him  caught at his feet
but before he reached the foot of the knoll he was met by a dense crowd of russian soldiers who  stumbling  tripping up  and shouting  ran merrily and wildly toward the battery
 this was the attack for which ermolov claimed the credit  declaring that only his courage and good luck made such a feat possible  it was the attack in which he was said to have thrown some st
george s crosses he had in his pocket into the battery for the first soldiers to take who got there   the french who had occupied the battery fled  and our troops shouting  hurrah   pursued them so far beyond the battery that it was difficult to call them back
the prisoners were brought down from the battery and among them was a wounded french general  whom the officers surrounded
crowds of wounded  some known to pierre and some unknown russians and french  with faces distorted by suffering  walked  crawled  and were carried on stretchers from the battery pierre again went up onto the knoll where he had spent over an hour  and of that family circle which had received him as a member he did not find a single one
there were many dead whom he did not know  but some he recognized
the young officer still sat in the same way  bent double  in a pool of blood at the edge of the earth wall
the red faced man was still twitching  but they did not carry him away
pierre ran down the slope once more
 now they will stop it  now they will be horrified at what they have done   he thought  aimlessly going toward a crowd of stretcher bearers moving from the battlefield but behind the veil of smoke the sun was still high  and in front and especially to the left  near semenovsk  something seemed to be seething in the smoke  and the roar of cannon and musketry did not diminish  but even increased to desperation like a man who  straining himself  shrieks with all his remaining strength the chief action of the battle of borodino was fought within the seven thousand feet between borodino and bagration s fleches
beyond that space there was  on the one side  a demonstration made by the russians with uvarov s cavalry at midday  and on the other side  beyond utitsa  poniatowski s collision with tuchkov  but these two were detached and feeble actions in comparison with what took place in the center of the battlefield
on the field between borodino and the fleches  beside the wood  the chief action of the day took place on an open space visible from both sides and was fought in the simplest and most artless way
the battle began on both sides with a cannonade from several hundred guns
then when the whole field was covered with smoke  two divisions  campan s and dessaix s  advanced from the french right  while murat s troops advanced on borodino from their left
from the shevardino redoubt where napoleon was standing the fleches were two thirds of a mile away  and it was more than a mile as the crow flies to borodino  so that napoleon could not see what was happening there  especially as the smoke mingling with the mist hid the whole locality
the soldiers of dessaix s division advancing against the fleches could only be seen till they had entered the hollow that lay between them and the fleches
as soon as they had descended into that hollow  the smoke of the guns and musketry on the fleches grew so dense that it covered the whole approach on that side of it
through the smoke glimpses could be caught of something black  probably men and at times the glint of bayonets
but whether they were moving or stationary  whether they were french or russian  could not be discovered from the shevardino redoubt
the sun had risen brightly and its slanting rays struck straight into napoleon s face as  shading his eyes with his hand  he looked at the fleches
the smoke spread out before them  and at times it looked as if the smoke were moving  at times as if the troops moved
sometimes shouts were heard through the firing  but it was impossible to tell what was being done there
napoleon  standing on the knoll  looked through a field glass  and in its small circlet saw smoke and men  sometimes his own and sometimes russians  but when he looked again with the naked eye  he could not tell where what he had seen was
he descended the knoll and began walking up and down before it
occasionally he stopped  listened to the firing  and gazed intently at the battlefield
but not only was it impossible to make out what was happening from where he was standing down below  or from the knoll above on which some of his generals had taken their stand  but even from the fleches themselves in which by this time there were now russian and now french soldiers  alternately or together  dead  wounded  alive  frightened  or maddened even at those fleches themselves it was impossible to make out what was taking place there for several hours amid incessant cannon and musketry fire  now russians were seen alone  now frenchmen alone  now infantry  and now cavalry  they appeared  fired  fell  collided  not knowing what to do with one another  screamed  and ran back again
from the battlefield adjutants he had sent out  and orderlies from his marshals  kept galloping up to napoleon with reports of the progress of the action  but all these reports were false  both because it was impossible in the heat of battle to say what was happening at any given moment and because many of the adjutants did not go to the actual place of conflict but reported what they had heard from others  and also because while an adjutant was riding more than a mile to napoleon circumstances changed and the news he brought was already becoming false thus an adjutant galloped up from murat with tidings that borodino had been occupied and the bridge over the kolocha was in the hands of the french
the adjutant asked whether napoleon wished the troops to cross it  napoleon gave orders that the troops should form up on the farther side and wait
but before that order was given almost as soon in fact as the adjutant had left borodino the bridge had been retaken by the russians and burned  in the very skirmish at which pierre had been present at the beginning of the battle
an adjutant galloped up from the fleches with a pale and frightened face and reported to napoleon that their attack had been repulsed  campan wounded  and davout killed  yet at the very time the adjutant had been told that the french had been repulsed  the fleches had in fact been recaptured by other french troops  and davout was alive and only slightly bruised
on the basis of these necessarily untrustworthy reports napoleon gave his orders  which had either been executed before he gave them or could not be and were not executed
the marshals and generals  who were nearer to the field of battle but  like napoleon  did not take part in the actual fighting and only occasionally went within musket range  made their own arrangements without asking napoleon and issued orders where and in what direction to fire and where cavalry should gallop and infantry should run
but even their orders  like napoleon s  were seldom carried out  and then but partially
for the most part things happened contrary to their orders
soldiers ordered to advance ran back on meeting grapeshot  soldiers ordered to remain where they were  suddenly  seeing russians unexpectedly before them  sometimes rushed back and sometimes forward  and the cavalry dashed without orders in pursuit of the flying russians
in this way two cavalry regiments galloped through the semenovsk hollow and as soon as they reached the top of the incline turned round and galloped full speed back again
the infantry moved in the same way  sometimes running to quite other places than those they were ordered to go to
all orders as to where and when to move the guns  when to send infantry to shoot or horsemen to ride down the russian infantry all such orders were given by the officers on the spot nearest to the units concerned  without asking either ney  davout  or murat  much less napoleon
they did not fear getting into trouble for not fulfilling orders or for acting on their own initiative  for in battle what is at stake is what is dearest to man his own life and it sometimes seems that safety lies in running back  sometimes in running forward  and these men who were right in the heat of the battle acted according to the mood of the moment in reality  however  all these movements forward and backward did not improve or alter the position of the troops
all their rushing and galloping at one another did little harm  the harm of disablement and death was caused by the balls and bullets that flew over the fields on which these men were floundering about
as soon as they left the place where the balls and bullets were flying about  their superiors  located in the background  re formed them and brought them under discipline and under the influence of that discipline led them back to the zone of fire  where under the influence of fear of death they lost their discipline and rushed about according to the chance promptings of the throng
napoleon s generals davout  ney  and murat  who were near that region of fire and sometimes even entered it repeatedly led into it huge masses of well ordered troops
but contrary to what had always happened in their former battles  instead of the news they expected of the enemy s flight  these orderly masses returned thence as disorganized and terrified mobs
the generals reformed them  but their numbers constantly decreased
in the middle of the day murat sent his adjutant to napoleon to demand reinforcements
napoleon sat at the foot of the knoll  drinking punch  when murat s adjutant galloped up with an assurance that the russians would be routed if his majesty would let him have another division
 reinforcements   said napoleon in a tone of stern surprise  looking at the adjutant a handsome lad with long black curls arranged like murat s own  as though he did not understand his words
 reinforcements   thought napoleon to himself  how can they need reinforcements when they already have half the army directed against a weak  unentrenched russian wing    tell the king of naples   said he sternly   that it is not noon yet  and i don t yet see my chessboard clearly
go      the handsome boy adjutant with the long hair sighed deeply without removing his hand from his hat and galloped back to where men were being slaughtered
napoleon rose and having summoned caulaincourt and berthier began talking to them about matters unconnected with the battle
in the midst of this conversation  which was beginning to interest napoleon  berthier s eyes turned to look at a general with a suite  who was galloping toward the knoll on a lathering horse
it was belliard
having dismounted he went up to the emperor with rapid strides and in a loud voice began boldly demonstrating the necessity of sending reinforcements
he swore on his honor that the russians were lost if the emperor would give another division
napoleon shrugged his shoulders and continued to pace up and down without replying
belliard began talking loudly and eagerly to the generals of the suite around him
 you are very fiery  belliard   said napoleon  when he again came up to the general
 in the heat of a battle it is easy to make a mistake
go and have another look and then come back to me   before belliard was out of sight  a messenger from another part of the battlefield galloped up
 now then  what do you want   asked napoleon in the tone of a man irritated at being continually disturbed
 sire  the prince     began the adjutant
 asks for reinforcements   said napoleon with an angry gesture
the adjutant bent his head affirmatively and began to report  but the emperor turned from him  took a couple of steps  stopped  came back  and called berthier
 we must give reserves   he said  moving his arms slightly apart  who do you think should be sent there   he asked of berthier  whom he subsequently termed  that gosling i have made an eagle  
 send claparede s division  sire   replied berthier  who knew all the division s regiments  and battalions by heart
napoleon nodded assent
the adjutant galloped to claparede s division and a few minutes later the young guards stationed behind the knoll moved forward
napoleon gazed silently in that direction
 no   he suddenly said to berthier
 i can t send claparede
send friant s division   though there was no advantage in sending friant s division instead of claparede s  and even an obvious inconvenience and delay in stopping claparede and sending friant now  the order was carried out exactly
napoleon did not notice that in regard to his army he was playing the part of a doctor who hinders by his medicines a role he so justly understood and condemned
friant s division disappeared as the others had done into the smoke of the battlefield
from all sides adjutants continued to arrive at a gallop and as if by agreement all said the same thing
they all asked for reinforcements and all said that the russians were holding their positions and maintaining a hellish fire under which the french army was melting away
napoleon sat on a campstool  wrapped in thought
m
de beausset  the man so fond of travel  having fasted since morning  came up to the emperor and ventured respectfully to suggest lunch to his majesty
 i hope i may now congratulate your majesty on a victory   said he
napoleon silently shook his head in negation
assuming the negation to refer only to the victory and not to the lunch  m
de beausset ventured with respectful jocularity to remark that there is no reason for not having lunch when one can get it
 go away     exclaimed napoleon suddenly and morosely  and turned aside
a beatific smile of regret  repentance  and ecstasy beamed on m
de beausset s face and he glided away to the other generals
napoleon was experiencing a feeling of depression like that of an ever lucky gambler who  after recklessly flinging money about and always winning  suddenly just when he has calculated all the chances of the game  finds that the more he considers his play the more surely he loses
his troops were the same  his generals the same  the same preparations had been made  the same dispositions  and the same proclamation courte et energique  he himself was still the same  he knew that and knew that he was now even more experienced and skillful than before even the enemy was the same as at austerlitz and friedland yet the terrible stroke of his arm had supernaturally become impotent
all the old methods that had been unfailingly crowned with success  the concentration of batteries on one point  an attack by reserves to break the enemy s line  and a cavalry attack by  the men of iron   all these methods had already been employed  yet not only was there no victory  but from all sides came the same news of generals killed and wounded  of reinforcements needed  of the impossibility of driving back the russians  and of disorganization among his own troops
formerly  after he had given two or three orders and uttered a few phrases  marshals and adjutants had come galloping up with congratulations and happy faces  announcing the trophies taken  the corps of prisoners  bundles of enemy eagles and standards  cannon and stores  and murat had only begged leave to loose the cavalry to gather in the baggage wagons
so it had been at lodi  marengo  arcola  jena  austerlitz  wagram  and so on
but now something strange was happening to his troops
despite news of the capture of the fleches  napoleon saw that this was not the same  not at all the same  as what had happened in his former battles
he saw that what he was feeling was felt by all the men about him experienced in the art of war
all their faces looked dejected  and they all shunned one another s eyes only a de beausset could fail to grasp the meaning of what was happening
but napoleon with his long experience of war well knew the meaning of a battle not gained by the attacking side in eight hours  after all efforts had been expended
he knew that it was a lost battle and that the least accident might now with the fight balanced on such a strained center destroy him and his army
when he ran his mind over the whole of this strange russian campaign in which not one battle had been won  and in which not a flag  or cannon  or army corps had been captured in two months  when he looked at the concealed depression on the faces around him and heard reports of the russians still holding their ground a terrible feeling like a nightmare took possession of him  and all the unlucky accidents that might destroy him occurred to his mind
the russians might fall on his left wing  might break through his center  he himself might be killed by a stray cannon ball all this was possible
in former battles he had only considered the possibilities of success  but now innumerable unlucky chances presented themselves  and he expected them all yes  it was like a dream in which a man fancies that a ruffian is coming to attack him  and raises his arm to strike that ruffian a terrible blow which he knows should annihilate him  but then feels that his arm drops powerless and limp like a rag  and the horror of unavoidable destruction seizes him in his helplessness
the news that the russians were attacking the left flank of the french army aroused that horror in napoleon
he sat silently on a campstool below the knoll  with head bowed and elbows on his knees
berthier approached and suggested that they should ride along the line to ascertain the position of affairs
 what  what do you say   asked napoleon
 yes  tell them to bring me my horse   he mounted and rode toward semenovsk
amid the powder smoke  slowly dispersing over the whole space through which napoleon rode  horses and men were lying in pools of blood  singly or in heaps
neither napoleon nor any of his generals had ever before seen such horrors or so many slain in such a small area
the roar of guns  that had not ceased for ten hours  wearied the ear and gave a peculiar significance to the spectacle  as music does to tableaux vivants
napoleon rode up the high ground at semenovsk  and through the smoke saw ranks of men in uniforms of a color unfamiliar to him they were russians
the russians stood in serried ranks behind semenovsk village and its knoll  and their guns boomed incessantly along their line and sent forth clouds of smoke
it was no longer a battle  it was a continuous slaughter which could be of no avail either to the french or the russians
napoleon stopped his horse and again fell into the reverie from which berthier had aroused him
he could not stop what was going on before him and around him and was supposed to be directed by him and to depend on him  and from its lack of success this affair  for the first time  seemed to him unnecessary and horrible
one of the generals rode up to napoleon and ventured to offer to lead the old guard into action
ney and berthier  standing near napoleon  exchanged looks and smiled contemptuously at this general s senseless offer
napoleon bowed his head and remained silent a long time
 at eight hundred leagues from france  i will not have my guard destroyed   he said  and turning his horse rode back to shevardino
on the rug covered bench where pierre had seen him in the morning sat kutuzov  his gray head hanging  his heavy body relaxed
he gave no orders  but only assented to or dissented from what others suggested
 yes  yes  do that   he replied to various proposals
 yes  yes  go  dear boy  and have a look   he would say to one or another of those about him  or   no  don t  we d better wait   he listened to the reports that were brought him and gave directions when his subordinates demanded that of him  but when listening to the reports it seemed as if he were not interested in the import of the words spoken  but rather in something else in the expression of face and tone of voice of those who were reporting
by long years of military experience he knew  and with the wisdom of age understood  that it is impossible for one man to direct hundreds of thousands of others struggling with death  and he knew that the result of a battle is decided not by the orders of a commander in chief  nor the place where the troops are stationed  nor by the number of cannon or of slaughtered men  but by that intangible force called the spirit of the army  and he watched this force and guided it in as far as that was in his power
kutuzov s general expression was one of concentrated quiet attention  and his face wore a strained look as if he found it difficult to master the fatigue of his old and feeble body
at eleven o clock they brought him news that the fleches captured by the french had been retaken  but that prince bagration was wounded
kutuzov groaned and swayed his head
 ride over to prince peter ivanovich and find out about it exactly   he said to one of his adjutants  and then turned to the duke of wurttemberg who was standing behind him
 will your highness please take command of the first army   soon after the duke s departure before he could possibly have reached semenovsk his adjutant came back from him and told kutuzov that the duke asked for more troops
kutuzov made a grimace and sent an order to dokhturov to take over the command of the first army  and a request to the duke whom he said he could not spare at such an important moment to return to him
when they brought him news that murat had been taken prisoner  and the staff officers congratulated him  kutuzov smiled
 wait a little  gentlemen   said he
 the battle is won  and there is nothing extraordinary in the capture of murat
still  it is better to wait before we rejoice   but he sent an adjutant to take the news round the army
when scherbinin came galloping from the left flank with news that the french had captured the fleches and the village of semenovsk  kutuzov  guessing by the sounds of the battle and by scherbinin s looks that the news was bad  rose as if to stretch his legs and  taking scherbinin s arm  led him aside  go  my dear fellow   he said to ermolov   and see whether something can t be done   kutuzov was in gorki  near the center of the russian position
the attack directed by napoleon against our left flank had been several times repulsed
in the center the french had not got beyond borodino  and on their left flank uvarov s cavalry had put the french to flight
toward three o clock the french attacks ceased
on the faces of all who came from the field of battle  and of those who stood around him  kutuzov noticed an expression of extreme tension
he was satisfied with the day s success a success exceeding his expectations  but the old man s strength was failing him
several times his head dropped low as if it were falling and he dozed off
dinner was brought him
adjutant general wolzogen  the man who when riding past prince andrew had said   the war should be extended widely   and whom bagration so detested  rode up while kutuzov was at dinner
wolzogen had come from barclay de tolly to report on the progress of affairs on the left flank
the sagacious barclay de tolly  seeing crowds of wounded men running back and the disordered rear of the army  weighed all the circumstances  concluded that the battle was lost  and sent his favorite officer to the commander in chief with that news kutuzov was chewing a piece of roast chicken with difficulty and glanced at wolzogen with eyes that brightened under their puckering lids
wolzogen  nonchalantly stretching his legs  approached kutuzov with a half  contemptuous smile on his lips  scarcely touching the peak of his cap he treated his serene highness with a somewhat affected nonchalance intended to show that  as a highly trained military man  he left it to russians to make an idol of this useless old man  but that he knew whom he was dealing with
 der alte herr   as in their own set the germans called kutuzov   is making himself very comfortable   thought wolzogen  and looking severely at the dishes in front of kutuzov he began to report to  the old gentleman  the position of affairs on the left flank as barclay had ordered him to and as he himself had seen and understood it  all the points of our position are in the enemy s hands and we cannot dislodge them for lack of troops  the men are running away and it is impossible to stop them   he reported
kutuzov ceased chewing and fixed an astonished gaze on wolzogen  as if not understanding what was said to him
wolzogen  noticing  the old gentleman s  agitation  said with a smile   i have not considered it right to conceal from your serene highness what i have seen
the troops are in complete disorder      you have seen  you have seen      kutuzov shouted
frowning and rising quickly  he went up to wolzogen
 how  
how dare you      he shouted  choking and making a threatening gesture with his trembling arms   how dare you  sir  say that to me  you know nothing about it tell general barclay from me that his information is incorrect and that the real course of the battle is better known to me  the commander in chief  than to him   wolzogen was about to make a rejoinder  but kutuzov interrupted him
 the enemy has been repulsed on the left and defeated on the right flank
if you have seen amiss  sir  do not allow yourself to say what you don t know  be so good as to ride to general barclay and inform him of my firm intention to attack the enemy tomorrow   said kutuzov sternly
all were silent  and the only sound audible was the heavy breathing of the panting old general
 they are repulsed everywhere  for which i thank god and our brave army  the enemy is beaten  and tomorrow we shall drive him from the sacred soil of russia   said kutuzov crossing himself  and he suddenly sobbed as his eyes filled with tears wolzogen  shrugging his shoulders and curling his lips  stepped silently aside  marveling at  the old gentleman s  conceited stupidity
 ah  here he is  my hero   said kutuzov to a portly  handsome  dark haired general who was just ascending the knoll
this was raevski  who had spent the whole day at the most important part of the field of borodino
raevski reported that the troops were firmly holding their ground and that the french no longer ventured to attack
after hearing him  kutuzov said in french   then you do not think  like some others  that we must retreat    on the contrary  your highness  in indecisive actions it is always the most stubborn who remain victors   replied raevski   and in my opinion      kaysarov   kutuzov called to his adjutant
 sit down and write out the order of the day for tomorrow
and you   he continued  addressing another   ride along the line and announce that tomorrow we attack   while kutuzov was talking to raevski and dictating the order of the day  wolzogen returned from barclay and said that general barclay wished to have written confirmation of the order the field marshal had given
kutuzov  without looking at wolzogen  gave directions for the order to be written out which the former commander in chief  to avoid personal responsibility  very judiciously wished to receive
and by means of that mysterious indefinable bond which maintains throughout an army one and the same temper  known as  the spirit of the army   and which constitutes the sinew of war  kutuzov s words  his order for a battle next day  immediately became known from one end of the army to the other
it was far from being the same words or the same order that reached the farthest links of that chain
the tales passing from mouth to mouth at different ends of the army did not even resemble what kutuzov had said  but the sense of his words spread everywhere because what he said was not the outcome of cunning calculations  but of a feeling that lay in the commander in chief s soul as in that of every russian
and on learning that tomorrow they were to attack the enemy  and hearing from the highest quarters a confirmation of what they wanted to believe  the exhausted  wavering men felt comforted and inspirited
prince andrew s regiment was among the reserves which till after one o clock were stationed inactive behind semenovsk  under heavy artillery fire
toward two o clock the regiment  having already lost more than two hundred men  was moved forward into a trampled oatfield in the gap between semenovsk and the knoll battery  where thousands of men perished that day and on which an intense  concentrated fire from several hundred enemy guns was directed between one and two o clock
without moving from that spot or firing a single shot the regiment here lost another third of its men
from in front and especially from the right  in the unlifting smoke the guns boomed  and out of the mysterious domain of smoke that overlay the whole space in front  quick hissing cannon balls and slow whistling shells flew unceasingly
at times  as if to allow them a respite  a quarter of an hour passed during which the cannon balls and shells all flew overhead  but sometimes several men were torn from the regiment in a minute and the slain were continually being dragged away and the wounded carried off
with each fresh blow less and less chance of life remained for those not yet killed
the regiment stood in columns of battalion  three hundred paces apart  but nevertheless the men were always in one and the same mood
all alike were taciturn and morose
talk was rarely heard in the ranks  and it ceased altogether every time the thud of a successful shot and the cry of  stretchers   was heard most of the time  by their officers  order  the men sat on the ground
one  having taken off his shako  carefully loosened the gathers of its lining and drew them tight again  another  rubbing some dry clay between his palms  polished his bayonet  another fingered the strap and pulled the buckle of his bandolier  while another smoothed and refolded his leg bands and put his boots on again some built little houses of the tufts in the plowed ground  or plaited baskets from the straw in the cornfield
all seemed fully absorbed in these pursuits
when men were killed or wounded  when rows of stretchers went past  when some troops retreated  and when great masses of the enemy came into view through the smoke  no one paid any attention to these things but when our artillery or cavalry advanced or some of our infantry were seen to move forward  words of approval were heard on all sides
but the liveliest attention was attracted by occurrences quite apart from  and unconnected with  the battle
it was as if the minds of these morally exhausted men found relief in everyday  commonplace occurrences
a battery of artillery was passing in front of the regiment
the horse of an ammunition cart put its leg over a trace
 hey  look at the trace horse   
get her leg out  she ll fall   
ah  they don t see it   came identical shouts from the ranks all along the regiment
another time  general attention was attracted by a small brown dog  coming heaven knows whence  which trotted in a preoccupied manner in front of the ranks with tail stiffly erect till suddenly a shell fell close by  when it yelped  tucked its tail between its legs  and darted aside
yells and shrieks of laughter rose from the whole regiment
but such distractions lasted only a moment  and for eight hours the men had been inactive  without food  in constant fear of death  and their pale and gloomy faces grew ever paler and gloomier
prince andrew  pale and gloomy like everyone in the regiment  paced up and down from the border of one patch to another  at the edge of the meadow beside an oatfield  with head bowed and arms behind his back there was nothing for him to do and no orders to be given
everything went on of itself
the killed were dragged from the front  the wounded carried away  and the ranks closed up
if any soldiers ran to the rear they returned immediately and hastily
at first prince andrew  considering it his duty to rouse the courage of the men and to set them an example  walked about among the ranks  but he soon became convinced that this was unnecessary and that there was nothing he could teach them
all the powers of his soul  as of every soldier there  were unconsciously bent on avoiding the contemplation of the horrors of their situation
he walked along the meadow  dragging his feet  rustling the grass  and gazing at the dust that covered his boots  now he took big strides trying to keep to the footprints left on the meadow by the mowers  then he counted his steps  calculating how often he must walk from one strip to another to walk a mile  then he stripped the flowers from the wormwood that grew along a boundary rut  rubbed them in his palms  and smelled their pungent  sweetly bitter scent nothing remained of the previous day s thoughts
he thought of nothing
he listened with weary ears to the ever recurring sounds  distinguishing the whistle of flying projectiles from the booming of the reports  glanced at the tiresomely familiar faces of the men of the first battalion  and waited
 here it comes  
this one is coming our way again   he thought  listening to an approaching whistle in the hidden region of smoke
 one  another  again  it has hit      he stopped and looked at the ranks
 no  it has gone over
but this one has hit   and again he started trying to reach the boundary strip in sixteen paces
a whizz and a thud  five paces from him  a cannon ball tore up the dry earth and disappeared
a chill ran down his back
again he glanced at the ranks
probably many had been hit a large crowd had gathered near the second battalion
 adjutant   he shouted
 order them not to crowd together   the adjutant  having obeyed this instruction  approached prince andrew
from the other side a battalion commander rode up
 look out   came a frightened cry from a soldier and  like a bird whirring in rapid flight and alighting on the ground  a shell dropped with little noise within two steps of prince andrew and close to the battalion commander s horse
the horse first  regardless of whether it was right or wrong to show fear  snorted  reared almost throwing the major  and galloped aside
the horse s terror infected the men
 lie down   cried the adjutant  throwing himself flat on the ground prince andrew hesitated
the smoking shell spun like a top between him and the prostrate adjutant  near a wormwood plant between the field and the meadow
 can this be death   thought prince andrew  looking with a quite new  envious glance at the grass  the wormwood  and the streamlet of smoke that curled up from the rotating black ball
 i cannot  i do not wish to die
i love life i love this grass  this earth  this air      he thought this  and at the same time remembered that people were looking at him
 it s shameful  sir   he said to the adjutant
 what     he did not finish speaking
at one and the same moment came the sound of an explosion  a whistle of splinters as from a breaking window frame  a suffocating smell of powder  and prince andrew started to one side  raising his arm  and fell on his chest
several officers ran up to him
from the right side of his abdomen  blood was welling out making a large stain on the grass
the militiamen with stretchers who were called up stood behind the officers prince andrew lay on his chest with his face in the grass  breathing heavily and noisily
 what are you waiting for  come along   the peasants went up and took him by his shoulders and legs  but he moaned piteously and  exchanging looks  they set him down again
 pick him up  lift him  it s all the same   cried someone
they again took him by the shoulders and laid him on the stretcher  ah  god  my god  what is it  the stomach  that means death  my god    voices among the officers were heard saying
 it flew a hair s breadth past my ear   said the adjutant
the peasants  adjusting the stretcher to their shoulders  started hurriedly along the path they had trodden down  to the dressing station  keep in step  ah  
those peasants   shouted an officer  seizing by their shoulders and checking the peasants  who were walking unevenly and jolting the stretcher  get into step  fedor  
i say  fedor   said the foremost peasant
 now that s right   said the one behind joyfully  when he had got into step
 your excellency  eh  prince   said the trembling voice of timokhin  who had run up and was looking down on the stretcher prince andrew opened his eyes and looked up at the speaker from the stretcher into which his head had sunk deep and again his eyelids drooped the militiamen carried prince andrew to the dressing station by the wood  where wagons were stationed
the dressing station consisted of three tents with flaps turned back  pitched at the edge of a birch wood
in the wood  wagons and horses were standing
the horses were eating oats from their movable troughs and sparrows flew down and pecked the grains that fell
some crows  scenting blood  flew among the birch trees cawing impatiently
around the tents  over more than five acres  bloodstained men in various garbs stood  sat  or lay
around the wounded stood crowds of soldier stretcher bearers with dismal and attentive faces  whom the officers keeping order tried in vain to drive from the spot disregarding the officers  orders  the soldiers stood leaning against their stretchers and gazing intently  as if trying to comprehend the difficult problem of what was taking place before them from the tents came now loud angry cries and now plaintive groans
occasionally dressers ran out to fetch water  or to point out those who were to be brought in next the wounded men awaiting their turn outside the tents groaned  sighed  wept  screamed  swore  or asked for vodka
some were delirious
prince andrew s bearers  stepping over the wounded who had not yet been bandaged  took him  as a regimental commander  close up to one of the tents and there stopped  awaiting instructions
prince andrew opened his eyes and for a long time could not make out what was going on around him
he remembered the meadow  the wormwood  the field  the whirling black ball  and his sudden rush of passionate love of life
two steps from him  leaning against a branch and talking loudly and attracting general attention  stood a tall  handsome  black  haired noncommissioned officer with a bandaged head
he had been wounded in the head and leg by bullets
around him  eagerly listening to his talk  a crowd of wounded and stretcher bearers was gathered  we kicked him out from there so that he chucked everything  we grabbed the king himself   cried he  looking around him with eyes that glittered with fever  if only reserves had come up just then  lads  there wouldn t have been nothing left of him  i tell you surely     like all the others near the speaker  prince andrew looked at him with shining eyes and experienced a sense of comfort
 but isn t it all the same now   thought he
 and what will be there  and what has there been here  why was i so reluctant to part with life  there was something in this life i did not and do not understand   one of the doctors came out of the tent in a bloodstained apron  holding a cigar between the thumb and little finger of one of his small bloodstained hands  so as not to smear it
he raised his head and looked about him  but above the level of the wounded men
he evidently wanted a little respite
after turning his head from right to left for some time  he sighed and looked down
 all right  immediately   he replied to a dresser who pointed prince andrew out to him  and he told them to carry him into the tent
murmurs arose among the wounded who were waiting
 it seems that even in the next world only the gentry are to have a chance   remarked one prince andrew was carried in and laid on a table that had only just been cleared and which a dresser was washing down
prince andrew could not make out distinctly what was in that tent
the pitiful groans from all sides and the torturing pain in his thigh  stomach  and back distracted him
all he saw about him merged into a general impression of naked  bleeding human bodies that seemed to fill the whole of the low tent  as a few weeks previously  on that hot august day  such bodies had filled the dirty pond beside the smolensk road
yes  it was the same flesh  the same chair a canon  the sight of which had even then filled him with horror  as by a presentiment
there were three operating tables in the tent
two were occupied  and on the third they placed prince andrew
for a little while he was left alone and involuntarily witnessed what was taking place on the other two tables
on the nearest one sat a tartar  probably a cossack  judging by the uniform thrown down beside him
four soldiers were holding him  and a spectacled doctor was cutting into his muscular brown back
 ooh  ooh  ooh   grunted the tartar  and suddenly lifting up his swarthy snub  nosed face with its high cheekbones  and baring his white teeth  he began to wriggle and twitch his body and utter piercing  ringing  and prolonged yells
on the other table  round which many people were crowding  a tall well fed man lay on his back with his head thrown back
his curly hair  its color  and the shape of his head seemed strangely familiar to prince andrew
several dressers were pressing on his chest to hold him down
one large  white  plump leg twitched rapidly all the time with a feverish tremor
the man was sobbing and choking convulsively
two doctors one of whom was pale and trembling  were silently doing something to this man s other  gory leg
when he had finished with the tartar  whom they covered with an overcoat  the spectacled doctor came up to prince andrew  wiping his hands
he glanced at prince andrew s face and quickly turned away
 undress him  what are you waiting for   he cried angrily to the dressers
his very first  remotest recollections of childhood came back to prince andrew s mind when the dresser with sleeves rolled up began hastily to undo the buttons of his clothes and undressed him
the doctor bent down over the wound  felt it  and sighed deeply
then he made a sign to someone  and the torturing pain in his abdomen caused prince andrew to lose consciousness
when he came to himself the splintered portions of his thighbone had been extracted  the torn flesh cut away  and the wound bandaged water was being sprinkled on his face
as soon as prince andrew opened his eyes  the doctor bent over  kissed him silently on the lips  and hurried away
after the sufferings he had been enduring  prince andrew enjoyed a blissful feeling such as he had not experienced for a long time
all the best and happiest moments of his life especially his earliest childhood  when he used to be undressed and put to bed  and when leaning over him his nurse sang him to sleep and he  burying his head in the pillow  felt happy in the mere consciousness of life returned to his memory  not merely as something past but as something present
the doctors were busily engaged with the wounded man the shape of whose head seemed familiar to prince andrew  they were lifting him up and trying to quiet him
 show it to me   
oh  ooh  
oh  oh  ooh   his frightened moans could be heard  subdued by suffering and broken by sobs
hearing those moans prince andrew wanted to weep
whether because he was dying without glory  or because he was sorry to part with life  or because of those memories of a childhood that could not return  or because he was suffering and others were suffering and that man near him was groaning so piteously he felt like weeping childlike  kindly  and almost happy tears
the wounded man was shown his amputated leg stained with clotted blood and with the boot still on
 oh  oh  ooh   he sobbed  like a woman
the doctor who had been standing beside him  preventing prince andrew from seeing his face  moved away
 my god  what is this  why is he here   said prince andrew to himself in the miserable  sobbing  enfeebled man whose leg had just been amputated  he recognized anatole kuragin
men were supporting him in their arms and offering him a glass of water  but his trembling  swollen lips could not grasp its rim anatole was sobbing painfully
 yes  it is he  yes  that man is somehow closely and painfully connected with me   thought prince andrew  not yet clearly grasping what he saw before him
 what is the connection of that man with my childhood and life   he asked himself without finding an answer and suddenly a new unexpected memory from that realm of pure and loving childhood presented itself to him
he remembered natasha as he had seen her for the first time at the ball in 1810  with her slender neck and arms and with a frightened happy face ready for rapture  and love and tenderness for her  stronger and more vivid than ever  awoke in his soul he now remembered the connection that existed between himself and this man who was dimly gazing at him through tears that filled his swollen eyes he remembered everything  and ecstatic pity and love for that man overflowed his happy heart
prince andrew could no longer restrain himself and wept tender loving tears for his fellow men  for himself  and for his own and their errors  compassion  love of our brothers  for those who love us and for those who hate us  love of our enemies  yes  that love which god preached on earth and which princess mary taught me and i did not understand that is what made me sorry to part with life  that is what remained for me had i lived
but now it is too late
i know it   the terrible spectacle of the battlefield covered with dead and wounded  together with the heaviness of his head and the news that some twenty generals he knew personally had been killed or wounded  and the consciousness of the impotence of his once mighty arm  produced an unexpected impression on napoleon who usually liked to look at the killed and wounded  thereby  he considered  testing his strength of mind
this day the horrible appearance of the battlefield overcame that strength of mind which he thought constituted his merit and his greatness
he rode hurriedly from the battlefield and returned to the shevardino knoll  where he sat on his campstool  his sallow face swollen and heavy  his eyes dim  his nose red  and his voice hoarse  involuntarily listening  with downcast eyes  to the sounds of firing
with painful dejection he awaited the end of this action  in which he regarded himself as a participant and which he was unable to arrest a personal  human feeling for a brief moment got the better of the artificial phantasm of life he had served so long
he felt in his own person the sufferings and death he had witnessed on the battlefield
the heaviness of his head and chest reminded him of the possibility of suffering and death for himself at that moment he did not desire moscow  or victory  or glory  what need had he for any more glory  
the one thing he wished for was rest  tranquillity  and freedom
but when he had been on the semenovsk heights the artillery commander had proposed to him to bring several batteries of artillery up to those heights to strengthen the fire on the russian troops crowded in front of knyazkovo
napoleon had assented and had given orders that news should be brought to him of the effect those batteries produced
an adjutant came now to inform him that the fire of two hundred guns had been concentrated on the russians  as he had ordered  but that they still held their ground
 our fire is mowing them down by rows  but still they hold on   said the adjutant
 they want more      said napoleon in a hoarse voice
 sire   asked the adjutant who had not heard the remark
 they want more   croaked napoleon frowning
 let them have it   even before he gave that order the thing he did not desire  and for which he gave the order only because he thought it was expected of him  was being done
and he fell back into that artificial realm of imaginary greatness  and again as a horse walking a treadmill thinks it is doing something for itself  he submissively fulfilled the cruel  sad  gloomy  and inhuman role predestined for him
and not for that day and hour alone were the mind and conscience darkened of this man on whom the responsibility for what was happening lay more than on all the others who took part in it
never to the end of his life could he understand goodness  beauty  or truth  or the significance of his actions which were too contrary to goodness and truth  too remote from everything human  for him ever to be able to grasp their meaning
he could not disavow his actions  belauded as they were by half the world  and so he had to repudiate truth  goodness  and all humanity
not only on that day  as he rode over the battlefield strewn with men killed and maimed  by his will as he believed   did he reckon as he looked at them how many russians there were for each frenchman and  deceiving himself  find reason for rejoicing in the calculation that there were five russians for every frenchman not on that day alone did he write in a letter to paris that  the battle field was superb   because fifty thousand corpses lay there  but even on the island of st
helena in the peaceful solitude where he said he intended to devote his leisure to an account of the great deeds he had done  he wrote  the russian war should have been the most popular war of modern times  it was a war of good sense  for real interests  for the tranquillity and security of all  it was purely pacific and conservative
it was a war for a great cause  the end of uncertainties and the beginning of security
a new horizon and new labors were opening out  full of well being and prosperity for all
the european system was already founded  all that remained was to organize it
satisfied on these great points and with tranquility everywhere  i too should have had my congress and my holy alliance
those ideas were stolen from me
in that reunion of great sovereigns we should have discussed our interests like one family  and have rendered account to the peoples as clerk to master
europe would in this way soon have been  in fact  but one people  and anyone who traveled anywhere would have found himself always in the common fatherland i should have demanded the freedom of all navigable rivers for everybody  that the seas should be common to all  and that the great standing armies should be reduced henceforth to mere guards for the sovereigns
on returning to france  to the bosom of the great  strong  magnificent  peaceful  and glorious fatherland  i should have proclaimed her frontiers immutable  all future wars purely defensive  all aggrandizement antinational
i should have associated my son in the empire  my dictatorship would have been finished  and his constitutional reign would have begun
paris would have been the capital of the world  and the french the envy of the nations  my leisure then  and my old age  would have been devoted  in company with the empress and during the royal apprenticeship of my son  to leisurely visiting  with our own horses and like a true country couple  every corner of the empire  receiving complaints  redressing wrongs  and scattering public buildings and benefactions on all sides and everywhere
napoleon  predestined by providence for the gloomy role of executioner of the peoples  assured himself that the aim of his actions had been the peoples  welfare and that he could control the fate of millions and by the employment of power confer benefactions  of four hundred thousand who crossed the vistula   he wrote further of the russian war   half were austrians  prussians  saxons  poles  bavarians  wurttembergers  mecklenburgers  spaniards  italians  and neapolitans
the imperial army  strictly speaking  was one third composed of dutch  belgians  men from the borders of the rhine  piedmontese  swiss  genevese  tuscans  romans  inhabitants of the thirty second military division  of bremen  of hamburg  and so on  it included scarcely a hundred and forty thousand who spoke french
the russian expedition actually cost france less than fifty thousand men  the russian army in its retreat from vilna to moscow lost in the various battles four times more men than the french army  the burning of moscow cost the lives of a hundred thousand russians who died of cold and want in the woods  finally  in its march from moscow to the oder the russian army also suffered from the severity of the season  so that by the time it reached vilna it numbered only fifty thousand  and at kalisch less than eighteen thousand   he imagined that the war with russia came about by his will  and the horrors that occurred did not stagger his soul
he boldly took the whole responsibility for what happened  and his darkened mind found justification in the belief that among the hundreds of thousands who perished there were fewer frenchmen than hessians and bavarians
several tens of thousands of the slain lay in diverse postures and various uniforms on the fields and meadows belonging to the davydov family and to the crown serfs those fields and meadows where for hundreds of years the peasants of borodino  gorki  shevardino  and semenovsk had reaped their harvests and pastured their cattle at the dressing stations the grass and earth were soaked with blood for a space of some three acres around
crowds of men of various arms  wounded and unwounded  with frightened faces  dragged themselves back to mozhaysk from the one army and back to valuevo from the other other crowds  exhausted and hungry  went forward led by their officers
others held their ground and continued to fire
over the whole field  previously so gaily beautiful with the glitter of bayonets and cloudlets of smoke in the morning sun  there now spread a mist of damp and smoke and a strange acid smell of saltpeter and blood
clouds gathered and drops of rain began to fall on the dead and wounded  on the frightened  exhausted  and hesitating men  as if to say   enough  men  enough  cease  
bethink yourselves  what are you doing   to the men of both sides alike  worn out by want of food and rest  it began equally to appear doubtful whether they should continue to slaughter one another  all the faces expressed hesitation  and the question arose in every soul   for what  for whom  must i kill and be killed   
you may go and kill whom you please  but i don t want to do so anymore   by evening this thought had ripened in every soul
at any moment these men might have been seized with horror at what they were doing and might have thrown up everything and run away anywhere
but though toward the end of the battle the men felt all the horror of what they were doing  though they would have been glad to leave off  some incomprehensible  mysterious power continued to control them  and they still brought up the charges  loaded  aimed  and applied the match  though only one artilleryman survived out of every three  and though they stumbled and panted with fatigue  perspiring and stained with blood and powder
the cannon balls flew just as swiftly and cruelly from both sides  crushing human bodies  and that terrible work which was not done by the will of a man but at the will of him who governs men and worlds continued
anyone looking at the disorganized rear of the russian army would have said that  if only the french made one more slight effort  it would disappear  and anyone looking at the rear of the french army would have said that the russians need only make one more slight effort and the french would be destroyed
but neither the french nor the russians made that effort  and the flame of battle burned slowly out
the russians did not make that effort because they were not attacking the french
at the beginning of the battle they stood blocking the way to moscow and they still did so at the end of the battle as at the beginning
but even had the aim of the russians been to drive the french from their positions  they could not have made this last effort  for all the russian troops had been broken up  there was no part of the russian army that had not suffered in the battle  and though still holding their positions they had lost one half of their army
the french  with the memory of all their former victories during fifteen years  with the assurance of napoleon s invincibility  with the consciousness that they had captured part of the battlefield and had lost only a quarter of their men and still had their guards intact  twenty thousand strong  might easily have made that effort
the french who had attacked the russian army in order to drive it from its position ought to have made that effort  for as long as the russians continued to block the road to moscow as before  the aim of the french had not been attained and all their efforts and losses were in vain
but the french did not make that effort
some historians say that napoleon need only have used his old guards  who were intact  and the battle would have been won
to speak of what would have happened had napoleon sent his guards is like talking of what would happen if autumn became spring
it could not be
napoleon did not give his guards  not because he did not want to  but because it could not be done
all the generals  officers  and soldiers of the french army knew it could not be done  because the flagging spirit of the troops would not permit it
it was not napoleon alone who had experienced that nightmare feeling of the mighty arm being stricken powerless  but all the generals and soldiers of his army whether they had taken part in the battle or not  after all their experience of previous battles when after one tenth of such efforts the enemy had fled  experienced a similar feeling of terror before an enemy who  after losing half his men  stood as threateningly at the end as at the beginning of the battle
the moral force of the attacking french army was exhausted
not that sort of victory which is defined by the capture of pieces of material fastened to sticks  called standards  and of the ground on which the troops had stood and were standing  but a moral victory that convinces the enemy of the moral superiority of his opponent and of his own impotence was gained by the russians at borodino
the french invaders  like an infuriated animal that has in its onslaught received a mortal wound  felt that they were perishing  but could not stop  any more than the russian army  weaker by one half  could help swerving
by impetus gained  the french army was still able to roll forward to moscow  but there  without further effort on the part of the russians  it had to perish  bleeding from the mortal wound it had received at borodino
the direct consequence of the battle of borodino was napoleon s senseless flight from moscow  his retreat along the old smolensk road  the destruction of the invading army of five hundred thousand men  and the downfall of napoleonic france  on which at borodino for the first time the hand of an opponent of stronger spirit had been laid
