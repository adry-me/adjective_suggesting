in september levin moved to moscow for kitty s confinement
he had spent a whole month in moscow with nothing to do  when sergey ivanovitch  who had property in the kashinsky province  and took great interest in the question of the approaching elections  made ready to set off to the elections
he invited his brother  who had a vote in the seleznevsky district  to come with him
levin had  moreover  to transact in kashin some extremely important business relating to the wardship of land and to the receiving of certain redemption money for his sister  who was abroad
levin still hesitated  but kitty  who saw that he was bored in moscow  and urged him to go  on her own authority ordered him the proper nobleman s uniform  costing seven pounds
and that seven pounds paid for the uniform was the chief cause that finally decided levin to go
he went to kashin   
levin had been six days in kashin  visiting the assembly each day  and busily engaged about his sister s business  which still dragged on
the district marshals of nobility were all occupied with the elections  and it was impossible anna karenina 1395 of 1759 to get the simplest thing done that depended upon the court of wardship
the other matter  the payment of the sums due  was met too by difficulties after long negotiations over the legal details  the money was at last ready to be paid  but the notary  a most obliging person  could not hand over the order  because it must have the signature of the president  and the president  though he had not given over his duties to a deputy  was at the elections
all these worrying negotiations  this endless going from place to place  and talking with pleasant and excellent people  who quite saw the unpleasantness of the petitioner s position  but were powerless to assist him all these efforts that yielded no result  led to a feeling of misery in levin akin to the mortifying helplessness one experiences in dreams when one tries to use physical force he felt this frequently as he talked to his most goodnatured solicitor
this solicitor did  it seemed  everything possible  and strained every nerve to get him out of his difficulties
 i tell you what you might try   he said more than once   go to so and so and so and so   and the solicitor drew up a regular plan for getting round the fatal point that hindered everything
but he would add immediately   it ll mean some delay  anyway  but you might try it   and levin did try  and did go
everyone was anna karenina 1396 of 1759 kind and civil  but the point evaded seemed to crop up again in the end  and again to bar the way
what was particularly trying  was that levin could not make out with whom he was struggling  to whose interest it was that his business should not be done
that no one seemed to know  the solicitor certainly did not know
if levin could have understood why  just as he saw why one can only approach the booking office of a railway station in single file  it would not have been so vexatious and tiresome to him
but with the hindrances that confronted him in his business  no one could explain why they existed
but levin had changed a good deal since his marriage  he was patient  and if he could not see why it was all arranged like this  he told himself that he could not judge without knowing all about it  and that most likely it must be so  and he tried not to fret in attending the elections  too  and taking part in them  he tried now not to judge  not to fall foul of them  but to comprehend as fully as he could the question which was so earnestly and ardently absorbing honest and excellent men whom he respected
since his marriage there had been revealed to levin so many new and serious aspects of life that had previously  through his frivolous attitude to anna karenina 1397 of 1759 them  seemed of no importance  that in the question of the elections too he assumed and tried to find some serious significance
sergey ivanovitch explained to him the meaning and object of the proposed revolution at the elections
the marshal of the province in whose hands the law had placed the control of so many important public functions the guardianship of wards  the very department which was giving levin so much trouble just now   the disposal of large sums subscribed by the nobility of the province  the high schools  female  male  and military  and popular instruction on the new model  and finally  the district council the marshal of the province  snetkov  was a nobleman of the old school  dissipating an immense fortune  a good hearted man  honest after his own fashion  but utterly without any comprehension of the needs of modern days he always took  in every question  the side of the nobility  he was positively antagonistic to the spread of popular education  and he succeeded in giving a purely party character to the district council which ought by rights to be of such an immense importance
what was needed was to put in his place a fresh  capable  perfectly modern man  of contemporary ideas  and to frame their policy so as from the rights conferred upon the nobles  not anna karenina 1398 of 1759 as the nobility  but as an element of the district council  to extract all the powers of self government that could possibly be derived from them
in the wealthy kashinsky province  which always took the lead of other provinces in everything  there was now such a preponderance of forces that this policy  once carried through properly there  might serve as a model for other provinces for all russia
and hence the whole question was of the greatest importance
it was proposed to elect as marshal in place of snetkov either sviazhsky  or  better still  nevyedovsky  a former university professor  a man of remarkable intelligence and a great friend of sergey ivanovitch
the meeting was opened by the governor  who made a speech to the nobles  urging them to elect the public functionaries  not from regard for persons  but for the service and welfare of their fatherland  and hoping that the honorable nobility of the kashinsky province would  as at all former elections  hold their duty as sacred  and vindicate the exalted confidence of the monarch
when he had finished with his speech  the governor walked out of the hall  and the noblemen noisily and eagerly some even enthusiastically  followed him and thronged round him while he put on his fur coat and conversed amicably with the marshal of the province
anna karenina 1399 of 1759 levin  anxious to see into everything and not to miss anything  stood there too in the crowd  and heard the governor say   please tell marya ivanovna my wife is very sorry she couldn t come to the home   and thereupon the nobles in high good humor sorted out their fur coats and all drove off to the cathedral
in the cathedral levin  lifting his hand like the rest and repeating the words of the archdeacon  swore with most terrible oaths to do all the governor had hoped they would do
church services always affected levin  and as he uttered the words  i kiss the cross   and glanced round at the crowd of young and old men repeating the same  he felt touched
on the second and third days there was business relating to the finances of the nobility and the female high school  of no importance whatever  as sergey ivanovitch explained  and levin  busy seeing after his own affairs  did not attend the meetings
on the fourth day the auditing of the marshal s accounts took place at the high table of the marshal of the province
and then there occurred the first skirmish between the new party and the old
the committee who had been deputed to verify the accounts reported to the meeting that all was in order
the marshal of the province got up  thanked the nobility for their anna karenina 1400 of 1759 confidence  and shed tears
the nobles gave him a loud welcome  and shook hands with him
but at that instant a nobleman of sergey ivanovitch s party said that he had heard that the committee had not verified the accounts  considering such a verification an insult to the marshal of the province
one of the members of the committee incautiously admitted this
then a small gentleman  very young looking but very malignant  began to say that it would probably be agreeable to the marshal of the province to give an account of his expenditures of the public moneys  and that the misplaced delicacy of the members of the committee was depriving him of this moral satisfaction
then the members of the committee tried to withdraw their admission  and sergey ivanovitch began to prove that they must logically admit either that they had verified the accounts or that they had not  and he developed this dilemma in detail
sergey ivanovitch was answered by the spokesman of the opposite party
then sviazhsky spoke  and then the malignant gentleman again
the discussion lasted a long time and ended in nothing
levin was surprised that they should dispute upon this subject so long  especially as  when he asked sergey ivanovitch whether he supposed that money had been misappropriated  sergey ivanovitch answered  anna karenina 1401 of 1759  oh  no  he s an honest man
but those old fashioned methods of paternal family arrangements in the management of provincial affairs must be broken down   on the fifth day came the elections of the district marshals
it was rather a stormy day in several districts
in the seleznevsky district sviazhsky was elected unanimously without a ballot  and he gave a dinner that evening
anna karenina 1402 of 1759 the sixth day was fixed for the election of the marshal of the province
the rooms  large and small  were full of noblemen in all sorts of uniforms many had come only for that day
men who had not seen each other for years  some from the crimea  some from petersburg  some from abroad  met in the rooms of the hall of nobility there was much discussion around the governor s table under the portrait of the tsar
the nobles  both in the larger and the smaller rooms  grouped themselves in camps  and from their hostile and suspicious glances  from the silence that fell upon them when outsiders approached a group  and from the way that some  whispering together  retreated to the farther corridor  it was evident that each side had secrets from the other in appearance the noblemen were sharply divided into two classes  the old and the new
the old were for the most part either in old uniforms of the nobility  buttoned up closely  with spurs and hats  or in their own special naval  cavalry  infantry  or official uniforms the uniforms of the older men were embroidered in the old  anna karenina 1403 of 1759 fashioned way with epaulets on their shoulders  they were unmistakably tight and short in the waist  as though their wearers had grown out of them the younger men wore the uniform of the nobility with long waists and broad shoulders  unbuttoned over white waistcoats  or uniforms with black collars and with the embroidered badges of justices of the peace to the younger men belonged the court uniforms that here and there brightened up the crowd but the division into young and old did not correspond with the division of parties
some of the young men  as levin observed  belonged to the old party  and some of the very oldest noblemen  on the contrary  were whispering with sviazhsky  and were evidently ardent partisans of the new party
levin stood in the smaller room  where they were smoking and taking light refreshments  close to his own friends  and listening to what they were saying  he conscientiously exerted all his intelligence trying to understand what was said
sergey ivanovitch was the center round which the others grouped themselves he was listening at that moment to sviazhsky and hliustov  the marshal of another district  who belonged to their party
hliustov would not agree to go with his district to anna karenina 1404 of 1759 ask snetkov to stand  while sviazhsky was persuading him to do so  and sergey ivanovitch was approving of the plan
levin could not make out why the opposition was to ask the marshal to stand whom they wanted to supersede
stepan arkadyevitch  who had just been drinking and taking some lunch  came up to them in his uniform of a gentleman of the bedchamber  wiping his lips with a perfumed handkerchief of bordered batiste
 we are placing our forces   he said  pulling out his whiskers   sergey ivanovitch   and listening to the conversation  he supported sviazhsky s contention
 one district s enough  and sviazhsky s obviously of the opposition   he said  words evidently intelligible to all except levin
 why  kostya  you here too  i suppose you re converted  eh   he added  turning to levin and drawing his arm through his
levin would have been glad indeed to be converted  but could not make out what the point was  and retreating a few steps from the speakers  he explained to stepan arkadyevitch his inability to understand why the marshal of the province should be asked to stand
anna karenina 1405 of 1759  o sancta simplicitas   said stepan arkadyevitch  and briefly and clearly he explained it to levin
if  as at previous elections  all the districts asked the marshal of the province to stand  then he would be elected without a ballot
that must not be
now eight districts had agreed to call upon him  if two refused to do so  snetkov might decline to stand at all  and then the old party might choose another of their party  which would throw them completely out in their reckoning
but if only one district  sviazhsky s  did not call upon him to stand  snetkov would let himself be balloted for they were even  some of them  going to vote for him  and purposely to let him get a good many votes  so that the enemy might be thrown off the scent  and when a candidate of the other side was put up  they too might give him some votes
levin understood to some extent  but not fully  and would have put a few more questions  when suddenly everyone began talking and making a noise and they moved towards the big room
 what is it  eh  whom    no guarantee  whose  what    they won t pass him    no guarantee    they won t let flerov in    eh  because of the charge against him    why  at this rate  they won t admit anyone
it s a swindle    the law   levin heard exclamations on all sides  and he moved anna karenina 1406 of 1759 into the big room together with the others  all hurrying somewhere and afraid of missing something
squeezed by the crowding noblemen  he drew near the high table where the marshal of the province  sviazhsky  and the other leaders were hotly disputing about something
anna karenina 1407 of 1759 levin was standing rather far off
a nobleman breathing heavily and hoarsely at his side  and another whose thick boots were creaking  prevented him from hearing distinctly
he could only hear the soft voice of the marshal faintly  then the shrill voice of the malignant gentleman  and then the voice of sviazhsky
they were disputing  as far as he could make out  as to the interpretation to be put on the act and the exact meaning of the words   liable to be called up for trial   the crowd parted to make way for sergey ivanovitch approaching the table
sergey ivanovitch  waiting till the malignant gentleman had finished speaking  said that he thought the best solution would be to refer to the act itself  and asked the secretary to find the act
the act said that in case of difference of opinion  there must be a ballot
sergey ivanovitch read the act and began to explain its meaning  but at that point a tall  stout  round shouldered landowner  with dyed whiskers  in a tight uniform that cut the back of his neck  interrupted him
he went up to the table  and striking it with his finger ring  he shouted anna karenina 1408 of 1759 loudly   a ballot  put it to the vote  no need for more talking   then several voices began to talk all at once  and the tall nobleman with the ring  getting more and more exasperated  shouted more and more loudly
but it was impossible to make out what he said
he was shouting for the very course sergey ivanovitch had proposed  but it was evident that he hated him and all his party  and this feeling of hatred spread through the whole party and roused in opposition to it the same vindictiveness  though in a more seemly form  on the other side
shouts were raised  and for a moment all was confusion  so that the marshal of the province had to call for order
 a ballot  a ballot  every nobleman sees it  we shed our blood for our country   
the confidence of the monarch   
no checking the accounts of the marshal  he s not a cashier   
but that s not the point   
votes  please  beastly      shouted furious and violent voices on all sides
looks and faces were even more violent and furious than their words
they expressed the most implacable hatred
levin did not in the least understand what was the matter  and he marveled at the passion with which it was disputed whether or not the decision about flerov should be put to the vote
he forgot  as sergey ivanovitch explained to him anna karenina 1409 of 1759 afterwards  this syllogism  that it was necessary for the public good to get rid of the marshal of the province  that to get rid of the marshal it was necessary to have a majority of votes  that to get a majority of votes it was necessary to secure flerov s right to vote  that to secure the recognition of flerov s right to vote they must decide on the interpretation to be put on the act
 and one vote may decide the whole question and one must be serious and consecutive  if one wants to be of use in public life   concluded sergey ivanovitch
but levin forgot all that  and it was painful to him to see all these excellent persons  for whom he had a respect  in such an unpleasant and vicious state of excitement
to escape from this painful feeling he went away into the other room where there was nobody except the waiters at the refreshment bar
seeing the waiters busy over washing up the crockery and setting in order their plates and wine glasses  seeing their calm and cheerful faces  levin felt an unexpected sense of relief as though he had come out of a stuffy room into the fresh air
he began walking up and down  looking with pleasure at the waiters
he particularly liked the way one gray whiskered waiter  who showed his scorn for the other younger ones and was jeered at by them  was teaching them how to fold up napkins properly
anna karenina 1410 of 1759 levin was just about to enter into conversation with the old waiter  when the secretary of the court of wardship  a little old man whose specialty it was to know all the noblemen of the province by name and patronymic  drew him away
 please come  konstantin dmitrievitch   he said   your brother s looking for you
they are voting on the legal point   levin walked into the room  received a white ball  and followed his brother  sergey ivanovitch  to the table where sviazhsky was standing with a significant and ironical face  holding his beard in his fist and sniffing at it
sergey ivanovitch put his hand into the box  put the ball somewhere  and making room for levin  stopped
levin advanced  but utterly forgetting what he was to do  and much embarrassed  he turned to sergey ivanovitch with the question   where am i to put it   he asked this softly  at a moment when there was talking going on near  so that he had hoped his question would not be overheard
but the persons speaking paused  and his improper question was overheard
sergey ivanovitch frowned
 that is a matter for each man s own decision   he said severely
anna karenina 1411 of 1759 several people smiled
levin crimsoned  hurriedly thrust his hand under the cloth  and put the ball to the right as it was in his right hand having put it in  he recollected that he ought to have thrust his left hand too  and so he thrust it in though too late  and  still more overcome with confusion  he beat a hasty retreat into the background
 a hundred and twenty six for admission  ninety eight against   sang out the voice of the secretary  who could not pronounce the letter r
then there was a laugh  a button and two nuts were found in the box
the nobleman was allowed the right to vote  and the new party had conquered
but the old party did not consider themselves conquered levin heard that they were asking snetkov to stand  and he saw that a crowd of noblemen was surrounding the marshal  who was saying something
levin went nearer
in reply snetkov spoke of the trust the noblemen of the province had placed in him  the affection they had shown him  which he did not deserve  as his only merit had been his attachment to the nobility  to whom he had devoted twelve years of service
several times he repeated the words   i have served to the best of my powers with truth and good faith  i value your goodness anna karenina 1412 of 1759 and thank you   and suddenly he stopped short from the tears that choked him  and went out of the room
whether these tears came from a sense of the injustice being done him  from his love for the nobility  or from the strain of the position he was placed in  feeling himself surrounded by enemies  his emotion infected the assembly  the majority were touched  and levin felt a tenderness for snetkov in the doorway the marshal of the province jostled against levin
 beg pardon  excuse me  please   he said as to a stranger  but recognizing levin  he smiled timidly
it seemed to levin that he would have liked to say something  but could not speak for emotion
his face and his whole figure in his uniform with the crosses  and white trousers striped with braid  as he moved hurriedly along  reminded levin of some hunted beast who sees that he is in evil case
this expression in the marshal s face was particularly touching to levin  because  only the day before  he had been at his house about his trustee business and had seen him in all his grandeur  a kind hearted  fatherly man
the big house with the old family furniture  the rather dirty  far from stylish  but respectful footmen  unmistakably old house serfs who had stuck to their anna karenina 1413 of 1759 master  the stout  good natured wife in a cap with lace and a turkish shawl  petting her pretty grandchild  her daughter s daughter  the young son  a sixth form high school boy  coming home from school  and greeting his father  kissing his big hand  the genuine  cordial words and gestures of the old man all this had the day before roused an instinctive feeling of respect and sympathy in levin
this old man was a touching and pathetic figure to levin now  and he longed to say something pleasant to him
 so you re sure to be our marshal again   he said
 it s not likely   said the marshal  looking round with a scared expression
 i m worn out  i m old
if there are men younger and more deserving than i  let them serve   and the marshal disappeared through a side door
the most solemn moment was at hand
they were to proceed immediately to the election
the leaders of both parties were reckoning white and black on their fingers
the discussion upon flerov had given the new party not only flerov s vote  but had also gained time for them  so that they could send to fetch three noblemen who had been rendered unable to take part in the elections by the wiles of the other party two noble gentlemen  who had a weakness for strong drink  had been made drunk by the anna karenina 1414 of 1759 partisans of snetkov  and a third had been robbed of his uniform
on learning this  the new party had made haste  during the dispute about flerov  to send some of their men in a sledge to clothe the stripped gentleman  and to bring along one of the intoxicated to the meeting
 i ve brought one  drenched him with water   said the landowner  who had gone on this errand  to sviazhsky
 he s all right  he ll do    not too drunk  he won t fall down   said sviazhsky  shaking his head
 no  he s first rate
if only they don t give him any more here   
i ve told the waiter not to give him anything on any account   anna karenina 1415 of 1759 the narrow room  in which they were smoking and taking refresh  ments  was full of noblemen
the excitement grew more intense  and every face betrayed some uneasiness
the excitement was specially keen for the leaders of each party  who knew every detail  and had reckoned up every vote
they were the generals organizing the approaching battle
the rest  like the rank and file before an engagement  though they were getting ready for the fight  sought for other distractions in the interval
some were lunching  standing at the bar  or sitting at the table  others were walking up and down the long room  smoking cigarettes  and talking with friends whom they had not seen for a long while
levin did not care to eat  and he was not smoking  he did not want to join his own friends  that is sergey ivanovitch  stepan arkadyevitch  sviazhsky and the rest  because vronsky in his equerry s uniform was standing with them in eager conversation
levin had seen him already at the meeting on the previous day  and he had studiously avoided him  not caring to greet him
he went to the window and sat down  scanning the groups  and anna karenina 1416 of 1759 listening to what was being said around him
he felt depressed  especially because everyone else was  as he saw  eager  anxious  and interested  and he alone  with an old  toothless little man with mumbling lips wearing a naval uniform  sitting beside him  had no interest in it and nothing to do
 he s such a blackguard  i have told him so  but it makes no difference
only think of it  he couldn t collect it in three years   he heard vigorously uttered by a roundshouldered  short  country gentleman  who had pomaded hair hanging on his embroidered collar  and new boots obviously put on for the occasion  with heels that tapped energetically as he spoke
casting a displeased glance at levin  this gentleman sharply turned his back
 yes  it s a dirty business  there s no denying   a small gentleman assented in a high voice
next  a whole crowd of country gentlemen  surrounding a stout general  hurriedly came near levin
these persons were unmistakably seeking a place where they could talk without being overheard
 how dare he say i had his breeches stolen  pawned them for drink  i expect
damn the fellow  prince indeed  he d better not say it  the beast   anna karenina 1417 of 1759  but excuse me  they take their stand on the act   was being said in another group   the wife must be registered as noble    oh  damn your acts  i speak from my heart
we re all gentlemen  aren t we  above suspicion    shall we go on  your excellency  fine champagne   another group was following a nobleman  who was shouting something in a loud voice  it was one of the three intoxicated gentlemen
 i always advised marya semyonovna to let for a fair rent  for she can never save a profit   he heard a pleasant voice say
the speaker was a country gentleman with gray whiskers  wearing the regimental uniform of an old general staff officer
it was the very landowner levin had met at sviazhsky s
he knew him at once
the landowner too stared at levin  and they exchanged greetings
 very glad to see you  to be sure  i remember you very well
last year at our district marshal  nikolay ivanovitch s    well  and how is your land doing   asked levin
 oh  still just the same  always at a loss   the landowner answered with a resigned smile  but with an expression of serenity and conviction that so it must be
 and how do you come to be in our province   he asked
 come to take part in our coup d etat   he said  confidently pronouncing anna karenina 1418 of 1759 the french words with a bad accent
 all russia s here  gentlemen of the bedchamber  and everything short of the ministry   he pointed to the imposing figure of stepan arkadyevitch in white trousers and his court uniform  walking by with a general
 i ought to own that i don t very well understand the drift of the provincial elections   said levin
the landowner looked at him
 why  what is there to understand  there s no meaning in it at all
it s a decaying institution that goes on running only by the force of inertia
just look  the very uniforms tell you that it s an assembly of justices of the peace  permanent members of the court  and so on  but not of noblemen    then why do you come   asked levin  from habit  nothing else
then  too  one must keep up connections
it s a moral obligation of a sort
and then  to tell the truth  there s one s own interests
my son inlaw wants to stand as a permanent member  they re not rich people  and he must be brought forward
these gentlemen  now  what do they come for   he said  pointing to the malignant gentleman  who was talking at the high table
 that s the new generation of nobility   anna karenina 1419 of 1759  new it may be  but nobility it isn t
they re proprietors of a sort  but we re the landowners
as noblemen  they re cutting their own throats    but you say it s an institution that s served its time    that it may be  but still it ought to be treated a little more respectfully
snetkov  now   we may be of use  or we may not  but we re the growth of a thousand years
if we re laying out a garden  planning one before the house  you know  and there you ve a tree that s stood for centuries in the very spot   
old and gnarled it may be  and yet you don t cut down the old fellow to make room for the flowerbeds  but lay out your beds so as to take advantage of the tree
you won t grow him again in a year   he said cautiously  and he immediately changed the conversation
 well  and how is your land doing    oh  not very well
i make five per cent    yes  but you don t reckon your own work
aren t you worth something too  i ll tell you my own case
before i took to seeing after the land  i had a salary of three hundred pounds from the service
now i do more work than i did in the service  and like you i get five per cent on the land  and thank god for that
but one s work is thrown in for nothing    then why do you do it  if it s a clear loss   anna karenina 1420 of 1759  oh  well  one does it  what would you have  it s habit  and one knows it s how it should be
and what s more   the landowner went on  leaning his elbows on the window and chatting on   my son  i must tell you  has no taste for it
there s no doubt he ll be a scientific man
so there ll be no one to keep it up
and yet one does it
here this year i ve planted an orchard    yes  yes   said levin   that s perfectly true
i always feel there s no real balance of gain in my work on the land  and yet one does it   
it s a sort of duty one feels to the land    but i tell you what   the landowner pursued   a neighbor of mine  a merchant  was at my place
we walked about the fields and the garden
 no   said he   stepan vassilievitch  everything s well looked after  but your garden s neglected   but  as a fact  it s well kept up
 to my thinking  i d cut down that lime tree
here you ve thousands of limes  and each would make two good bundles of bark
and nowadays that bark s worth something
i d cut down the lot      and with what he made he d increase his stock  or buy some land for a trifle  and let it out in lots to the peasants   levin added  smiling
he had evidently more than once come across those commercial calculations
 and he d anna karenina 1421 of 1759 make his fortune
but you and i must thank god if we keep what we ve got and leave it to our children    you re married  i ve heard   said the landowner
 yes   levin answered  with proud satisfaction
 yes  it s rather strange   he went on
 so we live without making anything  as though we were ancient vestals set to keep in a fire   the landowner chuckled under his white mustaches
 there are some among us  too  like our friend nikolay ivanovitch  or count vronsky  that s settled here lately  who try to carry on their husbandry as though it were a factory  but so far it leads to nothing but making away with capital on it    but why is it we don t do like the merchants  why don t we cut down our parks for timber   said levin  returning to a thought that had struck him
 why  as you said  to keep the fire in
besides that s not work for a nobleman
and our work as noblemen isn t done here at the elections  but yonder  each in our corner
there s a class instinct  too  of what one ought and oughtn t to do
there s the peasants  too  i wonder at them sometimes  any good peasant tries to take all the land he can
however bad the land is  he ll work it
without a return too
at a simple loss   anna karenina 1422 of 1759  just as we do   said levin
 very  very glad to have met you   he added  seeing sviazhsky approaching him
 and here we ve met for the first time since we met at your place   said the landowner to sviazhsky   and we ve had a good talk too    well  have you been attacking the new order of things   said sviazhsky with a smile
 that we re bound to do    you ve relieved your feelings   anna karenina 1423 of 1759 sviazhsky took levin s arm  and went with him to his own friends
this time there was no avoiding vronsky
he was standing with stepan arkadyevitch and sergey ivanovitch  and looking straight at levin as he drew near
 delighted  i believe i ve had the pleasure of meeting you   at princess shtcherbatskaya s   he said  giving levin his hand
 yes  i quite remember our meeting   said levin  and blushing crimson  he turned away immediately  and began talking to his brother with a slight smile vronsky went on talking to sviazhsky  obviously without the slightest inclination to enter into conversation with levin
but levin  as he talked to his brother  was continually looking round at vronsky  trying to think of something to say to him to gloss over his rudeness
 what are we waiting for now   asked levin  looking at sviazhsky and vronsky
 for snetkov
he has to refuse or to consent to stand   answered sviazhsky
 well  and what has he done  consented or not   anna karenina 1424 of 1759  that s the point  that he s done neither   said vronsky
 and if he refuses  who will stand then   asked levin  looking at vronsky
 whoever chooses to   said sviazhsky
 shall you   asked levin
 certainly not i   said sviazhsky  looking confused  and turning an alarmed glance at the malignant gentleman  who was standing beside sergey ivanovitch
 who then  nevyedovsky   said levin  feeling he was putting his foot into it
but this was worse still
nevyedovsky and sviazhsky were the two candidates
 i certainly shall not  under any circumstances   answered the malignant gentleman this was nevyedovsky himself sviazhsky introduced him to levin
 well  you find it exciting too   said stepan arkadyevitch  winking at vronsky
 it s something like a race
one might bet on it    yes  it is keenly exciting   said vronsky
 and once taking the thing up  one s eager to see it through
it s a fight   he said  scowling and setting his powerful jaws
 what a capable fellow sviazhsky is  sees it all so clearly   anna karenina 1425 of 1759  oh  yes   vronsky assented indifferently
a silence followed  during which vronsky since he had to look at something looked at levin  at his feet  at his uniform  then at his face  and noticing his gloomy eyes fixed upon him  he said  in order to say something   how is it that you  living constantly in the country  are not a justice of the peace  you are not in the uniform of one    it s because i consider that the justice of the peace is a silly institution   levin answered gloomily
he had been all the time looking for an opportunity to enter into conversation with vronsky  so as to smooth over his rudeness at their first meeting
 i don t think so  quite the contrary   vronsky said  with quiet surprise
 it s a plaything   levin cut him short
 we don t want justices of the peace
i ve never had a single thing to do with them during eight years
and what i have had was decided wrongly by them
the justice of the peace is over thirty miles from me
for some matter of two roubles i should have to send a lawyer  who costs me fifteen   and he related how a peasant had stolen some flour from the miller  and when the miller told him of it  had lodged a complaint for slander
all this was utterly anna karenina 1426 of 1759 uncalled for and stupid  and levin felt it himself as he said it  oh  this is such an original fellow   said stepan arkadyevitch with his most soothing  almond oil smile
 but come along  i think they re voting     and they separated
 i can t understand   said sergey ivanovitch  who had observed his brother s clumsiness   i can t understand how anyone can be so absolutely devoid of political tact that s where we russians are so deficient
the marshal of the province is our opponent  and with him you re ami cochon  and you beg him to stand
count vronsky  now    i m not making a friend of him  he s asked me to dinner  and i m not going  but he s one of our side why make an enemy of him  then you ask nevyedovsky if he s going to stand
that s not a thing to do    oh  i don t understand it at all  and it s all such nonsense   levin answered gloomily
 you say it s all such nonsense  but as soon as you have anything to do with it  you make a muddle   levin did not answer  and they walked together into the big room
the marshal of the province  though he was vaguely conscious in the air of some trap being prepared for him  anna karenina 1427 of 1759 and though he had not been called upon by all to stand  had still made up his mind to stand
all was silence in the room
the secretary announced in a loud voice that the captain of the guards  mihail stepanovitch snetkov  would now be balloted for as marshal of the province
the district marshals walked carrying plates  on which were balls  from their tables to the high table  and the election began
 put it in the right side   whispered stepan arkadyevitch  as with his brother levin followed the marshal of his district to the table
but levin had forgotten by now the calculations that had been explained to him  and was afraid stepan arkadyevitch might be mistaken in saying  the right side   surely snetkov was the enemy
as he went up  he held the ball in his right hand  but thinking he was wrong  just at the box he changed to the left hand  and undoubtedly put the ball to the left
an adept in the business  standing at the box and seeing by the mere action of the elbow where each put his ball  scowled with annoyance
it was no good for him to use his insight
everything was still  and the counting of the balls was heard
then a single voice rose and proclaimed the numbers for and against
the marshal had been voted for by a considerable majority
all was noise and eager anna karenina 1428 of 1759 movement towards the doors
snetkov came in  and the nobles thronged round him  congratulating him
 well  now is it over   levin asked sergey ivanovitch
 it s only just beginning   sviazhsky said  replying for sergey ivanovitch with a smile
 some other candidate may receive more votes than the marshal   levin had quite forgotten about that
now he could only remember that there was some sort of trickery in it  but he was too bored to think what it was exactly
he felt depressed  and longed to get out of the crowd
as no one was paying any attention to him  and no one apparently needed him  he quietly slipped away into the little room where the refreshments were  and again had a great sense of comfort when he saw the waiters
the little old waiter pressed him to have something  and levin agreed
after eating a cutlet with beans and talking to the waiters of their former masters  levin  not wishing to go back to the hall  where it was all so distasteful to him  proceeded to walk through the galleries
the galleries were full of fashionably dressed ladies  leaning over the balustrade and trying not to lose a single word of what was being said below
with the ladies were sitting and standing smart lawyers  high school teachers in spectacles  and officers
everywhere they were talking of the election  and anna karenina 1429 of 1759 of how worried the marshal was  and how splendid the discussions had been
in one group levin heard his brother s praises
one lady was telling a lawyer   how glad i am i heard koznishev  it s worth losing one s dinner
he s exquisite  so clear and distinct all of it  there s not one of you in the law courts that speaks like that
the only one is meidel  and he s not so eloquent by a long way   finding a free place  levin leaned over the balustrade and began looking and listening
all the noblemen were sitting railed off behind barriers according to their districts
in the middle of the room stood a man in a uniform  who shouted in a loud  high voice   as a candidate for the marshalship of the nobility of the province we call upon staff captain yevgeney ivanovitch apuhtin   a dead silence followed  and then a weak old voice was heard   declined    we call upon the privy councilor pyotr petrovitch bol   the voice began again
 declined   a high boyish voice replied
again it began  and again  declined   and so it went on for about an hour
levin  with his elbows on the balustrade  looked and listened
at first he wondered and anna karenina 1430 of 1759 wanted to know what it meant  then feeling sure that he could not make it out he began to be bored
then recalling all the excitement and vindictiveness he had seen on all the faces  he felt sad  he made up his mind to go  and went downstairs
as he passed through the entry to the galleries he met a dejected high school boy walking up and down with tired looking eyes
on the stairs he met a couple a lady running quickly on her high heels and the jaunty deputy prosecutor
 i told you you weren t late   the deputy prosecutor was saying at the moment when levin moved aside to let the lady pass
levin was on the stairs to the way out  and was just feeling in his waistcoat pocket for the number of his overcoat  when the secretary overtook him
 this way  please  konstantin dmitrievitch  they are voting   the candidate who was being voted on was nevyedovsky  who had so stoutly denied all idea of standing
levin went up to the door of the room  it was locked
the secretary knocked  the door opened  and levin was met by two red faced gentlemen  who darted out
anna karenina 1431 of 1759  i can t stand any more of it   said one red faced gentleman
after them the face of the marshal of the province was poked out
his face was dreadful looking from exhaustion and dismay
 i told you not to let any one out   he cried to the doorkeeper
 i let someone in  your excellency    mercy on us   and with a heavy sigh the marshal of the province walked with downcast head to the high table in the middle of the room  his legs staggering in his white trousers
nevyedovsky had scored a higher majority  as they had planned  and he was the new marshal of the province
many people were amused  many were pleased and happy  many were in ecstasies  many were disgusted and unhappy
the former marshal of the province was in a state of despair  which he could not conceal
when nevyedovsky went out of the room  the crowd thronged round him and followed him enthusiastically  just as they had followed the governor who had opened the meetings  and just as they had followed snetkov when he was elected
anna karenina 1432 of 1759 the newly elected marshal and many of the successful party dined that day with vronsky
vronsky had come to the elections partly because he was bored in the country and wanted to show anna his right to independence  and also to repay sviazhsky by his support at the election for all the trouble he had taken for vronsky at the district council election  but chiefly in order strictly to perform all those duties of a nobleman and landowner which he had taken upon himself but he had not in the least expected that the election would so interest him  so keenly excite him  and that he would be so good at this kind of thing
he was quite a new man in the circle of the nobility of the province  but his success was unmistakable  and he was not wrong in supposing that he had already obtained a certain influence
this influence was due to his wealth and reputation  the capital house in the town lent him by his old friend shirkov  who had a post in the department of finances and was director of a nourishing bank in kashin  the excellent cook vronsky had brought from the country  and his friendship with the governor  who was a schoolfellow of vronsky s a anna karenina 1433 of 1759 schoolfellow he had patronized and protected indeed
but what contributed more than all to his success was his direct  equable manner with everyone  which very quickly made the majority of the noblemen reverse the current opinion of his supposed haughtiness
he was himself conscious that  except that whimsical gentleman married to kitty shtcherbatskaya  who had a propos de bottes poured out a stream of irrelevant absurdities with such spiteful fury  every nobleman with whom he had made acquaintance had become his adherent he saw clearly  and other people recognized it  too  that he had done a great deal to secure the success of nevyedovsky
and now at his own table  celebrating nevyedovsky s election  he was experiencing an agreeable sense of triumph over the success of his candidate
the election itself had so fascinated him that  if he could succeed in getting married during the next three years  he began to think of standing himself much as after winning a race ridden by a jockey  he had longed to ride a race himself today he was celebrating the success of his jockey
vronsky sat at the head of the table  on his right hand sat the young governor  a general of high rank
to all the rest he was the chief man in the province  who had solemnly opened the elections with his speech  and aroused a feeling anna karenina 1434 of 1759 of respect and even of awe in many people  as vronsky saw  to vronsky he was little katka maslov that had been his nickname in the pages  corps whom he felt to be shy and tried to mettre a son aise
on the left hand sat nevyedovsky with his youthful  stubborn  and malignant face
with him vronsky was simple and deferential
sviazhsky took his failure very light heartedly
it was indeed no failure in his eyes  as he said himself  turning  glass in hand  to nevyedovsky  they could not have found a better representative of the new movement  which the nobility ought to follow and so every honest person  as he said  was on the side of today s success and was rejoicing over it
stepan arkadyevitch was glad  too  that he was having a good time  and that everyone was pleased
the episode of the elections served as a good occasion for a capital dinner
sviazhsky comically imitated the tearful discourse of the marshal  and observed  addressing nevyedovsky  that his excellency would have to select another more complicated method of auditing the accounts than tears
another nobleman jocosely described how footmen in stockings had been ordered for the marshal s ball  and how now they would have to be sent back unless the new marshal would give a ball with footmen in stockings
anna karenina 1435 of 1759 continually during dinner they said of nevyedovsky   our marshal   and  your excellency   this was said with the same pleasure with which a bride is called  madame  and her husband s name
nevyedovsky affected to be not merely indifferent but scornful of this appellation  but it was obvious that he was highly delighted  and had to keep a curb on himself not to betray the triumph which was unsuitable to their new liberal tone after dinner several telegrams were sent to people interested in the result of the election and stepan arkadyevitch  who was in high good humor  sent darya alexandrovna a telegram   nevyedovsky elected by twenty votes
congratulations
tell people   he dictated it aloud  saying   we must let them share our rejoicing   darya alexandrovna  getting the message  simply sighed over the rouble wasted on it  and understood that it was an afterdinner affair
she knew stiva had a weakness after dining for faire jouer le telegraphe
everything  together with the excellent dinner and the wine  not from russian merchants  but imported direct from abroad  was extremely dignified  simple  and enjoyable
the party some twenty had been selected by sviazhsky from among the more active new liberals  all anna karenina 1436 of 1759 of the same way of thinking  who were at the same time clever and well bred
they drank  also half in jest  to the health of the new marshal of the province  of the governor  of the bank director  and of  our amiable host   vronsky was satisfied
he had never expected to find so pleasant a tone in the provinces
towards the end of dinner it was still more lively
the governor asked vronsky to come to a concert for the benefit of the servians which his wife  who was anxious to make his acquaintance  had been getting up
 there ll be a ball  and you ll see the belle of the province
worth seeing  really    not in my line   vronsky answered
he liked that english phrase
but he smiled  and promised to come
before they rose from the table  when all of them were smoking  vronsky s valet went up to him with a letter on a tray
 from vozdvizhenskoe by special messenger   he said with a significant expression
 astonishing  how like he is to the deputy prosecutor sventitsky   said one of the guests in french of the valet  while vronsky  frowning  read the letter
the letter was from anna
before he read the letter  he knew its contents
expecting the elections to be over in anna karenina 1437 of 1759 five days  he had promised to be back on friday
today was saturday  and he knew that the letter contained reproaches for not being back at the time fixed
the letter he had sent the previous evening had probably not reached her yet
the letter was what he had expected  but the form of it was unexpected  and particularly disagreeable to him
 annie is very ill  the doctor says it may be inflammation
i am losing my head all alone
princess varvara is no help  but a hindrance
i expected you the day before yesterday  and yesterday  and now i am sending to find out where you are and what you are doing
i wanted to come myself  but thought better of it  knowing you would dislike it
send some answer  that i may know what to do   the child ill  yet she had thought of coming herself
their daughter ill  and this hostile tone
the innocent festivities over the election  and this gloomy  burdensome love to which he had to return struck vronsky by their contrast
but he had to go  and by the first train that night he set off home
anna karenina 1438 of 1759 before vronsky s departure for the elections  anna had reflected that the scenes constantly repeated between them each time he left home  might only make him cold to her instead of attaching him to her  and resolved to do all she could to control herself so as to bear the parting with composure
but the cold  severe glance with which he had looked at her when he came to tell her he was going had wounded her  and before he had started her peace of mind was destroyed
in solitude afterwards  thinking over that glance which had expressed his right to freedom  she came  as she always did  to the same point the sense of her own humiliation
 he has the right to go away when and where he chooses
not simply to go away  but to leave me
he has every right  and i have none
but knowing that  he ought not to do it
what has he done  though   
he looked at me with a cold  severe expression
of course that is something indefinable  impalpable  but it has never been so before  and that glance means a great deal   she thought
 that glance shows the beginning of indifference   anna karenina 1439 of 1759 and though she felt sure that a coldness was beginning  there was nothing she could do  she could not in any way alter her relations to him
just as before  only by love and by charm could she keep him
and so  just as before  only by occupation in the day  by morphine at night  could she stifle the fearful thought of what would be if he ceased to love her
it is true there was still one means  not to keep him for that she wanted nothing more than his love  but to be nearer to him  to be in such a position that he would not leave her
that means was divorce and marriage
and she began to long for that  and made up her mind to agree to it the first time he or stiva approached her on the subject
absorbed in such thoughts  she passed five days without him  the five days that he was to be at the elections
walks  conversation with princess varvara  visits to the hospital  and  most of all  reading reading of one book after another filled up her time
but on the sixth day  when the coachman came back without him  she felt that now she was utterly incapable of stifling the thought of him and of what he was doing there  just at that time her little girl was taken ill
anna began to look after her  but even that did not distract her mind  especially as the illness anna karenina 1440 of 1759 was not serious
however hard she tried  she could not love this little child  and to feign love was beyond her powers
towards the evening of that day  still alone  anna was in such a panic about him that she decided to start for the town  but on second thoughts wrote him the contradictory letter that vronsky received  and without reading it through  sent it off by a special messenger
the next morning she received his letter and regretted her own
she dreaded a repetition of the severe look he had flung at her at parting  especially when he knew that the baby was not dangerously ill
but still she was glad she had written to him
at this moment anna was positively admitting to herself that she was a burden to him  that he would relinquish his freedom regretfully to return to her  and in spite of that she was glad he was coming
let him weary of her  but he would be here with her  so that she would see him  would know of every action he took
she was sitting in the drawing room near a lamp  with a new volume of taine  and as she read  listening to the sound of the wind outside  and every minute expecting the carriage to arrive
several times she had fancied she heard the sound of wheels  but she had been mistaken
at last she heard not the sound of wheels  but the coachman s shout and the dull rumble in the covered entry
even anna karenina 1441 of 1759 princess varvara  playing patience  confirmed this  and anna  flushing hotly  got up  but instead of going down  as she had done twice before  she stood still
she suddenly felt ashamed of her duplicity  but even more she dreaded how he might meet her
all feeling of wounded pride had passed now  she was only afraid of the expression of his displeasure
she remembered that her child had been perfectly well again for the last two days
she felt positively vexed with her for getting better from the very moment her letter was sent off
then she thought of him  that he was here  all of him  with his hands  his eyes
she heard his voice
and forgetting everything  she ran joyfully to meet him
 well  how is annie   he said timidly from below  looking up to anna as she ran down to him
he was sitting on a chair  and a footman was pulling off his warm over boot
 oh  she is better    and you   he said  shaking himself she took his hand in both of hers  and drew it to her waist  never taking her eyes off him
 well  i m glad   he said  coldly scanning her  her hair  her dress  which he knew she had put on for him
all was charming  but how many times it had charmed him  and anna karenina 1442 of 1759 the stern  stony expression that she so dreaded settled upon his face
 well  i m glad
and are you well   he said  wiping his damp beard with his handkerchief and kissing her hand
 never mind   she thought   only let him be here  and so long as he s here he cannot  he dare not  cease to love me   the evening was spent happily and gaily in the presence of princess varvara  who complained to him that anna had been taking morphine in his absence
 what am i to do  i couldn t sleep   
my thoughts prevented me
when he s here i never take it hardly ever   he told her about the election  and anna knew how by adroit questions to bring him to what gave him most pleasure his own success
she told him of everything that interested him at home  and all that she told him was of the most cheerful description
but late in the evening  when they were alone  anna  seeing that she had regained complete possession of him  wanted to erase the painful impression of the glance he had given her for her letter
she said   tell me frankly  you were vexed at getting my letter  and you didn t believe me   anna karenina 1443 of 1759 as soon as she had said it  she felt that however warm his feelings were to her  he had not forgiven her for that
 yes   he said   the letter was so strange
first  annie ill  and then you thought of coming yourself    it was all the truth    oh  i don t doubt it    yes  you do doubt it
you are vexed  i see    not for one moment
i m only vexed  that s true  that you seem somehow unwilling to admit that there are duties     the duty of going to a concert     but we won t talk about it   he said
 why not talk about it   she said
 i only meant to say that matters of real importance may turn up
now  for instance  i shall have to go to moscow to arrange about the house   
oh  anna  why are you so irritable  don t you know that i can t live without you    if so   said anna  her voice suddenly changing   it means that you are sick of this life   
yes  you will come for a day and go away  as men do     anna  that s cruel
i am ready to give up my whole life   but she did not hear him
anna karenina 1444 of 1759  if you go to moscow  i will go too
i will not stay here
either we must separate or else live together    why  you know  that s my one desire
but for that     we must get a divorce
i will write to him
i see i cannot go on like this   
but i will come with you to moscow    you talk as if you were threatening me
but i desire nothing so much as never to be parted from you   said vronsky  smiling
but as he said these words there gleamed in his eyes not merely a cold look  but the vindictive look of a man persecuted and made cruel
she saw the look and correctly divined its meaning
 if so  it s a calamity   that glance told her
it was a moment s impression  but she never forgot it
anna wrote to her husband asking him about a divorce  and towards the end of november  taking leave of princess varvara  who wanted to go to petersburg  she went with vronsky to moscow
expecting every day an answer from alexey alexandrovitch  and after that the divorce  they now established themselves together like married people anna karenina 1445 of 1759 part seven anna karenina 1446 of 1759 the levins had been three months in moscow
the date had long passed on which  according to the most trustworthy calculations of people learned in such matters  kitty should have been confined
but she was still about  and there was nothing to show that her time was any nearer than two months ago
the doctor  the monthly nurse  and dolly and her mother  and most of all levin  who could not think of the approaching event without terror  began to be impatient and uneasy
kitty was the only person who felt perfectly calm and happy
she was distinctly conscious now of the birth of a new feeling of love for the future child  for her to some extent actually existing already  and she brooded blissfully over this feeling
he was not by now altogether a part of herself  but sometimes lived his own life independently of her
often this separate being gave her pain  but at the same time she wanted to laugh with a strange new joy
all the people she loved were with her  and all were so good to her  so attentively caring for her  so entirely pleasant was everything presented to her  that if she had not known and felt that it must all soon be over  she could not have wished for a better and pleasanter life
the only anna karenina 1447 of 1759 thing that spoiled the charm of this manner of life was that her husband was not here as she loved him to be  and as he was in the country
she liked his serene  friendly  and hospitable manner in the country
in the town he seemed continually uneasy and on his guard  as though he were afraid someone would be rude to him  and still more to her
at home in the country  knowing himself distinctly to be in his right place  he was never in haste to be off elsewhere he was never unoccupied
here in town he was in a continual hurry  as though afraid of missing something  and yet he had nothing to do
and she felt sorry for him
to others  she knew  he did not appear an object of pity
on the contrary  when kitty looked at him in society  as one sometimes looks at those one loves  trying to see him as if he were a stranger  so as to catch the impression he must make on others  she saw with a panic even of jealous fear that he was far indeed from being a pitiable figure  that he was very attractive with his fine breeding  his rather oldfashioned  reserved courtesy with women  his powerful figure  and striking  as she thought  and expressive face
but she saw him not from without  but from within  she saw that here he was not himself  that was the only way she could define his condition to herself sometimes she anna karenina 1448 of 1759 inwardly reproached him for his inability to live in the town  sometimes she recognized that it was really hard for him to order his life here so that he could be satisfied with
what had he to do  indeed  he did not care for cards  he did not go to a club
spending the time with jovial gentlemen of oblonsky s type she knew now what that meant   it meant drinking and going somewhere after drinking
she could not think without horror of where men went on such occasions
was he to go into society  but she knew he could only find satisfaction in that if he took pleasure in the society of young women  and that she could not wish for
should he stay at home with her  her mother and her sisters  but much as she liked and enjoyed their conversations forever on the same subjects  alinenadine   as the old prince called the sisters  talks she knew it must bore him
what was there left for him to do  to go on writing at his book he had indeed attempted  and at first he used to go to the library and make extracts and look up references for his book
but  as he told her  the more he did nothing  the less time he had to do anything
and besides  he complained that he had talked too much about his book here  and that consequently all his ideas about it were muddled and had lost their interest for him
anna karenina 1449 of 1759 one advantage in this town life was that quarrels hardly ever happened between them here in town
whether it was that their conditions were different  or that they had both become more careful and sensible in that respect  they had no quarrels in moscow from jealousy  which they had so dreaded when they moved from the country
one event  an event of great importance to both from that point of view  did indeed happen that was kitty s meeting with vronsky
the old princess marya borissovna  kitty s godmother  who had always been very fond of her  had insisted on seeing her
kitty  though she did not go into society at all on account of her condition  went with her father to see the venerable old lady  and there met vronsky
the only thing kitty could reproach herself for at this meeting was that at the instant when she recognized in his civilian dress the features once so familiar to her  her breath failed her  the blood rushed to her heart  and a vivid blush she felt it  overspread her face
but this lasted only a few seconds
before her father  who purposely began talking in a loud voice to vronsky  had finished  she was perfectly ready to look at vronsky  to speak to him  if necessary  exactly as she spoke to princess marya borissovna  and more than that  to do so in such a anna karenina 1450 of 1759 way that everything to the faintest intonation and smile would have been approved by her husband  whose unseen presence she seemed to feel about her at that instant
she said a few words to him  even smiled serenely at his joke about the elections  which he called  our parliament    she had to smile to show she saw the joke   but she turned away immediately to princess marya borissovna  and did not once glance at him till he got up to go  then she looked at him  but evidently only because it would be uncivil not to look at a man when he is saying good bye
she was grateful to her father for saying nothing to her about their meeting vronsky  but she saw by his special warmth to her after the visit during their usual walk that he was pleased with her
she was pleased with herself
she had not expected she would have had the power  while keeping somewhere in the bottom of her heart all the memories of her old feeling for vronsky  not only to seem but to be perfectly indifferent and composed with him
levin flushed a great deal more than she when she told him she had met vronsky at princess marya borissovna s
it was very hard for her to tell him this  but still harder to go on speaking of the details of the meeting  as he did not question her  but simply gazed at her with a frown
anna karenina 1451 of 1759  i am very sorry you weren t there   she said
 not that you weren t in the room   i couldn t have been so natural in your presence   i am blushing now much more  much  much more   she said  blushing till the tears came into her eyes
 but that you couldn t see through a crack   the truthful eyes told levin that she was satisfied with herself  and in spite of her blushing he was quickly reassured and began questioning her  which was all she wanted
when he had heard everything  even to the detail that for the first second she could not help flushing  but that afterwards she was just as direct and as much at her ease as with any chance acquaintance  levin was quite happy again and said he was glad of it  and would not now behave as stupidly as he had done at the election  but would try the first time he met vronsky to be as friendly as possible
 it s so wretched to feel that there s a man almost an enemy whom it s painful to meet   said levin  i m very  very glad   anna karenina 1452 of 1759  go  please  go then and call on the bols   kitty said to her husband  when he came in to see her at eleven o clock before going out
 i know you are dining at the club  papa put down your name
but what are you going to do in the morning    i am only going to katavasov   answered levin
 why so early    he promised to introduce me to metrov
i wanted to talk to him about my work
he s a distinguished scientific man from petersburg   said levin
 yes  wasn t it his article you were praising so  well  and after that   said kitty
 i shall go to the court  perhaps  about my sister s business    and the concert   she queried
 i shan t go there all alone    no  do go  there are going to be some new things   
that interested you so
i should certainly go    well  anyway  i shall come home before dinner   he said  looking at his watch
anna karenina 1453 of 1759  put on your frock coat  so that you can go straight to call on countess bola    but is it absolutely necessary    oh  absolutely  he has been to see us
come  what is it  you go in  sit down  talk for five minutes of the weather  get up and go away    oh  you wouldn t believe it  i ve got so out of the way of all this that it makes me feel positively ashamed
it s such a horrible thing to do  a complete outsider walks in  sits down  stays on with nothing to do  wastes their time and worries himself  and walks away   kitty laughed  why  i suppose you used to pay calls before you were married  didn t you    yes  i did  but i always felt ashamed  and now i m so out of the way of it that  by jove  i d sooner go two days running without my dinner than pay this call  one s so ashamed  i feel all the while that they re annoyed  that they re saying   what has he come for      no  they won t
i ll answer for that   said kitty  looking into his face with a laugh
she took his hand
 well  good bye   
do go  please   he was just going out after kissing his wife s hand  when she stopped him
anna karenina 1454 of 1759  kostya  do you know i ve only fifty roubles left    oh  all right  i ll go to the bank and get some
how much   he said  with the expression of dissatisfaction she knew so well
 no  wait a minute   she held his hand
 let s talk about it  it worries me
i seem to spend nothing unnecessary  but money seems to fly away simply we don t manage well  somehow    oh  it s all right   he said with a little cough  looking at her from under his brows
that cough she knew well
it was a sign of intense dissatisfaction  not with her  but with himself he certainly was displeased not at so much money being spent  but at being reminded of what he  knowing something was unsatisfactory  wanted to forget
 i have told sokolov to sell the wheat  and to borrow an advance on the mill
we shall have money enough in any case    yes  but i m afraid that altogether     oh  it s all right  all right   he repeated
 well  goodbye  darling    no  i m really sorry sometimes that i listened to mamma
how nice it would have been in the country  as it is  i m worrying you all  and we re wasting our money   anna karenina 1455 of 1759  not at all  not at all
not once since i ve been married have i said that things could have been better than they are      truly   she said  looking into his eyes
he had said it without thinking  simply to console her
but when he glanced at her and saw those sweet truthful eyes fastened questioningly on him  he repeated it with his whole heart
 i was positively forgetting her   he thought
and he remembered what was before them  so soon to come
 will it be soon  how do you feel   he whispered  taking her two hands
 i have so often thought so  that now i don t think about it or know anything about it    and you re not frightened   she smiled contemptuously
 not the least little bit   she said
 well  if anything happens  i shall be at katavasov s    no  nothing will happen  and don t think about it
i m going for a walk on the boulevard with papa
we re going to see dolly
i shall expect you before dinner
oh  yes  do you know that dolly s position is becoming utterly impossible  she s in debt all round  she hasn t a penny
we were talking yesterday with mamma and arseny   this was anna karenina 1456 of 1759 her sister s husband lvov    and we determined to send you with him to talk to stiva
it s really unbearable
one can t speak to papa about it   
but if you and he     why  what can we do   said levin
 you ll be at arseny s  anyway  talk to him  he will tell what we decided    oh  i agree to everything arseny thinks beforehand
i ll go and see him
by the way  if i do go to the concert  i ll go with natalia
well  good  bye   on the steps levin was stopped by his old servant kouzma  who had been with him before his marriage  and now looked after their household in town
 beauty   that was the left shaft horse brought up from the country   has been badly shod and is quite lame   he said
 what does your honor wish to be done   during the first part of their stay in moscow  levin had used his own horses brought up from the country
he had tried to arrange this part of their expenses in the best and cheapest way possible  but it appeared that their own horses came dearer than hired horses  and they still hired too
 send for the veterinary  there may be a bruise    and for katerina alexandrovna   asked konzma
anna karenina 1457 of 1759 levin was not by now struck as he had been at first by the fact that to get from one end of moscow to the other he had to have two powerful horses put into a heavy carriage  to take the carriage three miles through the snowy slush and to keep it standing there four hours  paying five roubles every time
now it seemed quite natural
 hire a pair for our carriage from the jobmaster   said he
 yes  sir   and so  simply and easily  thanks to the facilities of town life  levin settled a question which  in the country  would have called for so much personal trouble and exertion  and going out onto the steps  he called a sledge  sat down  and drove to nikitsky
on the way he thought no more of money  but mused on the introduction that awaited him to the petersburg savant  a writer on sociology  and what he would say to him about his book
only during the first days of his stay in moscow levin had been struck by the expenditure  strange to one living in the country  unproductive but inevitable  that was expected of him on every side
but by now he had grown used to it
that had happened to him in this matter which is said to happen to drunkards the first glass sticks in the anna karenina 1458 of 1759 throat  the second flies down like a hawk  but after the third they re like tiny little birds
when levin had changed his first hundred rouble note to pay for liveries for his footmen and hall porter he could not help reflecting that these liveries were of no use to anyone  but they were indubitably necessary  to judge by the amazement of the princess and kitty when he suggested that they might do without liveries  that these liveries would cost the wages of two laborers for the summer  that is  would pay for about three hundred working days from easter to ash wednesday  and each a day of hard work from early morning to late evening and that hundredrouble note did stick in his throat
but the next note  changed to pay for providing a dinner for their relations  that cost twenty eight roubles  though it did excite in levin the reflection that twenty eight roubles meant nine measures of oats  which men would with groans and sweat have reaped and bound and thrashed and winnowed and sifted and sown  this next one he parted with more easily
and now the notes he changed no longer aroused such reflections  and they flew off like little birds
whether the labor devoted to obtaining the money corresponded to the pleasure given by what was bought with it  was a consideration he had long ago dismissed
his business anna karenina 1459 of 1759 calculation that there divas a certain price below which he could not sell certain grain was forgotten too
the rye  for the price of which he had so long held out  had been sold for fifty kopecks a measure cheaper than it had been fetching a month ago even the consideration that with such an expenditure he could not go on living for a year without debt  that even had no force
only one thing was essential  to have money in the bank  without inquiring where it came from  so as to know that one had the wherewithal to buy meat for tomorrow
and this condition had hitherto been fulfilled  he had always had the money in the bank
but now the money in the bank had gone  and he could not quite tell where to get the next installment
and this it was which  at the moment when kitty had mentioned money  had disturbed him  but he had no time to think about it
he drove off  thinking of katavasov and the meeting with metrov that was before him
anna karenina 1460 of 1759 levin had on this visit to town seen a great deal of his old friend at the university  professor katavasov  whom he had not seen since his marriage
he liked in katavasov the clearness and simplicity of his conception of life
levin thought that the clearness of katavasov s conception of life was due to the poverty of his nature  katavasov thought that the disconnectedness of levin s ideas was due to his lack of intellectual discipline  but levin enjoyed katavasov s clearness  and katavasov enjoyed the abundance of levin s untrained ideas  and they liked to meet and to discuss
levin had read katavasov some parts of his book  and he had liked them
on the previous day katavasov had met levin at a public lecture and told him that the celebrated metrov  whose article levin had so much liked  was in moscow  that he had been much interested by what katavasov had told him about levin s work  and that he was coming to see him tomorrow at eleven  and would be very glad to make levin s acquaintance
 you re positively a reformed character  i m glad to see   said katavasov  meeting levin in the little drawing anna karenina 1461 of 1759 room
 i heard the bell and thought  impossible that it can be he at the exact time   
well  what do you say to the montenegrins now  they re a race of warriors    why  what s happened   asked levin
katavasov in a few words told him the last piece of news from the war  and going into his study  introduced levin to a short  thick set man of pleasant appearance
this was metrov
the conversation touched for a brief space on politics and on how recent events were looked at in the higher spheres in petersburg
metrov repeated a saying that had reached him through a most trustworthy source  reported as having been uttered on this subject by the tsar and one of the ministers
katavasov had heard also on excellent authority that the tsar had said something quite different
levin tried to imagine circumstances in which both sayings might have been uttered  and the conversation on that topic dropped  yes  here he s written almost a book on the natural conditions of the laborer in relation to the land   said katavasov   i m not a specialist  but i  as a natural science man  was pleased at his not taking mankind as something outside biological laws  but  on the contrary  seeing his dependence on his surroundings  and in that dependence seeking the laws of his development   anna karenina 1462 of 1759  that s very interesting   said metrov
 what i began precisely was to write a book on agriculture  but studying the chief instrument of agriculture  the laborer   said levin  reddening   i could not help coming to quite unexpected results   and levin began carefully  as it were  feeling his ground  to expound his views
he knew metrov had written an article against the generally accepted theory of political economy  but to what extent he could reckon on his sympathy with his own new views he did not know and could not guess from the clever and serene face of the learned man
 but in what do you see the special characteristics of the russian laborer   said metrov   in his biological characteristics  so to speak  or in the condition in which he is placed   levin saw that there was an idea underlying this question with which he did not agree
but he went on explaining his own idea that the russian laborer has a quite special view of the land  different from that of other people  and to support this proposition he made haste to add that in his opinion this attitude of the russian peasant was due to the consciousness of his vocation to people vast unoccupied expanses in the east
anna karenina 1463 of 1759  one may easily be led into error in basing any conclusion on the general vocation of a people   said metrov  interrupting levin
 the condition of the laborer will always depend on his relation to the land and to capital   and without letting levin finish explaining his idea  metrov began expounding to him the special point of his own theory
in what the point of his theory lay  levin did not understand  because he did not take the trouble to understand
he saw that metrov  like other people  in spite of his own article  in which he had attacked the current theory of political economy  looked at the position of the russian peasant simply from the point of view of capital  wages  and rent
he would indeed have been obliged to admit that in the eastern much the larger  part of russia rent was as yet nil  that for nine tenths of the eighty millions of the russian peasants wages took the form simply of food provided for themselves  and that capital does not so far exist except in the form of the most primitive tools yet it was only from that point of view that he considered every laborer  though in many points he differed from the economists and had his own theory of the wage fund  which he expounded to levin
anna karenina 1464 of 1759 levin listened reluctantly  and at first made objections
he would have liked to interrupt metrov  to explain his own thought  which in his opinion would have rendered further exposition of metrov s theories superfluous
but later on  feeling convinced that they looked at the matter so differently  that they could never understand one another  he did not even oppose his statements  but simply listened
although what metrov was saying was by now utterly devoid of interest for him  he yet experienced a certain satisfaction in listening to him
it flattered his vanity that such a learned man should explain his ideas to him so eagerly  with such intensity and confidence in levin s understanding of the subject  sometimes with a mere hint referring him to a whole aspect of the subject
he put this down to his own credit  unaware that metrov  who had already discussed his theory over and over again with all his intimate friends  talked of it with special eagerness to every new person  and in general was eager to talk to anyone of any subject that interested him  even if still obscure to himself  we are late though   said katavasov  looking at his watch directly metrov had finished his discourse
 yes  there s a meeting of the society of amateurs today in commemoration of the jubilee of svintitch   said anna karenina 1465 of 1759 katavasov in answer to levin s inquiry
 pyotr ivanovitch and i were going
i ve promised to deliver an address on his labors in zoology
come along with us  it s very interesting    yes  and indeed it s time to start   said metrov
 come with us  and from there  if you care to  come to my place
i should very much like to hear your work    oh  no  it s no good yet  it s unfinished
but i shall be very glad to go to the meeting    i say  friends  have you heard  he has handed in the separate report   katavasov called from the other room  where he was putting on his frock coat
and a conversation sprang up upon the university question  which was a very important event that winter in moscow
three old professors in the council had not accepted the opinion of the younger professors
the young ones had registered a separate resolution
this  in the judgment of some people  was monstrous  in the judgment of others it was the simplest and most just thing to do  and the professors were split up into two parties
one party  to which katavasov belonged  saw in the opposite party a scoundrelly betrayal and treachery  while the opposite party saw in them childishness and lack of respect for the authorities
levin  though he did not anna karenina 1466 of 1759 belong to the university  had several times already during his stay in moscow heard and talked about this matter  and had his own opinion on the subject
he took part in the conversation that was continued in the street  as they all three walked to the buildings of the old university
the meeting had already begun
round the clothcovered table  at which katavasov and metrov seated themselves  there were some half dozen persons  and one of these was bending close over a manuscript  reading something aloud levin sat down in one of the empty chairs that were standing round the table  and in a whisper asked a student sitting near what was being read
the student  eyeing levin with displeasure  said   biography   though levin was not interested in the biography  he could not help listening  and learned some new and interesting facts about the life of the distinguished man of science
when the reader had finished  the chairman thanked him and read some verses of the poet ment sent him on the jubilee  and said a few words by way of thanks to the poet
then katavasov in his loud  ringing voice read his address on the scientific labors of the man whose jubilee was being kept
anna karenina 1467 of 1759 when katavasov had finished  levin looked at his watch  saw it was past one  and thought that there would not be time before the concert to read metrov his book  and indeed  he did not now care to do so
during the reading he had thought over their conversation
he saw distinctly now that though metrov s ideas might perhaps have value  his own ideas had a value too  and their ideas could only be made clear and lead to something if each worked separately in his chosen path  and that nothing would be gained by putting their ideas together
and having made up his mind to refuse metrov s invitation  levin went up to him at the end of the meeting
metrov introduced levin to the chairman  with whom he was talking of the political news
metrov told the chairman what he had already told levin  and levin made the same remarks on his news that he had already made that morning  but for the sake of variety he expressed also a new opinion which had only just struck him
after that the conversation turned again on the university question
as levin had already heard it all  he made haste to tell metrov that he was sorry he could not take advantage of his invitation  took leave  and drove to lvov s
anna karenina 1468 of 1759 lvov  the husband of natalia  kitty s sister  had spent all his life in foreign capitals  where he had been educated  and had been in the diplomatic service
during the previous year he had left the diplomatic service  not owing to any  unpleasantness   he never had any  unpleasantness  with anyone   and was transferred to the department of the court of the palace in moscow  in order to give his two boys the best education possible
in spite of the striking contrast in their habits and views and the fact that lvov was older than levin  they had seen a great deal of one another that winter  and had taken a great liking to each other
lvov was at home  and levin went in to him unannounced
lvov  in a house coat with a belt and in chamois leather shoes  was sitting in an armchair  and with a pincenez with blue glasses he was reading a book that stood on a reading desk  while in his beautiful hand he held a halfburned cigarette daintily away from him
anna karenina 1469 of 1759 his handsome  delicate  and still youthful looking face  to which his curly  glistening silvery hair gave a still more aristocratic air  lighted up with a smile when he saw levin
 capital  i was meaning to send to you
how s kitty  sit here  it s more comfortable   he got up and pushed up a rocking chair
 have you read the last circular in the journal de st
petersbourg  i think it s excellent   he said with a slight french accent
levin told him what he had heard from katavasov was being said in petersburg  and after talking a little about politics  he told him of his interview with metrov  and the learned society s meeting
to lvov it was very interesting
 that s what i envy you  that you are able to mix in these interesting scientific circles   he said
and as he talked  he passed as usual into french  which was easier to him
 it s true i haven t the time for it
my official work and the children leave me no time  and then i m not ashamed to own that my education has been too defective    that i don t believe   said levin with a smile  feeling  as he always did  touched at lvov s low opinion of himself  which was not in the least put on from a desire to seem or to be modest  but was absolutely sincere anna karenina 1470 of 1759  oh  yes  indeed  i feel now how badly educated i am
to educate my children i positively have to look up a great deal  and in fact simply to study myself
for it s not enough to have teachers  there must be someone to look after them  just as on your land you want laborers and an overseer
see what i m reading  he pointed to buslaev s grammar on the desk  it s expected of misha  and it s so difficult   
come  explain to me   
here he says    levin tried to explain to him that it couldn t be understood  but that it had to be taught  but lvov would not agree with him
 oh  you re laughing at it    on the contrary  you can t imagine how  when i look at you  i m always learning the task that lies before me  that is the education of one s children    well  there s nothing for you to learn   said lvov
 all i know   said levin   is that i have never seen better brought up children than yours  and i wouldn t wish for children better than yours   lvov visibly tried to restrain the expression of his delight  but he was positively radiant with smiles
 if only they re better than i  that s all i desire
you don t know yet all the work   he said   with boys who ve been left like mine to run wild abroad   anna karenina 1471 of 1759  you ll catch all that up
they re such clever children
the great thing is the education of character
that s what i learn when i look at your children    you talk of the education of character
you can t imagine how difficult that is  you have hardly succeeded in combating one tendency when others crop up  and the struggle begins again
if one had not a support in religion you remember we talked about that no father could bring children up relying on his own strength alone without that help   this subject  which always interested levin  was cut short by the entrance of the beauty natalia alexandrovna  dressed to go out
 i didn t know you were here   she said  unmistakably feeling no regret  but a positive pleasure  in interrupting this conversation on a topic she had heard so much of that she was by now weary of it
 well  how is kitty  i am dining with you today
i tell you what  arseny   she turned to her husband   you take the carriage   and the husband and wife began to discuss their arrangements for the day
as the husband had to drive to meet someone on official business  while the wife had to go to the concert and some public meeting of a committee on the eastern question  there was a great deal to consider anna karenina 1472 of 1759 and settle
levin had to take part in their plans as one of themselves it was settled that levin should go with natalia to the concert and the meeting  and that from there they should send the carriage to the office for arseny  and he should call for her and take her to kitty s  or that  if he had not finished his work  he should send the carriage back and levin would go with her
 he s spoiling me   lvov said to his wife   he assures me that our children are splendid  when i know how much that s bad there is in them    arseny goes to extremes  i always say   said his wife
 if you look for perfection  you will never be satisfied
and it s true  as papa says   that when we were brought up there was one extreme we were kept in the basement  while our parents lived in the best rooms  now it s just the other way the parents are in the wash house  while the children are in the best rooms parents now are not expected to live at all  but to exist altogether for their children    well  what if they like it better   lvov said  with his beautiful smile  touching her hand
 anyone who didn t know you would think you were a stepmother  not a true mother   anna karenina 1473 of 1759  no  extremes are not good in anything   natalia said serenely  putting his paper knife straight in its proper place on the table
 well  come here  you perfect children   lvov said to the two handsome boys who came in  and after bowing to levin  went up to their father  obviously wishing to ask him about something
levin would have liked to talk to them  to hear what they would say to their father  but natalia began talking to him  and then lvov s colleague in the service  mahotin  walked in  wearing his court uniform  to go with him to meet someone  and a conversation was kept up without a break upon herzegovina  princess korzinskaya  the town council  and the sudden death of madame apraksina
levin even forgot the commission intrusted to him
he recollected it as he was going into the hall
 oh  kitty told me to talk to you about oblonsky   he said  as lvov was standing on the stairs  seeing his wife and levin off
 yes  yes  maman wants us  les beaux freres  to attack him   he said  blushing
 but why should i    well  then  i will attack him   said madame lvova  with a smile  standing in her white sheepskin cape  waiting till they had finished speaking
 come  let us go   anna karenina 1474 of 1759 at the concert in the afternoon two very interesting things were performed
one was a fantasia  king lear  the other was a quartette dedicated to the memory of bach
both were new and in the new style  and levin was eager to form an opinion of them
after escorting his sister inlaw to her stall  he stood against a column and tried to listen as attentively and conscientiously as possible
he tried not to let his attention be distracted  and not to spoil his impression by looking at the conductor in a white tie  waving his arms  which always disturbed his enjoyment of music so much  or the ladies in bonnets  with strings carefully tied over their ears  and all these people either thinking of nothing at all or thinking of all sorts of things except the music he tried to avoid meeting musical connoisseurs or talkative acquaintances  and stood looking at the floor straight before him  listening
but the more he listened to the fantasia of ring lear the further he felt from forming any definite opinion of it
there was  as it were  a continual beginning  a preparation of the musical expression of some feeling  but it fell to pieces again directly  breaking into new musical motives  anna karenina 1475 of 1759 or simply nothing but the whims of the composer  exceedingly complex but disconnected sounds and these fragmentary musical expressions  though sometimes beautiful  were disagreeable  because they were utterly unexpected and not led up to by anything
gaiety and grief and despair and tenderness and triumph followed one another without any connection  like the emotions of a madman
and those emotions  like a madman s  sprang up quite unexpectedly
during the whole of the performance levin felt like a deaf man watching people dancing  and was in a state of complete bewilderment when the fantasia was over  and felt a great weariness from the fruitless strain on his attention
loud applause resounded on all sides
everyone got up  moved about  and began talking
anxious to throw some light on his own perplexity from the impressions of others  levin began to walk about  looking for connoisseurs  and was glad to see a well known musical amateur in conversation with pestsov  whom he knew
 marvelous   pestsov was saying in his mellow bass
 how are you  konstantin dmitrievitch  particularly sculpturesque and plastic  so to say  and richly colored is that passage where you feel cordelia s approach  where anna karenina 1476 of 1759 woman  das ewig weibliche  enters into conflict with fate
isn t it    you mean   what has cordelia to do with it   levin asked timidly  forgetting that the fantasia was supposed to represent king lear
 cordelia comes in   see here   said pestsov  tapping his finger on the satiny surface of the program he held in his hand and passing it to levin
only then levin recollected the title of the fantasia  and made haste to read in the russian translation the lines from shakespeare that were printed on the back of the program
 you can t follow it without that   said pestsov  addressing levin  as the person he had been speaking to had gone away  and he had no one to talk to
in the entr acte levin and pestsov fell into an argument upon the merits and defects of music of the wagner school
levin maintained that the mistake of wagner and all his followers lay in their trying to take music into the sphere of another art  just as poetry goes wrong when it tries to paint a face as the art of painting ought to do  and as an instance of this mistake he cited the sculptor who carved in marble certain poetic phantasms flitting round the figure of the poet on the pedestal  these phantoms anna karenina 1477 of 1759 were so far from being phantoms that they were positively clinging on the ladder   said levin the comparison pleased him  but he could not remember whether he had not used the same phrase before  and to pestsov  too  and as he said it he felt confused
pestsov maintained that art is one  and that it can attain its highest manifestations only by conjunction with all kinds of art
the second piece that was performed levin could not hear
pestsov  who was standing beside him  was talking to him almost all the time  condemning the music for its excessive affected assumption of simplicity  and comparing it with the simplicity of the pre raphaelites in painting
as he went out levin met many more acquaintances  with whom he talked of politics  of music  and of common acquaintances
among others he met count bol  whom he had utterly forgotten to call upon
 well  go at once then   madame lvova said  when he told her   perhaps they ll not be at home  and then you can come to the meeting to fetch me you ll find me still there   anna karenina 1478 of 1759  perhaps they re not at home   said levin  as he went into the hall of countess bola s house
 at home  please walk in   said the porter  resolutely removing his overcoat
 how annoying   thought levin with a sigh  taking off one glove and stroking his hat
 what did i come for  what have i to say to them   as he passed through the first drawing room levin met in the doorway countess bola  giving some order to a servant with a care worn and severe face
on seeing levin she smiled  and asked him to come into the little drawing room  where he heard voices
in this room there were sitting in armchairs the two daughters of the countess  and a moscow colonel  whom levin knew
levin went up  greeted them  and sat down beside the sofa with his hat on his knees
 how is your wife  have you been at the concert  we couldn t go
mamma had to be at the funeral service    yes  i heard   
what a sudden death   said levin
the countess came in  sat down on the sofa  and she too asked after his wife and inquired about the concert
anna karenina 1479 of 1759 levin answered  and repeated an inquiry about madame apraksina s sudden death
 but she was always in weak health    were you at the opera yesterday    yes  i was    lucca was very good    yes  very good   he said  and as it was utterly of no consequence to him what they thought of him  he began repeating what they had heard a hundred times about the characteristics of the singer s talent
countess bola pretended to be listening
then  when he had said enough and paused  the colonel  who had been silent till then  began to talk
the colonel too talked of the opera  and about culture
at last  after speaking of the proposed folle journee at turin s  the colonel laughed  got up noisily  and went away
levin too rose  but he saw by the face of the countess that it was not yet time for him to go
he must stay two minutes longer
he sat down
but as he was thinking all the while how stupid it was  he could not find a subject for conversation  and sat silent
 you are not going to the public meeting  they say it will be very interesting   began the countess
 no  i promised my belle soeur to fetch her from it   said levin anna karenina 1480 of 1759 a silence followed
the mother once more exchanged glances with a daughter
 well  now i think the time has come   thought levin  and he got up
the ladies shook hands with him  and begged him to say mille choses to his wife for them
the porter asked him  as he gave him his coat   where is your honor staying   and immediately wrote down his address in a big handsomely bound book
 of course i don t care  but still i feel ashamed and awfully stupid   thought levin  consoling himself with the reflection that everyone does it he drove to the public meeting  where he was to find his sister in law  so as to drive home with her
at the public meeting of the committee there were a great many people  and almost all the highest society
levin was in time for the report which  as everyone said  was very interesting
when the reading of the report was over  people moved about  and levin met sviazhsky  who invited him very pressingly to come that evening to a meeting of the society of agriculture  where a celebrated lecture was to be delivered  and stepan arkadyevitch  who had only just come from the races  and many other acquaintances  and levin heard and uttered various criticisms on the meeting  on the new fantasia  and on a anna karenina 1481 of 1759 public trial but  probably from the mental fatigue he was beginning to feel  he made a blunder in speaking of the trial  and this blunder he recalled several times with vexation
speaking of the sentence upon a foreigner who had been condemned in russia  and of how unfair it would be to punish him by exile abroad  levin repeated what he had heard the day before in conversation from an acquaintance
 i think sending him abroad is much the same as punishing a carp by putting it into the water   said levin
then he recollected that this idea  which he had heard from an acquaintance and uttered as his own  came from a fable of krilov s  and that the acquaintance had picked it up from a newspaper article
after driving home with his sister in law  and finding kitty in good spirits and quite well  levin drove to the club
anna karenina 1482 of 1759 levin reached the club just at the right time
members and visitors were driving up as he arrived
levin had not been at the club for a very long while not since he lived in moscow  when he was leaving the university and going into society
he remembered the club  the external details of its arrangement  but he had completely forgotten the impression it had made on him in old days
but as soon as  driving into the wide semicircular court and getting out of the sledge  he mounted the steps  and the hall porter  adorned with a crossway scarf  noiselessly opened the door to him with a bow  as soon as he saw in the porter s room the cloaks and galoshes of members who thought it less trouble to take them off downstairs  as soon as he heard the mysterious ringing bell that preceded him as he ascended the easy  carpeted staircase  and saw the statue on the landing  and the third porter at the top doors  a familiar figure grown older  in the club livery  opening the door without haste or delay  and scanning the visitors as they passed in levin felt the old impression of the club come back in a rush  an impression of repose  comfort  and propriety
anna karenina 1483 of 1759  your hat  please   the porter said to levin  who forgot the club rule to leave his hat in the porter s room
 long time since you ve been
the prince put your name down yesterday
prince stepan arkadyevitch is not here yet   the porter did not only know levin  but also all his ties and relationships  and so immediately mentioned his intimate friends
passing through the outer hall  divided up by screens  and the room partitioned on the right  where a man sits at the fruit buffet  levin overtook an old man walking slowly in  and entered the dining room full of noise and people
he walked along the tables  almost all full  and looked at the visitors
he saw people of all sorts  old and young  some he knew a little  some intimate friends
there was not a single cross or worried looking face
all seemed to have left their cares and anxieties in the porter s room with their hats  and were all deliberately getting ready to enjoy the material blessings of life
sviazhsky was here and shtcherbatsky  nevyedovsky and the old prince  and vronsky and sergey ivanovitch
 ah  why are you late   the prince said smiling  and giving him his hand over his own shoulder
 how s kitty   he added  smoothing out the napkin he had tucked in at his waistcoat buttons
anna karenina 1484 of 1759  all right  they are dining at home  all the three of them    ah   aline nadine   to be sure  there s no room with us
go to that table  and make haste and take a seat   said the prince  and turning away he carefully took a plate of eel soup
 levin  this way   a good natured voice shouted a little farther on
it was turovtsin
he was sitting with a young officer  and beside them were two chairs turned upside down
levin gladly went up to them
he had always liked the good hearted rake  turovtsin he was associated in his mind with memories of his courtship and at that moment  after the strain of intellectual conversation  the sight of turovtsin s good natured face was particularly welcome
 for you and oblonsky
he ll be here directly   the young man  holding himself very erect  with eyes forever twinkling with enjoyment  was an officer from petersburg  gagin turovtsin introduced them
 oblonsky s always late    ah  here he is    have you only just come   said oblonsky  coming quickly towards them
 good day
had some vodka  well  come along then   anna karenina 1485 of 1759 levin got up and went with him to the big table spread with spirits and appetizers of the most various kinds
one would have thought that out of two dozen delicacies one might find something to one s taste  but stepan arkadyevitch asked for something special  and one of the liveried waiters standing by immediately brought what was required
they drank a wine glassful and returned to their table
at once  while they were still at the soup  gagin was served with champagne  and told the waiter to fill four glasses
levin did not refuse the wine  and asked for a second bottle
he was very hungry  and ate and drank with great enjoyment  and with still greater enjoyment took part in the lively and simple conversation of his companions
gagin  dropping his voice  told the last good story from petersburg  and the story  though improper and stupid  was so ludicrous that levin broke into roars of laughter so loud that those near looked round
 that s in the same style as   that s a thing i can t endure   you know the story   said stepan arkadyevitch
 ah  that s exquisite  another bottle   he said to the waiter  and he began to relate his good story
 pyotr illyitch vinovsky invites you to drink with him   a little old waiter interrupted stepan arkadyevitch  anna karenina 1486 of 1759 bringing two delicate glasses of sparkling champagne  and addressing stepan arkadyevitch and levin
stepan arkadyevitch took the glass  and looking towards a bald man with red mustaches at the other end of the table  he nodded to him  smiling
 who s that   asked levin
 you met him once at my place  don t you remember  a good natured fellow   levin did the same as stepan arkadyevitch and took the glass
stepan arkadyevitch s anecdote too was very amusing
levin told his story  and that too was successful
then they talked of horses  of the races  of what they had been doing that day  and of how smartly vronsky s atlas had won the first prize
levin did not notice how the time passed at dinner
 ah  and here they are   stepan arkadyevitch said towards the end of dinner  leaning over the back of his chair and holding out his hand to vronsky  who came up with a tall officer of the guards
vronsky s face too beamed with the look of good humored enjoyment that was general in the club
he propped his elbow playfully on stepan arkadyevitch s shoulder  whispering something anna karenina 1487 of 1759 to him  and he held out his hand to levin with the same good humored smile
 very glad to meet you   he said
 i looked out for you at the election  but i was told you had gone away    yes  i left the same day
we ve just been talking of your horse
i congratulate you   said levin
 it was very rapidly run    yes  you ve race horses too  haven t you    no  my father had  but i remember and know something about it    where have you dined   asked stepan arkadyevitch
 we were at the second table  behind the columns    we ve been celebrating his success   said the tall colonel
 it s his second imperial prize
i wish i might have the luck at cards he has with horses
well  why waste the precious time  i m going to the  infernal regions    added the colonel  and he walked away
 that s yashvin   vronsky said in answer to turovtsin  and he sat down in the vacated seat beside them
he drank the glass offered him  and ordered a bottle of wine
under the influence of the club atmosphere or the wine he had drunk  levin chatted away to vronsky of the best breeds of cattle  and was very glad not to feel the slightest hostility to this man
he even told him  among other anna karenina 1488 of 1759 things  that he had heard from his wife that she had met him at princess marya borissovna s
 ah  princess marya borissovna  she s exquisite   said stepan arkadyevitch  and he told an anecdote about her which set them all laughing
vronsky particularly laughed with such simplehearted amusement that levin felt quite reconciled to him
 well  have we finished   said stepan arkadyevitch  getting up with a smile
 let us go   anna karenina 1489 of 1759 getting up from the table  levin walked with gagin through the lofty room to the billiard room  feeling his arms swing as he walked with a peculiar lightness and ease as he crossed the big room  he came upon his father inlaw
 well  how do you like our temple of idolence   said the prince  taking his arm
 come along  come along    yes  i wanted to walk about and look at everything
it s interesting    yes  it s interesting for you
but its interest for me is quite different
you look at those little old men now   he said  pointing to a club member with bent back and projecting lip  shuffling towards them in his soft boots   and imagine that they were shlupiks like that from their birth up    how shlupiks    i see you don t know that name
that s our club designation
you know the game of rolling eggs  when one s rolled a long while it becomes a shlupik
so it is with us  one goes on coming and coming to the club  and ends by becoming a shlupik
ah  you laugh  but we look anna karenina 1490 of 1759 out  for fear of dropping into it ourselves
you know prince tchetchensky   inquired the prince  and levin saw by his face that he was just going to relate something funny  no  i don t know him    you don t say so  well  prince tchetchensky is a wellknown figure no matter  though
he s always playing billiards here
only three years ago he was not a shlupik and kept up his spirits and even used to call other people shlupiks
but one day he turns up  and our porter   you know vassily  why  that fat one  he s famous for his bon mots
and so prince tchetchensky asks him   come  vassily  who s here  any shlupiks here yet   and he says   you re the third   yes  my dear boy  that he did   talking and greeting the friends they met  levin and the prince walked through all the rooms  the great room where tables had already been set  and the usual partners were playing for small stakes  the divan room  where they were playing chess  and sergey ivanovitch was sitting talking to somebody  the billiard room  where  about a sofa in a recess  there was a lively party drinking champagne gagin was one of them they peeped into the  infernal regions   where a good many men were crowding round one table  at which yashvin was sitting anna karenina 1491 of 1759 trying not to make a noise  they walked into the dark reading room  where under the shaded lamps there sat a young man with a wrathful countenance  turning over one journal after another  and a bald general buried in a book
they went  too  into what the prince called the intellectual room  where three gentlemen were engaged in a heated discussion of the latest political news
 prince  please come  we re ready   said one of his card party  who had come to look for him  and the prince went off
levin sat down and listened  but recalling all the conversation of the morning he felt all of a sudden fearfully bored
he got up hurriedly  and went to look for oblonsky and turovtsin  with whom it had been so pleasant
turovtsin was one of the circle drinking in the billiard room  and stepan arkadyevitch was talking with vronsky near the door at the farther corner of the room
 it s not that she s dull  but this undefined  this unsettled position   levin caught  and he was hurrying away  but stepan arkadyevitch called to him
 levied  said stepan arkadyevitch  and levin noticed that his eyes were not full of tears exactly  but moist  which always happened when he had been drinking  or when he was touched
just now it was due to both causes
anna karenina 1492 of 1759  levin  don t go   he said  and he warmly squeezed his arm above the elbow  obviously not at all wishing to let him go
 this is a true friend of mine almost my greatest friend   he said to vronsky
 you have become even closer and dearer to me
and i want you  and i know you ought  to be friends  and great friends  because you re both splendid fellows    well  there s nothing for us now but to kiss and be friends   vronsky said  with good natured playfulness  holding out his hand
levin quickly took the offered hand  and pressed it warmly
 i m very  very glad   said levin
 waiter  a bottle of champagne   said stepan arkadyevitch
 and i m very glad   said vronsky
but in spite of stepan arkadyevitch s desire  and their own desire  they had nothing to talk about  and both felt it
 do you know  he has never met anna   stepan arkadyevitch said to vronsky
 and i want above everything to take him to see her
let us go  levin   anna karenina 1493 of 1759  really   said vronsky
 she will be very glad to see you
i should be going home at once   he added   but i m worried about yashvin  and i want to stay on till he finishes    why  is he losing    he keeps losing  and i m the only friend that can restrain him    well  what do you say to pyramids  levin  will you play  capital   said stepan arkadyevitch
 get the table ready   he said to the marker
 it has been ready a long while   answered the marker  who had already set the balls in a triangle  and was knocking the red one about for his own diversion
 well  let us begin   after the game vronsky and levin sat down at gagin s table  and at stepan arkadyevitch s suggestion levin took a hand in the game
vronsky sat down at the table  surrounded by friends  who were incessantly coming up to him
every now and then he went to the  infernal  to keep an eye on yashvin
levin was enjoying a delightful sense of repose after the mental fatigue of the morning
he was glad that all hostility was at an end with vronsky  and the sense of peace  decorum  and comfort never left him
anna karenina 1494 of 1759 when the game was over  stepan arkadyevitch took levin s arm
 well  let us go to anna s  then
at once  eh  she is at home
i promised her long ago to bring you
where were you meaning to spend the evening    oh  nowhere specially
i promised sviazhsky to go to the society of agriculture
by all means  let us go   said levin
 very good  come along
find out if my carriage is here   stepan arkadyevitch said to the waiter
levin went up to the table  paid the forty roubles he had lost  paid his bill  the amount of which was in some mysterious way ascertained by the little old waiter who stood at the counter  and swinging his arms he walked through all the rooms to the way out anna karenina 1495 of 1759  oblonsky s carriage   the porter shouted in an angry bass
the carriage drove up and both got in
it was only for the first few moments  while the carriage was driving out of the clubhouse gates  that levin was still under the influence of the club atmosphere of repose  comfort  and unimpeachable good form
but as soon as the carriage drove out into the street  and he felt it jolting over the uneven road  heard the angry shout of a sledge driver coming towards them  saw in the uncertain light the red blind of a tavern and the shops  this impression was dissipated  and he began to think over his actions  and to wonder whether he was doing right in going to see anna
what would kitty say  but stepan arkadyevitch gave him no time for reflection  and  as though divining his doubts  he scattered them
 how glad i am   he said   that you should know her  you know dolly has long wished for it
and lvov s been to see her  and often goes
though she is my sister   stepan arkadyevitch pursued   i don t hesitate to say that she s a remarkable woman
but you will see
her position is very painful  especially now   anna karenina 1496 of 1759  why especially now    we are carrying on negotiations with her husband about a divorce
and he s agreed  but there are difficulties in regard to the son  and the business  which ought to have been arranged long ago  has been dragging on for three months past
as soon as the divorce is over  she will marry vronsky
how stupid these old ceremonies are  that no one believes in  and which only prevent people being comfortable   stepan arkadyevitch put in
 well  then their position will be as regular as mine  as yours    what is the difficulty   said levin
 oh  it s a long and tedious story  the whole business is in such an anomalous position with us
but the point is she has been for three months in moscow  where everyone knows her  waiting for the divorce  she goes out nowhere  sees no woman except dolly  because  do you understand  she doesn t care to have people come as a favor
that fool princess varvara  even she has left her  considering this a breach of propriety
well  you see  in such a position any other woman would not have found resources in herself
but you ll see how she has arranged her life how calm  how dignified she is
to the left  in the crescent opposite the church   shouted stepan arkadyevitch  leaning out of the window
 phew  how anna karenina 1497 of 1759 hot it is   he said  in spite of twelve degrees of frost  flinging his open overcoat still wider open
 but she has a daughter  no doubt she s busy looking after her   said levin
 i believe you picture every woman simply as a female  une couveuse   said stepan arkadyevitch
 if she s occupied  it must be with her children
no  she brings her up capitally  i believe  but one doesn t hear about her
she s busy  in the first place  with what she writes
i see you re smiling ironically  but you re wrong
she s writing a children s book  and doesn t talk about it to anyone  but she read it to me and i gave the manuscript to vorkuev   you know the publisher   and he s an author himself too  i fancy he understands those things  and he says it s a remarkable piece of work
but are you fancying she s an authoress  not a bit of it
she s a woman with a heart  before everything  but you ll see
now she has a little english girl with her  and a whole family she s looking after    oh  something in a philanthropic way    why  you will look at everything in the worst light
it s not from philanthropy  it s from the heart
they that is  vronsky  had a trainer  an englishman  first rate in his own line  but a drunkard
he s completely given up to anna karenina 1498 of 1759 drink delirium tremens  and the family were cast on the world
she saw them  helped them  got more and more interested in them  and now the whole family is on her hands
but not by way of patronage  you know  helping with money  she s herself preparing the boys in russian for the high school  and she s taken the little girl to live with her
but you ll see her for yourself   the carriage drove into the courtyard  and stepan arkadyevitch rang loudly at the entrance where sledges were standing
and without asking the servant who opened the door whether the lady were at home  stepan arkadyevitch walked into the hall
levin followed him  more and more doubtful whether he was doing right or wrong
looking at himself in the glass  levin noticed that he was red in the face  but he felt certain he was not drunk  and he followed stepan arkadyevitch up the carpeted stairs at the top stepan arkadyevitch inquired of the footman  who bowed to him as to an intimate friend  who was with anna arkadyevna  and received the answer that it was m
vorkuev
 where are they    in the study   anna karenina 1499 of 1759 passing through the dining room  a room not very large  with dark  paneled walls  stepan arkadyevitch and levin walked over the soft carpet to the half dark study  lighted up by a single lamp with a big dark shade
another lamp with a reflector was hanging on the wall  lighting up a big full length portrait of a woman  which levin could not help looking at
it was the portrait of anna  painted in italy by mihailov
while stepan arkadyevitch went behind the treillage  and the man s voice which had been speaking paused  levin gazed at the portrait  which stood out from the frame in the brilliant light thrown on it  and he could not tear himself away from it he positively forgot where he was  and not even hearing what was said  he could not take his eyes off the marvelous portrait
it was not a picture  but a living  charming woman  with black curling hair  with bare arms and shoulders  with a pensive smile on the lips  covered with soft down  triumphantly and softly she looked at him with eyes that baffled him she was not living only because she was more beautiful than a living woman can be
 i am delighted   he heard suddenly near him a voice  unmistakably addressing him  the voice of the very woman he had been admiring in the portrait
anna had come from behind the treillage to meet him  and levin saw in anna karenina 1500 of 1759 the dim light of the study the very woman of the portrait  in a dark blue shot gown  not in the same position nor with the same expression  but with the same perfection of beauty which the artist had caught in the portrait
she was less dazzling in reality  but  on the other hand  there was something fresh and seductive in the living woman which was not in the portrait
anna karenina 1501 of 1759 she had risen to meet him  not concealing her pleasure at seeing him  and in the quiet ease with which she held out her little vigorous hand  introduced him to vorkuev and indicated a red haired  pretty little girl who was sitting at work  calling her her pupil  levin recognized and liked the manners of a woman of the great world  always selfpossessed and natural
 i am delighted  delighted   she repeated  and on her lips these simple words took for levin s ears a special significance
 i have known you and liked you for a long while  both from your friendship with stiva and for your wife s sake   
i knew her for a very short time  but she left on me the impression of an exquisite flower  simply a flower
and to think she will soon be a mother   she spoke easily and without haste  looking now and then from levin to her brother  and levin felt that the impression he was making was good  and he felt immediately at home  simple and happy with her  as though he had known her from childhood
 ivan petrovitch and i settled in alexey s study   she said in answer to stepan arkadyevitch s question whether anna karenina 1502 of 1759 he might smoke   just so as to be able to smoke  and glancing at levin  instead of asking whether he would smoke  she pulled closer a tortoise shell cigar case and took a cigarette
 how are you feeling today   her brother asked her
 oh  nothing
nerves  as usual    yes  isn t it extraordinarily fine   said stepan arkadyevitch  noticing that levin was scrutinizing the picture
 i have never seen a better portrait    and extraordinarily like  isn t it   said vorkuev
levin looked from the portrait to the original
a peculiar brilliance lighted up anna s face when she felt his eyes on her
levin flushed  and to cover his confusion would have asked whether she had seen darya alexandrovna lately  but at that moment anna spoke
 we were just talking  ivan petrovitch and i  of vashtchenkov s last pictures
have you seen them    yes  i have seen them   answered levin
 but  i beg your pardon  i interrupted you   you were saying     levin asked if she had seen dolly lately
anna karenina 1503 of 1759  she was here yesterday
she was very indignant with the high school people on grisha s account
the latin teacher  it seems  had been unfair to him    yes  i have seen his pictures i didn t care for them very much   levin went back to the subject she had started
levin talked now not at all with that purely businesslike attitude to the subject with which he had been talking all the morning
every word in his conversation with her had a special significance
and talking to her was pleasant  still pleasanter it was to listen to her
anna talked not merely naturally and cleverly  but cleverly and carelessly  attaching no value to her own ideas and giving great weight to the ideas of the person she was talking to
the conversation turned on the new movement in art  on the new illustrations of the bible by a french artist
vorkuev attacked the artist for a realism carried to the point of coarseness
levin said that the french had carried conventionality further than anyone  and that consequently they see a great merit in the return to realism
in the fact of not lying they see poetry
anna karenina 1504 of 1759 never had anything clever said by levin given him so much pleasure as this remark
anna s face lighted up at once  as at once she appreciated the thought
she laughed
 i laugh   she said   as one laughs when one sees a very true portrait
what you said so perfectly hits off french art now  painting and literature too  indeed zola  daudet
but perhaps it is always so  that men form their conceptions from fictitious  conventional types  and then all the combinaisons made they are tired of the fictitious figures and begin to invent more natural  true figures    that s perfectly true   said vorknev
 so you ve been at the club   she said to her brother
 yes  yes  this is a woman   levin thought  forgetting himself and staring persistently at her lovely  mobile face  which at that moment was all at once completely transformed levin did not hear what she was talking of as she leaned over to her brother  but he was struck by the change of her expression
her face so handsome a moment before in its repose suddenly wore a look of strange curiosity  anger  and pride
but this lasted only an instant
she dropped her eyelids  as though recollecting something
anna karenina 1505 of 1759  oh  well  but that s of no interest to anyone   she said  and she turned to the english girl
 please order the tea in the drawing room   she said in english
the girl got up and went out
 well  how did she get through her examination   asked stepan arkadyevitch
 splendidly  she s a very gifted child and a sweet character    it will end in your loving her more than your own    there a man speaks
in love there s no more nor less
i love my daughter with one love  and her with another    i was just telling anna arkadyevna   said vorkuev   that if she were to put a hundredth part of the energy she devotes to this english girl to the public question of the education of russian children  she would be doing a great and useful work    yes  but i can t help it  i couldn t do it
count alexey kirillovitch urged me very much   as she uttered the words count alexey kirillovitch she glanced with appealing timidity at levin  and he unconsciously responded with a respectful and reassuring look    he urged me to take up the school in the village
i visited it several times
the children were very nice  but i could not feel anna karenina 1506 of 1759 drawn to the work
you speak of energy
energy rests upon love  and come as it will  there s no forcing it
i took to this child i could not myself say why   and she glanced again at levin
and her smile and her glance  all told him that it was to him only she was addressing her words  valuing his good opinion  and at the same time sure beforehand that they understood each other
 i quite understand that   levin answered
 it s impossible to give one s heart to a school or such institutions in general  and i believe that s just why philanthropic institutions always give such poor results   she was silent for a while  then she smiled
 yes  yes   she agreed   i never could
je n ai pas le coeur assez large to love a whole asylum of horrid little girls
cela ne m a jamais reussi
there are so many women who have made themselves une position sociale in that way and now more than ever   she said with a mournful  confiding expression  ostensibly addressing her brother  but unmistakably intending her words only for levin   now when i have such need of some occupation  i cannot   and suddenly frowning  levin saw that she was frowning at herself for talking about herself  she changed the subject
 i know about you   she said to levin   that anna karenina 1507 of 1759 you re not a public spirited citizen  and i have defended you to the best of my ability    how have you defended me    oh  according to the attacks made on you
but won t you have some tea   she rose and took up a book bound in morocco
 give it to me  anna arkadyevna   said vorkuev  indicating the book
 it s well worth taking up    oh  no  it s all so sketchy    i told him about it   stepan arkadyevitch said to his sister  nodding at levin  you shouldn t have
my writing is something after the fashion of those little baskets and carving which liza mertsalova used to sell me from the prisons
she had the direction of the prison department in that society   she turned to levin   and they were miracles of patience  the work of those poor wretches   and levin saw a new trait in this woman  who attracted him so extraordinarily besides wit  grace  and beauty  she had truth
she had no wish to hide from him all the bitterness of her position
as she said that she sighed  and her face suddenly taking a hard expression  looked as it were turned to stone
with that expression on her face she was more beautiful than ever  but the anna karenina 1508 of 1759 expression was new  it was utterly unlike that expression  radiant with happiness and creating happiness  which had been caught by the painter in her portrait
levin looked more than once at the portrait and at her figure  as taking her brother s arm she walked with him to the high doors and he felt for her a tenderness and pity at which he wondered himself she asked levin and vorkuev to go into the drawing room  while she stayed behind to say a few words to her brother
 about her divorce  about vronsky  and what he s doing at the club  about me   wondered levin
and he was so keenly interested by the question of what she was saying to stepan arkadyevitch  that he scarcely heard what vorkuev was telling him of the qualities of the story for children anna arkadyevna had written
at tea the same pleasant sort of talk  full of interesting matter  continued
there was not a single instant when a subject for conversation was to seek  on the contrary  it was felt that one had hardly time to say what one had to say  and eagerly held back to hear what the others were saying
and all that was said  not only by her  but by vorkuev and stepan arkadyevitch all  so it seemed to levin  gained peculiar significance from her appreciation and her criticism
while he followed this interesting anna karenina 1509 of 1759 conversation  levin was all the time admiring her  her beauty  her intelligence  her culture  and at the same time her directness and genuine depth of feeling
he listened and talked  and all the while he was thinking of her inner life  trying to divine her feelings
and though he had judged her so severely hitherto  now by some strange chain of reasoning he was justifying her and was also sorry for her  and afraid that vronsky did not fully understand her
at eleven o clock  when stepan arkadyevitch got up to go  vorkuev had left earlier   it seemed to levin that he had only just come
regretfully levin too rose
 good bye   she said  holding his hand and glancing into his face with a winning look
 i am very glad que la glace est rompue   she dropped his hand  and half closed her eyes
 tell your wife that i love her as before  and that if she cannot pardon me my position  then my wish for her is that she may never pardon it
to pardon it  one must go through what i have gone through  and may god spare her that    certainly  yes  i will tell her     levin said  blushing
anna karenina 1510 of 1759  what a marvelous  sweet and unhappy woman   he was thinking  as he stepped out into the frosty air with stepan arkadyevitch
 well  didn t i tell you   said stepan arkadyevitch  seeing that levin had been completely won over
 yes   said levin dreamily   an extraordinary woman  it s not her cleverness  but she has such wonderful depth of feeling
i m awfully sorry for her    now  please god everything will soon be settled
well  well  don t be hard on people in future   said stepan arkadyevitch  opening the carriage door
 good bye  we don t go the same way   still thinking of anna  of everything  even the simplest phrase in their conversation with her  and recalling the minutest changes in her expression  entering more and more into her position  and feeling sympathy for her  levin reached home
at home kouzma told levin that katerina alexandrovna was quite well  and that her sisters had not long been gone  and he handed him two letters
levin read them at once in the hall  that he might not over look anna karenina 1511 of 1759 them later
one was from sokolov  his bailiff
sokolov wrote that the corn could not be sold  that it was fetching only five and a half roubles  and that more than that could not be got for it the other letter was from his sister
she scolded him for her business being still unsettled
 well  we must sell it at five and a half if we can t get more   levin decided the first question  which had always before seemed such a weighty one  with extraordinary facility on the spot
 it s extraordinary how all one s time is taken up here   he thought  considering the second letter
he felt himself to blame for not having got done what his sister had asked him to do for her  today  again  i ve not been to the court  but today i ve certainly not had time   and resolving that he would not fail to do it next day  he went up to his wife
as he went in  levin rapidly ran through mentally the day he had spent
all the events of the day were conversations  conversations he had heard and taken part in
all the conversations were upon subjects which  if he had been alone at home  he would never have taken up  but here they were very interesting
and all these conversations were right enough  only in two places there was something not quite right
one was what he had said about the carp  the other was something not anna karenina 1512 of 1759  quite the thing  in the tender sympathy he was feeling for anna
levin found his wife low spirited and dull
the dinner of the three sisters had gone off very well  but then they had waited and waited for him  all of them had felt dull  the sisters had departed  and she had been left alone
 well  and what have you been doing   she asked him  looking straight into his eyes  which shone with rather a suspicious brightness
but that she might not prevent his telling her everything  she concealed her close scrutiny of him  and with an approving smile listened to his account of how he had spent the evening
 well  i m very glad i met vronsky
i felt quite at ease and natural with him
you understand  i shall try not to see him  but i m glad that this awkwardness is all over   he said  and remembering that by way of trying not to see him  he had immediately gone to call on anna  he blushed
 we talk about the peasants drinking  i don t know which drinks most  the peasantry or our own class  the peasants do on holidays  but    but kitty took not the slightest interest in discussing the drinking habits of the peasants
she saw that he blushed  and she wanted to know why
 well  and then where did you go   anna karenina 1513 of 1759  stiva urged me awfully to go and see anna arkadyevna   and as he said this  levin blushed even more  and his doubts as to whether he had done right in going to see anna were settled once for all
he knew now that he ought not to have done so
kitty s eyes opened in a curious way and gleamed at anna s name  but controlling herself with an effort  she concealed her emotion and deceived him
 oh   was all she said
 i m sure you won t be angry at my going
stiva begged me to  and dolly wished it   levin went on
 oh  no   she said  but he saw in her eyes a constraint that boded him no good
 she is a very sweet  very  very unhappy  good woman   he said  telling her about anna  her occupations  and what she had told him to say to her
 yes  of course  she is very much to be pitied   said kitty  when he had finished
 whom was your letter from   he told her  and believing in her calm tone  he went to change his coat
anna karenina 1514 of 1759 coming back  he found kitty in the same easy chair
when he went up to her  she glanced at him and broke into sobs
 what  what is it   he asked  knowing beforehand what
 you re in love with that hateful woman  she has bewitched you  i saw it in your eyes
yes  yes  what can it all lead to  you were drinking at the club  drinking and gambling  and then you went   to her of all people  no  we must go away   
i shall go away tomorrow   it was a long while before levin could soothe his wife
at last he succeeded in calming her  only by confessing that a feeling of pity  in conjunction with the wine he had drunk  had been too much for him  that he had succumbed to anna s artful influence  and that he would avoid her
one thing he did with more sincerity confess to was that living so long in moscow  a life of nothing but conversation  eating and drinking  he was degenerating
they talked till three o clock in the morning
only at three o clock were they sufficiently reconciled to be able to go to sleep
anna karenina 1515 of 1759 after taking leave of her guests  anna did not sit down  but began walking up and down the room
she had unconsciously the whole evening done her utmost to arouse in levin a feeling of love as of late she had fallen into doing with all young men  and she knew she had attained her aim  as far as was possible in one evening  with a married and conscientious man
she liked him indeed extremely  and  in spite of the striking difference  from the masculine point of view  between vronsky and levin  as a woman she saw something they had in common  which had made kitty able to love both
yet as soon as he was out of the room  she ceased to think of him
one thought  and one only  pursued her in different forms  and refused to be shaken off  if i have so much effect on others  on this man  who loves his home and his wife  why is it he is so cold to me    not cold exactly  he loves me  i know that  but something new is drawing us apart now
why wasn t he here all the evening  he told stiva to say he could not leave yashvin  and must watch over his play
is yashvin a child  but supposing it s true
anna karenina 1516 of 1759 he never tells a lie
but there s something else in it if it s true
he is glad of an opportunity of showing me that he has other duties  i know that  i submit to that
but why prove that to me  he wants to show me that his love for me is not to interfere with his freedom
but i need no proofs  i need love
he ought to understand all the bitterness of this life for me here in moscow
is this life  i am not living  but waiting for an event  which is continually put off and put off
no answer again  and stiva says he cannot go to alexey alexandrovitch
and i can t write again
i can do nothing  can begin nothing  can alter nothing  i hold myself in  i wait  inventing amusements for myself the english family  writing  reading but it s all nothing but a sham  it s all the same as morphine
he ought to feel for me   she said  feeling tears of self pity coming into her eyes
she heard vronsky s abrupt ring and hurriedly dried her tears  not only dried her tears  but sat down by a lamp and opened a book  affecting composure
she wanted to show him that she was displeased that he had not come home as he had promised  displeased only  and not on any account to let him see her distress  and least of all  her self pity
she might pity herself  but he must not pity her
she did not want strife  she blamed him for anna karenina 1517 of 1759 wanting to quarrel  but unconsciously put herself into an attitude of antagonism
 well  you ve not been dull   he said  eagerly and good humoredly  going up to her
 what a terrible passion it is gambling    no  i ve not been dull  i ve learned long ago not to be dull
stiva has been here and levin    yes  they meant to come and see you
well  how did you like levin   he said  sitting down beside her
 very much
they have not long been gone
what was yashvin doing    he was winning seventeen thousand
i got him away
he had really started home  but he went back again  and now he s losing    then what did you stay for   she asked  suddenly lifting her eyes to him
the expression of her face was cold and ungracious
 you told stiva you were staying on to get yashvin away
and you have left him there   the same expression of cold readiness for the conflict appeared on his face too
 in the first place  i did not ask him to give you any message  and secondly  i never tell lies
but what s the chief point  i wanted to stay  and i stayed   he said  frowning
 anna  what is it for  why will you   he said anna karenina 1518 of 1759 after a moment s silence  bending over towards her  and he opened his hand  hoping she would lay hers in it
she was glad of this appeal for tenderness
but some strange force of evil would not let her give herself up to her feelings  as though the rules of warfare would not permit her to surrender
 of course you wanted to stay  and you stayed
you do everything you want to
but what do you tell me that for  with what object   she said  getting more and more excited
 does anyone contest your rights  but you want to be right  and you re welcome to be right   his hand closed  he turned away  and his face wore a still more obstinate expression
 for you it s a matter of obstinacy   she said  watching him intently and suddenly finding the right word for that expression that irritated her   simply obstinacy
for you it s a question of whether you keep the upper hand of me  while for me      again she felt sorry for herself  and she almost burst into tears
 if you knew what it is for me  when i feel as i do now that you are hostile  yes  hostile to me  if you knew what this means for me  if you knew how i feel on the brink of calamity at this instant  how afraid i am of myself   and she turned away  hiding her sobs
anna karenina 1519 of 1759  but what are you talking about   he said  horrified at her expression of despair  and again bending over her  he took her hand and kissed it
 what is it for  do i seek amusements outside our home  don t i avoid the society of women    well  yes  if that were all   she said
 come  tell me what i ought to do to give you peace of mind  i am ready to do anything to make you happy   he said  touched by her expression of despair   what wouldn t i do to save you from distress of any sort  as now  anna   he said
 it s nothing  nothing   she said
 i don t know myself whether it s the solitary life  my nerves   
come  don t let us talk of it
what about the race  you haven t told me   she inquired  trying to conceal her triumph at the victory  which had anyway been on her side
he asked for supper  and began telling her about the races  but in his tone  in his eyes  which became more and more cold  she saw that he did not forgive her for her victory  that the feeling of obstinacy with which she had been struggling had asserted itself again in him
he was colder to her than before  as though he were regretting his surrender
and she  remembering the words that had given her the victory   how i feel on the brink of calamity  anna karenina 1520 of 1759 how afraid i am of myself   saw that this weapon was a dangerous one  and that it could not be used a second time
and she felt that beside the love that bound them together there had grown up between them some evil spirit of strife  which she could not exorcise from his  and still less from her own heart
anna karenina 1521 of 1759 there are no conditions to which a man cannot become used  especially if he sees that all around him are living in the same way
levin could not have believed three months before that he could have gone quietly to sleep in the condition in which he was that day  that leading an aimless irrational life  living too beyond his means  after drinking to excess  he could not call what happened at the club anything else   forming inappropriately friendly relations with a man with whom his wife had once been in love  and a still more inappropriate call upon a woman who could only be called a lost woman  after being fascinated by that woman and causing his wife distress he could still go quietly to sleep
but under the influence of fatigue  a sleepless night  and the wine he had drunk  his sleep was sound and untroubled
at five o clock the creak of a door opening waked him
he jumped up and looked round
kitty was not in bed beside him
but there was a light moving behind the screen  and he heard her steps
anna karenina 1522 of 1759  what is it    what is it   he said  half asleep
 kitty  what is it    nothing   she said  coming from behind the screen with a candle in her hand
 i felt unwell   she said  smiling a particularly sweet and meaning smile
 what  has it begun   he said in terror
 we ought to send     and hurriedly he reached after his clothes
 no  no   she said  smiling and holding his hand
 it s sure to be nothing
i was rather unwell  only a little
it s all over now   and getting into bed  she blew out the candle  lay down and was still
though he thought her stillness suspicious  as though she were holding her breath  and still more suspicious the expression of peculiar tenderness and excitement with which  as she came from behind the screen  she said  nothing   he was so sleepy that he fell asleep at once
only later he remembered the stillness of her breathing  and understood all that must have been passing in her sweet  precious heart while she lay beside him  not stirring  in anticipation of the greatest event in a woman s life
at seven o clock he was waked by the touch of her hand on his shoulder  and a gentle whisper
she seemed struggling between regret at waking him  and the desire to talk to him
anna karenina 1523 of 1759  kostya  don t be frightened
it s all right
but i fancy   
we ought to send for lizaveta petrovna   the candle was lighted again
she was sitting up in bed  holding some knitting  which she had been busy upon during the last few days
 please  don t be frightened  it s all right
i m not a bit afraid   she said  seeing his scared face  and she pressed his hand to her bosom and then to her lips
he hurriedly jumped up  hardly awake  and kept his eyes fixed on her  as he put on his dressing gown  then he stopped  still looking at her
he had to go  but he could not tear himself from her eyes he thought he loved her face  knew her expression  her eyes  but never had he seen it like this
how hateful and horrible he seemed to himself  thinking of the distress he had caused her yesterday her flushed face  fringed with soft curling hair under her night cap  was radiant with joy and courage
though there was so little that was complex or artificial in kitty s character in general  levin was struck by what was revealed now  when suddenly all disguises were thrown off and the very kernel of her soul shone in her eyes
and in this simplicity and nakedness of her soul  she  the very woman he loved in her  was more manifest than ever
she looked at him  smiling  but all at once her brows anna karenina 1524 of 1759 twitched  she threw up her head  and going quickly up to him  clutched his hand and pressed close up to him  breathing her hot breath upon him
she was in pain and was  as it were  complaining to him of her suffering
and for the first minute  from habit  it seemed to him that he was to blame
but in her eyes there was a tenderness that told him that she was far from reproaching him  that she loved him for her sufferings
 if not i  who is to blame for it   he thought unconsciously  seeking someone responsible for this suffering for him to punish  but there was no one responsible
she was suffering  complaining  and triumphing in her sufferings  and rejoicing in them  and loving them
he saw that something sublime was being accomplished in her soul  but what  he could not make it out
it was beyond his understanding
 i have sent to mamma
you go quickly to fetch lizaveta petrovna    kostya    nothing  it s over   she moved away from him and rang the bell
 well  go now  pasha s coming
i am all right   and levin saw with astonishment that she had taken up the knitting she had brought in in the night and begun working at it again
as levin was going out of one door  he heard the maid servant come in at the other
he stood at the door anna karenina 1525 of 1759 and heard kitty giving exact directions to the maid  and beginning to help her move the bedstead
he dressed  and while they were putting in his horses  as a hired sledge was not to be seen yet  he ran again up to the bedroom  not on tiptoe  it seemed to him  but on wings
two maid servants were carefully moving something in the bedroom
kitty was walking about knitting rapidly and giving directions
 i m going for the doctor
they have sent for lizaveta petrovna  but i ll go on there too
isn t there anything wanted  yes  shall i go to dolly s   she looked at him  obviously not hearing what he was saying
 yes  yes
do go   she said quickly  frowning and waving her hand to him
he had just gone into the drawing room  when suddenly a plaintive moan sounded from the bedroom  smothered instantly
he stood still  and for a long while he could not understand
 yes  that is she   he said to himself  and clutching at his head he ran downstairs  lord have mercy on us  pardon us  aid us   he repeated the words that for some reason came suddenly to his lips
anna karenina 1526 of 1759 and he  an unbeliever  repeated these words not with his lips only
at that instant he knew that all his doubts  even the impossibility of believing with his reason  of which he was aware in himself  did not in the least hinder his turning to god all of that now floated out of his soul like dust
to whom was he to turn if not to him in whose hands he felt himself  his soul  and his love  the horse was not yet ready  but feeling a peculiar concentration of his physical forces and his intellect on what he had to do  he started off on foot without waiting for the horse  and told kouzma to overtake him at the corner he met a night cabman driving hurriedly
in the little sledge  wrapped in a velvet cloak  sat lizaveta petrovna with a kerchief round her head
 thank god  thank god   he said  overjoyed to recognize her little fair face which wore a peculiarly serious  even stern expression
telling the driver not to stop  he ran along beside her
 for two hours  then  not more   she inquired
 you should let pyotr dmitrievitch know  but don t hurry him
and get some opium at the chemist s    so you think that it may go on well  lord have mercy on us and help us   levin said  seeing his own horse anna karenina 1527 of 1759 driving out of the gate
jumping into the sledge beside konzma  he told him to drive to the doctor s
anna karenina 1528 of 1759 the doctor was not yet up  and the footman said that  he had been up late  and had given orders not to be waked  but would get up soon   the footman was cleaning the lamp chimneys  and seemed very busy about them
this concentration of the footman upon his lamps  and his indifference to what was passing in levin  at first astounded him  but immediately on considering the question he realized that no one knew or was bound to know his feelings  and that it was all the more necessary to act calmly  sensibly  and resolutely to get through this wall of indifference and attain his aim
 don t be in a hurry or let anything slip   levin said to himself  feeling a greater and greater flow of physical energy and attention to all that lay before him to do having ascertained that the doctor was not getting up  levin considered various plans  and decided on the following one  that konzma should go for another doctor  while he himself should go to the chemist s for opium  and if when he came back the doctor had not yet begun to get up  he would either by tipping the footman  or by force  wake the doctor at all hazards anna karenina 1529 of 1759 at the chemist s the lank shopman sealed up a packet of powders for a coachman who stood waiting  and refused him opium with the same callousness with which the doctor s footman had cleaned his lamp chimneys
trying not to get flurried or out of temper  levin mentioned the names of the doctor and midwife  and explaining what the opium was needed for  tried to persuade him
the assistant inquired in german whether he should give it  and receiving an affirmative reply from behind the partition  he took out a bottle and a funnel  deliberately poured the opium from a bigger bottle into a little one  stuck on a label  sealed it up  in spite of levin s request that he would not do so  and was about to wrap it up too
this was more than levin could stand  he took the bottle firmly out of his hands  and ran to the big glass doors
the doctor was not even now getting up  and the footman  busy now in putting down the rugs  refused to wake him
levin deliberately took out a ten rouble note  and  careful to speak slowly  though losing no time over the business  he handed him the note  and explained that pyotr dmitrievitch  what a great and important personage he seemed to levin now  this pyotr dmitrievitch  who had been of so little consequence in his eyes before   had anna karenina 1530 of 1759 promised to come at any time  that he would certainly not be angry  and that he must therefore wake him at once
the footman agreed  and went upstairs  taking levin into the waiting room
levin could hear through the door the doctor coughing  moving about  washing  and saying something
three minutes passed  it seemed to levin that more than an hour had gone by
he could not wait any longer
 pyotr dmitrievitch  pyotr dmitrievitch   he said in an imploring voice at the open door
 for god s sake  forgive me  see me as you are
it s been going on more than two hours already    i a minute  in a minute   answered a voice  and to his amazement levin heard that the doctor was smiling as he spoke
 for one instant    in a minute   two minutes more passed while the doctor was putting on his boots  and two minutes more while the doctor put on his coat and combed his hair
 pyotr dmitrievitch   levin was beginning again in a plaintive voice  just as the doctor came in dressed and ready
 these people have no conscience   thought levin
 combing his hair  while we re dying   anna karenina 1531 of 1759  good morning   the doctor said to him  shaking hands  and  as it were  teasing him with his composure
 there s no hurry
well now   trying to be as accurate as possible levin began to tell him every unnecessary detail of his wife s condition  interrupting his account repeatedly with entreaties that the doctor would come with him at once
 oh  you needn t be in any hurry
you don t understand  you know
i m certain i m not wanted  still i ve promised  and if you like  i ll come
but there s no hurry
please sit down  won t you have some coffee   levin stared at him with eyes that asked whether he was laughing at him  but the doctor had no notion of making fun of him
 i know  i know   the doctor said  smiling   i m a married man myself  and at these moments we husbands are very much to be pitied
i ve a patient whose husband always takes refuge in the stables on such occasions    but what do you think  pyotr dmitrievitch  do you suppose it may go all right    everything points to a favorable issue    so you ll come immediately   said levin  looking wrathfully at the servant who was bringing in the coffee
 in an hour s time   anna karenina 1532 of 1759  oh  for mercy s sake    well  let me drink my coffee  anyway   the doctor started upon his coffee
both were silent
 the turks are really getting beaten  though
did you read yesterday s telegrams   said the doctor  munching some roll  no  i can t stand it   said levin  jumping up
 so you ll be with us in a quarter of an hour    in half an hour    on your honor   when levin got home  he drove up at the same time as the princess  and they went up to the bedroom door together
the princess had tears in her eyes  and her hands were shaking
seeing levin  she embraced him  and burst into tears
 well  my dear lizaveta petrovna   she queried  clasping the hand of the midwife  who came out to meet them with a beaming and anxious face
 she s going on well   she said   persuade her to lie down
she will be easier so   from the moment when he had waked up and understood what was going on  levin had prepared his mind to bear resolutely what was before him  and without considering or anticipating anything  to avoid upsetting his anna karenina 1533 of 1759 wife  and on the contrary to soothe her and keep up her courage
without allowing himself even to think of what was to come  of how it would end  judging from his inquiries as to the usual duration of these ordeals  levin had in his imagination braced himself to bear up and to keep a tight rein on his feelings for five hours  and it had seemed to him he could do this but when he came back from the doctor s and saw her sufferings again  he fell to repeating more and more frequently   lord  have mercy on us  and succor us   he sighed  and flung his head up  and began to feel afraid he could not bear it  that he would burst into tears or run away
such agony it was to him
and only one hour had passed
but after that hour there passed another hour  two hours  three  the full five hours he had fixed as the furthest limit of his sufferings  and the position was still unchanged  and he was still bearing it because there was nothing to be done but bear it  every instant feeling that he had reached the utmost limits of his endurance  and that his heart would break with sympathy and pain
but still the minutes passed by and the hours  and still hours more  and his misery and horror grew and were more and more intense
anna karenina 1534 of 1759 all the ordinary conditions of life  without which one can form no conception of anything  had ceased to exist for levin
he lost all sense of time
minutes those minutes when she sent for him and he held her moist hand  that would squeeze his hand with extraordinary violence and then push it away seemed to him hours  and hours seemed to him minutes
he was surprised when lizaveta petrovna asked him to light a candle behind a screen  and he found that it was five o clock in the afternoon
if he had been told it was only ten o clock in the morning he would not have been more surprised
where he was all this time  he knew as little as the time of anything
he saw her swollen face  sometimes bewildered and in agony  sometimes smiling and trying to reassure him
he saw the old princess too  flushed and overwrought  with her gray curls in disorder  forcing herself to gulp down her tears  biting her lips  he saw dolly too and the doctor  smoking fat cigarettes  and lizaveta petrovna with a firm  resolute  reassuring face  and the old prince walking up and down the hall with a frowning face
but why they came in and went out  where they were  he did not know
the princess was with the doctor in the bedroom  then in the study  where a table set for dinner suddenly appeared  then she was not anna karenina 1535 of 1759 there  but dolly was
then levin remembered he had been sent somewhere
once he had been sent to move a table and sofa
he had done this eagerly  thinking it had to be done for her sake  and only later on he found it was his own bed he had been getting ready
then he had been sent to the study to ask the doctor something
the doctor had answered and then had said something about the irregularities in the municipal council
then he had been sent to the bedroom to help the old princess to move the holy picture in its silver and gold setting  and with the princess s old waiting maid he had clambered on a shelf to reach it and had broken the little lamp  and the old servant had tried to reassure him about the lamp and about his wife  and he carried the holy picture and set it at kitty s head  carefully tucking it in behind the pillow
but where  when  and why all this had happened  he could not tell
he did not understand why the old princess took his hand  and looking compassionately at him  begged him not to worry himself  and dolly persuaded him to eat something and led him out of the room  and even the doctor looked seriously and with commiseration at him and offered him a drop of something all he knew and felt was that what was happening was what had happened nearly a year before in the hotel of the anna karenina 1536 of 1759 country town at the deathbed of his brother nikolay
but that had been grief  this was joy
yet that grief and this joy were alike outside all the ordinary conditions of life  they were loopholes  as it were  in that ordinary life through which there came glimpses of something sublime
and in the contemplation of this sublime something the soul was exalted to inconceivable heights of which it had before had no conception  while reason lagged behind  unable to keep up with it
 lord  have mercy on us  and succor us   he repeated to himself incessantly  feeling  in spite of his long and  as it seemed  complete alienation from religion  that he turned to god just as trustfully and simply as he had in his childhood and first youth all this time he had two distinct spiritual conditions
one was away from her  with the doctor  who kept smoking one fat cigarette after another and extinguishing them on the edge of a full ash tray  with dolly  and with the old prince  where there was talk about dinner  about politics  about marya petrovna s illness  and where levin suddenly forgot for a minute what was happening  and felt as though he had waked up from sleep  the other was in her presence  at her pillow  where his heart seemed breaking and still did not break from sympathetic anna karenina 1537 of 1759 suffering  and he prayed to god without ceasing
and every time he was brought back from a moment of oblivion by a scream reaching him from the bedroom  he fell into the same strange terror that had come upon him the first minute
every time he heard a shriek  he jumped up  ran to justify himself  remembered on the way that he was not to blame  and he longed to defend her  to help her but as he looked at her  he saw again that help was impossible  and he was filled with terror and prayed   lord  have mercy on us  and help us   and as time went on  both these conditions became more intense  the calmer he became away from her  completely forgetting her  the more agonizing became both her sufferings and his feeling of helplessness before them
he jumped up  would have liked to run away  but ran to her
sometimes  when again and again she called upon him  he blamed her  but seeing her patient  smiling face  and hearing the words   i am worrying you   he threw the blame on god  but thinking of god  at once he fell to beseeching god to forgive him and have mercy
anna karenina 1538 of 1759 he did not know whether it was late or early
the candles had all burned out
dolly had just been in the study and had suggested to the doctor that he should lie down
levin sat listening to the doctor s stories of a quack mesmerizer and looking at the ashes of his cigarette
there had been a period of repose  and he had sunk into oblivion
he had completely forgotten what was going on now
he heard the doctor s chat and understood it
suddenly there came an unearthly shriek
the shriek was so awful that levin did not even jump up  but holding his breath  gazed in terrified inquiry at the doctor
the doctor put his head on one side  listened  and smiled approvingly
everything was so extraordinary that nothing could strike levin as strange
 i suppose it must be so   he thought  and still sat where he was
whose scream was this  he jumped up  ran on tiptoe to the bedroom  edged round lizaveta petrovna and the princess  and took up his position at kitty s pillow
the scream had subsided  but there was some change now
what it was he did not see and did not comprehend  and he had no wish to see or comprehend
but he saw it by the face of lizaveta petrovna
lizaveta anna karenina 1539 of 1759 petrovna s face was stern and pale  and still as resolute  though her jaws were twitching  and her eyes were fixed intently on kitty
kitty s swollen and agonized face  a tress of hair clinging to her moist brow  was turned to him and sought his eyes
her lifted hands asked for his hands
clutching his chill hands in her moist ones  she began squeezing them to her face
 don t go  don t go  i m not afraid  i m not afraid   she said rapidly
 mamma  take my earrings
they bother me
you re not afraid  quick  quick  lizaveta petrovna    she spoke quickly  very quickly  and tried to smile
but suddenly her face was drawn  she pushed him away
 oh  this is awful  i m dying  i m dying  go away   she shrieked  and again he heard that unearthly scream
levin clutched at his head and ran out of the room
 it s nothing  it s nothing  it s all right   dolly called after him
but they might say what they liked  he knew now that all was over
he stood in the next room  his head leaning against the door post  and heard shrieks  howls such as he had never heard before  and he knew that what had been kitty was uttering these shrieks
he had long ago ceased to wish for the child
by now he loathed this child
he did anna karenina 1540 of 1759 not even wish for her life now  all he longed for was the end of this awful anguish
 doctor  what is it  what is it  by god   he said  snatching at the doctor s hand as he came up
 it s the end   said the doctor
and the doctor s face was so grave as he said it that levin took the end as meaning her death
beside himself  he ran into the bedroom the first thing he saw was the face of lizaveta petrovna
it was even more frowning and stern
kitty s face he did not know
in the place where it had been was something that was fearful in its strained distortion and in the sounds that came from it
he fell down with his head on the wooden framework of the bed  feeling that his heart was bursting
the awful scream never paused  it became still more awful  and as though it had reached the utmost limit of terror  suddenly it ceased
levin could not believe his ears  but there could be no doubt  the scream had ceased and he heard a subdued stir and bustle  and hurried breathing  and her voice  gasping  alive  tender  and blissful  uttered softly   it s over   he lifted his head
with her hands hanging exhausted on the quilt  looking extraordinarily lovely and serene  she looked at him in silence and tried to smile  and could not
anna karenina 1541 of 1759 and suddenly  from the mysterious and awful far away world in which he had been living for the last twenty two hours  levin felt himself all in an instant borne back to the old every day world  glorified though now  by such a radiance of happiness that he could not bear it the strained chords snapped  sobs and tears of joy which he had never foreseen rose up with such violence that his whole body shook  that for long they prevented him from speaking
falling on his knees before the bed  he held his wife s hand before his lips and kissed it  and the hand  with a weak movement of the fingers  responded to his kiss
and meanwhile  there at the foot of the bed  in the deft hands of lizaveta petrovna  like a flickering light in a lamp  lay the life of a human creature  which had never existed before  and which would now with the same right  with the same importance to itself  live and create in its own image
 alive  alive  and a boy too  set your mind at rest   levin heard lizaveta petrovna saying  as she slapped the baby s back with a shaking hand
 mamma  is it true   said kitty s voice
the princess s sobs were all the answers she could make
and in the midst of the silence there came in anna karenina 1542 of 1759 unmistakable reply to the mother s question  a voice quite unlike the subdued voices speaking in the room
it was the bold  clamorous  self assertive squall of the new human being  who had so incomprehensibly appeared
if levin had been told before that kitty was dead  and that he had died with her  and that their children were angels  and that god was standing before him  he would have been surprised at nothing
but now  coming back to the world of reality  he had to make great mental efforts to take in that she was alive and well  and that the creature squalling so desperately was his son
kitty was alive  her agony was over
and he was unutterably happy
that he understood  he was completely happy in it
but the baby  whence  why  who was he   
he could not get used to the idea
it seemed to him something extraneous  superfluous  to which he could not accustom himself anna karenina 1543 of 1759 at ten o clock the old prince  sergey ivanovitch  and stepan arkadyevitch were sitting at levin s
having inquired after kitty  they had dropped into conversation upon other subjects
levin heard them  and unconsciously  as they talked  going over the past  over what had been up to that morning  he thought of himself as he had been yesterday till that point it was as though a hundred years had passed since then
he felt himself exalted to unattainable heights  from which he studiously lowered himself so as not to wound the people he was talking to he talked  and was all the time thinking of his wife  of her condition now  of his son  in whose existence he tried to school himself into believing the whole world of woman  which had taken for him since his marriage a new value he had never suspected before  was now so exalted that he could not take it in in his imagination
he heard them talk of yesterday s dinner at the club  and thought   what is happening with her now  is she asleep  how is she  what is she thinking of  is he crying  my son dmitri   and in the middle of the conversation  in the anna karenina 1544 of 1759 middle of a sentence  he jumped up and went out of the room
 send me word if i can see her   said the prince
 very well  in a minute   answered levin  and without stopping  he went to her room
she was not asleep  she was talking gently with her mother  making plans about the christening
carefully set to rights  with hair well brushed  in a smart little cap with some blue in it  her arms out on the quilt  she was lying on her back meeting his eyes  her eyes drew him to her
her face  bright before  brightened still more as he drew near her
there was the same change in it from earthly to unearthly that is seen in the face of the dead
but then it means farewell  here it meant welcome
again a rush of emotion  such as he had felt at the moment of the child s birth  flooded his heart
she took his hand and asked him if he had slept
he could not answer  and turned away  struggling with his weakness
 i have had a nap  kostya   she said to him   and i am so comfortable now   she looked at him  but suddenly her expression changed
anna karenina 1545 of 1759  give him to me   she said  hearing the baby s cry
 give him to me  lizaveta petrovna  and he shall look at him    to be sure  his papa shall look at him   said lizaveta petrovna  getting up and bringing something red  and queer  and wriggling
 wait a minute  we ll make him tidy first   and lizaveta petrovna laid the red wobbling thing on the bed  began untrussing and trussing up the baby  lifting it up and turning it over with one finger and powdering it with something
levin  looking at the tiny  pitiful creature  made strenuous efforts to discover in his heart some traces of fatherly feeling for it
he felt nothing towards it but disgust
but when it was undressed and he caught a glimpse of wee  wee  little hands  little feet  saffroncolored  with little toes  too  and positively with a little big toe different from the rest  and when he saw lizaveta petrovna closing the wide open little hands  as though they were soft springs  and putting them into linen garments  such pity for the little creature came upon him  and such terror that she would hurt it  that he held her hand back
lizaveta petrovna laughed
 don t be frightened  don t be frightened   anna karenina 1546 of 1759 when the baby had been put to rights and transformed into a firm doll  lizaveta petrovna dandled it as though proud of her handiwork  and stood a little away so that levin might see his son in all his glory
kitty looked sideways in the same direction  never taking her eyes off the baby
 give him to me  give him to me   she said  and even made as though she would sit up
 what are you thinking of  katerina alexandrovna  you mustn t move like that  wait a minute
i ll give him to you
here we re showing papa what a fine fellow we are   and lizaveta petrovna  with one hand supporting the wobbling head  lifted up on the other arm the strange  limp  red creature  whose head was lost in its swaddling clothes
but it had a nose  too  and slanting eyes and smacking lips
 a splendid baby   said lizaveta petrovna
levin sighed with mortification
this splendid baby excited in him no feeling but disgust and compassion
it was not at all the feeling he had looked forward to
he turned away while lizaveta petrovna put the baby to the unaccustomed breast
suddenly laughter made him look round
the baby had taken the breast
anna karenina 1547 of 1759  come  that s enough  that s enough   said lizaveta petrovna  but kitty would not let the baby go
he fell asleep in her arms  look  now   said kitty  turning the baby so that he could see it
the aged looking little face suddenly puckered up still more and the baby sneezed
smiling  hardly able to restrain his tears  levin kissed his wife and went out of the dark room
what he felt towards this little creature was utterly unlike what he had expected
there was nothing cheerful and joyous in the feeling  on the contrary  it was a new torture of apprehension
it was the consciousness of a new sphere of liability to pain
and this sense was so painful at first  the apprehension lest this helpless creature should suffer was so intense  that it prevented him from noticing the strange thrill of senseless joy and even pride that he had felt when the baby sneezed
anna karenina 1548 of 1759 stepan arkadyevitch s affairs were in a very bad way
the money for two thirds of the forest had all been spent already  and he had borrowed from the merchant in advance at ten per cent discount  almost all the remaining third
the merchant would not give more  especially as darya alexandrovna  for the first time that winter insisting on her right to her own property  had refused to sign the receipt for the payment of the last third of the forest
all his salary went on household expenses and in payment of petty debts that could not be put off
there was positively no money
this was unpleasant and awkward  and in stepan arkadyevitch s opinion things could not go on like this
the explanation of the position was  in his view  to be found in the fact that his salary was too small
the post he filled had been unmistakably very good five years ago  but it was so no longer
petrov  the bank director  had twelve thousand  sventitsky  a company director  had seventeen thousand  mitin  who had founded a bank  received fifty thousand
anna karenina 1549 of 1759  clearly i ve been napping  and they ve overlooked me   stepan arkadyevitch thought about himself and he began keeping his eyes and ears open  and towards the end of the winter he had discovered a very good berth and had formed a plan of attack upon it  at first from moscow through aunts  uncles  and friends  and then  when the matter was well advanced  in the spring  he went himself to petersburg it was one of those snug  lucrative berths of which there are so many more nowadays than there used to be  with incomes ranging from one thousand to fifty thousand roubles
it was the post of secretary of the committee of the amalgamated agency of the southern railways  and of certain banking companies
this position  like all such appointments  called for such immense energy and such varied qualifications  that it was difficult for them to be found united in any one man
and since a man combining all the qualifications was not to be found  it was at least better that the post be filled by an honest than by a dishonest man
and stepan arkadyevitch was not merely an honest man unemphatically in the common acceptation of the words  he was an honest man  emphatically in that special sense which the word has in moscow  when they talk of an  honest  politician  an  honest  writer  an  honest  newspaper  an  honest  anna karenina 1550 of 1759 institution  an  honest  tendency  meaning not simply that the man or the institution is not dishonest  but that they are capable on occasion of taking a line of their own in opposition to the authorities
stepan arkadyevitch moved in those circles in moscow in which that expression had come into use  was regarded there as an honest man  and so had more right to this appointment than others
the appointment yielded an income of from seven to ten thousand a year  and oblonsky could fill it without giving up his government position
it was in the hands of two ministers  one lady  and two jews  and all these people  though the way had been paved already with them  stepan arkadyevitch had to see in petersburg
besides this business  stepan arkadyevitch had promised his sister anna to obtain from karenin a definite answer on the question of divorce
and begging fifty roubles from dolly  he set off for petersburg
stepan arkadyevitch sat in karenin s study listening to his report on the causes of the unsatisfactory position of russian finance  and only waiting for the moment when he would finish to speak about his own business or about anna
anna karenina 1551 of 1759  yes  that s very true   he said  when alexey alexandrovitch took off the pince nez  without which he could not read now  and looked inquiringly at his former brother in law   that s very true in particular cases  but still the principle of our day is freedom    yes  but i lay down another principle  embracing the principle of freedom   said alexey alexandrovitch  with emphasis on the word  embracing   and he put on his pince nez again  so as to read the passage in which this statement was made
and turning over the beautifully written  wide margined manuscript  alexey alexandrovitch read aloud over again the conclusive passage
 i don t advocate protection for the sake of private interests  but for the public weal  and for the lower and upper classes equally   he said  looking over his pince nez at oblonsky
 but they cannot grasp that  they are taken up now with personal interests  and carried away by phrases   stepan arkadyevitch knew that when karenin began to talk of what they were doing and thinking  the persons who would not accept his report and were the cause of everything wrong in russia  that it was coming near the end
and so now he eagerly abandoned the principle of anna karenina 1552 of 1759 free trade  and fully agreed
alexey alexandrovitch paused  thoughtfully turning over the pages of his manuscript
 oh  by the way   said stepan arkadyevitch   i wanted to ask you  some time when you see pomorsky  to drop him a hint that i should be very glad to get that new appointment of secretary of the committee of the amalgamated agency of the southern railways and banking companies   stepan arkadyevitch was familiar by now with the title of the post he coveted  and he brought it out rapidly without mistake
alexey alexandrovitch questioned him as to the duties of this new committee  and pondered
he was considering whether the new committee would not be acting in some way contrary to the views he had been advocating
but as the influence of the new committee was of a very complex nature  and his views were of very wide application  he could not decide this straight off  and taking off his pince nez  he said   of course  i can mention it to him  but what is your reason precisely for wishing to obtain the appointment    it s a good salary  rising to nine thousand  and my means    anna karenina 1553 of 1759  nine thousand   repeated alexey alexandrovitch  and he frowned
the high figure of the salary made him reflect that on that side stepan arkadyevitch s proposed position ran counter to the main tendency of his own projects of reform  which always leaned towards economy
 i consider  and i have embodied my views in a note on the subject  that in our day these immense salaries are evidence of the unsound economic assiette of our finances    but what s to be done   said stepan arkadyevitch
 suppose a bank director gets ten thousand well  he s worth it  or an engineer gets twenty thousand after all  it s a growing thing  you know    i assume that a salary is the price paid for a commodity  and it ought to conform with the law of supply and demand
if the salary is fixed without any regard for that law  as  for instance  when i see two engineers leaving college together  both equally well trained and efficient  and one getting forty thousand while the other is satisfied with two  or when i see lawyers and hussars  having no special qualifications  appointed directors of banking companies with immense salaries  i conclude that the salary is not fixed in accordance with the law of supply and demand  but simply through personal anna karenina 1554 of 1759 interest
and this is an abuse of great gravity in itself  and one that reacts injuriously on the government service
i consider    stepan arkadyevitch made haste to interrupt his brother in law
 yes  but you must agree that it s a new institution of undoubted utility that s being started
after all  you know  it s a growing thing  what they lay particular stress on is the thing being carried on honestly   said stepan arkadyevitch with emphasis
but the moscow significance of the word  honest  was lost on alexey alexandrovitch
 honesty is only a negative qualification   he said
 well  you ll do me a great service  anyway   said stepan arkadyevitch   by putting in a word to pomorsky just in the way of conversation      but i fancy it s more in volgarinov s hands   said alexey alexandrovitch
 volgarinov has fully assented  as far as he s concerned   said stepan arkadyevitch  turning red
stepan arkadyevitch reddened at the mention of that name  because he had been that morning at the jew volgarinov s  and the visit had left an unpleasant recollection
anna karenina 1555 of 1759 stepan arkadyevitch believed most positively that the committee in which he was trying to get an appointment was a new  genuine  and honest public body  but that morning when volgarinov had  intentionally  beyond a doubt kept him two hours waiting with other petitioners in his waiting room  he had suddenly felt uneasy
whether he was uncomfortable that he  a descendant of rurik  prince oblonsky  had been kept for two hours waiting to see a jew  or that for the first time in his life he was not following the example of his ancestors in serving the government  but was turning off into a new career  anyway he was very uncomfortable
during those two hours in volgarinov s waiting room stepan arkadyevitch  stepping jauntily about the room  pulling his whiskers  entering into conversation with the other petitioners  and inventing an epigram on his position  assiduously concealed from others  and even from himself  the feeling he was experiencing but all the time he was uncomfortable and angry  he could not have said why whether because he could not get his epigram just right  or from some other reason
when at last volgarinov had received him with exaggerated politeness and unmistakable triumph at his humiliation  and had all but refused the favor asked of anna karenina 1556 of 1759 him  stepan arkadyevitch had made haste to forget it all as soon as possible
and now  at the mere recollection  he blushed
anna karenina 1557 of 1759  now there is something i want to talk about  and you know what it is
about anna   stepan arkadyevitch said  pausing for a brief space  and shaking off the unpleasant impression
as soon as oblonsky uttered anna s name  the face of alexey alexandrovitch was completely transformed  all the life was gone out of it  and it looked weary and dead
 what is it exactly that you want from me   he said  moving in his chair and snapping his pince nez
 a definite settlement  alexey alexandrovitch  some settlement of the position
i m appealing to you    not as an injured husband   stepan arkadyevitch was going to say  but afraid of wrecking his negotiation by this  he changed the words   not as a statesman   which did not sound a propos    but simply as a man  and a good hearted man and a christian
you must have pity on her   he said
 that is  in what way precisely   karenin said softly
 yes  pity on her
if you had seen her as i have  i have been spending all the winter with her you would have pity on her
her position is awful  simply awful   anna karenina 1558 of 1759  i had imagined   answered alexey alexandrovitch in a higher  almost shrill voice   that anna arkadyevna had everything she had desired for herself    oh  alexey alexandrovitch  for heaven s sake  don t let us indulge in recriminations  what is past is past  and you know what she wants and is waiting for divorce    but i believe anna arkadyevna refuses a divorce  if i make it a condition to leave me my son
i replied in that sense  and supposed that the matter was ended
i consider it at an end   shrieked alexey alexandrovitch
 but  for heaven s sake  don t get hot   said stepan arkadyevitch  touching his brother in law s knee
 the matter is not ended
if you will allow me to recapitulate  it was like this  when you parted  you were as magnanimous as could possibly be  you were ready to give her everything freedom  divorce even
she appreciated that
no  don t think that
she did appreciate it to such a degree that at the first moment  feeling how she had wronged you  she did not consider and could not consider everything
she gave up everything
but experience  time  have shown that her position is unbearable  impossible    the life of anna arkadyevna can have no interest for me   alexey alexandrovitch put in  lifting his eyebrows
anna karenina 1559 of 1759  allow me to disbelieve that   stepan arkadyevitch replied gently
 her position is intolerable for her  and of no benefit to anyone whatever
she has deserved it  you will say
she knows that and asks you for nothing  she says plainly that she dare not ask you
but i  all of us  her relatives  all who love her  beg you  entreat you
why should she suffer  who is any the better for it    excuse me  you seem to put me in the position of the guilty party   observed alexey alexandrovitch
 oh  no  oh  no  not at all  please understand me   said stepan arkadyevitch  touching his hand again  as though feeling sure this physical contact would soften his brotherin law
 all i say is this  her position is intolerable  and it might be alleviated by you  and you will lose nothing by it
i will arrange it all for you  so that you ll not notice it
you did promise it  you know    the promise was given before
and i had supposed that the question of my son had settled the matter
besides  i had hoped that anna arkadyevna had enough generosity     alexey alexandrovitch articulated with difficulty  his lips twitching and his face white
 she leaves it all to your generosity
she begs  she implores one thing of you to extricate her from the impossible position in which she is placed
she does not anna karenina 1560 of 1759 ask for her son now
alexey alexandrovitch  you are a good man
put yourself in her position for a minute
the question of divorce for her in her position is a question of life and death
if you had not promised it once  she would have reconciled herself to her position  she would have gone on living in the country
but you promised it  and she wrote to you  and moved to moscow
and here she s been for six months in moscow  where every chance meeting cuts her to the heart  every day expecting an answer
why  it s like keeping a condemned criminal for six months with the rope round his neck  promising him perhaps death  perhaps mercy
have pity on her  and i will undertake to arrange everything
vos scrupules     i am not talking about that  about that     alexey alexandrovitch interrupted with disgust
 but  perhaps  i promised what i had no right to promise    so you go back from your promise    i have never refused to do all that is possible  but i want time to consider how much of what i promised is possible    no  alexey alexandrovitch   cried oblonsky  jumping up   i won t believe that  she s unhappy as only an unhappy woman can be  and you cannot refuse in such    anna karenina 1561 of 1759  as much of what i promised as is possible
vous professez d etre libre penseur
but i as a believer cannot  in a matter of such gravity  act in opposition to the christian law    but in christian societies and among us  as far as i m aware  divorce is allowed   said stepan arkadyevitch
 divorce is sanctioned even by our church
and we see     it is allowed  but not in the sense     alexey alexandrovitch  you are not like yourself   said oblonsky  after a brief pause
 wasn t it you  and didn t we all appreciate it in you   who forgave everything  and moved simply by christian feeling was ready to make any sacrifice  you said yourself  if a man take thy coat  give him thy cloak also  and now     i beg   said alexey alexandrovitch shrilly  getting suddenly onto his feet  his face white and his jaws twitching   i beg you to drop this   to drop   this subject    oh  no  oh  forgive me  forgive me if i have wounded you   said stepan arkadyevitch  holding out his hand with a smile of embarrassment   but like a messenger i have simply performed the commission given me   alexey alexandrovitch gave him his hand  pondered a little  and said  anna karenina 1562 of 1759  i must think it over and seek for guidance
the day after tomorrow i will give you a final answer   he said  after considering a moment
anna karenina 1563 of 1759 stepan arkadyevitch was about to go away when korney came in to announce   sergey alexyevitch    who s sergey alexyevitch   stepan arkadyevitch was beginning  but he remembered immediately
 ah  seryozha   he said aloud
 sergey alexeitch  i thought it was the director of a department
anna asked me to see him too   he thought
and he recalled the timid  piteous expression with which anna had said to him at parting   anyway  you will see him
find out exactly where he is  who is looking after him
and stiva   if it were possible  could it be possible   stepan arkadyevitch knew what was meant by that  if it were possible   if it were possible to arrange the divorce so as to let her have her son   
stepan arkadyevitch saw now that it was no good to dream of that  but still he was glad to see his nephew
alexey alexandrovitch reminded his brother in law that they never spoke to the boy of his mother  and he begged him not to mention a single word about her
anna karenina 1564 of 1759  he was very ill after that interview with his mother  which we had not foreseen   said alexey alexandrovitch
 ideed  we feared for his life
but with rational treatment  and sea bathing in the summer  he regained his strength  and now  by the doctor s advice  i have let him go to school
and certainly the companionship of school has had a good effect on him  and he is perfectly well  and making good progress    what a fine fellow he s grown  he s not seryozha now  but quite full fledged sergey alexeitch   said stepan arkadyevitch  smiling  as he looked at the handsome  broad shouldered lad in blue coat and long trousers  who walked in alertly and confidently
the boy looked healthy and good humored
he bowed to his uncle as to a stranger  but recognizing him  he blushed and turned hurriedly away from him  as though offended and irritated at something
the boy went up to his father and handed him a note of the marks he had gained in school
 well  that s very fair   said his father   you can go    he s thinner and taller  and has grown out of being a child into a boy  i like that   said stepan arkadyevitch
 do you remember me   the boy looked back quickly at his uncle
anna karenina 1565 of 1759  yes  mon oncle   he answered  glancing at his father  and again he looked downcast
his uncle called him to him  and took his hand
 well  and how are you getting on   he said  wanting to talk to him  and not knowing what to say
the boy  blushing and making no answer  cautiously drew his hand away
as soon as stepan arkadyevitch let go his hand  he glanced doubtfully at his father  and like a bird set free  he darted out of the room
a year had passed since the last time seryozha had seen his mother
since then he had heard nothing more of her
and in the course of that year he had gone to school  and made friends among his schoolfellows
the dreams and memories of his mother  which had made him ill after seeing her  did not occupy his thoughts now when they came back to him  he studiously drove them away  regarding them as shameful and girlish  below the dignity of a boy and a schoolboy
he knew that his father and mother were separated by some quarrel  he knew that he had to remain with his father  and he tried to get used to that idea
he disliked seeing his uncle  so like his mother  for it called up those memories of which he was ashamed
he disliked it all the more as from some words he had caught anna karenina 1566 of 1759 as he waited at the study door  and still more from the faces of his father and uncle  he guessed that they must have been talking of his mother
and to avoid condemning the father with whom he lived and on whom he was dependent  and  above all  to avoid giving way to sentimentality  which he considered so degrading  seryozha tried not to look at his uncle who had come to disturb his peace of mind  and not to think of what he recalled to him
but when stepan arkadyevitch  going out after him  saw him on the stairs  and calling to him  asked him how he spent his playtime at school  seryozha talked more freely to him away from his father s presence
 we have a railway now   he said in answer to his uncle s question
 it s like this  do you see  two sit on a bench  they re the passengers  and one stands up straight on the bench
and all are harnessed to it by their arms or by their belts  and they run through all the rooms the doors are left open beforehand well  and it s pretty hard work being the conductor    that s the one that stands   stepan arkadyevitch inquired  smiling
anna karenina 1567 of 1759  yes  you want pluck for it  and cleverness too  especially when they stop all of a sudden  or someone falls down    yes  that must be a serious matter   said stepan arkadyevitch  watching with mournful interest the eager eyes  like his mother s  not childish now no longer fully innocent
and though he had promised alexey alexandrovitch not to speak of anna  he could not restrain himself  do you remember your mother   he asked suddenly
 no  i don t   seryozha said quickly
he blushed crimson  and his face clouded over and his uncle could get nothing more out of him
his tutor found his pupil on the staircase half an hour later  and for a long while he could not make out whether he was ill tempered or crying
 what is it  i expect you hurt yourself when you fell down   said the tutor
 i told you it was a dangerous game
and we shall have to speak to the director    if i had hurt myself  nobody should have found it out  that s certain    well  what is it  then    leave me alone  if i remember  or if i don t remember    what business is it of his  why should i anna karenina 1568 of 1759 remember  leave me in peace   he said  addressing not his tutor  but the whole world
anna karenina 1569 of 1759 stepan arkadyevitch  as usual  did not waste his time in petersburg
in petersburg  besides business  his sister s divorce  and his coveted appointment  he wanted  as he always did  to freshen himself up  as he said  after the mustiness of moscow in spite of its cafes chantants and its omnibuses  moscow was yet a stagnant bog
stepan arkadyevitch always felt it
after living for some time in moscow  especially in close relations with his family  he was conscious of a depression of spirits
after being a long time in moscow without a change  he reached a point when he positively began to be worrying himself over his wife s illhumor and reproaches  over his children s health and education  and the petty details of his official work  even the fact of being in debt worried him but he had only to go and stay a little while in petersburg  in the circle there in which he moved  where people lived really lived  instead of vegetating as in moscow  and all such ideas vanished and melted away at once  like wax before the fire
his wife   
only that day he had been talking to prince tchetchensky prince tchetchensky had a wife and anna karenina 1570 of 1759 family  grown up pages in the corps    and he had another illegitimate family of children also though the first family was very nice too  prince tchetchensky felt happier in his second family  and he used to take his eldest son with him to his second family  and told stepan arkadyevitch that he thought it good for his son  enlarging his ideas what would have been said to that in moscow  his children  in petersburg children did not prevent their parents from enjoying life
the children were brought up in schools  and there was no trace of the wild idea that prevailed in moscow  in lvov s household  for instance  that all the luxuries of life were for the children  while the parents have nothing but work and anxiety
here people understood that a man is in duty bound to live for himself  as every man of culture should live his official duties  official work here was not the stiff  hopeless drudgery that it was in moscow
here there was some interest in official life
a chance meeting  a service rendered  a happy phrase  a knack of facetious mimicry  and a man s career might be made in a trice
so it had been with bryantsev  whom stepan arkadyevitch had met the previous day  and who was one of the highest functionaries in government now
there was some interest in official work like that
anna karenina 1571 of 1759 the petersburg attitude on pecuniary matters had an especially soothing effect on stepan arkadyevitch
bartnyansky  who must spend at least fifty thousand to judge by the style he lived in  had made an interesting comment the day before on that subject
as they were talking before dinner  stepan arkadyevitch said to bartnyansky   you re friendly  i fancy  with mordvinsky  you might do me a favor  say a word to him  please  for me
there s an appointment i should like to get secretary of the agency     oh  i shan t remember all that  if you tell it to me   
but what possesses you to have to do with railways and jews   
take it as you will  it s a low business   stepan arkadyevitch did not say to bartnyansky that it was a  growing thing  bartnyansky would not have understood that
 i want the money  i ve nothing to live on    you re living  aren t you    yes  but in debt    are you  though  heavily   said bartnyansky sympathetically
 very heavily  twenty thousand   bartnyansky broke into good humored laughter
anna karenina 1572 of 1759  oh  lucky fellow   said he
 my debts mount up to a million and a half  and i ve nothing  and still i can live  as you see   and stepan arkadyevitch saw the correctness of this view not in words only but in actual fact
zhivahov owed three hundred thousand  and hadn t a farthing to bless himself with  and he lived  and in style too  count krivtsov was considered a hopeless case by everyone  and yet he kept two mistresses petrovsky had run through five millions  and still lived in just the same style  and was even a manager in the financial department with a salary of twenty thousand
but besides this  petersburg had physically an agreeable effect on stepan arkadyevitch
it made him younger
in moscow he sometimes found a gray hair in his head  dropped asleep after dinner  stretched  walked slowly upstairs  breathing heavily  was bored by the society of young women  and did not dance at balls in petersburg he always felt ten years younger
his experience in petersburg was exactly what had been described to him on the previous day by prince pyotr oblonsky  a man of sixty  who had just come back from abroad   we don t know the way to live here   said pyotr oblonsky
 i spent the summer in baden  and you anna karenina 1573 of 1759 wouldn t believe it  i felt quite a young man
at a glimpse of a pretty woman  my thoughts   
one dines and drinks a glass of wine  and feels strong and ready for anything
i came home to russia had to see my wife  and  what s more  go to my country place  and there  you d hardly believe it  in a fortnight i d got into a dressing gown and given up dressing for dinner
needn t say i had no thoughts left for pretty women
i became quite an old gentleman
there was nothing left for me but to think of my eternal salvation
i went off to paris i was as right as could be at once   stepan arkadyevitch felt exactly the difference that pyotr oblonsky described
in moscow he degenerated so much that if he had had to be there for long together  he might in good earnest have come to considering his salvation  in petersburg he felt himself a man of the world again between princess betsy tverskaya and stepan arkadyevitch there had long existed rather curious relations
stepan arkadyevitch always flirted with her in jest  and used to say to her  also in jest  the most unseemly things  knowing that nothing delighted her so much
the day after his conversation with karenin  stepan arkadyevitch went to see her  and felt so youthful that in anna karenina 1574 of 1759 this jesting flirtation and nonsense he recklessly went so far that he did not know how to extricate himself  as unluckily he was so far from being attracted by her that he thought her positively disagreeable what made it hard to change the conversation was the fact that he was very attractive to her
so that he was considerably relieved at the arrival of princess myakaya  which cut short their tetea tete
 ah  so you re here   said she when she saw him
 well  and what news of your poor sister  you needn t look at me like that   she added
 ever since they ve all turned against her  all those who re a thousand times worse than she  i ve thought she did a very fine thing
i can t forgive vronsky for not letting me know when she was in petersburg
i d have gone to see her and gone about with her everywhere
please give her my love
come  tell me about her    yes  her position is very difficult  she     began stepan arkadyevitch  in the simplicity of his heart accepting as sterling coin princess myakaya s words  tell me about her   princess myakaya interrupted him immediately  as she always did  and began talking herself
 she s done what they all do  except me only they hide it
but she wouldn t be deceitful  and she did a fine anna karenina 1575 of 1759 thing
and she did better still in throwing up that crazy brother in law of yours
you must excuse me
everybody used to say he was so clever  so very clever  i was the only one that said he was a fool
now that he s so thick with lidia ivanovna and landau  they all say he s crazy  and i should prefer not to agree with everybody  but this time i can t help it    oh  do please explain   said stepan arkadyevitch   what does it mean  yesterday i was seeing him on my sister s behalf  and i asked him to give me a final answer
he gave me no answer  and said he would think it over
but this morning  instead of an answer  i received an invitation from countess lidia ivanovna for this evening    ah  so that s it  that s it   said princess myakaya gleefully   they re going to ask landau what he s to say    ask landau  what for  who or what s landau    what  you don t know jules landau  le fameux jules landau  le clairvoyant  he s crazy too  but on him your sister s fate depends
see what comes of living in the provinces you know nothing about anything
landau  do you see  was a commis in a shop in paris  and he went to a doctor s  and in the doctor s waiting room he fell asleep  and in his sleep he began giving advice to all the patients
and wonderful advice it was  then the wife of anna karenina 1576 of 1759 yury meledinsky you know  the invalid  heard of this landau  and had him to see her husband
and he cured her husband  though i can t say that i see he did him much good  for he s just as feeble a creature as ever he was  but they believed in him  and took him along with them and brought him to russia
here there s been a general rush to him  and he s begun doctoring everyone
he cured countess bezzubova  and she took such a fancy to him that she adopted him    adopted him    yes  as her son
he s not landau any more now  but count bezzubov
that s neither here nor there  though  but lidia i m very fond of her  but she has a screw loose somewhere has lost her heart to this landau now  and nothing is settled now in her house or alexey alexandrovitch s without him  and so your sister s fate is now in the hands of landau  alias count bezzubov   anna karenina 1577 of 1759 after a capital dinner and a great deal of cognac drunk at bartnyansky s  stepan arkadyevitch  only a little later than the appointed time  went in to countess lidia ivanovna s
 who else is with the countess  a frenchman   stepan arkadyevitch asked the hall porter  as he glanced at the familiar overcoat of alexey alexandrovitch and a queer  rather artless looking overcoat with clasps
 alexey alexandrovitch karenin and count bezzubov   the porter answered severely
 princess myakaya guessed right   thought stepan arkadyevitch  as he went upstairs
 curious  it would be quite as well  though  to get on friendly terms with her she has immense influence
if she would say a word to pomorsky  the thing would be a certainty   it was still quite light out of doors  but in countess lidia ivanovna s little drawing room the blinds were drawn and the lamps lighted
at a round table under a lamp sat the countess and alexey alexandrovitch  talking softly
a short  thinnish man  very pale and handsome  with feminine hips and knock kneed legs  with fine anna karenina 1578 of 1759 brilliant eyes and long hair lying on the collar of his coat  was standing at the end of the room gazing at the portraits on the wall
after greeting the lady of the house and alexey alexandrovitch  stepan arkadyevitch could not resist glancing once more at the unknown man
 monsieur landau   the countess addressed him with a softness and caution that impressed oblonsky
and she introduced them
landau looked round hurriedly  came up  and smiling  laid his moist  lifeless hand in stepan arkadyevitch s outstretched hand and immediately walked away and fell to gazing at the portraits again the countess and alexey alexandrovitch looked at each other significantly
 i am very glad to see you  particularly today   said countess lidia ivanovna  pointing stepan arkadyevitch to a seat beside karenin
 i introduced you to him as landau   she said in a soft voice  glancing at the frenchman and again immediately after at alexey alexandrovitch   but he is really count bezzubov  as you re probably aware
only he does not like the title    yes  i heard so   answered stepan arkadyevitch   they say he completely cured countess bezzubova   anna karenina 1579 of 1759  she was here today  poor thing   the countess said  turning to alexey alexandrovitch
 this separation is awful for her
it s such a blow to her    and he positively is going   queried alexey alexandrovitch
 yes  he s going to paris
he heard a voice yesterday   said countess lidia ivanovna  looking at stepan arkadyevitch
 ah  a voice   repeated oblonsky  feeling that he must be as circumspect as he possibly could in this society  where something peculiar was going on  or was to go on  to which he had not the key a moment s silence followed  after which countess lidia ivanovna  as though approaching the main topic of conversation  said with a fine smile to oblonsky   i ve known you for a long while  and am very glad to make a closer acquaintance with you
les amis de nos amis sont nos amis
but to be a true friend  one must enter into the spiritual state of one s friend  and i fear that you are not doing so in the case of alexey alexandrovitch
you understand what i mean   she said  lifting her fine pensive eyes
 in part  countess  i understand the position of alexey alexandrovitch     said oblonsky
having no clear idea anna karenina 1580 of 1759 what they were talking about  he wanted to confine himself to generalities  the change is not in his external position   countess lidia ivanovna said sternly  following with eyes of love the figure of alexey alexandrovitch as he got up and crossed over to landau   his heart is changed  a new heart has been vouchsafed him  and i fear you don t fully apprehend the change that has taken place in him    oh  well  in general outlines i can conceive the change
we have always been friendly  and now     said stepan arkadyevitch  responding with a sympathetic glance to the expression of the countess  and mentally balancing the question with which of the two ministers she was most intimate  so as to know about which to ask her to speak for him
 the change that has taken place in him cannot lessen his love for his neighbors  on the contrary  that change can only intensify love in his heart
but i am afraid you do not understand me
won t you have some tea   she said  with her eyes indicating the footman  who was handing round tea on a tray
 not quite  countess
of course  his misfortune     yes  a misfortune which has proved the highest happiness  when his heart was made new  was filled full of anna karenina 1581 of 1759 it   she said  gazing with eyes full of love at stepan arkadyevitch
 i do believe i might ask her to speak to both of them   thought stepan arkadyevitch
 oh  of course  countess   he said   but i imagine such changes are a matter so private that no one  even the most intimate friend  would care to speak of them    on the contrary  we ought to speak freely and help one another    yes  undoubtedly so  but there is such a difference of convictions  and besides     said oblonsky with a soft smile
 there can be no difference where it is a question of holy truth    oh  no  of course  but     and stepan arkadyevitch paused in confusion
he understood at last that they were talking of religion
 i fancy he will fall asleep immediately   said alexey alexandrovitch in a whisper full of meaning  going up to lidia ivanovna
stepan arkadyevitch looked round
landau was sitting at the window  leaning on his elbow and the back of his chair  his head drooping
noticing that all eyes were anna karenina 1582 of 1759 turned on him he raised his head and smiled a smile of childlike artlessness
 don t take any notice   said lidia ivanovna  and she lightly moved a chair up for alexey alexandrovitch
 i have observed     she was beginning  when a footman came into the room with a letter
lidia ivanovna rapidly ran her eyes over the note  and excusing herself  wrote an answer with extraordinary rapidity  handed it to the man  and came back to the table
 i have observed   she went on   that moscow people  especially the men  are more indifferent to religion than anyone    oh  no  countess  i thought moscow people had the reputation of being the firmest in the faith   answered stepan arkadyevitch
 but as far as i can make out  you are unfortunately one of the indifferent ones   said alexey alexandrovitch  turning to him with a weary smile
 how anyone can be indifferent   said lidia ivanovna
 i am not so much indifferent on that subject as i am waiting in suspense   said stepan arkadyevitch  with his most deprecating smile
 i hardly think that the time for such questions has come yet for me   alexey alexandrovitch and lidia ivanovna looked at each other
anna karenina 1583 of 1759  we can never tell whether the time has come for us or not   said alexey alexandrovitch severely
 we ought not to think whether we are ready or not ready
god s grace is not guided by human considerations  sometimes it comes not to those that strive for it  and comes to those that are unprepared  like saul    no  i believe it won t be just yet   said lidia ivanovna  who had been meanwhile watching the movements of the frenchman
landau got up and came to them
 do you allow me to listen   he asked
 oh  yes  i did not want to disturb you   said lidia ivanovna  gazing tenderly at him   sit here with us    one has only not to close one s eyes to shut out the light   alexey alexandrovitch went on
 ah  if you knew the happiness we know  feeling his presence ever in our hearts   said countess lidia ivanovna with a rapturous smile
 but a man may feel himself unworthy sometimes to rise to that height   said stepan arkadyevitch  conscious of hypocrisy in admitting this religious height  but at the same time unable to bring himself to acknowledge his free thinking views before a person who  by a single word to pomorsky  might procure him the coveted appointment anna karenina 1584 of 1759  that is  you mean that sin keeps him back   said lidia ivanovna
 but that is a false idea
there is no sin for believers  their sin has been atoned for
pardon   she added  looking at the footman  who came in again with another letter
she read it and gave a verbal answer   tomorrow at the grand duchess s  say    for the believer sin is not   she went on
 yes  but faith without works is dead   said stepan arkadyevitch  recalling the phrase from the catechism  and only by his smile clinging to his independence
 there you have it from the epistle of st
james   said alexey alexandrovitch  addressing lidia ivanovna  with a certain reproachfulness in his tone
it was unmistakably a subject they had discussed more than once before
 what harm has been done by the false interpretation of that passage  nothing holds men back from belief like that misinterpretation
 i have not works  so i cannot believe   though all the while that is not said
but the very opposite is said    striving for god  saving the soul by fasting   said countess lidia ivanovna  with disgusted contempt   those are the crude ideas of our monks   
yet that is nowhere said
it is far simpler and easier   she added  looking at oblonsky with the same encouraging smile with which at anna karenina 1585 of 1759 court she encouraged youthful maids of honor  disconcerted by the new surroundings of the court
 we are saved by christ who suffered for us
we are saved by faith   alexey alexandrovitch chimed in  with a glance of approval at her words
 vous comprenez l anglais   asked lidia ivanovna  and receiving a reply in the affirmative  she got up and began looking through a shelf of books
 i want to read him  safe and happy   or  under the wing    she said  looking inquiringly at karenin
and finding the book  and sitting down again in her place  she opened it
 it s very short
in it is described the way by which faith can be reached  and the happiness  above all earthly bliss  with which it fills the soul
the believer cannot be unhappy because he is not alone
but you will see   she was just settling herself to read when the footman came in again
 madame borozdina  tell her  tomorrow at two o clock
yes   she said  putting her finger in the place in the book  and gazing before her with her fine pensive eyes   that is how true faith acts
you know marie sanina  you know about her trouble  she lost her only child
she was in despair
and what happened  she found this comforter  and she thanks god now for the death of her child
such is the happiness faith brings   anna karenina 1586 of 1759  oh  yes  that is most     said stepan arkadyevitch  glad they were going to read  and let him have a chance to collect his faculties
 no  i see i d better not ask her about anything today   he thought
 if only i can get out of this without putting my foot in it    it will be dull for you   said countess lidia ivanovna  addressing landau   you don t know english  but it s short    oh  i shall understand   said landau  with the same smile  and he closed his eyes
alexey alexandrovitch and lidia ivanovna exchanged meaningful glances  and the reading began
anna karenina 1587 of 1759 stepan arkadyevitch felt completely nonplussed by the strange talk which he was hearing for the first time
the complexity of petersburg  as a rule  had a stimulating effect on him  rousing him out of his moscow stagnation
but he liked these complications  and understood them only in the circles he knew and was at home in
in these unfamiliar surroundings he was puzzled and disconcerted  and could not get his bearings
as he listened to countess lidia ivanovna  aware of the beautiful  artless or perhaps artful  he could not decide which eyes of landau fixed upon him  stepan arkadyevitch began to be conscious of a peculiar heaviness in his head
the most incongruous ideas were in confusion in his head
 marie sanina is glad her child s dead   
how good a smoke would be now   
to be saved  one need only believe  and the monks don t know how the thing s to be done  but countess lidia ivanovna does know   
and why is my head so heavy  is it the cognac  or all this being so queer  anyway  i fancy i ve done nothing unsuitable so far
but anyway  it won t do to ask her now
they say they make one say one s prayers
i only hope they won t anna karenina 1588 of 1759 make me  that ll be too imbecile
and what stuff it is she s reading  but she has a good accent
landau  bezzubov  what s he bezzubov for   all at once stepan arkadyevitch became aware that his lower jaw was uncontrollably forming a yawn
he pulled his whiskers to cover the yawn  and shook himself together but soon after he became aware that he was dropping asleep and on the very point of snoring
he recovered himself at the very moment when the voice of countess lidia ivanovna was saying  he s asleep   stepan arkadyevitch started with dismay  feeling guilty and caught but he was reassured at once by seeing that the words  he s asleep  referred not to him  but to landau
the frenchman was asleep as well as stepan arkadyevitch
but stepan arkadyevitch s being asleep would have offended them  as he thought  though even this  he thought  might not be so  as everything seemed so queer   while landau s being asleep delighted them extremely  especially countess lidia ivanovna
 mon ami   said lidia ivanovna  carefully holding the folds of her silk gown so as not to rustle  and in her excitement calling karenin not alexey alexandrovitch  but  mon ami    donnez lui la main
vous voyez  sh   she hissed at the footman as he came in again
 not at home   anna karenina 1589 of 1759 the frenchman was asleep  or pretending to be asleep  with his head on the back of his chair  and his moist hand  as it lay on his knee  made faint movements  as though trying to catch something
alexey alexandrovitch got up  tried to move carefully  but stumbled against the table  went up and laid his hand in the frenchman s hand
stepan arkadyevitch got up too  and opening his eyes wide  trying to wake himself up if he were asleep  he looked first at one and then at the other it was all real
stepan arkadyevitch felt that his head was getting worse and worse
 que la personne qui est arrivee la derniere  celle qui demande  qu elle sorte  qu elle sorte   articulated the frenchman  without opening his eyes
 vous m excuserez  mais vous voyez   
revenez vers dix heures  encore mieux demain    qu elle sorte   repeated the frenchman impatiently
 c est moi  n est ce pas   and receiving an answer in the affirmative  stepan arkadyevitch  forgetting the favor he had meant to ask of lidia ivanovna  and forgetting his sister s affairs  caring for nothing  but filled with the sole desire to get away as soon as possible  went out on tiptoe and ran out into the street as though from a plague  anna karenina 1590 of 1759 stricken house
for a long while he chatted and joked with his cab driver  trying to recover his spirits
at the french theater where he arrived for the last act  and afterwards at the tatar restaurant after his champagne  stepan arkadyevitch felt a little refreshed in the atmosphere he was used to
but still he felt quite unlike himself all that evening on getting home to pyotr oblonsky s  where he was staying  stepan arkadyevitch found a note from betsy
she wrote to him that she was very anxious to finish their interrupted conversation  and begged him to come next day
he had scarcely read this note  and frowned at its contents  when he heard below the ponderous tramp of the servants  carrying something heavy
stepan arkadyevitch went out to look
it was the rejuvenated pyotr oblonsky
he was so drunk that he could not walk upstairs  but he told them to set him on his legs when he saw stepan arkadyevitch  and clinging to him  walked with him into his room and there began telling him how he had spent the evening  and fell asleep doing so
stepan arkadyevitch was in very low spirits  which happened rarely with him  and for a long while he could not go to sleep
everything he could recall to his mind  anna karenina 1591 of 1759 everything was disgusting  but most disgusting of all  as if it were something shameful  was the memory of the evening he had spent at countess lidia ivanovna s
next day he received from alexey alexandrovitch a final answer  refusing to grant anna s divorce  and he understood that this decision was based on what the frenchman had said in his real or pretended trance
anna karenina 1592 of 1759 in order to carry through any undertaking in family life  there must necessarily be either complete division between the husband and wife  or loving agreement
when the relations of a couple are vacillating and neither one thing nor the other  no sort of enterprise can be undertaken
many families remain for years in the same place  though both husband and wife are sick of it  simply because there is neither complete division nor agreement between them
both vronsky and anna felt life in moscow insupportable in the heat and dust  when the spring sunshine was followed by the glare of summer  and all the trees in the boulevards had long since been in full leaf  and the leaves were covered with dust
but they did not go back to vozdvizhenskoe  as they had arranged to do long before  they went on staying in moscow  though they both loathed it  because of late there had been no agreement between them
the irritability that kept them apart had no external cause  and all efforts to come to an understanding anna karenina 1593 of 1759 intensified it  instead of removing it
it was an inner irritation  grounded in her mind on the conviction that his love had grown less  in his  on regret that he had put himself for her sake in a difficult position  which she  instead of lightening  made still more difficult neither of them gave full utterance to their sense of grievance  but they considered each other in the wrong  and tried on every pretext to prove this to one another
in her eyes the whole of him  with all his habits  ideas  desires  with all his spiritual and physical temperament  was one thing love for women  and that love  she felt  ought to be entirely concentrated on her alone
that love was less  consequently  as she reasoned  he must have transferred part of his love to other women or to another woman and she was jealous
she was jealous not of any particular woman but of the decrease of his love
not having got an object for her jealousy  she was on the lookout for it
at the slightest hint she transferred her jealousy from one object to another
at one time she was jealous of those low women with whom he might so easily renew his old bachelor ties  then she was jealous of the society women he might meet  then she was jealous of the imaginary girl whom he might want to marry  for whose sake he would break with her
and this last form of anna karenina 1594 of 1759 jealousy tortured her most of all  especially as he had unwarily told her  in a moment of frankness  that his mother knew him so little that she had had the audacity to try and persuade him to marry the young princess sorokina
and being jealous of him  anna was indignant against him and found grounds for indignation in everything
for everything that was difficult in her position she blamed him
the agonizing condition of suspense she had passed in moscow  the tardiness and indecision of alexey alexandrovitch  her solitude she put it all down to him
if he had loved her he would have seen all the bitterness of her position  and would have rescued her from it
for her being in moscow and not in the country  he was to blame too
he could not live buried in the country as she would have liked to do
he must have society  and he had put her in this awful position  the bitterness of which he would not see
and again  it was his fault that she was forever separated from her son
even the rare moments of tenderness that came from time to time did not soothe her  in his tenderness now she saw a shade of complacency  of self confidence  which had not been of old and which exasperated her
anna karenina 1595 of 1759 it was dusk
anna was alone  and waiting for him to come back from a bachelor dinner
she walked up and down in his study  the room where the noise from the street was least heard   and thought over every detail of their yesterday s quarrel
going back from the wellremembered  offensive words of the quarrel to what had been the ground of it  she arrived at last at its origin
for a long while she could hardly believe that their dissension had arisen from a conversation so inoffensive  of so little moment to either
but so it actually had been
it all arose from his laughing at the girls  high schools  declaring they were useless  while she defended them
he had spoken slightingly of women s education in general  and had said that hannah  anna s english protegee  had not the slightest need to know anything of physics
this irritated anna
she saw in this a contemptuous reference to her occupations
and she bethought her of a phrase to pay him back for the pain he had given her
 i don t expect you to understand me  my feelings  as anyone who loved me might  but simple delicacy i did expect   she said
and he had actually flushed with vexation  and had said something unpleasant
she could not recall her answer  but anna karenina 1596 of 1759 at that point  with an unmistakable desire to wound her too  he had said   i feel no interest in your infatuation over this girl  that s true  because i see it s unnatural   the cruelty with which he shattered the world she had built up for herself so laboriously to enable her to endure her hard life  the injustice with which he had accused her of affectation  of artificiality  aroused her
 i am very sorry that nothing but what s coarse and material is comprehensible and natural to you   she said and walked out of the room
when he had come in to her yesterday evening  they had not referred to the quarrel  but both felt that the quarrel had been smoothed over  but was not at an end
today he had not been at home all day  and she felt so lonely and wretched in being on bad terms with him that she wanted to forget it all  to forgive him  and be reconciled with him  she wanted to throw the blame on herself and to justify him  i am myself to blame i m irritable  i m insanely jealous
i will make it up with him  and we ll go away to the country  there i shall be more at peace    unnatural   she suddenly recalled the word that had stung her most of all  not so much the word itself as the anna karenina 1597 of 1759 intent to wound her with which it was said
 i know what he meant  he meant  unnatural  not loving my own daughter  to love another person s child
what does he know of love for children  of my love for seryozha  whom i ve sacrificed for him  but that wish to wound me  no  he loves another woman  it must be so   and perceiving that  while trying to regain her peace of mind  she had gone round the same circle that she had been round so often before  and had come back to her former state of exasperation  she was horrified at herself
 can it be impossible  can it be beyond me to control myself   she said to herself  and began again from the beginning
 he s truthful  he s honest  he loves me
i love him  and in a few days the divorce will come
what more do i want  i want peace of mind and trust  and i will take the blame on myself
yes  now when he comes in  i will tell him i was wrong  though i was not wrong  and we will go away tomorrow   and to escape thinking any more  and being overcome by irritability  she rang  and ordered the boxes to be brought up for packing their things for the country
at ten o clock vronsky came in
anna karenina 1598 of 1759  well  was it nice   she asked  coming out to meet him with a penitent and meek expression
 just as usual   he answered  seeing at a glance that she was in one of her good moods
he was used by now to these transitions  and he was particularly glad to see it today  as he was in a specially good humor himself  what do i see  come  that s good   he said  pointing to the boxes in the passage
 yes  we must go
i went out for a drive  and it was so fine i longed to be in the country
there s nothing to keep you  is there    it s the one thing i desire
i ll be back directly  and we ll talk it over  i only want to change my coat
order some tea   and he went into his room
there was something mortifying in the way he had said  come  that s good   as one says to a child when it leaves off being naughty  and still more mortifying was the contrast between her penitent and his self confident tone  and for one instant she felt the lust of strife rising up in her anna karenina 1599 of 1759 again  but making an effort she conquered it  and met vronsky as good humoredly as before
when he came in she told him  partly repeating phrases she had prepared beforehand  how she had spent the day  and her plans for going away
 you know it came to me almost like an inspiration   she said
 why wait here for the divorce  won t it be just the same in the country  i can t wait any longer  i don t want to go on hoping  i don t want to hear anything about the divorce
i have made up my mind it shall not have any more influence on my life
do you agree    oh  yes   he said  glancing uneasily at her excited face
 what did you do  who was there   she said  after a pause
vronsky mentioned the names of the guests
 the dinner was first rate  and the boat race  and it was all pleasant enough  but in moscow they can never do anything without something ridicule
a lady of a sort appeared on the scene  teacher of swimming to the queen of sweden  and gave us an exhibition of her skill    how  did she swim   asked anna  frowning
 in an absurd red costume de natation  she was old and hideous too
so when shall we go   anna karenina 1600 of 1759  what an absurd fancy  why  did she swim in some special way  then   said anna  not answering
 there was absolutely nothing in it
that s just what i say  it was awfully stupid
well  then  when do you think of going   anna shook her head as though trying to drive away some unpleasant idea
 when  why  the sooner the better  by tomorrow we shan t be ready
the day after tomorrow    yes   oh  no  wait a minute  the day after tomorrow s sunday  i have to be at maman s   said vronsky  embarrassed  because as soon as he uttered his mother s name he was aware of her intent  suspicious eyes
his embarrassment confirmed her suspicion
she flushed hotly and drew away from him
it was now not the queen of sweden s swimming mistress who filled anna s imagination  but the young princess sorokina
she was staying in a village near moscow with countess vronskaya
 can t you go tomorrow   she said
 well  no  the deeds and the money for the business i m going there for i can t get by tomorrow   he answered
 if so  we won t go at all   anna karenina 1601 of 1759  but why so    i shall not go later
monday or never    what for   said vronsky  as though in amazement
 why  there s no meaning in it    there s no meaning in it to you  because you care nothing for me
you don t care to understand my life
the one thing that i cared for here was hannah
you say it s affectation
why  you said yesterday that i don t love my daughter  that i love this english girl  that it s unnatural
i should like to know what life there is for me that could be natural   for an instant she had a clear vision of what she was doing  and was horrified at how she had fallen away from her resolution
but even though she knew it was her own ruin  she could not restrain herself  could not keep herself from proving to him that he was wrong  could not give way to him
 i never said that  i said i did not sympathize with this sudden passion    how is it  though you boast of your straightforwardness  you don t tell the truth    i never boast  and i never tell lies   he said slowly  restraining his rising anger
 it s a great pity if you can t respect    anna karenina 1602 of 1759  respect was invented to cover the empty place where love should be
and if you don t love me any more  it would be better and more honest to say so    no  this is becoming unbearable   cried vronsky  getting up from his chair  and stopping short  facing her  he said  speaking deliberately   what do you try my patience for   looking as though he might have said much more  but was restraining himself  it has limits    what do you mean by that   she cried  looking with terror at the undisguised hatred in his whole face  and especially in his cruel  menacing eyes  i mean to say     he was beginning  but he checked himself  i must ask what it is you want of me    what can i want  all i can want is that you should not desert me  as you think of doing   she said  understanding all he had not uttered
 but that i don t want  that s secondary
i want love  and there is none
so then all is over   she turned towards the door
 stop  sto op   said vronsky  with no change in the gloomy lines of his brows  though he held her by the hand
 what is it all about  i said that we must put off going for three days  and on that you told me i was lying  that i was not an honorable man   anna karenina 1603 of 1759  yes  and i repeat that the man who reproaches me with having sacrificed everything for me   she said  recalling the words of a still earlier quarrel   that he s worse than a dishonorable man  he s a heartless man    oh  there are limits to endurance   he cried  and hastily let go her hand
 he hates me  that s clear   she thought  and in silence  without looking round  she walked with faltering steps out of the room
 he loves another woman  that s even clearer   she said to herself as she went into her own room
 i want love  and there is none
so  then  all is over   she repeated the words she had said   and it must be ended    but how   she asked herself  and she sat down in a low chair before the looking glass
thoughts of where she would go now  whether to the aunt who had brought her up  to dolly  or simply alone abroad  and of what he was doing now alone in his study  whether this was the final quarrel  or whether reconciliation were still possible  and of what all her old friends at petersburg would say of her now  and of how alexey alexandrovitch would look at it  and many other ideas of what would happen now after this rupture  came into her head  but she did not give herself up to them with all her heart
at the bottom of her heart was some obscure anna karenina 1604 of 1759 idea that alone interested her  but she could not get clear sight of it
thinking once more of alexey alexandrovitch  she recalled the time of her illness after her confinement  and the feeling which never left her at that time
 why didn t i die   and the words and the feeling of that time came back to her
and all at once she knew what was in her soul
yes  it was that idea which alone solved all
 yes  to die   
and the shame and disgrace of alexey alexandrovitch and of seryozha  and my awful shame  it will all be saved by death
to die  and he will feel remorse  will be sorry  will love me  he will suffer on my account   with the trace of a smile of commiseration for herself she sat down in the armchair  taking off and putting on the rings on her left hand  vividly picturing from different sides his feelings after her death
approaching footsteps his steps distracted her attention
as though absorbed in the arrangement of her rings  she did not even turn to him
he went up to her  and taking her by the hand  said softly   anna  we ll go the day after tomorrow  if you like
i agree to everything   she did not speak
 what is it   he urged
anna karenina 1605 of 1759  you know   she said  and at the same instant  unable to restrain herself any longer  she burst into sobs
 cast me off   she articulated between her sobs
 i ll go away tomorrow   i ll do more
what am i  an immoral woman  a stone round your neck
i don t want to make you wretched  i don t want to  i ll set you free you don t love me  you love someone else   vronsky besought her to be calm  and declared that there was no trace of foundation for her jealousy  that he had never ceased  and never would cease  to love her  that he loved her more than ever
 anna  why distress yourself and me so   he said to her  kissing her hands
there was tenderness now in his face  and she fancied she caught the sound of tears in his voice  and she felt them wet on her hand
and instantly anna s despairing jealousy changed to a despairing passion of tenderness
she put her arms round him  and covered with kisses his head  his neck  his hands anna karenina 1606 of 1759 feeling that the reconciliation was complete  anna set eagerly to to work in the morning preparing for their departure
though it was not settled whether they should go on monday or tuesday  as they had each given way to the other  anna packed busily  feeling absolutely indifferent whether they went a day earlier or later
she was standing in her room over an open box  taking things out of it  when he came in to see her earlier than usually  dressed to go out
 i m going off at once to see maman  she can send me the money by yegorov
and i shall be ready to go tomorrow   he said
though she was in such a good mood  the thought of his visit to his mother s gave her a pang
 no  i shan t be ready by then myself   she said  and at once reflected   so then it was possible to arrange to do as i wished    no  do as you meant to do
go into the dining room  i m coming directly
it s only to turn out those things that aren t wanted   she said  putting something more on the heap of frippery that lay in annushka s arms anna karenina 1607 of 1759 vronsky was eating his beefsteak when she came into the dining  room
 you wouldn t believe how distasteful these rooms have become to me   she said  sitting down beside him to her coffee  there s nothing more awful than these chambres garnies
there s no individuality in them  no soul
these clocks  and curtains  and  worst of all  the wallpapers they re a nightmare
i think of vozdvizhenskoe as the promised land
you re not sending the horses off yet    no  they will come after us
where are you going to    i wanted to go to wilson s to take some dresses to her
so it s really to be tomorrow   she said in a cheerful voice  but suddenly her face changed
vronsky s valet came in to ask him to sign a receipt for a telegram from petersburg
there was nothing out of the way in vronsky s getting a telegram  but he said  as though anxious to conceal something from her  that the receipt was in his study  and he turned hurriedly to her
 by tomorrow  without fail  i will finish it all    from whom is the telegram   she asked  not hearing him
 from stiva   he answered reluctantly
anna karenina 1608 of 1759  why didn t you show it to me  what secret can there be between stiva and me   vronsky called the valet back  and told him to bring the telegram
 i didn t want to show it to you  because stiva has such a passion for telegraphing  why telegraph when nothing is settled    about the divorce    yes  but he says he has not been able to come at anything yet
he has promised a decisive answer in a day or two
but here it is  read it   with trembling hands anna took the telegram  and read what vronsky had told her
at the end was added   little hope  but i will do everything possible and impossible    i said yesterday that it s absolutely nothing to me when i get  or whether i never get  a divorce   she said  flushing crimson  there was not the slightest necessity to hide it from me    so he may hide and does hide his correspondence with women from me   she thought
 yashvin meant to come this morning with voytov   said vronsky   i believe he s won from pyevtsov all and more than he can pay  about sixty thousand   anna karenina 1609 of 1759  no   she said  irritated by his so obviously showing by this change of subject that he was irritated   why did you suppose that this news would affect me so  that you must even try to hide it  i said i don t want to consider it  and i should have liked you to care as little about it as i do    i care about it because i like definiteness   he said
 definiteness is not in the form but the love   she said  more and more irritated  not by his words  but by the tone of cool composure in which he spoke
 what do you want it for    my god  love again   he thought  frowning
 oh  you know what for  for your sake and your children s in the future    there won t be children in the future    that s a great pity   he said
 you want it for the children s sake  but you don t think of me   she said  quite forgetting or not having heard that he had said   for your sake and the children s   the question of the possibility of having children had long been a subject of dispute and irritation to her
his desire to have children she interpreted as a proof he did not prize her beauty
 oh  i said  for your sake
above all for your sake   he repeated  frowning as though in pain   because i am anna karenina 1610 of 1759 certain that the greater part of your irritability comes from the indefiniteness of the position    yes  now he has laid aside all pretense  and all his cold hatred for me is apparent   she thought  not hearing his words  but watching with terror the cold  cruel judge who looked mocking her out of his eyes
 the cause is not that   she said   and  indeed  i don t see how the cause of my irritability  as you call it  can be that i am completely in your power
what indefiniteness is there in the position  on the contrary     i am very sorry that you don t care to understand   he interrupted  obstinately anxious to give utterance to his thought
 the indefiniteness consists in your imagining that i am free    on that score you can set your mind quite at rest   she said  and turning away from him  she began drinking her coffee
she lifted her cup  with her little finger held apart  and put it to her lips
after drinking a few sips she glanced at him  and by his expression  she saw clearly that he was repelled by her hand  and her gesture  and the sound made by her lips
anna karenina 1611 of 1759  i don t care in the least what your mother thinks  and what match she wants to make for you   she said  putting the cup down with a shaking hand
 but we are not talking about that    yes  that s just what we are talking about
and let me tell you that a heartless woman  whether she s old or not old  your mother or anyone else  is of no consequence to me  and i would not consent to know her    anna  i beg you not to speak disrespectfully of my mother    a woman whose heart does not tell her where her son s happiness and honor lie has no heart    i repeat my request that you will not speak disrespectfully of my mother  whom i respect   he said  raising his voice and looking sternly at her she did not answer
looking intently at him  at his face  his hands  she recalled all the details of their reconciliation the previous day  and his passionate caresses
 there  just such caresses he has lavished  and will lavish  and longs to lavish on other women   she thought
 you don t love your mother
that s all talk  and talk  and talk   she said  looking at him with hatred in her eyes
 even if so  you must    anna karenina 1612 of 1759  must decide  and i have decided   she said  and she would have gone away  but at that moment yashvin walked into the room
anna greeted him and remained
why  when there was a tempest in her soul  and she felt she was standing at a turning point in her life  which might have fearful consequences why  at that minute  she had to keep up appearances before an outsider  who sooner or later must know it all she did not know
but at once quelling the storm within her  she sat down and began talking to their guest
 well  how are you getting on  has your debt been paid you   she asked yashvin
 oh  pretty fair  i fancy i shan t get it all  but i shall get a good half
and when are you off   said yashvin  looking at vronsky  and unmistakably guessing at a quarrel
 the day after tomorrow  i think   said vronsky
 you ve been meaning to go so long  though    but now it s quite decided   said anna  looking vronsky straight in the face with a look which told him not to dream of the possibility of reconciliation
 don t you feel sorry for that unlucky pyevtsov   she went on  talking to yashvin
 i ve never asked myself the question  anna arkadyevna  whether i m sorry for him or not
you see  anna karenina 1613 of 1759 all my fortune s here  he touched his breast pocket   and just now i m a wealthy man
but today i m going to the club  and i may come out a beggar
you see  whoever sits down to play with me he wants to leave me without a shirt to my back  and so do i him
and so we fight it out  and that s the pleasure of it    well  but suppose you were married   said anna   how would it be for your wife   yashvin laughed
 that s why i m not married  and never mean to be    and helsingfors   said vronsky  entering into the conversation and glancing at anna s smiling face
meeting his eyes  anna s face instantly took a coldly severe expression as though she were saying to him   it s not forgotten
it s all the same    were you really in love   she said to yashvin
 oh heavens  ever so many times  but you see  some men can play but only so that they can always lay down their cards when the hour of a rendezvous comes  while i can take up love  but only so as not to be late for my cards in the evening
that s how i manage things    no  i didn t mean that  but the real thing   she would have said helsingfors  but would not repeat the word used by vronsky
anna karenina 1614 of 1759 voytov  who was buying the horse  came in
anna got up and went out of the room
before leaving the house  vronsky went into her room
she would have pretended to be looking for something on the table  but ashamed of making a pretense  she looked straight in his face with cold eyes
 what do you want   she asked in french
 to get the guarantee for gambetta  i ve sold him   he said  in a tone which said more clearly than words   i ve no time for discussing things  and it would lead to nothing    i m not to blame in any way   he thought
 if she will punish herself  tant pis pour elle   but as he was going he fancied that she said something  and his heart suddenly ached with pity for her
 eh  anna   he queried
 i said nothing   she answered just as coldly and calmly
 oh  nothing  tant pis then   he thought  feeling cold again  and he turned and went out
as he was going out he caught a glimpse in the looking glass of her face  white  with quivering lips
he even wanted to stop and to say some comforting word to her  but his legs carried him out of the room before he could think what to say
the whole of that day he spent away from home  and when he came anna karenina 1615 of 1759 in late in the evening the maid told him that anna arkadyevna had a headache and begged him not to go in to her
anna karenina 1616 of 1759 never before had a day been passed in quarrel
today was the first time
and this was not a quarrel
it was the open acknowledgment of complete coldness
was it possible to glance at her as he had glanced when he came into the room for the guarantee  to look at her  see her heart was breaking with despair  and go out without a word with that face of callous composure  he was not merely cold to her  he hated her because he loved another woman that was clear
and remembering all the cruel words he had said  anna supplied  too  the words that he had unmistakably wished to say and could have said to her  and she grew more and more exasperated
 i won t prevent you   he might say
 you can go where you like
you were unwilling to be divorced from your husband  no doubt so that you might go back to him
go back to him
if you want money  i ll give it to you
how many roubles do you want   all the most cruel words that a brutal man could say  he said to her in her imagination  and she could not forgive him for them  as though he had actually said them
anna karenina 1617 of 1759  but didn t he only yesterday swear he loved me  he  a truthful and sincere man  haven t i despaired for nothing many times already   she said to herself afterwards
all that day  except for the visit to wilson s  which occupied two hours  anna spent in doubts whether everything were over or whether there were still hope of reconciliation  whether she should go away at once or see him once more
she was expecting him the whole day  and in the evening  as she went to her own room  leaving a message for him that her head ached  she said to herself   if he comes in spite of what the maid says  it means that he loves me still
if not  it means that all is over  and then i will decide what i m to do     in the evening she heard the rumbling of his carriage stop at the entrance  his ring  his steps and his conversation with the servant  he believed what was told him  did not care to find out more  and went to his own room
so then everything was over
and death rose clearly and vividly before her mind as the sole means of bringing back love for her in his heart  of punishing him and of gaining the victory in that strife which the evil spirit in possession of her heart was waging with him
anna karenina 1618 of 1759 now nothing mattered  going or not going to vozdvizhenskoe  getting or not getting a divorce from her husband all that did not matter
the one thing that mattered was punishing him
when she poured herself out her usual dose of opium  and thought that she had only to drink off the whole bottle to die  it seemed to her so simple and easy  that she began musing with enjoyment on how he would suffer  and repent and love her memory when it would be too late
she lay in bed with open eyes  by the light of a single burned down candle  gazing at the carved cornice of the ceiling and at the shadow of the screen that covered part of it  while she vividly pictured to herself how he would feel when she would be no more  when she would be only a memory to him
 how could i say such cruel things to her   he would say
 how could i go out of the room without saying anything to her  but now she is no more
she has gone away from us forever
she is      suddenly the shadow of the screen wavered  pounced on the whole cornice  the whole ceiling  other shadows from the other side swooped to meet it  for an instant the shadows flitted back  but then with fresh swiftness they darted forward  wavered  commingled  and all was darkness
 death   she thought
and such horror came upon her that for a long while she could not realize anna karenina 1619 of 1759 where she was  and for a long while her trembling hands could not find the matches and light another candle  instead of the one that had burned down and gone out
 no  anything only to live  why  i love him  why  he loves me  this has been before and will pass   she said  feeling that tears of joy at the return to life were trickling down her cheeks
and to escape from her panic she went hurriedly to his room
he was asleep there  and sleeping soundly
she went up to him  and holding the light above his face  she gazed a long while at him
now when he was asleep  she loved him so that at the sight of him she could not keep back tears of tenderness
but she knew that if he waked up he would look at her with cold eyes  convinced that he was right  and that before telling him of her love  she would have to prove to him that he had been wrong in his treatment of her
without waking him  she went back  and after a second dose of opium she fell towards morning into a heavy  incomplete sleep  during which she never quite lost consciousness
in the morning she was waked by a horrible nightmare  which had recurred several times in her dreams  even before her connection with vronsky a little old man with unkempt beard was doing something bent down over anna karenina 1620 of 1759 some iron  muttering meaningless french words  and she  as she always did in this nightmare  it was what made the horror of it   felt that this peasant was taking no notice of her  but was doing something horrible with the iron  over her
and she waked up in a cold sweat
when she got up  the previous day came back to her as though veiled in mist
 there was a quarrel
just what has happened several times
i said i had a headache  and he did not come in to see me
tomorrow we re going away  i must see him and get ready for the journey   she said to herself
and learning that he was in his study  she went down to him
as she passed through the drawing room she heard a carriage stop at the entrance  and looking out of the window she saw the carriage  from which a young girl in a lilac hat was leaning out giving some direction to the footman ringing the bell
after a parley in the hall  someone came upstairs  and vronsky s steps could be heard passing the drawing room
he went rapidly downstairs
anna went again to the window
she saw him come out onto the steps without his hat and go up to the carriage
the young girl in the lilac hat handed him a parcel
vronsky  smiling  said something to her
the carriage drove away  he ran rapidly upstairs again
anna karenina 1621 of 1759 the mists that had shrouded everything in her soul parted suddenly
the feelings of yesterday pierced the sick heart with a fresh pang
she could not understand now how she could have lowered herself by spending a whole day with him in his house
she went into his room to announce her determination
 that was madame sorokina and her daughter
they came and brought me the money and the deeds from maman
i couldn t get them yesterday
how is your head  better   he said quietly  not wishing to see and to understand the gloomy and solemn expression of her face
she looked silently  intently at him  standing in the middle of the room
he glanced at her  frowned for a moment  and went on reading a letter
she turned  and went deliberately out of the room
he still might have turned her back  but she had reached the door  he was still silent  and the only sound audible was the rustling of the note paper as he turned it
 oh  by the way   he said at the very moment she was in the doorway   we re going tomorrow for certain  aren t we    you  but not i   she said  turning round to him
 anna  we can t go on like this     you  but not i   she repeated
anna karenina 1622 of 1759  this is getting unbearable    you   you will be sorry for this   she said  and went out
frightened by the desperate expression with which these words were uttered  he jumped up and would have run after her  but on second thoughts he sat down and scowled  setting his teeth
this vulgar as he thought it  threat of something vague exasperated him
 i ve tried everything   he thought   the only thing left is not to pay attention   and he began to get ready to drive into town  and again to his mother s to get her signature to the deeds
she heard the sound of his steps about the study and the dining room
at the drawing room he stood still
but he did not turn in to see her  he merely gave an order that the horse should be given to voytov if he came while he was away
then she heard the carriage brought round  the door opened  and he came out again
but he went back into the porch again  and someone was running upstairs
it was the valet running up for his gloves that had been forgotten
she went to the window and saw him take the gloves without looking  and touching the coachman on the back he said something to him
then without looking up at the window he settled himself in his usual attitude in anna karenina 1623 of 1759 the carriage  with his legs crossed  and drawing on his gloves he vanished round the corner anna karenina 1624 of 1759  he has gone  it is over   anna said to herself  standing at the window  and in answer to this statement the impression of the darkness when the candle had flickered out  and of her fearful dream mingling into one  filled her heart with cold terror
 no  that cannot be   she cried  and crossing the room she rang the bell
she was so afraid now of being alone  that without waiting for the servant to come in  she went out to meet him
 iquire where the count has gone   she said
the servant answered that the count had gone to the stable
 his honor left word that if you cared to drive out  the carriage would be back immediately    very good
wait a minute
i ll write a note at once
send mihail with the note to the stables
make haste   she sat down and wrote   i was wrong
come back home  i must explain
for god s sake come  i m afraid   she sealed it up and gave it to the servant
she was afraid of being left alone now  she followed the servant out of the room  and went to the nursery
anna karenina 1625 of 1759  why  this isn t it  this isn t he  where are his blue eyes  his sweet  shy smile   was her first thought when she saw her chubby rosy little girl with her black  curly hair instead of seryozha  whom in the tangle of her ideas she had expected to see in the nursery
the little girl sitting at the table was obstinately and violently battering on it with a cork  and staring aimlessly at her mother with her pitchblack eyes
answering the english nurse that she was quite well  and that she was going to the country tomorrow  anna sat down by the little girl and began spinning the cork to show her
but the child s loud  ringing laugh  and the motion of her eyebrows  recalled vronsky so vividly that she got up hurriedly  restraining her sobs  and went away
 can it be all over  no  it cannot be   she thought
 he will come back
but how can he explain that smile  that excitement after he had been talking to her  but even if he doesn t explain  i will believe
if i don t believe  there s only one thing left for me  and i can t   she looked at her watch
twenty minutes had passed
 by now he has received the note and is coming back
not long  ten minutes more   
but what if he doesn t come  no  that cannot be
he mustn t see me with tear stained eyes
i ll go and wash
yes  yes  did i do my hair or not   she asked herself
and she could not remember
she felt anna karenina 1626 of 1759 her head with her hand
 yes  my hair has been done  but when i did it i can t in the least remember   she could not believe the evidence of her hand  and went up to the pier glass to see whether she really had done her hair
she certainly had  but she could not think when she had done it
 who s that   she thought  looking in the looking glass at the swollen face with strangely glittering eyes  that looked in a scared way at her
 why  it s i   she suddenly understood  and looking round  she seemed all at once to feel his kisses on her  and twitched her shoulders  shuddering
then she lifted her hand to her lips and kissed it
 what is it  why  i m going out of my mind   and she went into her bedroom  where annushka was tidying the room
 annushka   she said  coming to a standstill before her  and she stared at the maid  not knowing what to say to her
 you meant to go and see darya alexandrovna   said the girl  as though she understood
 darya alexandrovna  yes  i ll go    fifteen minutes there  fifteen minutes back
he s coming  he ll be here soon   she took out her watch and looked at it
 but how could he go away  leaving me in anna karenina 1627 of 1759 such a state  how can he live  without making it up with me   she went to the window and began looking into the street
judging by the time  he might be back now
but her calculations might be wrong  and she began once more to recall when he had started and to count the minutes
at the moment when she had moved away to the big clock to compare it with her watch  someone drove up
glancing out of the window  she saw his carriage
but no one came upstairs  and voices could be heard below
it was the messenger who had come back in the carriage
she went down to him
 we didn t catch the count
the count had driven off on the lower city road    what do you say  what      she said to the rosy  goodhumored mihail  as he handed her back her note
 why  then  he has never received it   she thought
 go with this note to countess vronskaya s place  you know  and bring an answer back immediately   she said to the messenger
 and i  what am i going to do   she thought
 yes  i m going to dolly s  that s true or else i shall go out of my mind
yes  and i can telegraph  too   and she wrote a telegram
 i absolutely must talk to you  come at once   anna karenina 1628 of 1759 after sending off the telegram  she went to dress
when she was dressed and in her hat  she glanced again into the eyes of the plump  comfortable looking annushka
there was unmistakable sympathy in those good natured little gray eyes
 annushka  dear  what am i to do   said anna  sobbing and sinking helplessly into a chair
 why fret yourself so  anna arkadyevna  why  there s nothing out of the way
you drive out a little  and it ll cheer you up   said the maid
 yes  i m going   said anna  rousing herself and getting up
 and if there s a telegram while i m away  send it on to darya alexandrovna s   but no  i shall be back myself    yes  i mustn t think  i must do something  drive somewhere  and most of all  get out of this house   she said  feeling with terror the strange turmoil going on in her own heart  and she made haste to go out and get into the carriage
 where to   asked pyotr before getting onto the bow  to znamenka  the oblonskys    anna karenina 1629 of 1759 it was bright and sunny
a fine rain had been falling all the morning  and now it had not long cleared up
the iron roofs  the flags of the roads  the flints of the pavements  the wheels and leather  the brass and the tinplate of the carriages all glistened brightly in the may sunshine
it was three o clock  and the very liveliest time in the streets
as she sat in a corner of the comfortable carriage  that hardly swayed on its supple springs  while the grays trotted swiftly  in the midst of the unceasing rattle of wheels and the changing impressions in the pure air  anna ran over the events of the last days  and she saw her position quite differently from how it had seemed at home
now the thought of death seemed no longer so terrible and so clear to her  and death itself no longer seemed so inevitable
now she blamed herself for the humiliation to which she had lowered herself
 i entreat him to forgive me
i have given in to him
i have owned myself in fault
what for  can t i live without him   and leaving unanswered the question how she was going to live without him  she fell to reading the signs on the shops
 office and warehouse
anna karenina 1630 of 1759 dental surgeon
yes  i ll tell dolly all about it
she doesn t like vronsky
i shall be sick and ashamed  but i ll tell her
she loves me  and i ll follow her advice
i won t give in to him  i won t let him train me as he pleases
filippov  bun shop
they say they send their dough to petersburg
the moscow water is so good for it
ah  the springs at mitishtchen  and the pancakes   and she remembered how  long  long ago  when she was a girl of seventeen  she had gone with her aunt to troitsa
 riding  too
was that really me  with red hands  how much that seemed to me then splendid and out of reach has become worthless  while what i had then has gone out of my reach forever  could i ever have believed then that i could come to such humiliation  how conceited and self satisfied he will be when he gets my note  but i will show him   
how horrid that paint smells  why is it they re always painting and building  modes et robes   she read
a man bowed to her
it was annushka s husband
 our parasites   she remembered how vronsky had said that
 our  why our  what s so awful is that one can t tear up the past by its roots
one can t tear it out  but one can hide one s memory of it
and i ll hide it   and then she thought of her past with alexey alexandrovitch  of how she had blotted the memory of it out of her life
anna karenina 1631 of 1759  dolly will think i m leaving my second husband  and so i certainly must be in the wrong
as if i cared to be right  i can t help it   she said  and she wanted to cry
but at once she fell to wondering what those two girls could be smiling about
 love  most likely
they don t know how dreary it is  how low   
the boulevard and the children
three boys running  playing at horses
seryozha  and i m losing everything and not getting him back
yes  i m losing everything  if he doesn t return
perhaps he was late for the train and has come back by now
longing for humiliation again   she said to herself
 no  i ll go to dolly  and say straight out to her  i m unhappy  i deserve this  i m to blame  but still i m unhappy  help me
these horses  this carriage how loathsome i am to myself in this carriage all his  but i won t see them again   thinking over the words in which she would tell dolly  and mentally working her heart up to great bitterness  anna went upstairs
 is there anyone with her   she asked in the hall
 katerina alexandrovna levin   answered the footman
 kitty  kitty  whom vronsky was in love with   thought anna   the girl he thinks of with love
he s sorry he didn t marry her
but me he thinks of with hatred  and is sorry he had anything to do with me   anna karenina 1632 of 1759 the sisters were having a consultation about nursing when anna called
dolly went down alone to see the visitor who had interrupted their conversation
 well  so you ve not gone away yet  i meant to have come to you   she said   i had a letter from stiva today    we had a telegram too   answered anna  looking round for kitty
 he writes that he can t make out quite what alexey alexandrovitch wants  but he won t go away without a decisive answer    i thought you had someone with you
can i see the letter    yes  kitty   said dolly  embarrassed
 she stayed in the nursery
she has been very ill    so i heard
may i see the letter    i ll get it directly
but he doesn t refuse  on the contrary  stiva has hopes   said dolly  stopping in the doorway
 i haven t  and indeed i don t wish it   said anna
 what s this  does kitty consider it degrading to meet me   thought anna when she was alone
 perhaps she s right  too
but it s not for her  the girl who was in love with vronsky  it s not for her to show me that  even if it is true
i know that in my position i can t be received by any anna karenina 1633 of 1759 decent woman
i knew that from the first moment i sacrificed everything to him
and this is my reward  oh  how i hate him  and what did i come here for  i m worse here  more miserable   she heard from the next room the sisters  voices in consultation
 and what am i going to say to dolly now  amuse kitty by the sight of my wretchedness  submit to her patronizing  no  and besides  dolly wouldn t understand and it would be no good my telling her
it would only be interesting to see kitty  to show her how i despise everyone and everything  how nothing matters to me now   dolly came in with the letter
anna read it and handed it back in silence
 i knew all that   she said   and it doesn t interest me in the least    oh  why so  on the contrary  i have hopes   said dolly  looking inquisitively at anna
she had never seen her in such a strangely irritable condition
 when are you going away   she asked
anna  half closing her eyes  looked straight before her and did not answer
 why does kitty shrink from me   she said  looking at the door and flushing red
anna karenina 1634 of 1759  oh  what nonsense  she s nursing  and things aren t going right with her  and i ve been advising her   
she s delighted
she ll be here in a minute   said dolly awkwardly  not clever at lying
 yes  here she is   hearing that anna had called  kitty had wanted not to appear  but dolly persuaded her
rallying her forces  kitty went in  walked up to her  blushing  and shook hands
 i am so glad to see you   she said with a trembling voice
kitty had been thrown into confusion by the inward conflict between her antagonism to this bad woman and her desire to be nice to her
but as soon as she saw anna s lovely and attractive face  all feeling of antagonism disappeared
 i should not have been surprised if you had not cared to meet me
i m used to everything
you have been ill  yes  you are changed   said anna
kitty felt that anna was looking at her with hostile eyes
she ascribed this hostility to the awkward position in which anna  who had once patronized her  must feel with her now  and she felt sorry for her
they talked of kitty s illness  of the baby  of stiva  but it was obvious that nothing interested anna
 i came to say good bye to you   she said  getting up
anna karenina 1635 of 1759  oh  when are you going   but again not answering  anna turned to kitty
 yes  i am very glad to have seen you   she said with a smile
 i have heard so much of you from everyone  even from your husband
he came to see me  and i liked him exceedingly   she said  unmistakably with malicious intent
 where is he    he has gone back to the country   said kitty  blushing
 remember me to him  be sure you do    i ll be sure to   kitty said naively  looking compassionately into her eyes
 so good bye  dolly   and kissing dolly and shaking hands with kitty  anna went out hurriedly
 she s just the same and just as charming  she s very lovely   said kitty  when she was alone with her sister
 but there s something piteous about her
awfully piteous    yes  there s something unusual about her today   said dolly
 when i went with her into the hall  i fancied she was almost crying   anna karenina 1636 of 1759 anna got into the carriage again in an even worse frame of mind than when she set out from home
to her previous tortures was added now that sense of mortification and of being an outcast which she had felt so distinctly on meeting kitty
 where to  home   asked pyotr
 yes  home   she said  not even thinking now where she was going
 how they looked at me as something dreadful  incomprehensible  and curious  what can he be telling the other with such warmth   she thought  staring at two men who walked by
 can one ever tell anyone what one is feeling  i meant to tell dolly  and it s a good thing i didn t tell her
how pleased she would have been at my misery  she would have concealed it  but her chief feeling would have been delight at my being punished for the happiness she envied me for
kitty  she would have been even more pleased
how i can see through her  she knows i was more than usually sweet to her husband
and she s jealous and hates me
and she despises me
in her eyes i m an immoral woman
if i were an immoral woman i could anna karenina 1637 of 1759 have made her husband fall in love with me    if i d cared to
and  indeed  i did care to
there s someone who s pleased with himself   she thought  as she saw a fat  rubicund gentleman coming towards her he took her for an acquaintance  and lifted his glossy hat above his bald  glossy head  and then perceived his mistake
 he thought he knew me
well  he knows me as well as anyone in the world knows me
i don t know myself
i know my appetites  as the french say
they want that dirty ice cream  that they do know for certain   she thought  looking at two boys stopping an ice cream seller  who took a barrel off his head and began wiping his perspiring face with a towel
 we all want what is sweet and nice
if not sweetmeats  then a dirty ice
and kitty s the same if not vronsky  then levin
and she envies me  and hates me
and we all hate each other
i kitty  kitty me
yes  that s the truth
 tiutkin  coiffeur   je me fais coiffer par tiutkin   
i ll tell him that when he comes   she thought and smiled
but the same instant she remembered that she had no one now to tell anything amusing to
 and there s nothing amusing  nothing mirthful  really
it s all hateful
they re singing for vespers  and how carefully that merchant crosses himself  as if he were afraid of missing something why these churches and this singing and this anna karenina 1638 of 1759 humbug  simply to conceal that we all hate each other like these cab drivers who are abusing each other so angrily
yashvin says   he wants to strip me of my shirt  and i him of his   yes  that s the truth   she was plunged in these thoughts  which so engrossed her that she left off thinking of her own position  when the carriage drew up at the steps of her house
it was only when she saw the porter running out to meet her that she remembered she had sent the note and the telegram  is there an answer   she inquired
 i ll see this minute   answered the porter  and glancing into his room  he took out and gave her the thin square envelope of a telegram
 i can t come before ten o clock  vronsky   she read
 and hasn t the messenger come back    no   answered the porter
 then  since it s so  i know what i must do   she said  and feeling a vague fury and craving for revenge rising up within her  she ran upstairs
 i ll go to him myself
before going away forever  i ll tell him all
never have i hated anyone as i hate that man   she thought
seeing his hat on the rack  she shuddered with aversion
she did not consider that his telegram was an answer to her telegram and that he had not yet received her note
she pictured anna karenina 1639 of 1759 him to herself as talking calmly to his mother and princess sorokina and rejoicing at her sufferings
 yes  i must go quickly   she said  not knowing yet where she was going
she longed to get away as quickly as possible from the feelings she had gone through in that awful house
the servants  the walls  the things in that house all aroused repulsion and hatred in her and lay like a weight upon her
 yes  i must go to the railway station  and if he s not there  then go there and catch him   anna looked at the railway timetable in the newspapers
an evening train went at two minutes past eight
 yes  i shall be in time   she gave orders for the other horses to be put in the carriage  and packed in a traveling bag the things needed for a few days
she knew she would never come back here again
among the plans that came into her head she vaguely determined that after what would happen at the station or at the countess s house  she would go as far as the first town on the nizhni road and stop there
dinner was on the table  she went up  but the smell of the bread and cheese was enough to make her feel that all food was disgusting
she ordered the carriage and went out
the house threw a shadow now right across the street  but it was a bright evening and still warm in the anna karenina 1640 of 1759 sunshine
annushka  who came down with her things  and pyotr  who put the things in the carriage  and the coachman  evidently out of humor  were all hateful to her  and irritated her by their words and actions
 i don t want you  pyotr    but how about the ticket    well  as you like  it doesn t matter   she said crossly
pyotr jumped on the box  and putting his arms akimbo  told the coachman to drive to the booking office anna karenina 1641 of 1759  here it is again  again i understand it all   anna said to herself  as soon as the carriage had started and swaying lightly  rumbled over the tiny cobbles of the paved road  and again one impression followed rapidly upon another
 yes  what was the last thing i thought of so clearly   she tried to recall it
  tiutkin  coiffeur   no  not that
yes  of what yashvin says  the struggle for existence and hatred is the one thing that holds men together
no  it s a useless journey you re making   she said  mentally addressing a party in a coach and four  evidently going for an excursion into the country
 and the dog you re taking with you will be no help to you
you can t get away from yourselves   turning her eyes in the direction pyotr had turned to look  she saw a factory hand almost dead drunk  with hanging head  being led away by a policeman
 come  he s found a quicker way   she thought
 count vronsky and i did not find that happiness either  though we expected so much from it   and now for the first time anna turned that glaring light in which she was seeing everything on to her relations with him  which she had hitherto avoided thinking about
 what was it he sought anna karenina 1642 of 1759 in me  not love so much as the satisfaction of vanity   she remembered his words  the expression of his face  that recalled an abject setter dog  in the early days of their connection
and everything now confirmed this
 yes  there was the triumph of success in him
of course there was love too  but the chief element was the pride of success
he boasted of me
now that s over
there s nothing to be proud of
not to be proud of  but to be ashamed of
he has taken from me all he could  and now i am no use to him
he is weary of me and is trying not to be dishonorable in his behavior to me
he let that out yesterday he wants divorce and marriage so as to burn his ships
he loves me  but how  the zest is gone  as the english say
that fellow wants everyone to admire him and is very much pleased with himself   she thought  looking at a red faced clerk  riding on a riding school horse  yes  there s not the same flavor about me for him now
if i go away from him  at the bottom of his heart he will be glad   this was not mere supposition  she saw it distinctly in the piercing light  which revealed to her now the meaning of life and human relations
 my love keeps growing more passionate and egoistic  while his is waning and waning  and that s why we re anna karenina 1643 of 1759 drifting apart   she went on musing
 and there s no help for it
he is everything for me  and i want him more and more to give himself up to me entirely and he wants more and more to get away from me
we walked to meet each other up to the time of our love  and then we have been irresistibly drifting in different directions
and there s no altering that
he tells me i m insanely jealous  and i have told myself that i am insanely jealous  but it s not true
i m not jealous  but i m unsatisfied
but     she opened her lips  and shifted her place in the carriage in the excitement  aroused by the thought that suddenly struck her
 if i could be anything but a mistress  passionately caring for nothing but his caresses  but i can t and i don t care to be anything else
and by that desire i rouse aversion in him  and he rouses fury in me  and it cannot be different
don t i know that he wouldn t deceive me  that he has no schemes about princess sorokina  that he s not in love with kitty  that he won t desert me  i know all that  but it makes it no better for me
if without loving me  from duty he ll be good and kind to me  without what i want  that s a thousand times worse than unkindness  that s hell  and that s just how it is
for a long while now he hasn t loved me
and where love ends  hate begins
i don t know these streets at all
hills it seems  anna karenina 1644 of 1759 and still houses  and houses     and in the houses always people and people   
how many of them  no end  and all hating each other  come  let me try and think what i want  to make me happy
well  suppose i am divorced  and alexey alexandrovitch lets me have seryozha  and i marry vronsky   thinking of alexey alexandrovitch  she at once pictured him with extraordinary vividness as though he were alive before her  with his mild  lifeless  dull eyes  the blue veins in his white hands  his intonations and the cracking of his fingers  and remembering the feeling which had existed between them  and which was also called love  she shuddered with loathing
 well  i m divorced  and become vronsky s wife
well  will kitty cease looking at me as she looked at me today  no
and will seryozha leave off asking and wondering about my two husbands  and is there any new feeling i can awaken between vronsky and me  is there possible  if not happiness  some sort of ease from misery  no  no   she answered now without the slightest hesitation
 impossible  we are drawn apart by life  and i make his unhappiness  and he mine  and there s no altering him or me
every attempt has been made  the screw has come unscrewed
oh  a beggar woman with a baby
she thinks i m sorry for her
aren t we all flung into the world only anna karenina 1645 of 1759 to hate each other  and so to torture ourselves and each other  schoolboys coming laughing seryozha   she thought
 i thought  too  that i loved him  and used to be touched by my own tenderness
but i have lived without him  i gave him up for another love  and did not regret the exchange till that love was satisfied   and with loathing she thought of what she meant by that love
and the clearness with which she saw life now  her own and all men s  was a pleasure to her
 it s so with me and pyotr  and the coachman  fyodor  and that merchant  and all the people living along the volga  where those placards invite one to go  and everywhere and always   she thought when she had driven under the low pitched roof of the nizhigorod station  and the porters ran to meet her
 a ticket to obiralovka   said pyotr
she had utterly forgotten where and why she was going  and only by a great effort she understood the question
 yes   she said  handing him her purse  and taking a little red bag in her hand  she got out of the carriage
making her way through the crowd to the first class waiting room  she gradually recollected all the details of her position  and the plans between which she was hesitating
and again at the old sore places  hope and then anna karenina 1646 of 1759 despair poisoned the wounds of her tortured  fearfully throbbing heart
as she sat on the star shaped sofa waiting for the train  she gazed with aversion at the people coming and going  they were all hateful to her   and thought how she would arrive at the station  would write him a note  and what she would write to him  and how he was at this moment complaining to his mother of his position  not understanding her sufferings  and how she would go into the room  and what she would say to him
then she thought that life might still be happy  and how miserably she loved and hated him  and how fearfully her heart was beating
anna karenina 1647 of 1759 a bell rang  some young men  ugly and impudent  and at the same time careful of the impression they were making  hurried by
pyotr  too  crossed the room in his livery and top boots  with his dull  animal face  and came up to her to take her to the train
some noisy men were quiet as she passed them on the platform  and one whispered something about her to another  something vile  no doubt
she stepped up on the high step  and sat down in a carriage by herself on a dirty seat that had been white
her bag lay beside her  shaken up and down by the springiness of the seat
with a foolish smile pyotr raised his hat  with its colored band  at the window  in token of farewell  an impudent conductor slammed the door and the latch
a grotesque looking lady wearing a bustle  anna mentally undressed the woman  and was appalled at her hideousness   and a little girl laughing affectedly ran down the platform
 katerina andreevna  she s got them all  ma tante   cried the girl
 even the child s hideous and affected   thought anna
to avoid seeing anyone  she got up quickly and seated anna karenina 1648 of 1759 herself at the opposite window of the empty carriage
a misshapen looking peasant covered with dirt  in a cap from which his tangled hair stuck out all round  passed by that window  stooping down to the carriage wheels
 there s something familiar about that hideous peasant   thought anna
and remembering her dream  she moved away to the opposite door  shaking with terror
the conductor opened the door and let in a man and his wife
 do you wish to get out   anna made no answer
the conductor and her two fellow passengers did not notice under her veil her panicstricken face
she went back to her corner and sat down
the couple seated themselves on the opposite side  and intently but surreptitiously scrutinized her clothes both husband and wife seemed repulsive to anna
the husband asked  would she allow him to smoke  obviously not with a view to smoking but to getting into conversation with her
receiving her assent  he said to his wife in french something about caring less to smoke than to talk
they made inane and affected remarks to one another  entirely for her benefit
anna saw clearly that they were sick of each other  and hated each other
and no one could have helped hating such miserable monstrosities
anna karenina 1649 of 1759 a second bell sounded  and was followed by moving of luggage  noise  shouting and laughter
it was so clear to anna that there was nothing for anyone to be glad of  that this laughter irritated her agonizingly  and she would have liked to stop up her ears not to hear it
at last the third bell rang  there was a whistle and a hiss of steam  and a clank of chains  and the man in her carriage crossed himself  it would be interesting to ask him what meaning he attaches to that   thought anna  looking angrily at him
she looked past the lady out of the window at the people who seemed whirling by as they ran beside the train or stood on the platform
the train  jerking at regular intervals at the junctions of the rails  rolled by the platform  past a stone wall  a signal box  past other trains  the wheels  moving more smoothly and evenly  resounded with a slight clang on the rails
the window was lighted up by the bright evening sun  and a slight breeze fluttered the curtain
anna forgot her fellow passengers  and to the light swaying of the train she fell to thinking again  as she breathed the fresh air
 yes  what did i stop at  that i couldn t conceive a position in which life would not be a misery  that we are all created to be miserable  and that we all know it  and all anna karenina 1650 of 1759 invent means of deceiving each other
and when one sees the truth  what is one to do    that s what reason is given man for  to escape from what worries him   said the lady in french  lisping affectedly  and obviously pleased with her phrase
the words seemed an answer to anna s thoughts
 to escape from what worries him   repeated anna
and glancing at the red checked husband and the thin wife  she saw that the sickly wife considered herself misunderstood  and the husband deceived her and encouraged her in that idea of herself
anna seemed to see all their history and all the crannies of their souls  as it were turning a light upon them
but there was nothing interesting in them  and she pursued her thought
 yes  i m very much worried  and that s what reason was given me for  to escape  so then one must escape  why not put out the light when there s nothing more to look at  when it s sickening to look at it all  but how  why did the conductor run along the footboard  why are they shrieking  those young men in that train  why are they talking  why are they laughing  it s all falsehood  all lying  all humbug  all cruelty     when the train came into the station  anna got out into the crowd of passengers  and moving apart from them anna karenina 1651 of 1759 as if they were lepers  she stood on the platform  trying to think what she had come here for  and what she meant to do
everything that had seemed to her possible before was now so difficult to consider  especially in this noisy crowd of hideous people who would not leave her alone
one moment porters ran up to her proffering their services  then young men  clacking their heels on the planks of the platform and talking loudly  stared at her  people meeting her dodged past on the wrong side
remembering that she had meant to go on further if there were no answer  she stopped a porter and asked if her coachman were not here with a note from count vronsky
 count vronsky  they sent up here from the vronskys just this minute  to meet princess sorokina and her daughter
and what is the coachman like   just as she was talking to the porter  the coachman mihail  red and cheerful in his smart blue coat and chain  evidently proud of having so successfully performed his commission  came up to her and gave her a letter
she broke it open  and her heart ached before she had read it
 i am very sorry your note did not reach me
i will be home at ten   vronsky had written carelessly   
 yes  that s what i expected   she said to herself with an evil smile
anna karenina 1652 of 1759  very good  you can go home then   she said softly  addressing mihail
she spoke softly because the rapidity of her heart s beating hindered her breathing
 no  i won t let you make me miserable   she thought menacingly  addressing not him  not herself  but the power that made her suffer  and she walked along the platform
two maidservants walking along the platform turned their heads  staring at her and making some remarks about her dress
 real   they said of the lace she was wearing
the young men would not leave her in peace
again they passed by  peering into her face  and with a laugh shouting something in an unnatural voice
the station master coming up asked her whether she was going by train
a boy selling kvas never took his eyes off her
 my god  where am i to go   she thought  going farther and farther along the platform
at the end she stopped
some ladies and children  who had come to meet a gentleman in spectacles  paused in their loud laughter and talking  and stared at her as she reached them
she quickened her pace and walked away from them to the edge of the platform
a luggage train was coming in
the platform began to sway  and she fancied she was in the train again
and all at once she thought of the man crushed by the train the day she had first met vronsky  and she knew anna karenina 1653 of 1759 what she had to do
with a rapid  light step she went down the steps that led from the tank to the rails and stopped quite near the approaching train
she looked at the lower part of the carriages  at the screws and chains and the tall cast iron wheel of the first carriage slowly moving up  and trying to measure the middle between the front and back wheels  and the very minute when that middle point would be opposite her
 there   she said to herself  looking into the shadow of the carriage  at the sand and coal dust which covered the sleepers   there  in the very middle  and i will punish him and escape from everyone and from myself   she tried to fling herself below the wheels of the first carriage as it reached her  but the red bag which she tried to drop out of her hand delayed her  and she was too late  she missed the moment
she had to wait for the next carriage
a feeling such as she had known when about to take the first plunge in bathing came upon her  and she crossed herself
that familiar gesture brought back into her soul a whole series of girlish and childish memories  and suddenly the darkness that had covered everything for her was torn apart  and life rose up before her for an instant with all its bright past joys
but she did not take her eyes from the wheels of the second carriage
and exactly at the anna karenina 1654 of 1759 moment when the space between the wheels came opposite her  she dropped the red bag  and drawing her head back into her shoulders  fell on her hands under the carriage  and lightly  as though she would rise again at once  dropped on to her knees
and at the same instant she was terror stricken at what she was doing
 where am i  what am i doing  what for   she tried to get up  to drop backwards  but something huge and merciless struck her on the head and rolled her on her back
 lord  forgive me all   she said  feeling it impossible to struggle
a peasant muttering something was working at the iron above her
and the light by which she had read the book filled with troubles  falsehoods  sorrow  and evil  flared up more brightly than ever before  lighted up for her all that had been in darkness  flickered  began to grow dim  and was quenched forever
anna karenina 1655 of 1759 part eight anna karenina 1656 of 1759 almost two months had passed
the hot summer was half over  but sergey ivanovitch was only just preparing to leave moscow
sergey ivanovitch s life had not been uneventful during this time
a year ago he had finished his book  the fruit of six years  labor   sketch of a survey of the principles and forms of government in europe and russia   several sections of this book and its introduction had appeared in periodical publications  and other parts had been read by sergey ivanovitch to persons of his circle  so that the leading ideas of the work could not be completely novel to the public but still sergey ivanovitch had expected that on its appearance his book would be sure to make a serious impression on society  and if it did not cause a revolution in social science it would  at any rate  make a great stir in the scientific world after the most conscientious revision the book had last year been published  and had been distributed among the booksellers
though he asked no one about it  reluctantly and with feigned indifference answered his friends  inquiries as to how the book was going  and did not even inquire of the anna karenina 1657 of 1759 booksellers how the book was selling  sergey ivanovitch was all on the alert  with strained attention  watching for the first impression his book would make in the world and in literature
but a week passed  a second  a third  and in society no impression whatever could be detected
his friends who were specialists and savants  occasionally unmistakably from politeness alluded to it
the rest of his acquaintances  not interested in a book on a learned subject  did not talk of it at all
and society generally just now especially absorbed in other things was absolutely indifferent
in the press  too  for a whole month there was not a word about his book
sergey ivanovitch had calculated to a nicety the time necessary for writing a review  but a month passed  and a second  and still there was silence
only in the northern beetle  in a comic article on the singer drabanti  who had lost his voice  there was a contemptuous allusion to koznishev s book  suggesting that the book had been long ago seen through by everyone  and was a subject of general ridicule
at last in the third month a critical article appeared in a serious review
sergey ivanovitch knew the author of the article
he had met him once at golubtsov s
anna karenina 1658 of 1759 the author of the article was a young man  an invalid  very bold as a writer  but extremely deficient in breeding and shy in personal relations
in spite of his absolute contempt for the author  it was with complete respect that sergey ivanovitch set about reading the article
the article was awful
the critic had undoubtedly put an interpretation upon the book which could not possibly be put on it
but he had selected quotations so adroitly that for people who had not read the book  and obviously scarcely anyone had read it  it seemed absolutely clear that the whole book was nothing but a medley of high flown phrases  not even as suggested by marks of interrogation used appropriately  and that the author of the book was a person absolutely without knowledge of the subject
and all this was so wittingly done that sergey ivanovitch would not have disowned such wit himself but that was just what was so awful
in spite of the scrupulous conscientiousness with which sergey ivanovitch verified the correctness of the critic s arguments  he did not for a minute stop to ponder over the faults and mistakes which were ridiculed  but unconsciously he began immediately trying to recall every anna karenina 1659 of 1759 detail of his meeting and conversation with the author of the article
 didn t i offend him in some way   sergey ivanovitch wondered
and remembering that when they met he had corrected the young man about something he had said that betrayed ignorance  sergey ivanovitch found the clue to explain the article
this article was followed by a deadly silence about the book both in the press and in conversation  and sergey ivanovitch saw that his six years  task  toiled at with such love and labor  had gone  leaving no trace
sergey ivanovitch s position was still more difficult from the fact that  since he had finished his book  he had had no more literary work to do  such as had hitherto occupied the greater part of his time
sergey ivanovitch was clever  cultivated  healthy  and energetic  and he did not know what use to make of his energy
conversations in drawing rooms  in meetings  assemblies  and committees everywhere where talk was possible took up part of his time but being used for years to town life  he did not waste all his energies in talk  as his less experienced younger brother did  when he was anna karenina 1660 of 1759 in moscow
he had a great deal of leisure and intellectual energy still to dispose of
fortunately for him  at this period so difficult for him from the failure of his book  the various public questions of the dissenting sects  of the american alliance  of the samara famine  of exhibitions  and of spiritualism  were definitely replaced in public interest by the slavonic question  which had hitherto rather languidly interested society  and sergey ivanovitch  who had been one of the first to raise this subject  threw himself into it heart and soul in the circle to which sergey ivanovitch belonged  nothing was talked of or written about just now but the servian war
everything that the idle crowd usually does to kill time was done now for the benefit of the slavonic states
balls  concerts  dinners  matchboxes  ladies  dresses  beer  restaurants  everything testified to sympathy with the slavonic peoples
from much of what was spoken and written on the subject  sergey ivanovitch differed on various points
he saw that the slavonic question had become one of those fashionable distractions which succeed one another in providing society with an object and an occupation
he saw  too  that a great many people were taking up the anna karenina 1661 of 1759 subject from motives of self interest and selfadvertisement
he recognized that the newspapers published a great deal that was superfluous and exaggerated  with the sole aim of attracting attention and outbidding one another
he saw that in this general movement those who thrust themselves most forward and shouted the loudest were men who had failed and were smarting under a sense of injury generals without armies  ministers not in the ministry  journalists not on any paper  party leaders without followers he saw that there was a great deal in it that was frivolous and absurd
but he saw and recognized an unmistakable growing enthusiasm  uniting all classes  with which it was impossible not to sympathize
the massacre of men who were fellow christians  and of the same slavonic race  excited sympathy for the sufferers and indignation against the oppressors
and the heroism of the servians and montenegrins struggling for a great cause begot in the whole people a longing to help their brothers not in word but in deed
but in this there was another aspect that rejoiced sergey ivanovitch
that was the manifestation of public opinion
the public had definitely expressed its desire
the soul of the people had  as sergey ivanovitch said  anna karenina 1662 of 1759 found expression
and the more he worked in this cause  the more incontestable it seemed to him that it was a cause destined to assume vast dimensions  to create an epoch
he threw himself heart and soul into the service of this great cause  and forgot to think about his book his whole time now was engrossed by it  so that he could scarcely manage to answer all the letters and appeals addressed to him
he worked the whole spring and part of the summer  and it was only in july that he prepared to go away to his brother s in the country
he was going both to rest for a fortnight  and in the very heart of the people  in the farthest wilds of the country  to enjoy the sight of that uplifting of the spirit of the people  of which  like all residents in the capital and big towns  he was fully persuaded
katavasov had long been meaning to carry out his promise to stay with levin  and so he was going with him
anna karenina 1663 of 1759 sergey ivanovitch and katavasov had only just reached the station of the kursk line  which was particularly busy and full of people that day  when  looking round for the groom who was following with their things  they saw a party of volunteers driving up in four cabs
ladies met them with bouquets of flowers  and followed by the rushing crowd they went into the station
one of the ladies  who had met the volunteers  came out of the hall and addressed sergey ivanovitch
 you too come to see them off   she asked in french
 no  i m going away myself  princess
to my brother s for a holiday
do you always see them of   said sergey ivanovitch with a hardly perceptible smile
 oh  that would be impossible   answered the princess
 is it true that eight hundred have been sent from us already  malvinsky wouldn t believe me    more than eight hundred
if you reckon those who have been sent not directly from moscow  over a thousand   answered sergey ivanovitch
anna karenina 1664 of 1759  there  that s just what i said   exclaimed the lady
 and it s true too  i suppose  that more than a million has been subscribed    yes  princess    what do you say to today s telegram  beaten the turks again    yes  so i saw   answered sergey ivanovitch
they were speaking of the last telegram stating that the turks had been for three days in succession beaten at all points and put to flight  and that tomorrow a decisive engagement was expected
 ah  by the way  a splendid young fellow has asked leave to go  and they ve made some difficulty  i don t know why
i meant to ask you  i know him  please write a note about his case
he s being sent by countess lidia ivanovna   sergey ivanovitch asked for all the details the princess knew about the young man  and going into the first class waiting room  wrote a note to the person on whom the granting of leave of absence depended  and handed it to the princess
 you know count vronsky  the notorious one   is going by this train   said the princess with a smile full of anna karenina 1665 of 1759 triumph and meaning  when he found her again and gave her the letter
 i had heard he was going  but i did not know when
by this train    i ve seen him
he s here  there s only his mother seeing him off
it s the best thing  anyway  that he could do    oh  yes  of course   while they were talking the crowd streamed by them into the dining room
they went forward too  and heard a gentleman with a glass in his hand delivering a loud discourse to the volunteers
 in the service of religion  humanity  and our brothers   the gentleman said  his voice growing louder and louder   to this great cause mother moscow dedicates you with her blessing
jivio   he concluded  loudly and tearfully
everyone shouted jivio  and a fresh crowd dashed into the hall  almost carrying the princess off her legs
 ah  princess  that was something like   said stepan arkadyevitch  suddenly appearing in the middle of the crowd and beaming upon them with a delighted smile
 capitally  warmly said  wasn t it  bravo  and sergey ivanovitch  why  you ought to have said something just a few words  you know  to encourage them  you do that anna karenina 1666 of 1759 so well   he added with a soft  respectful  and discreet smile  moving sergey ivanovitch forward a little by the arm
 no  i m just off    where to    to the country  to my brother s   answered sergey ivanovitch
 then you ll see my wife
i ve written to her  but you ll see her first
please tell her that they ve seen me and that it s  all right   as the english say
she ll understand
oh  and be so good as to tell her i m appointed secretary of the committee   
but she ll understand  you know  les petites miseres de la vie humaine   he said  as it were apologizing to the princess
 and princess myakaya not liza  but bibish is sending a thousand guns and twelve nurses
did i tell you    yes  i heard so   answered koznishev indifferently
 it s a pity you re going away   said stepan arkadyevitch
 tomorrow we re giving a dinner to two who re setting off  dimer bartnyansky from petersburg and our veslovsky  grisha
they re both going
veslovsky s only lately married
there s a fine fellow for you  eh  princess   he turned to the lady
anna karenina 1667 of 1759 the princess looked at koznishev without replying
but the fact that sergey ivanovitch and the princess seemed anxious to get rid of him did not in the least disconcert stepan arkadyevitch
smiling  he stared at the feather in the princess s hat  and then about him as though he were going to pick something up
seeing a lady approaching with a collecting box  he beckoned her up and put in a five rouble note
 i can never see these collecting boxes unmoved while i ve money in my pocket   he said
 and how about today s telegram  fine chaps those montenegrins    you don t say so   he cried  when the princess told him that vronsky was going by this train
for an instant stepan arkadyevitch s face looked sad  but a minute later  when  stroking his mustaches and swinging as he walked  he went into the hall where vronsky was  he had completely forgotten his own despairing sobs over his sister s corpse  and he saw in vronsky only a hero and an old friend
 with all his faults one can t refuse to do him justice   said the princess to sergey ivanovitch as soon as stepan arkadyevitch had left them
 what a typically russian  slav nature  only  i m afraid it won t be pleasant for vronsky to see him
say what you will  i m touched by anna karenina 1668 of 1759 that man s fate
do talk to him a little on the way   said the princess
 yes  perhaps  if it happens so    i never liked him
but this atones for a great deal
he s not merely going himself  he s taking a squadron at his own expense    yes  so i heard   a bell sounded everyone crowded to the doors  here he is   said the princess  indicating vronsky  who with his mother on his arm walked by  wearing a long overcoat and wide brimmed black hat
oblonsky was walking beside him  talking eagerly of something
vronsky was frowning and looking straight before him  as though he did not hear what stepan arkadyevitch was saying
probably on oblonsky s pointing them out  he looked round in the direction where the princess and sergey ivanovitch were standing  and without speaking lifted his hat
his face  aged and worn by suffering  looked stony
going onto the platform  vronsky left his mother and disappeared into a compartment
on the platform there rang out  god save the tsar   then shouts of  hurrah   and  jivio   one of the volunteers  a tall  very young man with a hollow chest  was anna karenina 1669 of 1759 particularly conspicuous  bowing and waving his felt hat and a nosegay over his head
then two officers emerged  bowing too  and a stout man with a big beard  wearing a greasy forage cap
anna karenina 1670 of 1759 saying good bye to the princess  sergey ivanovitch was joined by katavasov  together they got into a carriage full to overflowing  and the train started
at tsaritsino station the train was met by a chorus of young men singing  hail to thee   again the volunteers bowed and poked their heads out  but sergey ivanovitch paid no attention to them
he had had so much to do with the volunteers that the type was familiar to him and did not interest him
katavasov  whose scientific work had prevented his having a chance of observing them hitherto  was very much interested in them and questioned sergey ivanovitch
sergey ivanovitch advised him to go into the secondclass and talk to them himself at the next station katavasov acted on this suggestion
at the first stop he moved into the second class and made the acquaintance of the volunteers
they were sitting in a corner of the carriage  talking loudly and obviously aware that the attention of the passengers and katavasov as he got in was concentrated upon them
more loudly than all talked the tall  hollow chested young man
anna karenina 1671 of 1759 he was unmistakably tipsy  and was relating some story that had occurred at his school
facing him sat a middleaged officer in the austrian military jacket of the guards uniform
he was listening with a smile to the hollowchested youth  and occasionally pulling him up
the third  in an artillery uniform  was sitting on a box beside them
a fourth was asleep
entering into conversation with the youth  katavasov learned that he was a wealthy moscow merchant who had run through a large fortune before he was two andtwenty
katavasov did not like him  because he was unmanly and effeminate and sickly
he was obviously convinced  especially now after drinking  that he was performing a heroic action  and he bragged of it in the most unpleasant way
the second  the retired officer  made an unpleasant impression too upon katavasov
he was  it seemed  a man who had tried everything
he had been on a railway  had been a land steward  and had started factories  and he talked  quite without necessity  of all he had done  and used learned expressions quite inappropriately
the third  the artilleryman  on the contrary  struck katavasov very favorably
he was a quiet  modest fellow  unmistakably impressed by the knowledge of the officer anna karenina 1672 of 1759 and the heroic self sacrifice of the merchant and saying nothing about himself when katavasov asked him what had impelled him to go to servia  he answered modestly   oh  well  everyone s going
the servians want help  too
i m sorry for them    yes  you artillerymen especially are scarce there   said katavasov
 oh  i wasn t long in the artillery  maybe they ll put me into the infantry or the cavalry    into the infantry when they need artillery more than anything   said katavasov  fancying from the artilleryman s apparent age that he must have reached a fairly high grade
 i wasn t long in the artillery  i m a cadet retired   he said  and he began to explain how he had failed in his examination
all of this together made a disagreeable impression on katavasov  and when the volunteers got out at a station for a drink  katavasov would have liked to compare his unfavorable impression in conversation with someone
there was an old man in the carriage  wearing a military overcoat  who had been listening all the while to katavasov s conversation with the volunteers
when they were left alone  katavasov addressed him
anna karenina 1673 of 1759  what different positions they come from  all those fellows who are going off there   katavasov said vaguely  not wishing to express his own opinion  and at the same time anxious to find out the old man s views
the old man was an officer who had served on two campaigns
he knew what makes a soldier  and judging by the appearance and the talk of those persons  by the swagger with which they had recourse to the bottle on the journey  he considered them poor soldiers
moreover  he lived in a district town  and he was longing to tell how one soldier had volunteered from his town  a drunkard and a thief whom no one would employ as a laborer
but knowing by experience that in the present condition of the public temper it was dangerous to express an opinion opposed to the general one  and especially to criticize the volunteers unfavorably  he too watched katavasov without committing himself  well  men are wanted there   he said  laughing with his eyes
and they fell to talking of the last war news  and each concealed from the other his perplexity as to the engagement expected next day  since the turks had been beaten  according to the latest news  at all points
and so they parted  neither giving expression to his opinion
anna karenina 1674 of 1759 katavasov went back to his own carriage  and with reluctant hypocrisy reported to sergey ivanovitch his observations of the volunteers  from which it would appear that they were capital fellows
at a big station at a town the volunteers were again greeted with shouts and singing  again men and women with collecting boxes appeared  and provincial ladies brought bouquets to the volunteers and followed them into the refreshment room  but all this was on a much smaller and feebler scale than in moscow
anna karenina 1675 of 1759 while the train was stopping at the provincial town  sergey ivanovitch did not go to the refreshment room  but walked up and down the platform
the first time he passed vronsky s compartment he noticed that the curtain was drawn over the window  but as he passed it the second time he saw the old countess at the window
she beckoned to koznishev
 i m going  you see  taking him as far as kursk   she said
 yes  so i heard   said sergey ivanovitch  standing at her window and peeping in
 what a noble act on his part   he added  noticing that vronsky was not in the compartment
 yes  after his misfortune  what was there for him to do    what a terrible thing it was   said sergey ivanovitch
 ah  what i have been through  but do get in   
ah  what i have been through   she repeated  when sergey ivanovitch had got in and sat down beside her
 you can t conceive it  for six weeks he did not speak to anyone  and would not touch food except when i implored him
and not for one minute could we leave him alone
we took anna karenina 1676 of 1759 away everything he could have used against himself we lived on the ground floor  but there was no reckoning on anything
you know  of course  that he had shot himself once already on her account   she said  and the old lady s eyelashes twitched at the recollection  yes  hers was the fitting end for such a woman
even the death she chose was low and vulgar    it s not for us to judge  countess   said sergey ivanovitch   but i can understand that it has been very hard for you    ah  don t speak of it  i was staying on my estate  and he was with me
a note was brought him
he wrote an answer and sent it off
we hadn t an idea that she was close by at the station
i the evening i had only just gone to my room  when my mary told me a lady had thrown herself under the train
something seemed to strike me at once
i knew it was she
the first thing i said was  he was not to be told
but they d told him already
his coachman was there and saw it all
when i ran into his room  he was beside himself it was fearful to see him he didn t say a word  but galloped off there
i don t know to this day what happened there  but he was brought back at death s door
i shouldn t have known him
prostration complete  the doctor said
and that was followed almost by madness
anna karenina 1677 of 1759 oh  why talk of it   said the countess with a wave of her hand
 it was an awful time  no  say what you will  she was a bad woman
why  what is the meaning of such desperate passions  it was all to show herself something out of the way
well  and that she did do
she brought herself to ruin and two good men her husband and my unhappy son    and what did her husband do   asked sergey ivanovitch
 he has taken her daughter
alexey was ready to agree to anything at first
now it worries him terribly that he should have given his own child away to another man
but he can t take back his word
karenin came to the funeral
but we tried to prevent his meeting alexey
for him  for her husband  it was easier  anyway
she had set him free
but my poor son was utterly given up to her
he had thrown up everything  his career  me  and even then she had no mercy on him  but of set purpose she made his ruin complete
no  say what you will  her very death was the death of a vile woman  of no religious feeling
god forgive me  but i can t help hating the memory of her  when i look at my son s misery    but how is he now   anna karenina 1678 of 1759  it was a blessing from providence for us this servian war
i m old  and i don t understand the rights and wrongs of it  but it s come as a providential blessing to him
of course for me  as his mother  it s terrible  and what s worse  they say  ce n est pas tres bien vu a petersbourg
but it can t be helped  it was the one thing that could rouse him
yashvin a friend of his he had lost all he had at cards and he was going to servia
he came to see him and persuaded him to go
now it s an interest for him
do please talk to him a little
i want to distract his mind
he s so low spirited
and as bad luck would have it  he has toothache too
but he ll be delighted to see you
please do talk to him  he s walking up and down on that side   sergey ivanovitch said he would be very glad to  and crossed over to the other side of the station
anna karenina 1679 of 1759 in the slanting evening shadows cast by the baggage piled up on the platform  vronsky in his long overcoat and slouch hat  with his hands in his pockets  strode up and down  like a wild beast in a cage  turning sharply after twenty paces
sergey ivanovitch fancied  as he approached him  that vronsky saw him but was pretending not to see
this did not affect sergey ivanovitch in the slightest
he was above all personal considerations with vronsky
at that moment sergey ivanovitch looked upon vronsky as a man taking an important part in a great cause  and koznishev thought it his duty to encourage him and express his approval
he went up to him
vronsky stood still  looked intently at him  recognized him  and going a few steps forward to meet him  shook hands with him very warmly
 possibly you didn t wish to see me   said sergey ivanovitch   but couldn t i be of use to you    there s no one i should less dislike seeing than you   said vronsky
 excuse me  and there s nothing in life for me to like   anna karenina 1680 of 1759  i quite understand  and i merely meant to offer you my services   said sergey ivanovitch  scanning vronsky s face  full of unmistakable suffering
 wouldn t it be of use to you to have a letter to ristitch to milan    oh  no   vronsky said  seeming to understand him with difficulty
 if you don t mind  let s walk on
it s so stuffy among the carriages
a letter  no  thank you  to meet death one needs no letters of introduction
nor for the turks     he said  with a smile that was merely of the lips
his eyes still kept their look of angry suffering
 yes  but you might find it easier to get into relations  which are after all essential  with anyone prepared to see you
but that s as you like
i was very glad to hear of your intention
there have been so many attacks made on the volunteers  and a man like you raises them in public estimation    my use as a man   said vronsky   is that life s worth nothing to me
and that i ve enough bodily energy to cut my way into their ranks  and to trample on them or fall i know that
i m glad there s something to give my life for  for it s not simply useless but loathsome to me
anyone s welcome to it   and his jaw twitched impatiently from the incessant gnawing toothache  that prevented him from even speaking with a natural expression
anna karenina 1681 of 1759  you will become another man  i predict   said sergey ivanovitch  feeling touched
 to deliver one s brothermen from bondage is an aim worth death and life
god grant you success outwardly and inwardly peace   he added  and he held out his hand
vronsky warmly pressed his outstretched hand  yes  as a weapon i may be of some use
but as a man  i m a wreck   he jerked out
he could hardly speak for the throbbing ache in his strong teeth  that were like rows of ivory in his mouth
he was silent  and his eyes rested on the wheels of the tender  slowly and smoothly rolling along the rails
and all at once a different pain  not an ache  but an inner trouble  that set his whole being in anguish  made him for an instant forget his toothache
as he glanced at the tender and the rails  under the influence of the conversation with a friend he had not met since his misfortune  he suddenly recalled her that is  what was left of her when he had run like one distraught into the cloak room of the railway station on the table  shamelessly sprawling out among strangers  the bloodstained body so lately full of life  the head unhurt dropping back with its weight of hair  and the curling tresses about the temples  and the exquisite face  with red  anna karenina 1682 of 1759 half opened mouth  the strange  fixed expression  piteous on the lips and awful in the still open eyes  that seemed to utter that fearful phrase that he would be sorry for it  that she had said when they were quarreling
and he tried to think of her as she was when he met her the first time  at a railway station too  mysterious  exquisite  loving  seeking and giving happiness  and not cruelly revengeful as he remembered her on that last moment
he tried to recall his best moments with her  but those moments were poisoned forever
he could only think of her as triumphant  successful in her menace of a wholly useless remorse never to be effaced
he lost all consciousness of toothache  and his face worked with sobs
passing twice up and down beside the baggage in silence and regaining his self possession  he addressed sergey ivanovitch calmly   you have had no telegrams since yesterday s  yes  driven back for a third time  but a decisive engagement expected for tomorrow   and after talking a little more of king milan s proclamation  and the immense effect it might have  they parted  going to their carriages on hearing the second bell anna karenina 1683 of 1759 sergey ivanovitch had not telegraphed to his brother to send to meet him  as he did not know when he should be able to leave moscow
levin was not at home when katavasov and sergey ivanovitch in a fly hired at the station drove up to the steps of the pokrovskoe house  as black as moors from the dust of the road
kitty  sitting on the balcony with her father and sister  recognized her brother in law  and ran down to meet him
 what a shame not to have let us know   she said  giving her hand to sergey ivanovitch  and putting her forehead up for him to kiss
 we drove here capitally  and have not put you out   answered sergey ivanovitch
 i m so dirty
i m afraid to touch you
i ve been so busy  i didn t know when i should be able to tear myself away
and so you re still as ever enjoying your peaceful  quiet happiness   he said  smiling   out of the reach of the current in your peaceful backwater
here s our friend fyodor vassilievitch who has succeeded in getting here at last    but i m not a negro  i shall look like a human being when i wash   said katavasov in his jesting fashion  and he anna karenina 1684 of 1759 shook hands and smiled  his teeth flashing white in his black face
 kostya will be delighted
he has gone to his settlement
it s time he should be home    busy as ever with his farming
it really is a peaceful backwater   said katavasov   while we in town think of nothing but the servian war
well  how does our friend look at it  he s sure not to think like other people    oh  i don t know  like everybody else   kitty answered  a little embarrassed  looking round at sergey ivanovitch
 i ll send to fetch him papa s staying with us
he s only just come home from abroad   and making arrangements to send for levin and for the guests to wash  one in his room and the other in what had been dolly s  and giving orders for their luncheon  kitty ran out onto the balcony  enjoying the freedom  and rapidity of movement  of which she had been deprived during the months of her pregnancy
 it s sergey ivanovitch and katavasov  a professor   she said
 oh  that s a bore in this heat   said the prince
 no  papa  he s very nice  and kostya s very fond of him   kitty said  with a deprecating smile  noticing the irony on her father s face
anna karenina 1685 of 1759  oh  i didn t say anything    you go to them  darling   said kitty to her sister   and entertain them
they saw stiva at the station  he was quite well
and i must run to mitya
as ill luck would have it  i haven t fed him since tea
he s awake now  and sure to be screaming   and feeling a rush of milk  she hurried to the nursery
this was not a mere guess  her connection with the child was still so close  that she could gauge by the flow of her milk his need of food  and knew for certain he was hungry
she knew he was crying before she reached the nursery
and he was indeed crying
she heard him and hastened
but the faster she went  the louder he screamed
it was a fine healthy scream  hungry and impatient
 has he been screaming long  nurse  very long   said kitty hurriedly  seating herself on a chair  and preparing to give the baby the breast
 but give me him quickly
oh  nurse  how tiresome you are  there  tie the cap afterwards  dol   the baby s greedy scream was passing into sobs
 but you can t manage so  ma am   said agafea mihalovna  who was almost always to be found in the anna karenina 1686 of 1759 nursery
 he must be put straight
a oo  a oo   she chanted over him  paying no attention to the mother
the nurse brought the baby to his mother
agafea mihalovna followed him with a face dissolving with tenderness
 he knows me  he knows me
in god s faith  katerina alexandrovna  ma am  he knew me   agafea mihalovna cried above the baby s screams but kitty did not hear her words
her impatience kept growing  like the baby s
their impatience hindered things for a while
the baby could not get hold of the breast right  and was furious
at last  after despairing  breathless screaming  and vain sucking  things went right  and mother and child felt simultaneously soothed  and both subsided into calm
 but poor darling  he s all in perspiration   said kitty in a whisper  touching the baby
 what makes you think he knows you   she added  with a sidelong glance at the baby s eyes  that peered roguishly  as she fancied  from under his cap  at his rhythmically puffing cheeks  and the little red palmed hand he was waving
anna karenina 1687 of 1759  impossible  if he knew anyone  he would have known me   said kitty  in response to agafea mihalovna s statement  and she smiled
she smiled because  though she said he could not know her  in her heart she was sure that he knew not merely agafea mihalovna  but that he knew and understood everything  and knew and understood a great deal too that no one else knew  and that she  his mother  had learned and come to understand only through him
to agafea mihalovna  to the nurse  to his grandfather  to his father even  mitya was a living being  requiring only materiel care  but for his mother he had long been a mortal being  with whom there had been a whole series of spiritual relations already
 when he wakes up  please god  you shall see for yourself
then when i do like this  he simply beams on me  the darling  simply beams like a sunny day   said agafea mihalovna  well  well then we shall see   whispered kitty
 but now go away  he s going to sleep   anna karenina 1688 of 1759 agafea mihalovna went out on tiptoe  the nurse let down the blind  chased a fly out from under the muslin canopy of the crib  and a bumblebee struggling on the window frame  and sat down waving a faded branch of birch over the mother and the baby
 how hot it is  if god would send a drop of rain   she said
 yes  yes  sh sh sh   was all kitty answered  rocking a little  and tenderly squeezing the plump little arm  with rolls of fat at the wrist  which mitya still waved feebly as he opened and shut his eyes
that hand worried kitty  she longed to kiss the little hand  but was afraid to for fear of waking the baby
at last the little hand ceased waving  and the eyes closed
only from time to time  as he went on sucking  the baby raised his long  curly eyelashes and peeped at his mother with wet eyes  that looked black in the twilight
the nurse had left off fanning  and was dozing
from above came the peals of the old prince s voice  and the chuckle of katavasov
 they have got into talk without me   thought kitty   but still it s vexing that kostya s out
he s sure to have anna karenina 1689 of 1759 gone to the bee house again
though it s a pity he s there so often  still i m glad
it distracts his mind
he s become altogether happier and better now than in the spring
he used to be so gloomy and worried that i felt frightened for him
and how absurd he is   she whispered  smiling
she knew what worried her husband
it was his unbelief
although  if she had been asked whether she supposed that in the future life  if he did not believe  he would be damned  she would have had to admit that he would be damned  his unbelief did not cause her unhappiness
and she  confessing that for an unbeliever there can be no salvation  and loving her husband s soul more than anything in the world  thought with a smile of his unbelief  and told herself that he was absurd
 what does he keep reading philosophy of some sort for all this year   she wondered
 if it s all written in those books  he can understand them
if it s all wrong  why does he read them  he says himself that he would like to believe then why is it he doesn t believe  surely from his thinking so much  and he thinks so much from being solitary
he s always alone  alone
he can t talk about it all to us
i fancy he ll be glad of these visitors  especially katavasov
he likes discussions with them   she thought  and passed instantly to the consideration of where it would anna karenina 1690 of 1759 be more convenient to put katavasov  to sleep alone or to share sergey ivanovitch s room
and then an idea suddenly struck her  which made her shudder and even disturb mitya  who glanced severely at her
 i do believe the laundress hasn t sent the washing yet  and all the best sheets are in use
if i don t see to it  agafea mihalovna will give sergey ivanovitch the wrong sheets   and at the very idea of this the blood rushed to kitty s face
 yes  i will arrange it   she decided  and going back to her former thoughts  she remembered that some spiritual question of importance had been interrupted  and she began to recall what
 yes  kostya  an unbeliever   she thought again with a smile
 well  an unbeliever then  better let him always be one than like madame stahl  or what i tried to be in those days abroad
no  he won t ever sham anything   and a recent instance of his goodness rose vividly to her mind
a fortnight ago a penitent letter had come from stepan arkadyevitch to dolly
he besought her to save his honor  to sell her estate to pay his debts
dolly was in despair  she detested her husband  despised him  pitied him  resolved on a separation  resolved to refuse  but ended by agreeing to sell part of her property
after that  with an irrepressible smile of tenderness  kitty recalled her anna karenina 1691 of 1759 husband s shamefaced embarrassment  his repeated awkward efforts to approach the subject  and how at last  having thought of the one means of helping dolly without wounding her pride  he had suggested to kitty what had not occurred to her before that she should give up her share of the property
 he an unbeliever indeed  with his heart  his dread of offending anyone  even a child  everything for others  nothing for himself sergey ivanovitch simply considers it as kostya s duty to be his steward
and it s the same with his sister
now dolly and her children are under his guardianship  all these peasants who come to him every day  as though he were bound to be at their service    yes  only be like your father  only like him   she said  handing mitya over to the nurse  and putting her lips to his cheek
anna karenina 1692 of 1759 ever since  by his beloved brother s deathbed  levin had first glanced into the questions of life and death in the light of these new convictions  as he called them  which had during the period from his twentieth to his thirtyfourth year imperceptibly replaced his childish and youthful beliefs he had been stricken with horror  not so much of death  as of life  without any knowledge of whence  and why  and how  and what it was
the physical organization  its decay  the indestructibility of matter  the law of the conservation of energy  evolution  were the words which usurped the place of his old belief
these words and the ideas associated with them were very well for intellectual purposes
but for life they yielded nothing  and levin felt suddenly like a man who has changed his warm fur cloak for a muslin garment  and going for the first time into the frost is immediately convinced  not by reason  but by his whole nature that he is as good as naked  and that he must infallibly perish miserably
from that moment  though he did not distinctly face it  and still went on living as before  levin had never lost this sense of terror at his lack of knowledge
anna karenina 1693 of 1759 he vaguely felt  too  that what he called his new convictions were not merely lack of knowledge  but that they were part of a whole order of ideas  in which no knowledge of what he needed was possible
at first  marriage  with the new joys and duties bound up with it  had completely crowded out these thoughts
but of late  while he was staying in moscow after his wife s confinement  with nothing to do  the question that clamored for solution had more and more often  more and more insistently  haunted levin s mind
the question was summed up for him thus   if i do not accept the answers christianity gives to the problems of my life  what answers do i accept   and in the whole arsenal of his convictions  so far from finding any satisfactory answers  he was utterly unable to find anything at all like an answer he was in the position of a man seeking food in toy shops and tool shops
istinctively  unconsciously  with every book  with every conversation  with every man he met  he was on the lookout for light on these questions and their solution
what puzzled and distracted him above everything was that the majority of men of his age and circle had  like him  exchanged their old beliefs for the same new anna karenina 1694 of 1759 convictions  and yet saw nothing to lament in this  and were perfectly satisfied and serene
so that  apart from the principal question  levin was tortured by other questions too
were these people sincere  he asked himself  or were they playing a part  or was it that they understood the answers science gave to these problems in some different  clearer sense than he did  and he assiduously studied both these men s opinions and the books which treated of these scientific explanations one fact he had found out since these questions had engrossed his mind  was that he had been quite wrong in supposing from the recollections of the circle of his young days at college  that religion had outlived its day  and that it was now practically non existent
all the people nearest to him who were good in their lives were believers
the old prince  and lvov  whom he liked so much  and sergey ivanovitch  and all the women believed  and his wife believed as simply as he had believed in his earliest childhood  and ninety nine hundredths of the russian people  all the working people for whose life he felt the deepest respect  believed
another fact of which he became convinced  after reading many scientific books  was that the men who shared his views had no other construction to put on anna karenina 1695 of 1759 them  and that they gave no explanation of the questions which he felt he could not live without answering  but simply ignored their existence and attempted to explain other questions of no possible interest to him  such as the evolution of organisms  the materialistic theory of consciousness  and so forth moreover  during his wife s confinement  something had happened that seemed extraordinary to him
he  an unbeliever  had fallen into praying  and at the moment he prayed  he believed
but that moment had passed  and he could not make his state of mind at that moment fit into the rest of his life
he could not admit that at that moment he knew the truth  and that now he was wrong  for as soon as he began thinking calmly about it  it all fell to pieces
he could not admit that he was mistaken then  for his spiritual condition then was precious to him  and to admit that it was a proof of weakness would have been to desecrate those moments
he was miserably divided against himself  and strained all his spiritual forces to the utmost to escape from this condition anna karenina 1696 of 1759 these doubts fretted and harassed him  growing weaker or stronger from time to time  but never leaving him
he read and thought  and the more he read and the more he thought  the further he felt from the aim he was pursuing
of late in moscow and in the country  since he had become convinced that he would find no solution in the materialists  he had read and reread thoroughly plato  spinoza  kant  schelling  hegel  and schopenhauer  the philosophers who gave a non materialistic explanation of life
their ideas seemed to him fruitful when he was reading or was himself seeking arguments to refute other theories  especially those of the materialists  but as soon as he began to read or sought fat himself a solution of problems  the same thing always happened as long as he followed the fixed definition of obscure words such as spirit  will  freedom  essence  purposely letting himself go into the snare of words the philosophers set for him  he seemed to comprehend something but he had only to forget the artificial train of reasoning  and to turn from life itself to what had satisfied him while thinking in accordance with anna karenina 1697 of 1759 the fixed definitions  and all this artificial edifice fell to pieces at once like a house of cards  and it became clear that the edifice had been built up out of those transposed words  apart from anything in life more important than reason
at one time  reading schopenhauer  he put in place of his will the word love  and for a couple of days this new philosophy charmed him  till he removed a little away from it
but then  when he turned from life itself to glance at it again  it fell away too  and proved to be the same muslin garment with no warmth in it
his brother sergey ivanovitch advised him to read the theological works of homiakov
levin read the second volume of homiakov s works  and in spite of the elegant  epigrammatic  argumentative style which at first repelled him  he was impressed by the doctrine of the church he found in them
he was struck at first by the idea that the apprehension of divine truths had not been vouchsafed to man  but to a corporation of men bound together by love to the church
what delighted him was the thought how much easier it was to believe in a still existing living church  embracing all the beliefs of men  and having god at its head  and therefore holy and infallible  and from it to accept the faith in god  in the creation  the fall  the anna karenina 1698 of 1759 redemption  than to begin with god  a mysterious  faraway god  the creation  etc but afterwards  on reading a catholic writer s history of the church  and then a greek orthodox writer s history of the church  and seeing that the two churches  in their very conception infallible  each deny the authority of the other  homiakov s doctrine of the church lost all its charm for him  and this edifice crumbled into dust like the philosophers  edifices
all that spring he was not himself  and went through fearful moments of horror  without knowing what i am and why i am here  life s impossible  and that i can t know  and so i can t live   levin said to himself  in infinite time  in infinite matter  in infinite space  is formed a bubble organism  and that bubble lasts a while and bursts  and that bubble is me   it was an agonizing error  but it was the sole logical result of ages of human thought in that direction
this was the ultimate belief on which all the systems elaborated by human thought in almost all their ramifications rested it was the prevalent conviction  and of all other explanations levin had unconsciously  not knowing when or how  chosen it  as anyway the clearest  and made it his own
anna karenina 1699 of 1759 but it was not merely a falsehood  it was the cruel jeer of some wicked power  some evil  hateful power  to whom one could not submit
he must escape from this power
and the means of escape every man had in his own hands
he had but to cut short this dependence on evil
and there was one means  death
and levin  a happy father and husband  in perfect health  was several times so near suicide that he hid the cord that he might not be tempted to hang himself  and was afraid to go out with his gun for fear of shooting himself but levin did not shoot himself  and did not hang himself  he went on living anna karenina 1700 of 1759 when levin thought what he was and what he was living for  he could find no answer to the questions and was reduced to despair  but he left off questioning himself about it it seemed as though he knew both what he was and for what he was living  for he acted and lived resolutely and without hesitation
indeed  in these latter days he was far more decided and unhesitating in life than he had ever been
when he went back to the country at the beginning of june  he went back also to his usual pursuits
the management of the estate  his relations with the peasants and the neighbors  the care of his household  the management of his sister s and brother s property  of which he had the direction  his relations with his wife and kindred  the care of his child  and the new bee keeping hobby he had taken up that spring  filled all his time
these things occupied him now  not because he justified them to himself by any sort of general principles  as he had done in former days  on the contrary  disappointed by the failure of his former efforts for the general welfare  and too much occupied with his own anna karenina 1701 of 1759 thought and the mass of business with which he was burdened from all sides  he had completely given up thinking of the general good  and he busied himself with all this work simply because it seemed to him that he must do what he was doing that he could not do otherwise in former days almost from childhood  and increasingly up to full manhood when he had tried to do anything that would be good for all  for humanity  for russia  for the whole village  he had noticed that the idea of it had been pleasant  but the work itself had always been incoherent  that then he had never had a full conviction of its absolute necessity  and that the work that had begun by seeming so great  had grown less and less  till it vanished into nothing
but now  since his marriage  when he had begun to confine himself more and more to living for himself  though he experienced no delight at all at the thought of the work he was doing  he felt a complete conviction of its necessity  saw that it succeeded far better than in old days  and that it kept on growing more and more now  involuntarily it seemed  he cut more and more deeply into the soil like a plough  so that he could not be drawn out without turning aside the furrow
anna karenina 1702 of 1759 to live the same family life as his father and forefathers that is  in the same condition of culture and to bring up his children in the same  was incontestably necessary
it was as necessary as dining when one was hungry
and to do this  just as it was necessary to cook dinner  it was necessary to keep the mechanism of agriculture at pokrovskoe going so as to yield an income
just as incontestably as it was necessary to repay a debt was it necessary to keep the property in such a condition that his son  when he received it as a heritage  would say  thank you  to his father as levin had said  thank you  to his grandfather for all he built and planted
and to do this it was necessary to look after the land himself  not to let it  and to breed cattle  manure the fields  and plant timber it was impossible not to look after the affairs of sergey ivanovitch  of his sister  of the peasants who came to him for advice and were accustomed to do so as impossible as to fling down a child one is carrying in one s arms it was necessary to look after the comfort of his sister in law and her children  and of his wife and baby  and it was impossible not to spend with them at least a short time each day
anna karenina 1703 of 1759 and all this  together with shooting and his new beekeeping  filled up the whole of levin s life  which had no meaning at all for him  when he began to think
but besides knowing thoroughly what he had to do  levin knew in just the same way how he had to do it all  and what was more important than the rest
he knew he must hire laborers as cheaply as possible  but to hire men under bond  paying them in advance at less than the current rate of wages  was what he must not do  even though it was very profitable
selling straw to the peasants in times of scarcity of provender was what he might do  even though he felt sorry for them  but the tavern and the pothouse must be put down  though they were a source of income
felling timber must be punished as severely as possible  but he could not exact forfeits for cattle being driven onto his fields  and though it annoyed the keeper and made the peasants not afraid to graze their cattle on his land  he could not keep their cattle as a punishment
to pyotr  who was paying a money lender 10 per cent a month  he must lend a sum of money to set him free
but he could not let off peasants who did not pay their rent  nor let them fall into arrears
it was impossible to overlook the bailiff s not having mown the meadows and anna karenina 1704 of 1759 letting the hay spoil  and it was equally impossible to mow those acres where a young copse had been planted
it was impossible to excuse a laborer who had gone home in the busy season because his father was dying  however sorry he might feel for him  and he must subtract from his pay those costly months of idleness
but it was impossible not to allow monthly rations to the old servants who were of no use for anything
levin knew that when he got home he must first of all go to his wife  who was unwell  and that the peasants who had been waiting for three hours to see him could wait a little longer
he knew too that  regardless of all the pleasure he felt in taking a swarm  he must forego that pleasure  and leave the old man to see to the bees alone  while he talked to the peasants who had come after him to the bee house
whether he were acting rightly or wrongly he did not know  and far from trying to prove that he was  nowadays he avoided all thought or talk about it
reasoning had brought him to doubt  and prevented him from seeing what he ought to do and what he ought not
when he did not think  but simply lived  he was continually aware of the presence of an infallible judge in his soul  determining which of two possible courses of anna karenina 1705 of 1759 action was the better and which was the worse  and as soon as he did not act rightly  he was at once aware of it
so he lived  not knowing and not seeing any chance of knowing what he was and what he was living for  and harassed at this lack of knowledge to such a point that he was afraid of suicide  and yet firmly laying down his own individual definite path in life
anna karenina 1706 of 1759 the day on which sergey ivanovitch came to pokrovskoe was one of levin s most painful days
it was the very busiest working time  when all the peasantry show an extraordinary intensity of self sacrifice in labor  such as is never shown in any other conditions of life  and would be highly esteemed if the men who showed these qualities themselves thought highly of them  and if it were not repeated every year  and if the results of this intense labor were not so simple to reap and bind the rye and oats and to carry it  to mow the meadows  turn over the fallows  thrash the seed and sow the winter corn all this seems so simple and ordinary  but to succeed in getting through it all everyone in the village  from the old man to the young child  must toil incessantly for three or four weeks  three times as hard as usual  living on rye beer  onions  and black bread  thrashing and carrying the sheaves at night  and not giving more than two or three hours in the twenty four to sleep and every year this is done all over russia
having lived the greater part of his life in the country and in the closest relations with the peasants  levin always anna karenina 1707 of 1759 felt in this busy time that he was infected by this general quickening of energy in the people
in the early morning he rode over to the first sowing of the rye  and to the oats  which were being carried to the stacks  and returning home at the time his wife and sisterin law were getting up  he drank coffee with them and walked to the farm  where a new thrashing machine was to be set working to get ready the seed corn
he was standing in the cool granary  still fragrant with the leaves of the hazel branches interlaced on the freshly peeled aspen beams of the new thatch roof he gazed through the open door in which the dry bitter dust of the thrashing whirled and played  at the grass of the thrashing floor in the sunlight and the fresh straw that had been brought in from the barn  then at the speckly headed  white breasted swallows that flew chirping in under the roof and  fluttering their wings  settled in the crevices of the doorway  then at the peasants bustling in the dark  dusty barn  and he thought strange thoughts
 why is it all being done   he thought
 why am i standing here  making them work  what are they all so busy for  trying to show their zeal before me  what is that old matrona  my old friend  toiling for   i doctored her  when the beam fell on her in the fire   he thought  anna karenina 1708 of 1759 looking at a thin old woman who was raking up the grain  moving painfully with her bare  sun blackened feet over the uneven  rough floor
 then she recovered  but today or tomorrow or in ten years she won t  they ll bury her  and nothing will be left either of her or of that smart girl in the red jacket  who with that skillful  soft action shakes the ears out of their husks
they ll bury her and this piebald horse  and very soon too   he thought  gazing at the heavily moving  panting horse that kept walking up the wheel that turned under him
 and they will bury her and fyodor the thrasher with his curly beard full of chaff and his shirt torn on his white shoulders they will bury him
he s untying the sheaves  and giving orders  and shouting to the women  and quickly setting straight the strap on the moving wheel
and what s more  it s not them alone me they ll bury too  and nothing will be left
what for   he thought this  and at the same time looked at his watch to reckon how much they thrashed in an hour
he wanted to know this so as to judge by it the task to set for the day
 it ll soon be one  and they re only beginning the third sheaf   thought levin
he went up to the man that was feeding the machine  and shouting over the roar of the anna karenina 1709 of 1759 machine he told him to put it in more slowly
 you put in too much at a time  fyodor
do you see it gets choked  that s why it isn t getting on
do it evenly   fyodor  black with the dust that clung to his moist face  shouted something in response  but still went on doing it as levin did not want him to
levin  going up to the machine  moved fyodor aside  and began feeding the corn in himself working on till the peasants  dinner hour  which was not long in coming  he went out of the barn with fyodor and fell into talk with him  stopping beside a neat yellow sheaf of rye laid on the thrashing floor for seed
fyodor came from a village at some distance from the one in which levin had once allotted land to his cooperative association
now it had been let to a former house porter
levin talked to fyodor about this land and asked whether platon  a well to do peasant of good character belonging to the same village  would not take the land for the coming year
 it s a high rent  it wouldn t pay platon  konstantin dmitrievitch   answered the peasant  picking the ears off his sweat drenched shirt
 but how does kirillov make it pay   anna karenina 1710 of 1759  mituh    so the peasant called the house porter  in a tone of contempt    you may be sure he ll make it pay  konstantin dmitrievitch  he ll get his share  however he has to squeeze to get it  he s no mercy on a christian
but uncle fokanitch   so he called the old peasant platon    do you suppose he d flay the skin off a man  where there s debt  he ll let anyone off
and he ll not wring the last penny out
he s a man too    but why will he let anyone off    oh  well  of course  folks are different
one man lives for his own wants and nothing else  like mituh  he only thinks of filling his belly  but fokanitch is a righteous man
he lives for his soul
he does not forget god    how thinks of god  how does he live for his soul   levin almost shouted
 why  to be sure  in truth  in god s way
folks are different
take you now  you wouldn t wrong a man      yes  yes  good bye   said levin  breathless with excitement  and turning round he took his stick and walked quickly away towards home
at the peasant s words that fokanitch lived for his soul  in truth  in god s way  undefined but significant ideas seemed to burst out as though they had been locked up  and all striving towards anna karenina 1711 of 1759 one goal  they thronged whirling through his head  blinding him with their light
anna karenina 1712 of 1759 levin strode along the highroad  absorbed not so much in his thoughts  he could not yet disentangle them  as in his spiritual condition  unlike anything he had experienced before
the words uttered by the peasant had acted on his soul like an electric shock  suddenly transforming and combining into a single whole the whole swarm of disjointed  impotent  separate thoughts that incessantly occupied his mind
these thoughts had unconsciously been in his mind even when he was talking about the land
he was aware of something new in his soul  and joyfully tested this new thing  not yet knowing what it was
 not living for his own wants  but for god  for what god  and could one say anything more senseless than what he said  he said that one must not live for one s own wants  that is  that one must not live for what we understand  what we are attracted by  what we desire  but must live for something incomprehensible  for god  whom no one can understand nor even define
what of it  anna karenina 1713 of 1759 didn t i understand those senseless words of fyodor s  and understanding them  did i doubt of their truth  did i think them stupid  obscure  inexact  no  i understood him  and exactly as he understands the words
i understood them more fully and clearly than i understand anything in life  and never in my life have i doubted nor can i doubt about it
and not only i  but everyone  the whole world understands nothing fully but this  and about this only they have no doubt and are always agreed
 and i looked out for miracles  complained that i did not see a miracle which would convince me
a material miracle would have persuaded me
and here is a miracle  the sole miracle possible  continually existing  surrounding me on all sides  and i never noticed it   fyodor says that kirillov lives for his belly
that s comprehensible and rational
all of us as rational beings can t do anything else but live for our belly
and all of a sudden the same fyodor says that one mustn t live for one s belly  but must live for truth  for god  and at a hint i understand him  and i and millions of men  men who lived ages ago and men living now  peasants  the poor in spirit and the learned  who have thought and written about it  in their obscure words saying the same thing  we are all agreed about this one thing  what we must live anna karenina 1714 of 1759 for and what is good
i and all men have only one firm  incontestable  clear knowledge  and that knowledge cannot be explained by the reason it is outside it  and has no causes and can have no effects
 if goodness has causes  it is not goodness  if it has effects  a reward  it is not goodness either
so goodness is outside the chain of cause and effect
 and yet i know it  and we all know it
 what could be a greater miracle than that   can i have found the solution of it all  can my sufferings be over   thought levin  striding along the dusty road  not noticing the heat nor his weariness  and experiencing a sense of relief from prolonged suffering
this feeling was so delicious that it seemed to him incredible
he was breathless with emotion and incapable of going farther  he turned off the road into the forest and lay down in the shade of an aspen on the uncut grass
he took his hat off his hot head and lay propped on his elbow in the lush  feathery  woodland grass
 yes  i must make it clear to myself and understand   he thought  looking intently at the untrampled grass before him  and following the movements of a green beetle  advancing along a blade of couch grass and lifting up in its progress a leaf of goat weed
 what have i discovered   he anna karenina 1715 of 1759 asked himself  bending aside the leaf of goat weed out of the beetle s way and twisting another blade of grass above for the beetle to cross over onto it  what is it makes me glad  what have i discovered   i have discovered nothing
i have only found out what i knew
i understand the force that in the past gave me life  and now too gives me life
i have been set free from falsity  i have found the master
 of old i used to say that in my body  that in the body of this grass and of this beetle  there  she didn t care for the grass  she s opened her wings and flown away   there was going on a transformation of matter in accordance with physical  chemical  and physiological laws
and in all of us  as well as in the aspens and the clouds and the misty patches  there was a process of evolution
evolution from what  into what  eternal evolution and struggle   
as though there could be any sort of tendency and struggle in the eternal  and i was astonished that in spite of the utmost effort of thought along that road i could not discover the meaning of life  the meaning of my impulses and yearnings
now i say that i know the meaning of my life   to live for god  for my soul   and this meaning  in spite of its clearness  is mysterious and marvelous
such  indeed  is the meaning of everything existing
yes  pride   anna karenina 1716 of 1759 he said to himself  turning over on his stomach and beginning to tie a noose of blades of grass  trying not to break them  and not merely pride of intellect  but dulness of intellect
and most of all  the deceitfulness  yes  the deceitfulness of intellect
the cheating knavishness of intellect  that s it   he said to himself and he briefly went through  mentally  the whole course of his ideas during the last two years  the beginning of which was the clear confronting of death at the sight of his dear brother hopelessly ill
then  for the first time  grasping that for every man  and himself too  there was nothing in store but suffering  death  and forgetfulness  he had made up his mind that life was impossible like that  and that he must either interpret life so that it would not present itself to him as the evil jest of some devil  or shoot himself but he had not done either  but had gone on living  thinking  and feeling  and had even at that very time married  and had had many joys and had been happy  when he was not thinking of the meaning of his life
what did this mean  it meant that he had been living rightly  but thinking wrongly
anna karenina 1717 of 1759 he had lived  without being aware of it  on those spiritual truths that he had sucked in with his mother s milk  but he had thought  not merely without recognition of these truths  but studiously ignoring them
now it was clear to him that he could only live by virtue of the beliefs in which he had been brought up
 what should i have been  and how should i have spent my life  if i had not had these beliefs  if i had not known that i must live for god and not for my own desires  i should have robbed and lied and killed
nothing of what makes the chief happiness of my life would have existed for me   and with the utmost stretch of imagination he could not conceive the brutal creature he would have been himself  if he had not known what he was living for  i looked for an answer to my question and thought could not give an answer to my question it is incommensurable with my question
the answer has been given me by life itself  in my knowledge of what is right and what is wrong
and that knowledge i did not arrive at in any way  it was given to me as to all men  given  because i could not have got it from anywhere
 where could i have got it  by reason could i have arrived at knowing that i must love my neighbor and not anna karenina 1718 of 1759 oppress him  i was told that in my childhood  and i believed it gladly  for they told me what was already in my soul
but who discovered it  not reason
reason discovered the struggle for existence  and the law that requires us to oppress all who hinder the satisfaction of our desires
that is the deduction of reason
but loving one s neighbor reason could never discover  because it s irrational   anna karenina 1719 of 1759 and levin remembered a scene he had lately witnessed between dolly and her children
the children  left to themselves  had begun cooking raspberries over the candles and squirting milk into each other s mouths with a syringe their mother  catching them at these pranks  began reminding them in levin s presence of the trouble their mischief gave to the grown up people  and that this trouble was all for their sake  and that if they smashed the cups they would have nothing to drink their tea out of  and that if they wasted the milk  they would have nothing to eat  and die of hunger
and levin had been struck by the passive  weary incredulity with which the children heard what their mother said to them
they were simply annoyed that their amusing play had been interrupted  and did not believe a word of what their mother was saying
they could not believe it indeed  for they could not take in the immensity of all they habitually enjoyed  and so could not conceive that what they were destroying was the very thing they lived by
anna karenina 1720 of 1759  that all comes of itself   they thought   and there s nothing interesting or important about it because it has always been so  and always will be so
and it s all always the same
we ve no need to think about that  it s all ready
but we want to invent something of our own  and new
so we thought of putting raspberries in a cup  and cooking them over a candle  and squirting milk straight into each other s mouths
that s fun  and something new  and not a bit worse than drinking out of cups    isn t it just the same that we do  that i did  searching by the aid of reason for the significance of the forces of nature and the meaning of the life of man   he thought
 and don t all the theories of philosophy do the same  trying by the path of thought  which is strange and not natural to man  to bring him to a knowledge of what he has known long ago  and knows so certainly that he could not live at all without it  isn t it distinctly to be seen in the development of each philosopher s theory  that he knows what is the chief significance of life beforehand  just as positively as the peasant fyodor  and not a bit more clearly than he  and is simply trying by a dubious intellectual path to come back to what everyone knows   now then  leave the children to themselves to get things alone and make their crockery  get the milk from anna karenina 1721 of 1759 the cows  and so on would they be naughty then  why  they d die of hunger  well  then  leave us with our passions and thoughts  without any idea of the one god  of the creator  or without any idea of what is right  without any idea of moral evil
 just try and build up anything without those ideas   we only try to destroy them  because we re spiritually provided for
exactly like the children   whence have i that joyful knowledge  shared with the peasant  that alone gives peace to my soul  whence did i get it   brought up with an idea of god  a christian  my whole life filled with the spiritual blessings christianity has given me  full of them  and living on those blessings  like the children i did not understand them  and destroy  that is try to destroy  what i live by
and as soon as an important moment of life comes  like the children when they are cold and hungry  i turn to him  and even less than the children when their mother scolds them for their childish mischief  do i feel that my childish efforts at wanton madness are reckoned against me
 yes  what i know  i know not by reason  but it has been given to me  revealed to me  and i know it with my heart  by faith in the chief thing taught by the church
anna karenina 1722 of 1759  the church  the church   levin repeated to himself he turned over on the other side  and leaning on his elbow  fell to gazing into the distance at a herd of cattle crossing over to the river
 but can i believe in all the church teaches   he thought  trying himself  and thinking of everything that could destroy his present peace of mind itentionally he recalled all those doctrines of the church which had always seemed most strange and had always been a stumbling block to him
 the creation  but how did i explain existence  by existence  by nothing  the devil and sin
but how do i explain evil   
the atonement   
 but i know nothing  nothing  and i can know nothing but what has been told to me and all men   and it seemed to him that there was not a single article of faith of the church which could destroy the chief thing faith in god  in goodness  as the one goal of man s destiny
under every article of faith of the church could be put the faith in the service of truth instead of one s desires
and each doctrine did not simply leave that faith unshaken  each doctrine seemed essential to complete that great miracle  continually manifest upon earth  that made anna karenina 1723 of 1759 it possible for each man and millions of different sorts of men  wise men and imbeciles  old men and children all men  peasants  lvov  kitty  beggars and kings to understand perfectly the same one thing  and to build up thereby that life of the soul which alone is worth living  and which alone is precious to us
lying on his back  he gazed up now into the high  cloudless sky
 do i not know that that is infinite space  and that it is not a round arch  but  however i screw up my eyes and strain my sight  i cannot see it not round and not bounded  and in spite of my knowing about infinite space  i am incontestably right when i see a solid blue dome  and more right than when i strain my eyes to see beyond it   levin ceased thinking  and only  as it were  listened to mysterious voices that seemed talking joyfully and earnestly within him
 can this be faith   he thought  afraid to believe in his happiness
 my god  i thank thee   he said  gulping down his sobs  and with both hands brushing away the tears that filled his eyes
anna karenina 1724 of 1759 levin looked before him and saw a herd of cattle  then he caught sight of his trap with raven in the shafts  and the coachman  who  driving up to the herd  said something to the herdsman
then he heard the rattle of the wheels and the snort of the sleek horse close by him
but he was so buried in his thoughts that he did not even wonder why the coachman had come for him
he only thought of that when the coachman had driven quite up to him and shouted to him
 the mistress sent me
your brother has come  and some gentleman with him   levin got into the trap and took the reins
as though just roused out of sleep  for a long while levin could not collect his faculties
he stared at the sleek horse flecked with lather between his haunches and on his neck  where the harness rubbed  stared at ivan the coachman sitting beside him  and remembered that he was expecting his brother  thought that his wife was most likely uneasy at his long absence  and tried to guess who was the visitor who had come with his brother
and his brother and his wife and the unknown guest seemed to him now quite anna karenina 1725 of 1759 different from before
he fancied that now his relations with all men would be different
 with my brother there will be none of that aloofness there always used to be between us  there will be no disputes  with kitty there shall never be quarrels  with the visitor  whoever he may be  i will be friendly and nice  with the servants  with ivan  it will all be different   pulling the stiff rein and holding in the good horse that snorted with impatience and seemed begging to be let go  levin looked round at ivan sitting beside him  not knowing what to do with his unoccupied hand  continually pressing down his shirt as it puffed out  and he tried to find something to start a conversation about with him
he would have said that ivan had pulled the saddlegirth up too high  but that was like blame  and he longed for friendly  warm talk
nothing else occurred to him
 your honor must keep to the right and mind that stump   said the coachman  pulling the rein levin held
 please don t touch and don t teach me   said levin  angered by this interference
now  as always  interference made him angry  and he felt sorrowfully at once how mistaken had been his supposition that his spiritual condition could immediately change him in contact with reality
anna karenina 1726 of 1759 he was not a quarter of a mile from home when he saw grisha and tanya running to meet him
 uncle kostya  mamma s coming  and grandfather  and sergey ivanovitch  and someone else   they said  clambering up into the trap
 who is he    an awfully terrible person  and he does like this with his arms   said tanya  getting up in the trap and mimicking katavasov  old or young   asked levin  laughing  reminded of someone  he did not know whom  by tanya s performance
 oh  i hope it s not a tiresome person   thought levin
as soon as he turned  at a bend in the road  and saw the party coming  levin recognized katavasov in a straw hat  walking along swinging his arms just as tanya had shown him katavasov was very fond of discussing metaphysics  having derived his notions from natural science writers who had never studied metaphysics  and in moscow levin had had many arguments with him of late
and one of these arguments  in which katavasov had obviously considered that he came off victorious  was the first thing levin thought of as he recognized him
anna karenina 1727 of 1759  no  whatever i do  i won t argue and give utterance to my ideas lightly   he thought
getting out of the trap and greeting his brother and katavasov  levin asked about his wife
 she has taken mitya to kolok   a copse near the house 
 she meant to have him out there because it s so hot indoors   said dolly
levin had always advised his wife not to take the baby to the wood  thinking it unsafe  and he was not pleased to hear this
 she rushes about from place to place with him   said the prince  smiling
 i advised her to try putting him in the ice cellar    she meant to come to the bee house
she thought you would be there
we are going there   said dolly
 well  and what are you doing   said sergey ivanovitch  falling back from the rest and walking beside him
 oh  nothing special
busy as usual with the land   answered levin
 well  and what about you  come for long  we have been expecting you for such a long time    only for a fortnight
i ve a great deal to do in moscow   at these words the brothers  eyes met  and levin  in spite of the desire he always had  stronger than ever just now  to be on affectionate and still more open terms with anna karenina 1728 of 1759 his brother  felt an awkwardness in looking at him he dropped his eyes and did not know what to say
casting over the subjects of conversation that would be pleasant to sergey ivanovitch  and would keep him off the subject of the servian war and the slavonic question  at which he had hinted by the allusion to what he had to do in moscow  levin began to talk of sergey ivanovitch s book
 well  have there been reviews of your book   he asked
sergey ivanovitch smiled at the intentional character of the question
 no one is interested in that now  and i less than anyone   he said
 just look  darya alexandrovna  we shall have a shower   he added  pointing with a sunshade at the white rain clouds that showed above the aspen tree tops
and these words were enough to reestablish again between the brothers that tone hardly hostile  but chilly which levin had been so longing to avoid
levin went up to katavasov
 it was jolly of you to make up your mind to come   he said to him
anna karenina 1729 of 1759  i ve been meaning to a long while
now we shall have some discussion  we ll see to that
have you been reading spencer    no  i ve not finished reading him   said levin
 but i don t need him now    how s that  that s interesting
why so    i mean that i m fully convinced that the solution of the problems that interest me i shall never find in him and his like now    but katavasov s serene and good humored expression suddenly struck him  and he felt such tenderness for his own happy mood  which he was unmistakably disturbing by this conversation  that he remembered his resolution and stopped short
 but we ll talk later on   he added
 if we re going to the bee house  it s this way  along this little path   he said  addressing them all
going along the narrow path to a little uncut meadow covered on one side with thick clumps of brilliant heart sease among which stood up here and there tall  dark green tufts of hellebore  levin settled his guests in the dense  cool shade of the young aspens on a bench and some stumps purposely put there for visitors to the bee house who might be afraid of the bees  and he went off himself anna karenina 1730 of 1759 to the hut to get bread  cucumbers  and fresh honey  to regale them with trying to make his movements as deliberate as possible  and listening to the bees that buzzed more and more frequently past him  he walked along the little path to the hut
in the very entry one bee hummed angrily  caught in his beard  but he carefully extricated it
going into the shady outer room  he took down from the wall his veil  that hung on a peg  and putting it on  and thrusting his hands into his pockets  he went into the fenced in beegarden  where there stood in the midst of a closely mown space in regular rows  fastened with bast on posts  all the hives he knew so well  the old stocks  each with its own history  and along the fences the younger swarms hived that year in front of the openings of the hives  it made his eyes giddy to watch the bees and drones whirling round and round about the same spot  while among them the working bees flew in and out with spoils or in search of them  always in the same direction into the wood to the flowering lime trees and back to the hives
his ears were filled with the incessant hum in various notes  now the busy hum of the working bee flying quickly off  then the blaring of the lazy drone  and the excited buzz of the bees on guard protecting their anna karenina 1731 of 1759 property from the enemy and preparing to sting
on the farther side of the fence the old bee keeper was shaving a hoop for a tub  and he did not see levin
levin stood still in the midst of the beehives and did not call him
he was glad of a chance to be alone to recover from the influence of ordinary actual life  which had already depressed his happy mood
he thought that he had already had time to lose his temper with ivan  to show coolness to his brother  and to talk flippantly with katavasov
 can it have been only a momentary mood  and will it pass and leave no trace   he thought
but the same instant  going back to his mood  he felt with delight that something new and important had happened to him
real life had only for a time overcast the spiritual peace he had found  but it was still untouched within him
just as the bees  whirling round him  now menacing him and distracting his attention  prevented him from enjoying complete physical peace  forced him to restrain his movements to avoid them  so had the petty cares that had swarmed about him from the moment he got into the trap restricted his spiritual freedom  but that lasted only so long as he was among them
just as his bodily strength was still unaffected  in spite of the bees  so too was the spiritual strength that he had just become aware of
anna karenina 1732 of 1759  do you know  kostya  with whom sergey ivanovitch traveled on his way here   said dolly  doling out cucumbers and honey to the children   with vronsky  he s going to servia    and not alone  he s taking a squadron out with him at his own expense   said katavasov
 that s the right thing for him   said levin
 are volunteers still going out then   he added  glancing at sergey ivanovitch
sergey ivanovitch did not answer
he was carefully with a blunt knife getting a live bee covered with sticky honey out of a cup full of white honeycomb
 i should think sol you should have seen what was going on at the station yesterday   said katavasov  biting with a juicy sound into a cucumber
 well  what is one to make of it  for mercy s sake  do explain to me  sergey ivanovitch  where are all those volunteers going  whom are they fighting with   asked the old prince  unmistakably taking up a conversation that had sprung up in levin s absence
anna karenina 1733 of 1759  with the turks   sergey ivanovitch answered  smiling serenely  as he extricated the bee  dark with honey and helplessly kicking  and put it with the knife on a stout aspen leaf
 but who has declared war on the turks  ivan ivanovitch ragozov and countess lidia ivanovna  assisted by madame stahl    no one has declared war  but people sympathize with their neighbors  sufferings and are eager to help them   said sergey ivanovitch
 but the prince is not speaking of help   said levin  coming to the assistance of his father in law   but of war
the prince says that private persons cannot take part in war without the permission of the government    kostya  mind  that s a bee  really  they ll sting us   said dolly  waving away a wasp
 but that s not a bee  it s a wasp   said levin
 well now  well  what s your own theory   katavasov said to levin with a smile  distinctly challenging him to a discussion
 why have not private persons the right to do so    oh  my theory s this  war is on one side such a beastly  cruel  and awful thing  that no one man  not to speak of a christian  can individually take upon himself the anna karenina 1734 of 1759 responsibility of beginning wars  that can only be done by a government  which is called upon to do this  and is driven inevitably into war on the other hand  both political science and common sense teach us that in matters of state  and especially in the matter of war  private citizens must forego their personal individual sergey ivanovitch and katavasov had their replies ready  and both began speaking at the same time
 but the point is  my dear fellow  that there may be cases when the government does not carry out the will of the citizens and then the public asserts its will   said katavasov
but evidently sergey ivanovitch did not approve of this answer
his brows contracted at katavasov s words and he said something else
 you don t put the matter in its true light
there is no question here of a declaration of war  but simply the expression of a human christian feeling
our brothers  one with us in religion and in race  are being massacred
even supposing they were not our brothers nor fellowchristians  but simply children  women  old people  feeling is aroused and russians go eagerly to help in stopping these atrocities
fancy  if you were going along the street and saw drunken men beating a woman or a anna karenina 1735 of 1759 child i imagine you would not stop to inquire whether war had been declared on the men  but would throw yourself on them  and protect the victim    but i should not kill them   said levin
 yes  you would kill them    i don t know
if i saw that  i might give way to my impulse of the moment  but i can t say beforehand
and such a momentary impulse there is not  and there cannot be  in the case of the oppression of the slavonic peoples    possibly for you there is not  but for others there is   said sergey ivanovitch  frowning with displeasure
 there are traditions still extant among the people of slavs of the true faith suffering under the yoke of the  unclean sons of hagar   the people have heard of the sufferings of their brethren and have spoken    perhaps so   said levin evasively   but i don t see it
i m one of the people myself  and i don t feel it    here am i too   said the old prince
 i ve been staying abroad and reading the papers  and i must own  up to the time of the bulgarian atrocities  i couldn t make out why it was all the russians were all of a sudden so fond of their slavonic brethren  while i didn t feel the slightest affection for them
i was very much upset  thought i was a monster  or that it was the influence of carlsbad on me
but since i anna karenina 1736 of 1759 have been here  my mind s been set at rest
i see that there are people besides me who re only interested in russia  and not in their slavonic brethren
here s konstantin too    personal opinions mean nothing in such a case   said sergey ivanovitch   it s not a matter of personal opinions when all russia the whole people has expressed its will    but excuse me  i don t see that
the people don t know anything about it  if you come to that   said the old prince
 oh  papa    how can you say that  and last sunday in church   said dolly  listening to the conversation
 please give me a cloth   she said to the old man  who was looking at the children with a smile
 why  it s not possible that all     but what was it in church on sunday  the priest had been told to read that
he read it
they didn t understand a word of it
then they were told that there was to be a collection for a pious object in church  well  they pulled out their halfpence and gave them  but what for they couldn t say    the people cannot help knowing  the sense of their own destinies is always in the people  and at such moments as the present that sense finds utterance   said anna karenina 1737 of 1759 sergey ivanovitch with conviction  glancing at the old bee keeper
the handsome old man  with black grizzled beard and thick silvery hair  stood motionless  holding a cup of honey  looking down from the height of his tall figure with friendly serenity at the gentlefolk  obviously understanding nothing of their conversation and not caring to understand it
 that s so  no doubt   he said  with a significant shake of his head at sergey ivanovitch s words
 here  then  ask him
he knows nothing about it and thinks nothing   said levin
 have you heard about the war  mihalitch   he said  turning to him
 what they read in the church  what do you think about it  ought we to fight for the christians    what should we think  alexander nikolaevitch our emperor has thought for us  he thinks for us indeed in all things
it s clearer for hint to see
shall i bring a bit more bread  give the little lad some more   he said addressing darya alexandrovna and pointing to grisha  who had finished his crust
 i don t need to ask   said sergey ivanovitch   we have seen and are seeing hundreds and hundreds of people who give up everything to sense a just cause  come from every anna karenina 1738 of 1759 part of russia  and directly and clearly express their thought and aim
they bring their halfpence or go themselves and say directly what for what does it mean    it means  to my thinking   said levin  who was beginning to get warm   that among eighty millions of people there can always be found not hundreds  as now  but tens of thousands of people who have lost caste  ne erdo wells  who are always ready to go anywhere to pogatchev s bands  to khiva  to serbia     i tell you that it s not a case of hundreds or of ne erdo wells  but the best representatives of the people   said sergey ivanovitch  with as much irritation as if he were defending the last penny of his fortune
 and what of the subscriptions  in this case it is a whole people directly expressing their will    that word  people  is so vague   said levin
 parish clerks  teachers  and one in a thousand of the peasants  maybe  know what it s all about
the rest of the eighty millions  like mihalitch  far from expressing their will  haven t the faintest idea what there is for them to express their will about
what right have we to say that this is the people s will   anna karenina 1739 of 1759 sergey ivanovitch  being practiced in argument  did not reply  but at once turned the conversation to another aspect of the subject
 oh  if you want to learn the spirit of the people by arithmetical computation  of course it s very difficult to arrive at it
and voting has not been introduced among us and cannot be introduced  for it does not express the will of the people  but there are other ways of reaching that
it is felt in the air  it is felt by the heart
i won t speak of those deep currents which are astir in the still ocean of the people  and which are evident to every unprejudiced man  let us look at society in the narrow sense
all the most diverse sections of the educated public  hostile before  are merged in one
every division is at an end  all the public organs say the same thing over and over again  all feel the mighty torrent that has overtaken them and is carrying them in one direction    yes  all the newspapers do say the same thing   said the prince
 that s true
but so it is the same thing that all the frogs croak before a storm
one can hear nothing for them   anna karenina 1740 of 1759  frogs or no frogs  i m not the editor of a paper and i don t want to defend them  but i am speaking of the unanimity in the intellectual world   said sergey ivanovitch  addressing his brother
levin would have answered  but the old prince interrupted him
 well  about that unanimity  that s another thing  one may say   said the prince
 there s my son in law  stepan arkadyevitch  you know him
he s got a place now on the committee of a commission and something or other  i don t remember
only there s nothing to do in it why  dolly  it s no secret  and a salary of eight thousand
you try asking him whether his post is of use  he ll prove to you that it s most necessary
and he s a truthful man too  but there s no refusing to believe in the utility of eight thousand roubles    yes  he asked me to give a message to darya alexandrovna about the post   said sergey ivanovitch reluctantly  feeling the prince s remark to be ill timed
 so it is with the unanimity of the press
that s been explained to me  as soon as there s war their incomes are doubled
how can they help believing in the destinies of the people and the slavonic races   and all that    i don t care for many of the papers  but that s unjust   said sergey ivanovitch
anna karenina 1741 of 1759  i would only make one condition   pursued the old prince
 alphonse karr said a capital thing before the war with prussia   you consider war to be inevitable  very good
let everyone who advocates war be enrolled in a special regiment of advance guards  for the front of every storm  of every attack  to lead them all     a nice lot the editors would make   said katavasov  with a loud roar  as he pictured the editors he knew in this picked legion
 but they d run   said dolly   they d only be in the way    oh  if they ran away  then we d have grape shot or cossacks with whips behind them   said the prince
 but that s a joke  and a poor one too  if you ll excuse my saying so  prince   said sergey ivanovitch
 i don t see that it was a joke  that     levin was beginning  but sergey ivanovitch interrupted him
 every member of society is called upon to do his own special work   said he
 and men of thought are doing their work when they express public opinion
and the single hearted and full expression of public opinion is the service of the press and a phenomenon to rejoice us at the same time
twenty years ago we should have been silent  but now we have heard the voice of the russian people  anna karenina 1742 of 1759 which is ready to rise as one man and ready to sacrifice itself for its oppressed brethren  that is a great step and a proof of strength    but it s not only making a sacrifice
but killing turks   said levin timidly
 the people make sacrifices and are ready to make sacrifices for their soul  but not for murder   he added  instinctively connecting the conversation with the ideas that had been absorbing his mind
 for their soul  that s a most puzzling expression for a natural science man  do you understand  what sort of thing is the soul   said katavasov  smiling
 oh  you know    no  by god  i haven t the faintest idea   said katavasov with a loud roar of laughter
  i bring not peace  but a sword   says christ   sergey ivanovitch rejoined for his part  quoting as simply as though it were the easiest thing to understand the very passage that had always puzzled levin most
 that s so  no doubt   the old man repeated again
he was standing near them and responded to a chance glance turned in his direction
 ah  my dear fellow  you re defeated  utterly defeated   cried katavasov good humoredly
anna karenina 1743 of 1759 levin reddened with vexation  not at being defeated  but at having failed to control himself and being drawn into argument  no  i can t argue with them   he thought   they wear impenetrable armor  while i m naked   he saw that it was impossible to convince his brother and katavasov  and he saw even less possibility of himself agreeing with them what they advocated was the very pride of intellect that had almost been his ruin
he could not admit that some dozens of men  among them his brother  had the right  on the ground of what they were told by some hundreds of glib volunteers swarming to the capital  to say that they and the newspapers were expressing the will and feeling of the people  and a feeling which was expressed in vengeance and murder
he could not admit this  because he neither saw the expression of such feelings in the people among whom he was living  nor found them in himself  and he could not but consider himself one of the persons making up the russian people   and most of all because he  like the people  did not know and could not know what is for the general good  though he knew beyond a doubt that this general good could be attained only by the strict observance of that law of right and wrong which has been revealed to every man  and anna karenina 1744 of 1759 therefore he could not wish for war or advocate war for any general objects whatever he said as mihalitch did and the people  who had expressed their feeling in the traditional invitations of the varyagi   be princes and rule over us
gladly we promise complete submission
all the labor  all humiliations  all sacrifices we take upon ourselves  but we will not judge and decide   and now  according to sergey ivanovitch s account  the people had foregone this privilege they had bought at such a costly price
he wanted to say too that if public opinion were an infallible guide  then why were not revolutions and the commune as lawful as the movement in favor of the slavonic peoples  but these were merely thoughts that could settle nothing
one thing could be seen beyond doubt that was that at the actual moment the discussion was irritating sergey ivanovitch  and so it was wrong to continue it
and levin ceased speaking and then called the attention of his guests to the fact that the storm clouds were gathering  and that they had better be going home before it rained
anna karenina 1745 of 1759 the old prince and sergey ivanovitch got into the trap and drove off  the rest of the party hastened homewards on foot
but the storm clouds  turning white and then black  moved down so quickly that they had to quicken their pace to get home before the rain
the foremost clouds  lowering and black as soot laden smoke  rushed with extraordinary swiftness over the sky
they were still two hundred paces from home and a gust of wind had already blown up  and every second the downpour might be looked for
the children ran ahead with frightened and gleeful shrieks
darya alexandrovna  struggling painfully with her skirts that clung round her legs  was not walking  but running  her eyes fixed on the children
the men of the party  holding their hats on  strode with long steps beside her
they were just at the steps when a big drop fell splashing on the edge of the iron guttering
the children and their elders after them ran into the shelter of the house  talking merrily
anna karenina 1746 of 1759  katerina alexandrovna   levin asked of agafea mihalovna  who met them with kerchiefs and rugs in the hall
 we thought she was with you   she said
 and mitya    in the copse  he must be  and the nurse with him   levin snatched up the rugs and ran towards the copse
in that brief interval of time the storm clouds had moved on  covering the sun so completely that it was dark as an eclipse
stubbornly  as though insisting on its rights  the wind stopped levin  and tearing the leaves and flowers off the lime trees and stripping the white birch branches into strange unseemly nakedness  it twisted everything on one side acacias  flowers  burdocks  long grass  and tall tree tops
the peasant girls working in the garden ran shrieking into shelter in the servants  quarters
the streaming rain had already flung its white veil over all the distant forest and half the fields close by  and was rapidly swooping down upon the copse
the wet of the rain spurting up in tiny drops could be smelt in the air
holding his head bent down before him  and struggling with the wind that strove to tear the wraps away from him  levin was moving up to the copse and had just caught sight of something white behind the oak tree  anna karenina 1747 of 1759 when there was a sudden flash  the whole earth seemed on fire  and the vault of heaven seemed crashing overhead
opening his blinded eyes  levin gazed through the thick veil of rain that separated him now from the copse  and to his horror the first thing he saw was the green crest of the familiar oak tree in the middle of the copse uncannily changing its position
 can it have been struck   levin hardly had time to think when  moving more and more rapidly  the oak tree vanished behind the other trees  and he heard the crash of the great tree falling upon the others
the flash of lightning  the crash of thunder  and the instantaneous chill that ran through him were all merged for levin in one sense of terror
 my god  my god  not on them   he said
and though he thought at once how senseless was his prayer that they should not have been killed by the oak which had fallen now  he repeated it  knowing that he could do nothing better than utter this senseless prayer
running up to the place where they usually went  he did not find them there
they were at the other end of the copse under an old lime tree  they were calling him
two figures in dark dresses  they had been light summer dresses when they started out  were standing bending over something
it was anna karenina 1748 of 1759 kitty with the nurse
the rain was already ceasing  and it was beginning to get light when levin reached them
the nurse was not wet on the lower part of her dress  but kitty was drenched through  and her soaked clothes clung to her
though the rain was over  they still stood in the same position in which they had been standing when the storm broke
both stood bending over a perambulator with a green umbrella
 alive  unhurt  thank god   he said  splashing with his soaked boots through the standing water and running up to them
kitty s rosy wet face was turned towards him  and she smiled timidly under her shapeless sopped hat
 aren t you ashamed of yourself  i can t think how you can be so reckless   he said angrily to his wife
 it wasn t my fault  really
we were just meaning to go  when he made such a to do that we had to change him
we were just     kitty began defending herself
mitya was unharmed  dry  and still fast asleep
 well  thank god  i don t know what i m saying   they gathered up the baby s wet belongings  the nurse picked up the baby and carried it
levin walked beside his wife  and  penitent for having been angry  he squeezed her hand when the nurse was not looking
anna karenina 1749 of 1759 during the whole of that day  in the extremely different conversations in which he took part  only as it were with the top layer of his mind  in spite of the disappointment of not finding the change he expected in himself  levin had been all the while joyfully conscious of the fulness of his heart after the rain it was too wet to go for a walk  besides  the storm clouds still hung about the horizon  and gathered here and there  black and thundery
on the rim of the sky
the whole party spent the rest of the day in the house
no more discussions sprang up  on the contrary  after dinner every one was in the most amiable frame of mind
at first katavasov amused the ladies by his original jokes  which always pleased people on their first acquaintance with him
then sergey ivanovitch induced him to tell them about the very interesting observations he had made on the habits and characteristics of common houseflies  and their life
sergey ivanovitch  too  was in good spirits  and at tea his brother drew him on to explain his views of the future of the eastern question  and he anna karenina 1750 of 1759 spoke so simply and so well  that everyone listened eagerly
kitty was the only one who did not hear it all she was summoned to give mitya his bath
a few minutes after kitty had left the room she sent for levin to come to the nursery
leaving his tea  and regretfully interrupting the interesting conversation  and at the same time uneasily wondering why he had been sent for  as this only happened on important occasions  levin went to the nursery
although he had been much interested by sergey ivanovitch s views of the new epoch in history that would be created by the emancipation of forty millions of men of slavonic race acting with russia  a conception quite new to him  and although he was disturbed by uneasy wonder at being sent for by kitty  as soon as he came out of the drawing room and was alone  his mind reverted at once to the thoughts of the morning
and all the theories of the significance of the slav element in the history of the world seemed to him so trivial compared with what was passing in his own soul  that he instantly forgot it all and dropped back into the same frame of mind that he been in that morning
anna karenina 1751 of 1759 he did not  as he had done at other times  recall the whole train of thought that he did not need
he fell back at once into the feeling which had guided him  which was connected with those thoughts  and he found that feeling in his soul even stronger and more definite than before
he did not  as he had had to do with previous attempts to find comforting arguments  need to revive a whole chain of thought to find the feeling
now  on the contrary  the feeling of joy and peace was keener than ever  and thought could not keep pace with feeling
he walked across the terrace and looked at two stars that had come out in the darkening sky  and suddenly he remembered
 yes  looking at the sky  i thought that the dome that i see is not a deception  and then i thought something  i shirked facing something   he mused
 but whatever it was  there can be no disproving it  i have but to think  and all will come clear   just as he was going into the nursery he remembered what it was he had shirked facing
it was that if the chief proof of the divinity was his revelation of what is right  how is it this revelation is confined to the christian church alone  what relation to this revelation have the beliefs of the buddhists  mohammedans  who preached and did good too  anna karenina 1752 of 1759 it seemed to him that he had an answer to this question  but he had not time to formulate it to himself before he went into the nursery kitty was standing with her sleeves tucked up over the baby in the bath
hearing her husband s footstep  she turned towards him  summoning him to her with her smile
with one hand she was supporting the fat baby that lay floating and sprawling on its back  while with the other she squeezed the sponge over him
 come  look  look   she said  when her husband came up to her
 agafea mihalovna s right
he knows us   mitya had on that day given unmistakable  incontestable signs of recognizing all his friends
as soon as levin approached the bath  the experiment was tried  and it was completely successful
the cook  sent for with this object  bent over the baby
he frowned and shook his head disapprovingly
kitty bent down to him  he gave her a beaming smile  propped his little hands on the sponge and chirruped  making such a queer little contented sound with his lips  that kitty and the nurse were not alone in their admiration
levin  too  was surprised and delighted
anna karenina 1753 of 1759 the baby was taken out of the bath  drenched with water  wrapped in towels  dried  and after a piercing scream  handed to his mother
 well  i am glad you are beginning to love him   said kitty to her husband  when she had settled herself comfortably in her usual place  with the baby at her breast
 i am so glad  it had begun to distress me
you said you had no feeling for him    no  did i say that  i only said i was disappointed    what  disappointed in him    not disappointed in him  but in my own feeling  i had expected more
i had expected a rush of new delightful emotion to come as a surprise
and then instead of that  disgust  pity    she listened attentively  looking at him over the baby  while she put back on her slender fingers the rings she had taken off while giving mitya his bath
 and most of all  at there being far more apprehension and pity than pleasure
today  after that fright during the storm  i understand how i love him   kitty s smile was radiant
 were you very much frightened   she said
 so was i too  but i feel it more now that it s over
i m going to look at the oak
how nice katavasov is  and what a happy anna karenina 1754 of 1759 day we ve had altogether
and you re so nice with sergey ivanovitch  when you care to be   
well  go back to them
it s always so hot and steamy here after the bath   anna karenina 1755 of 1759 going out of the nursery and being again alone  levin went back at once to the thought  in which there was something not clear
instead of going into the drawing room  where he heard voices  he stopped on the terrace  and leaning his elbows on the parapet  he gazed up at the sky
it was quite dark now  and in the south  where he was looking  there were no clouds
the storm had drifted on to the opposite side of the sky  and there were flashes of lightning and distant thunder from that quarter
levin listened to the monotonous drip from the lime trees in the garden  and looked at the triangle of stars he knew so well  and the milky way with its branches that ran through its midst
at each flash of lightning the milky way  and even the bright stars  vanished  but as soon as the lightning died away  they reappeared in their places as though some hand had flung them back with careful aim
 well  what is it perplexes me   levin said to himself  feeling beforehand that the solution of his difficulties was ready in his soul  though he did not know it yet  yes  the one unmistakable  incontestable manifestation of the anna karenina 1756 of 1759 divinity is the law of right and wrong  which has come into the world by revelation  and which i feel in myself  and in the recognition of which i don t make myself  but whether i will or not i am made one with other men in one body of believers  which is called the church
well  but the jews  the mohammedans  the confucians  the buddhists what of them   he put to himself the question he had feared to face  can these hundreds of millions of men be deprived of that highest blessing without which life has no meaning   he pondered a moment  but immediately corrected himself  but what am i questioning   he said to himself  i am questioning the relation to divinity of all the different religions of all mankind
i am questioning the universal manifestation of god to all the world with all those misty blurs
what am i about  to me individually  to my heart has been revealed a knowledge beyond all doubt  and unattainable by reason  and here i am obstinately trying to express that knowledge in reason and words
 don t i know that the stars don t move   he asked himself  gazing at the bright planet which had shifted its position up to the topmost twig of the birch tree  but looking at the movements of the stars  i can t picture to anna karenina 1757 of 1759 myself the rotation of the earth  and i m right in saying that the stars move
 and could the astronomers have understood and calculated anything  if they had taken into account all the complicated and varied motions of the earth  all the marvelous conclusions they have reached about the distances  weights  movements  and deflections of the heavenly bodies are only founded on the apparent motions of the heavenly bodies about a stationary earth  on that very motion i see before me now  which has been so for millions of men during long ages  and was and will be always alike  and can always be trusted
and just as the conclusions of the astronomers would have been vain and uncertain if not founded on observations of the seen heavens  in relation to a single meridian and a single horizon  so would my conclusions be vain and uncertain if not founded on that conception of right  which has been and will be always alike for all men  which has been revealed to me as a christian  and which can always be trusted in my soul
the question of other religions and their relations to divinity i have no right to decide  and no possibility of deciding   anna karenina 1758 of 1759  oh  you haven t gone in then   he heard kitty s voice all at once  as she came by the same way to the drawingroom
 what is it  you re not worried about anything   she said  looking intently at his face in the starlight
but she could not have seen his face if a flash of lightning had not hidden the stars and revealed it
in that flash she saw his face distinctly  and seeing him calm and happy  she smiled at him
 she understands   he thought   she knows what i m thinking about
shall i tell her or not  yes  i ll tell her   but at the moment he was about to speak  she began speaking
 kostya  do something for me   she said   go into the corner room and see if they ve made it all right for sergey ivanovitch
i can t very well
see if they ve put the new wash stand in it    very well  i ll go directly   said levin  standing up and kissing her
 no  i d better not speak of it   he thought  when she had gone in before him
 it is a secret for me alone  of vital importance for me  and not to be put into words
 this new feeling has not changed me  has not made me happy and enlightened all of a sudden  as i had anna karenina 1759 of 1759 dreamed  just like the feeling for my child
there was no surprise in this either
faith or not faith i don t know what it is but this feeling has come just as imperceptibly through suffering  and has taken firm root in my soul
 i shall go on in the same way  losing my temper with ivan the coachman  falling into angry discussions  expressing my opinions tactlessly  there will be still the same wall between the holy of holies of my soul and other people  even my wife  i shall still go on scolding her for my own terror  and being remorseful for it  i shall still be as unable to understand with my reason why i pray  and i shall still go on praying  but my life now  my whole life apart from anything that can happen to me  every minute of it is no more meaningless  as it was before  but it has the positive meaning of goodness  which i have the power to put into it
