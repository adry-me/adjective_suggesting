early in the year 1806 nicholas rostov returned home on leave
denisov was going home to voronezh and rostov persuaded him to travel with him as far as moscow and to stay with him there
meeting a comrade at the last post station but one before moscow  denisov had drunk three bottles of wine with him and  despite the jolting ruts across the snow covered road  did not once wake up on the way to moscow  but lay at the bottom of the sleigh beside rostov  who grew more and more impatient the nearer they got to moscow  how much longer  how much longer  oh  these insufferable streets  shops  bakers' signboards  street lamps  and sleighs   thought rostov  when their leave permits had been passed at the town gate and they had entered moscow
 denisov  we're here  he's asleep   he added  leaning forward with his whole body as if in that position he hoped to hasten the speed of the sleigh
denisov gave no answer
 there's the corner at the crossroads  where the cabman  zakhar  has his stand  and there's zakhar himself and still the same horse  and here's the little shop where we used to buy gingerbread  can't you hurry up  now then    which house is it   asked the driver  why  that one  right at the end  the big one
don't you see  that's our house   said rostov
 of course  it's our house  denisov  denisov  we're almost there   denisov raised his head  coughed  and made no answer
 dmitri   said rostov to his valet on the box   those lights are in our house  aren't they    yes  sir  and there's a light in your father's study    then they've not gone to bed yet  what do you think  mind now  don't forget to put out my new coat   added rostov  fingering his new mustache
 now then  get on   he shouted to the driver
 do wake up  vaska   he went on  turning to denisov  whose head was again nodding
 come  get on  you shall have three rubles for vodka get on   rostov shouted  when the sleigh was only three houses from his door
it seemed to him the horses were not moving at all
at last the sleigh bore to the right  drew up at an entrance  and rostov saw overhead the old familiar cornice with a bit of plaster broken off  the porch  and the post by the side of the pavement
he sprang out before the sleigh stopped  and ran into the hall
the house stood cold and silent  as if quite regardless of who had come to it
there was no one in the hall
 oh god  is everyone all right   he thought  stopping for a moment with a sinking heart  and then immediately starting to run along the hall and up the warped steps of the familiar staircase
the well known old door handle  which always angered the countess when it was not properly cleaned  turned as loosely as ever
a solitary tallow candle burned in the anteroom
old michael was asleep on the chest
prokofy  the footman  who was so strong that he could lift the back of the carriage from behind  sat plaiting slippers out of cloth selvedges
he looked up at the opening door and his expression of sleepy indifference suddenly changed to one of delighted amazement
 gracious heavens  the young count   he cried  recognizing his young master
 can it be  my treasure   and prokofy  trembling with excitement  rushed toward the drawing room door  probably in order to announce him  but  changing his mind  came back and stooped to kiss the young man's shoulder
 all well   asked rostov  drawing away his arm
 yes  god be thanked  yes  they've just finished supper
let me have a look at you  your excellency    is everything quite all right    the lord be thanked  yes   rostov  who had completely forgotten denisov  not wishing anyone to forestall him  threw off his fur coat and ran on tiptoe through the large dark ballroom
all was the same  there were the same old card tables and the same chandelier with a cover over it  but someone had already seen the young master  and  before he had reached the drawing room  something flew out from a side door like a tornado and began hugging and kissing him
another and yet another creature of the same kind sprang from a second door and a third  more hugging  more kissing  more outcries  and tears of joy
he could not distinguish which was papa  which natasha  and which petya
everyone shouted  talked  and kissed him at the same time
only his mother was not there  he noticed that
 and i did not know  
nicholas  
my darling       here he is  
our own  
kolya  * dear fellow  
how he has changed   
where are the candles   
tea      * nicholas
 and me  kiss me    dearest  
and me   sonya  natasha  petya  anna mikhaylovna  vera  and the old count were all hugging him  and the serfs  men and maids  flocked into the room  exclaiming and oh ing and ah ing
petya  clinging to his legs  kept shouting   and me too   natasha  after she had pulled him down toward her and covered his face with kisses  holding him tight by the skirt of his coat  sprang away and pranced up and down in one place like a goat and shrieked piercingly
all around were loving eyes glistening with tears of joy  and all around were lips seeking a kiss
sonya too  all rosy red  clung to his arm and  radiant with bliss  looked eagerly toward his eyes  waiting for the look for which she longed
sonya now was sixteen and she was very pretty  especially at this moment of happy  rapturous excitement
she gazed at him  not taking her eyes off him  and smiling and holding her breath
he gave her a grateful look  but was still expectant and looking for someone
the old countess had not yet come
but now steps were heard at the door  steps so rapid that they could hardly be his mother's
yet it was she  dressed in a new gown which he did not know  made since he had left
all the others let him go  and he ran to her
when they met  she fell on his breast  sobbing
she could not lift her face  but only pressed it to the cold braiding of his hussar's jacket
denisov  who had come into the room unnoticed by anyone  stood there and wiped his eyes at the sight
 vasili denisov  your son's friend   he said  introducing himself to the count  who was looking inquiringly at him  you are most welcome  i know  i know   said the count  kissing and embracing denisov
 nicholas wrote us  
natasha  vera  look  here is denisov   the same happy  rapturous faces turned to the shaggy figure of denisov
 darling denisov   screamed natasha  beside herself with rapture  springing to him  putting her arms round him  and kissing him this escapade made everybody feel confused
denisov blushed too  but smiled and  taking natasha's hand  kissed it
denisov was shown to the room prepared for him  and the rostovs all gathered round nicholas in the sitting room
the old countess  not letting go of his hand and kissing it every moment  sat beside him  the rest  crowding round him  watched every movement  word  or look of his  never taking their blissfully adoring eyes off him
his brother and sisters struggled for the places nearest to him and disputed with one another who should bring him his tea  handkerchief  and pipe
rostov was very happy in the love they showed him  but the first moment of meeting had been so beatific that his present joy seemed insufficient  and he kept expecting something more  more and yet more
next morning  after the fatigues of their journey  the travelers slept till ten o'clock
in the room next their bedroom there was a confusion of sabers  satchels  sabretaches  open portmanteaus  and dirty boots
two freshly cleaned pairs with spurs had just been placed by the wall
the servants were bringing in jugs and basins  hot water for shaving  and their well brushed clothes
there was a masculine odor and a smell of tobacco
 hallo  gwiska my pipe   came vasili denisov's husky voice
 wostov  get up   rostov  rubbing his eyes that seemed glued together  raised his disheveled head from the hot pillow
 why  is it late    late  it's nearly ten o'clock   answered natasha's voice
a rustle of starched petticoats and the whispering and laughter of girls' voices came from the adjoining room
the door was opened a crack and there was a glimpse of something blue  of ribbons  black hair  and merry faces
it was natasha  sonya  and petya  who had come to see whether they were getting up
 nicholas  get up   natasha's voice was again heard at the door
 directly   meanwhile  petya  having found and seized the sabers in the outer room  with the delight boys feel at the sight of a military elder brother  and forgetting that it was unbecoming for the girls to see men undressed  opened the bedroom door
 is this your saber   he shouted
the girls sprang aside
denisov hid his hairy legs under the blanket  looking with a scared face at his comrade for help the door  having let petya in  closed again
a sound of laughter came from behind it
 nicholas  come out in your dressing gown   said natasha's voice
 is this your saber   asked petya
 or is it yours   he said  addressing the black mustached denisov with servile deference
rostov hurriedly put something on his feet  drew on his dressing gown  and went out
natasha had put on one spurred boot and was just getting her foot into the other
sonya  when he came in  was twirling round and was about to expand her dresses into a balloon and sit down
they were dressed alike  in new pale blue frocks  and were both fresh  rosy  and bright
sonya ran away  but natasha  taking her brother's arm  led him into the sitting room  where they began talking
they hardly gave one another time to ask questions and give replies concerning a thousand little matters which could not interest anyone but themselves natasha laughed at every word he said or that she said herself  not because what they were saying was amusing  but because she felt happy and was unable to control her joy which expressed itself by laughter
 oh  how nice  how splendid   she said to everything
rostov felt that  under the influence of the warm rays of love  that childlike smile which had not once appeared on his face since he left home now for the first time after eighteen months again brightened his soul and his face
 no  but listen   she said   now you are quite a man  aren't you  i'm awfully glad you're my brother   she touched his mustache
 i want to know what you men are like
are you the same as we  no    why did sonya run away   asked rostov
 ah  yes  that's a whole long story  how are you going to speak to her thou or you    as may happen   said rostov
 no  call her you  please  i'll tell you all about it some other time
no  i'll tell you now
you know sonya's my dearest friend
such a friend that i burned my arm for her sake
look here   she pulled up her muslin sleeve and showed him a red scar on her long  slender  delicate arm  high above the elbow on that part that is covered even by a ball dress
 i burned this to prove my love for her
i just heated a ruler in the fire and pressed it there   sitting on the sofa with the little cushions on its arms  in what used to be his old schoolroom  and looking into natasha's wildly bright eyes  rostov reentered that world of home and childhood which had no meaning for anyone else  but gave him some of the best joys of his life  and the burning of an arm with a ruler as a proof of love did not seem to him senseless  he understood and was not surprised at it  well  and is that all   he asked
 we are such friends  such friends  all that ruler business was just nonsense  but we are friends forever
she  if she loves anyone  does it for life  but i don't understand that  i forget quickly    well  what then    well  she loves me and you like that   natasha suddenly flushed
 why  you remember before you went away   
well  she says you are to forget all that   
she says  'i shall love him always  but let him be free ' isn't that lovely and noble  yes  very noble  isn't it   asked natasha  so seriously and excitedly that it was evident that what she was now saying she had talked of before  with tears
rostov became thoughtful
 i never go back on my word   he said
 besides  sonya is so charming that only a fool would renounce such happiness    no  no   cried natasha   she and i have already talked it over
we knew you'd say so
but it won't do  because you see  if you say that if you consider yourself bound by your promise it will seem as if she had not meant it seriously
it makes it as if you were marrying her because you must  and that wouldn't do at all   rostov saw that it had been well considered by them
sonya had already struck him by her beauty on the preceding day
today  when he had caught a glimpse of her  she seemed still more lovely
she was a charming girl of sixteen  evidently passionately in love with him  he did not doubt that for an instant 
why should he not love her now  and even marry her  rostov thought  but just now there were so many other pleasures and interests before him   yes  they have taken a wise decision   he thought   i must remain free    well then  that's excellent   said he
 we'll talk it over later on
oh  how glad i am to have you    well  and are you still true to boris   he continued
 oh  what nonsense   cried natasha  laughing
 i don't think about him or anyone else  and i don't want anything of the kind    dear me  then what are you up to now    now   repeated natasha  and a happy smile lit up her face
 have you seen duport    no    not seen duport the famous dancer  well then  you won't understand
that's what i'm up to   curving her arms  natasha held out her skirts as dancers do  ran back a few steps  turned  cut a caper  brought her little feet sharply together  and made some steps on the very tips of her toes  see  i'm standing  see   she said  but could not maintain herself on her toes any longer
 so that's what i'm up to  i'll never marry anyone  but will be a dancer
only don't tell anyone   rostov laughed so loud and merrily that denisov  in his bedroom  felt envious and natasha could not help joining in
 no  but don't you think it's nice   she kept repeating
 nice  and so you no longer wish to marry boris   natasha flared up
 i don't want to marry anyone
and i'll tell him so when i see him    dear me   said rostov
 but that's all rubbish   natasha chattered on
 and is denisov nice   she asked
 yes  indeed    oh  well then  good by  go and dress
is he very terrible  denisov    why terrible   asked nicholas
 no  vaska is a splendid fellow    you call him vaska  that's funny  and is he very nice    very    well then  be quick
we'll all have breakfast together   and natasha rose and went out of the room on tiptoe  like a ballet dancer  but smiling as only happy girls of fifteen can smile
when rostov met sonya in the drawing room  he reddened
he did not know how to behave with her
the evening before  in the first happy moment of meeting  they had kissed each other  but today they felt it could not be done  he felt that everybody  including his mother and sisters  was looking inquiringly at him and watching to see how he would behave with her
he kissed her hand and addressed her not as thou but as you sonya
but their eyes met and said thou  and exchanged tender kisses
her looks asked him to forgive her for having dared  by natasha's intermediacy  to remind him of his promise  and then thanked him for his love
his looks thanked her for offering him his freedom and told her that one way or another he would never cease to love her  for that would be impossible
 how strange it is   said vera  selecting a moment when all were silent   that sonya and nicholas now say you to one another and meet like strangers   vera's remark was correct  as her remarks always were  but  like most of her observations  it made everyone feel uncomfortable  not only sonya  nicholas  and natasha  but even the old countess  who dreading this love affair which might hinder nicholas from making a brilliant match blushed like a girl
denisov  to rostov's surprise  appeared in the drawing room with pomaded hair  perfumed  and in a new uniform  looking just as smart as he made himself when going into battle  and he was more amiable to the ladies and gentlemen than rostov had ever expected to see him on his return to moscow from the army  nicholas rostov was welcomed by his home circle as the best of sons  a hero  and their darling nikolenka  by his relations as a charming  attractive  and polite young man  by his acquaintances as a handsome lieutenant of hussars  a good dancer  and one of the best matches in the city
the rostovs knew everybody in moscow
the old count had money enough that year  as all his estates had been remortgaged  and so nicholas  acquiring a trotter of his own  very stylish riding breeches of the latest cut  such as no one else yet had in moscow  and boots of the latest fashion  with extremely pointed toes and small silver spurs  passed his time very gaily
after a short period of adapting himself to the old conditions of life  nicholas found it very pleasant to be at home again he felt that he had grown up and matured very much
his despair at failing in a scripture examination  his borrowing money from gavril to pay a sleigh driver  his kissing sonya on the sly he now recalled all this as childishness he had left immeasurably behind
now he was a lieutenant of hussars  in a jacket laced with silver  and wearing the cross of st
george  awarded to soldiers for bravery in action  and in the company of well known  elderly  and respected racing men was training a trotter of his own for a race
he knew a lady on one of the boulevards whom he visited of an evening
he led the mazurka at the arkharovs' ball  talked about the war with field marshal kamenski  visited the english club  and was on intimate terms with a colonel of forty to whom denisov had introduced him his passion for the emperor had cooled somewhat in moscow
but still  as he did not see him and had no opportunity of seeing him  he often spoke about him and about his love for him  letting it be understood that he had not told all and that there was something in his feelings for the emperor not everyone could understand  and with his whole soul he shared the adoration then common in moscow for the emperor  who was spoken of as the  angel incarnate   during rostov's short stay in moscow  before rejoining the army  he did not draw closer to sonya  but rather drifted away from her
she was very pretty and sweet  and evidently deeply in love with him  but he was at the period of youth when there seems so much to do that there is no time for that sort of thing and a young man fears to bind himself and prizes his freedom which he needs for so many other things when he thought of sonya  during this stay in moscow  he said to himself   ah  there will be  and there are  many more such girls somewhere whom i do not yet know there will be time enough to think about love when i want to  but now i have no time   besides  it seemed to him that the society of women was rather derogatory to his manhood
he went to balls and into ladies' society with an affectation of doing so against his will
the races  the english club  sprees with denisov  and visits to a certain house  that was another matter and quite the thing for a dashing young hussar  at the beginning of march  old count ilya rostov was very busy arranging a dinner in honor of prince bagration at the english club
the count walked up and down the hall in his dressing gown  giving orders to the club steward and to the famous feoktist  the club's head cook  about asparagus  fresh cucumbers  strawberries  veal  and fish for this dinner
the count had been a member and on the committee of the club from the day it was founded
to him the club entrusted the arrangement of the festival in honor of bagration  for few men knew so well how to arrange a feast on an open handed  hospitable scale  and still fewer men would be so well able and willing to make up out of their own resources what might be needed for the success of the fete
the club cook and the steward listened to the count's orders with pleased faces  for they knew that under no other management could they so easily extract a good profit for themselves from a dinner costing several thousand rubles  well then  mind and have cocks' comb in the turtle soup  you know    shall we have three cold dishes then   asked the cook
the count considered
 we can't have less yes  three  
the mayonnaise  that's one   said he  bending down a finger
 then am i to order those large sterlets   asked the steward
 yes  it can't be helped if they won't take less
ah  dear me  i was forgetting
we must have another entree
ah  goodness gracious   he clutched at his head
 who is going to get me the flowers  dmitri  eh  dmitri  gallop off to our moscow estate   he said to the factotum who appeared at his call
 hurry off and tell maksim  the gardener  to set the serfs to work
say that everything out of the hothouses must be brought here well wrapped up in felt
i must have two hundred pots here on friday   having given several more orders  he was about to go to his  little countess  to have a rest  but remembering something else of importance  he returned again  called back the cook and the club steward  and again began giving orders
a light footstep and the clinking of spurs were heard at the door  and the young count  handsome  rosy  with a dark little mustache  evidently rested and made sleeker by his easy life in moscow  entered the room
 ah  my boy  my head's in a whirl   said the old man with a smile  as if he felt a little confused before his son
 now  if you would only help a bit  i must have singers too
i shall have my own orchestra  but shouldn't we get the gypsy singers as well  you military men like that sort of thing    really  papa  i believe prince bagration worried himself less before the battle of schon grabern than you do now   said his son with a smile the old count pretended to be angry
 yes  you talk  but try it yourself   and the count turned to the cook  who  with a shrewd and respectful expression  looked observantly and sympathetically at the father and son
 what have the young people come to nowadays  eh  feoktist   said he
 laughing at us old fellows    that's so  your excellency  all they have to do is to eat a good dinner  but providing it and serving it all up  that's not their business    that's it  that's it   exclaimed the count  and gaily seizing his son by both hands  he cried   now i've got you  so take the sleigh and pair at once  and go to bezukhov's  and tell him 'count ilya has sent you to ask for strawberries and fresh pineapples ' we can't get them from anyone else
he's not there himself  so you'll have to go in and ask the princesses  and from there go on to the rasgulyay the coachman ipatka knows and look up the gypsy ilyushka  the one who danced at count orlov's  you remember  in a white cossack coat  and bring him along to me    and am i to bring the gypsy girls along with him   asked nicholas  laughing  dear  dear      at that moment  with noiseless footsteps and with the businesslike  preoccupied  yet meekly christian look which never left her face  anna mikhaylovna entered the hall
though she came upon the count in his dressing gown every day  he invariably became confused and begged her to excuse his costume
 no matter at all  my dear count   she said  meekly closing her eyes
 but i'll go to bezukhov's myself
pierre has arrived  and now we shall get anything we want from his hothouses
i have to see him in any case
he has forwarded me a letter from boris
thank god  boris is now on the staff   the count was delighted at anna mikhaylovna's taking upon herself one of his commissions and ordered the small closed carriage for her
 tell bezukhov to come
i'll put his name down
is his wife with him   he asked
anna mikhaylovna turned up her eyes  and profound sadness was depicted on her face
 ah  my dear friend  he is very unfortunate   she said
 if what we hear is true  it is dreadful
how little we dreamed of such a thing when we were rejoicing at his happiness  and such a lofty angelic soul as young bezukhov  yes  i pity him from my heart  and shall try to give him what consolation i can    wh what is the matter   asked both the young and old rostov
anna mikhaylovna sighed deeply
 dolokhov  mary ivanovna's son   she said in a mysterious whisper   has compromised her completely  they say
pierre took him up  invited him to his house in petersburg  and now  
she has come here and that daredevil after her   said anna mikhaylovna  wishing to show her sympathy for pierre  but by involuntary intonations and a half smile betraying her sympathy for the  daredevil   as she called dolokhov
 they say pierre is quite broken by his misfortune    dear  dear  but still tell him to come to the club it will all blow over
it will be a tremendous banquet   next day  the third of march  soon after one o'clock  two hundred and fifty members of the english club and fifty guests were awaiting the guest of honor and hero of the austrian campaign  prince bagration  to dinner
on the first arrival of the news of the battle of austerlitz  moscow had been bewildered
at that time  the russians were so used to victories that on receiving news of the defeat some would simply not believe it  while others sought some extraordinary explanation of so strange an event
in the english club  where all who were distinguished  important  and well informed foregathered when the news began to arrive in december  nothing was said about the war and the last battle  as though all were in a conspiracy of silence
the men who set the tone in conversation count rostopchin  prince yuri dolgorukov  valuev  count markov  and prince vyazemski did not show themselves at the club  but met in private houses in intimate circles  and the moscovites who took their opinions from others ilya rostov among them  remained for a while without any definite opinion on the subject of the war and without leaders the moscovites felt that something was wrong and that to discuss the bad news was difficult  and so it was best to be silent
but after a while  just as a jury comes out of its room  the bigwigs who guided the club's opinion reappeared  and everybody began speaking clearly and definitely
reasons were found for the incredible  unheard of  and impossible event of a russian defeat  everything became clear  and in all corners of moscow the same things began to be said
these reasons were the treachery of the austrians  a defective commissariat  the treachery of the pole przebyszewski and of the frenchman langeron  kutuzov's incapacity  and  it was whispered  the youth and inexperience of the sovereign  who had trusted worthless and insignificant people
but the army  the russian army  everyone declared  was extraordinary and had achieved miracles of valor
the soldiers  officers  and generals were heroes
but the hero of heroes was prince bagration  distinguished by his schon grabern affair and by the retreat from austerlitz  where he alone had withdrawn his column unbroken and had all day beaten back an enemy force twice as numerous as his own
what also conduced to bagration's being selected as moscow's hero was the fact that he had no connections in the city and was a stranger there
in his person  honor was shown to a simple fighting russian soldier without connections and intrigues  and to one who was associated by memories of the italian campaign with the name of suvorov
moreover  paying such honor to bagration was the best way of expressing disapproval and dislike of kutuzov
 had there been no bagration  it would have been necessary to invent him   said the wit shinshin  parodying the words of voltaire
kutuzov no one spoke of  except some who abused him in whispers  calling him a court weathercock and an old satyr
all moscow repeated prince dolgorukov's saying   if you go on modeling and modeling you must get smeared with clay   suggesting consolation for our defeat by the memory of former victories  and the words of rostopchin  that french soldiers have to be incited to battle by highfalutin words  and germans by logical arguments to show them that it is more dangerous to run away than to advance  but that russian soldiers only need to be restrained and held back  on all sides  new and fresh anecdotes were heard of individual examples of heroism shown by our officers and men at austerlitz
one had saved a standard  another had killed five frenchmen  a third had loaded five cannon singlehanded
berg was mentioned  by those who did not know him  as having  when wounded in the right hand  taken his sword in the left  and gone forward
of bolkonski  nothing was said  and only those who knew him intimately regretted that he had died so young  leaving a pregnant wife with his eccentric father
on that third of march  all the rooms in the english club were filled with a hum of conversation  like the hum of bees swarming in springtime the members and guests of the club wandered hither and thither  sat  stood  met  and separated  some in uniform and some in evening dress  and a few here and there with powdered hair and in russian kaftans
powdered footmen  in livery with buckled shoes and smart stockings  stood at every door anxiously noting visitors' every movement in order to offer their services
most of those present were elderly  respected men with broad  self confident faces  fat fingers  and resolute gestures and voices
this class of guests and members sat in certain habitual places and met in certain habitual groups
a minority of those present were casual guests chiefly young men  among whom were denisov  rostov  and dolokhov who was now again an officer in the semenov regiment
the faces of these young people  especially those who were military men  bore that expression of condescending respect for their elders which seems to say to the older generation   we are prepared to respect and honor you  but all the same remember that the future belongs to us   nesvitski was there as an old member of the club pierre  who at his wife's command had let his hair grow and abandoned his spectacles  went about the rooms fashionably dressed but looking sad and dull here  as elsewhere  he was surrounded by an atmosphere of subservience to his wealth  and being in the habit of lording it over these people  he treated them with absent minded contempt
by his age he should have belonged to the younger men  but by his wealth and connections he belonged to the groups of old and honored guests  and so he went from one group to another
some of the most important old men were the center of groups which even strangers approached respectfully to hear the voices of well known men
the largest circles formed round count rostopchin  valuev  and naryshkin
rostopchin was describing how the russians had been overwhelmed by flying austrians and had had to force their way through them with bayonets
valuev was confidentially telling that uvarov had been sent from petersburg to ascertain what moscow was thinking about austerlitz
in the third circle  naryshkin was speaking of the meeting of the austrian council of war at which suvorov crowed like a cock in reply to the nonsense talked by the austrian generals
shinshin  standing close by  tried to make a joke  saying that kutuzov had evidently failed to learn from suvorov even so simple a thing as the art of crowing like a cock  but the elder members glanced severely at the wit  making him feel that in that place and on that day  it was improper to speak so of kutuzov
count ilya rostov  hurried and preoccupied  went about in his soft boots between the dining and drawing rooms  hastily greeting the important and unimportant  all of whom he knew  as if they were all equals  while his eyes occasionally sought out his fine well set up young son  resting on him and winking joyfully at him young rostov stood at a window with dolokhov  whose acquaintance he had lately made and highly valued
the old count came up to them and pressed dolokhov's hand
 please come and visit us  
you know my brave boy  
been together out there  
both playing the hero  
ah  vasili ignatovich  
how d'ye do  old fellow   he said  turning to an old man who was passing  but before he had finished his greeting there was a general stir  and a footman who had run in announced  with a frightened face   he's arrived   bells rang  the stewards rushed forward  and like rye shaken together in a shovel the guests who had been scattered about in different rooms came together and crowded in the large drawing room by the door of the ballroom bagration appeared in the doorway of the anteroom without hat or sword  which  in accord with the club custom  he had given up to the hall porter
he had no lambskin cap on his head  nor had he a loaded whip over his shoulder  as when rostov had seen him on the eve of the battle of austerlitz  but wore a tight new uniform with russian and foreign orders  and the star of st
george on his left breast
evidently just before coming to the dinner he had had his hair and whiskers trimmed  which changed his appearance for the worse
there was something naively festive in his air  which  in conjunction with his firm and virile features  gave him a rather comical expression
bekleshev and theodore uvarov  who had arrived with him  paused at the doorway to allow him  as the guest of honor  to enter first
bagration was embarrassed  not wishing to avail himself of their courtesy  and this caused some delay at the doors  but after all he did at last enter first he walked shyly and awkwardly over the parquet floor of the reception room  not knowing what to do with his hands  he was more accustomed to walk over a plowed field under fire  as he had done at the head of the kursk regiment at schon grabern and he would have found that easier
the committeemen met him at the first door and  expressing their delight at seeing such a highly honored guest  took possession of him as it were  without waiting for his reply  surrounded him  and led him to the drawing room
it was at first impossible to enter the drawing room door for the crowd of members and guests jostling one another and trying to get a good look at bagration over each other's shoulders  as if he were some rare animal
count ilya rostov  laughing and repeating the words   make way  dear boy  make way  make way   pushed through the crowd more energetically than anyone  led the guests into the drawing room  and seated them on the center sofa
the bigwigs  the most respected members of the club  beset the new arrivals
count ilya  again thrusting his way through the crowd  went out of the drawing room and reappeared a minute later with another committeeman  carrying a large silver salver which he presented to prince bagration
on the salver lay some verses composed and printed in the hero's honor
bagration  on seeing the salver  glanced around in dismay  as though seeking help
but all eyes demanded that he should submit
feeling himself in their power  he resolutely took the salver with both hands and looked sternly and reproachfully at the count who had presented it to him someone obligingly took the dish from bagration  or he would  it seemed  have held it till evening and have gone in to dinner with it  and drew his attention to the verses
 well  i will read them  then   bagration seemed to say  and  fixing his weary eyes on the paper  began to read them with a fixed and serious expression
but the author himself took the verses and began reading them aloud bagration bowed his head and listened  bring glory then to alexander's reign and on the throne our titus shield
a dreaded foe be thou  kindhearted as a man  a rhipheus at home  a caesar in the field  e'en fortunate napoleon knows by experience  now  bagration  and dare not herculean russians trouble  
but before he had finished reading  a stentorian major domo announced that dinner was ready  the door opened  and from the dining room came the resounding strains of the polonaise  conquest's joyful thunder waken  triumph  valiant russians  now   
and count rostov  glancing angrily at the author who went on reading his verses  bowed to bagration
everyone rose  feeling that dinner was more important than verses  and bagration  again preceding all the rest  went in to dinner
he was seated in the place of honor between two alexanders  bekleshev and naryshkin which was a significant allusion to the name of the sovereign
three hundred persons took their seats in the dining room  according to their rank and importance  the more important nearer to the honored guest  as naturally as water flows deepest where the land lies lowest
just before dinner  count ilya rostov presented his son to bagration  who recognized him and said a few words to him  disjointed and awkward  as were all the words he spoke that day  and count ilya looked joyfully and proudly around while bagration spoke to his son
nicholas rostov  with denisov and his new acquaintance  dolokhov  sat almost at the middle of the table
facing them sat pierre  beside prince nesvitski
count ilya rostov with the other members of the committee sat facing bagration and  as the very personification of moscow hospitality  did the honors to the prince
his efforts had not been in vain
the dinner  both the lenten and the other fare  was splendid  yet he could not feel quite at ease till the end of the meal
he winked at the butler  whispered directions to the footmen  and awaited each expected dish with some anxiety
everything was excellent
with the second course  a gigantic sterlet  at sight of which ilya rostov blushed with self conscious pleasure   the footmen began popping corks and filling the champagne glasses
after the fish  which made a certain sensation  the count exchanged glances with the other committeemen
 there will be many toasts  it's time to begin   he whispered  and taking up his glass  he rose
all were silent  waiting for what he would say
 to the health of our sovereign  the emperor   he cried  and at the same moment his kindly eyes grew moist with tears of joy and enthusiasm
the band immediately struck up  conquest's joyful thunder waken     all rose and cried  hurrah   bagration also rose and shouted  hurrah   in exactly the same voice in which he had shouted it on the field at schon grabern
young rostov's ecstatic voice could be heard above the three hundred others
he nearly wept
 to the health of our sovereign  the emperor   he roared   hurrah   and emptying his glass at one gulp he dashed it to the floor
many followed his example  and the loud shouting continued for a long time
when the voices subsided  the footmen cleared away the broken glass and everybody sat down again  smiling at the noise they had made and exchanging remarks
the old count rose once more  glanced at a note lying beside his plate  and proposed a toast   to the health of the hero of our last campaign  prince peter ivanovich bagration   and again his blue eyes grew moist
 hurrah   cried the three hundred voices again  but instead of the band a choir began singing a cantata composed by paul ivanovich kutuzov  russians  o'er all barriers on  courage conquest guarantees  have we not bagration  he brings foe men to their knees   
etc as soon as the singing was over  another and another toast was proposed and count ilya rostov became more and more moved  more glass was smashed  and the shouting grew louder
they drank to bekleshev  naryshkin  uvarov  dolgorukov  apraksin  valuev  to the committee  to all the club members and to all the club guests  and finally to count ilya rostov separately  as the organizer of the banquet
at that toast  the count took out his handkerchief and  covering his face  wept outright
pierre sat opposite dolokhov and nicholas rostov
as usual  he ate and drank much  and eagerly
but those who knew him intimately noticed that some great change had come over him that day
he was silent all through dinner and looked about  blinking and scowling  or  with fixed eyes and a look of complete absent mindedness  kept rubbing the bridge of his nose
his face was depressed and gloomy
he seemed to see and hear nothing of what was going on around him and to be absorbed by some depressing and unsolved problem
the unsolved problem that tormented him was caused by hints given by the princess  his cousin  at moscow  concerning dolokhov's intimacy with his wife  and by an anonymous letter he had received that morning  which in the mean jocular way common to anonymous letters said that he saw badly through his spectacles  but that his wife's connection with dolokhov was a secret to no one but himself pierre absolutely disbelieved both the princess' hints and the letter  but he feared now to look at dolokhov  who was sitting opposite him
every time he chanced to meet dolokhov's handsome insolent eyes  pierre felt something terrible and monstrous rising in his soul and turned quickly away
involuntarily recalling his wife's past and her relations with dolokhov  pierre saw clearly that what was said in the letter might be true  or might at least seem to be true had it not referred to his wife
he involuntarily remembered how dolokhov  who had fully recovered his former position after the campaign  had returned to petersburg and come to him
availing himself of his friendly relations with pierre as a boon companion  dolokhov had come straight to his house  and pierre had put him up and lent him money pierre recalled how helene had smilingly expressed disapproval of dolokhov's living at their house  and how cynically dolokhov had praised his wife's beauty to him and from that time till they came to moscow had not left them for a day
 yes  he is very handsome   thought pierre   and i know him
it would be particularly pleasant to him to dishonor my name and ridicule me  just because i have exerted myself on his behalf  befriended him  and helped him
i know and understand what a spice that would add to the pleasure of deceiving me  if it really were true
yes  if it were true  but i do not believe it
i have no right to  and can't  believe it   he remembered the expression dolokhov's face assumed in his moments of cruelty  as when tying the policeman to the bear and dropping them into the water  or when he challenged a man to a duel without any reason  or shot a post boy's horse with a pistol
that expression was often on dolokhov's face when looking at him
 yes  he is a bully   thought pierre   to kill a man means nothing to him
it must seem to him that everyone is afraid of him  and that must please him
he must think that i  too  am afraid of him and in fact i am afraid of him   he thought  and again he felt something terrible and monstrous rising in his soul
dolokhov  denisov  and rostov were now sitting opposite pierre and seemed very gay
rostov was talking merrily to his two friends  one of whom was a dashing hussar and the other a notorious duelist and rake  and every now and then he glanced ironically at pierre  whose preoccupied  absent minded  and massive figure was a very noticeable one at the dinner
rostov looked inimically at pierre  first because pierre appeared to his hussar eyes as a rich civilian  the husband of a beauty  and in a word an old woman  and secondly because pierre in his preoccupation and absent mindedness had not recognized rostov and had not responded to his greeting
when the emperor's health was drunk  pierre  lost in thought  did not rise or lift his glass
 what are you about   shouted rostov  looking at him in an ecstasy of exasperation
 don't you hear it's his majesty the emperor's health   pierre sighed  rose submissively  emptied his glass  and  waiting till all were seated again  turned with his kindly smile to rostov
 why  i didn't recognize you   he said
but rostov was otherwise engaged  he was shouting  hurrah    why don't you renew the acquaintance   said dolokhov to rostov
 confound him  he's a fool   said rostov
 one should make up to the husbands of pretty women   said denisov
pierre did not catch what they were saying  but knew they were talking about him
he reddened and turned away
 well  now to the health of handsome women   said dolokhov  and with a serious expression  but with a smile lurking at the corners of his mouth  he turned with his glass to pierre
 here's to the health of lovely women  peterkin and their lovers   he added
pierre  with downcast eyes  drank out of his glass without looking at dolokhov or answering him
the footman  who was distributing leaflets with kutuzov's cantata  laid one before pierre as one of the principal guests
he was just going to take it when dolokhov  leaning across  snatched it from his hand and began reading it
pierre looked at dolokhov and his eyes dropped  the something terrible and monstrous that had tormented him all dinnertime rose and took possession of him
he leaned his whole massive body across the table
 how dare you take it   he shouted
hearing that cry and seeing to whom it was addressed  nesvitski and the neighbor on his right quickly turned in alarm to bezukhov
 don't  don't  what are you about   whispered their frightened voices
dolokhov looked at pierre with clear  mirthful  cruel eyes  and that smile of his which seemed to say   ah  this is what i like    you shan't have it   he said distinctly
pale  with quivering lips  pierre snatched the copy
 you     you  
scoundrel  i challenge you   he ejaculated  and  pushing back his chair  he rose from the table
at the very instant he did this and uttered those words  pierre felt that the question of his wife's guilt which had been tormenting him the whole day was finally and indubitably answered in the affirmative
he hated her and was forever sundered from her
despite denisov's request that he would take no part in the matter  rostov agreed to be dolokhov's second  and after dinner he discussed the arrangements for the duel with nesvitski  bezukhov's second
pierre went home  but rostov with dolokhov and denisov stayed on at the club till late  listening to the gypsies and other singers
 well then  till tomorrow at sokolniki   said dolokhov  as he took leave of rostov in the club porch
 and do you feel quite calm   rostov asked
dolokhov paused
 well  you see  i'll tell you the whole secret of dueling in two words
if you are going to fight a duel  and you make a will and write affectionate letters to your parents  and if you think you may be killed  you are a fool and are lost for certain
but go with the firm intention of killing your man as quickly and surely as possible  and then all will be right  as our bear huntsman at kostroma used to tell me
'everyone fears a bear ' he says  'but when you see one your fear's all gone  and your only thought is not to let him get away ' and that's how it is with me
a demain  mon cher   * * till tomorrow  my dear fellow
next day  at eight in the morning  pierre and nesvitski drove to the sokolniki forest and found dolokhov  denisov  and rostov already there
pierre had the air of a man preoccupied with considerations which had no connection with the matter in hand
his haggard face was yellow
he had evidently not slept that night
he looked about distractedly and screwed up his eyes as if dazzled by the sun
he was entirely absorbed by two considerations  his wife's guilt  of which after his sleepless night he had not the slightest doubt  and the guiltlessness of dolokhov  who had no reason to preserve the honor of a man who was nothing to him   
 i should perhaps have done the same thing in his place   thought pierre
 it's even certain that i should have done the same  then why this duel  this murder  either i shall kill him  or he will hit me in the head  or elbow  or knee
can't i go away from here  run away  bury myself somewhere   passed through his mind
but just at moments when such thoughts occurred to him  he would ask in a particularly calm and absentminded way  which inspired the respect of the onlookers   will it be long  are things ready   when all was ready  the sabers stuck in the snow to mark the barriers  and the pistols loaded  nesvitski went up to pierre
 i should not be doing my duty  count   he said in timid tones   and should not justify your confidence and the honor you have done me in choosing me for your second  if at this grave  this very grave  moment i did not tell you the whole truth
i think there is no sufficient ground for this affair  or for blood to be shed over it   
you were not right  not quite in the right  you were impetuous      oh yes  it is horribly stupid   said pierre
 then allow me to express your regrets  and i am sure your opponent will accept them   said nesvitski  who like the others concerned in the affair  and like everyone in similar cases  did not yet believe that the affair had come to an actual duel 
 you know  count  it is much more honorable to admit one's mistake than to let matters become irreparable
there was no insult on either side
allow me to convey       no  what is there to talk about   said pierre
 it's all the same   
is everything ready   he added
 only tell me where to go and where to shoot   he said with an unnaturally gentle smile
he took the pistol in his hand and began asking about the working of the trigger  as he had not before held a pistol in his hand a fact that he did not wish to confess
 oh yes  like that  i know  i only forgot   said he
 no apologies  none whatever   said dolokhov to denisov  who on his side had been attempting a reconciliation   and he also went up to the appointed place
the spot chosen for the duel was some eighty paces from the road  where the sleighs had been left  in a small clearing in the pine forest covered with melting snow  the frost having begun to break up during the last few days
the antagonists stood forty paces apart at the farther edge of the clearing
the seconds  measuring the paces  left tracks in the deep wet snow between the place where they had been standing and nesvitski's and dolokhov's sabers  which were stuck into the ground ten paces apart to mark the barrier
it was thawing and misty  at forty paces' distance nothing could be seen
for three minutes all had been ready  but they still delayed and all were silent
 well begin   said dolokhov
 all right   said pierre  still smiling in the same way
a feeling of dread was in the air
it was evident that the affair so lightly begun could no longer be averted but was taking its course independently of men's will
denisov first went to the barrier and announced   as the adve'sawies have wefused a weconciliation  please pwoceed
take your pistols  and at the word thwee begin to advance
 o ne  t wo  thwee   he shouted angrily and stepped aside
the combatants advanced along the trodden tracks  nearer and nearer to one another  beginning to see one another through the mist
they had the right to fire when they liked as they approached the barrier
dolokhov walked slowly without raising his pistol  looking intently with his bright  sparkling blue eyes into his antagonist's face
his mouth wore its usual semblance of a smile
 so i can fire when i like   said pierre  and at the word  three   he went quickly forward  missing the trodden path and stepping into the deep snow
he held the pistol in his right hand at arm's length  apparently afraid of shooting himself with it his left hand he held carefully back  because he wished to support his right hand with it and knew he must not do so
having advanced six paces and strayed off the track into the snow  pierre looked down at his feet  then quickly glanced at dolokhov and  bending his finger as he had been shown  fired
not at all expecting so loud a report  pierre shuddered at the sound and then  smiling at his own sensations  stood still
the smoke  rendered denser by the mist  prevented him from seeing anything for an instant  but there was no second report as he had expected
he only heard dolokhov's hurried steps  and his figure came in view through the smoke
he was pressing one hand to his left side  while the other clutched his drooping pistol
his face was pale
rostov ran toward him and said something
 no o o   muttered dolokhov through his teeth   no  it's not over   and after stumbling a few staggering steps right up to the saber  he sank on the snow beside it
his left hand was bloody  he wiped it on his coat and supported himself with it his frowning face was pallid and quivered
 plea     began dolokhov  but could not at first pronounce the word
 please   he uttered with an effort
pierre  hardly restraining his sobs  began running toward dolokhov and was about to cross the space between the barriers  when dolokhov cried   to your barrier   and pierre  grasping what was meant  stopped by his saber
only ten paces divided them
dolokhov lowered his head to the snow  greedily bit at it  again raised his head  adjusted himself  drew in his legs and sat up  seeking a firm center of gravity he sucked and swallowed the cold snow  his lips quivered but his eyes  still smiling  glittered with effort and exasperation as he mustered his remaining strength
he raised his pistol and aimed
 sideways  cover yourself with your pistol   ejaculated nesvitski
 cover yourself   even denisov cried to his adversary
pierre  with a gentle smile of pity and remorse  his arms and legs helplessly spread out  stood with his broad chest directly facing dolokhov looked sorrowfully at him denisov  rostov  and nesvitski closed their eyes
at the same instant they heard a report and dolokhov's angry cry
 missed   shouted dolokhov  and he lay helplessly  face downwards on the snow
pierre clutched his temples  and turning round went into the forest  trampling through the deep snow  and muttering incoherent words   folly  
folly  death  
lies     he repeated  puckering his face
nesvitski stopped him and took him home
rostov and denisov drove away with the wounded dolokhov
the latter lay silent in the sleigh with closed eyes and did not answer a word to the questions addressed to him
but on entering moscow he suddenly came to and  lifting his head with an effort  took rostov  who was sitting beside him  by the hand
rostov was struck by the totally altered and unexpectedly rapturous and tender expression on dolokhov's face
 well  how do you feel   he asked
 bad  but it's not that  my friend   said dolokhov with a gasping voice
 where are we  in moscow  i know
i don't matter  but i have killed her  killed  
she won't get over it  she won't survive       who   asked rostov
 my mother  my mother  my angel  my adored angel mother   and dolokhov pressed rostov's hand and burst into tears
when he had become a little quieter  he explained to rostov that he was living with his mother  who  if she saw him dying  would not survive it
he implored rostov to go on and prepare her
rostov went on ahead to do what was asked  and to his great surprise learned that dolokhov the brawler  dolokhov the bully  lived in moscow with an old mother and a hunchback sister  and was the most affectionate of sons and brothers
pierre had of late rarely seen his wife alone
both in petersburg and in moscow their house was always full of visitors
the night after the duel he did not go to his bedroom but  as he often did  remained in his father's room  that huge room in which count bezukhov had died
he lay down on the sofa meaning to fall asleep and forget all that had happened to him  but could not do so
such a storm of feelings  thoughts  and memories suddenly arose within him that he could not fall asleep  nor even remain in one place  but had to jump up and pace the room with rapid steps
now he seemed to see her in the early days of their marriage  with bare shoulders and a languid  passionate look on her face  and then immediately he saw beside her dolokhov's handsome  insolent  hard  and mocking face as he had seen it at the banquet  and then that same face pale  quivering  and suffering  as it had been when he reeled and sank on the snow
 what has happened   he asked himself  i have killed her lover  yes  killed my wife's lover
yes  that was it  and why  how did i come to do it    because you married her   answered an inner voice
 but in what was i to blame   he asked
 in marrying her without loving her  in deceiving yourself and her   and he vividly recalled that moment after supper at prince vasili's  when he spoke those words he had found so difficult to utter   i love you    it all comes from that  even then i felt it   he thought
 i felt then that it was not so  that i had no right to do it
and so it turns out   he remembered his honeymoon and blushed at the recollection
particularly vivid  humiliating  and shameful was the recollection of how one day soon after his marriage he came out of the bedroom into his study a little before noon in his silk dressing gown and found his head steward there  who  bowing respectfully  looked into his face and at his dressing gown and smiled slightly  as if expressing respectful understanding of his employer's happiness
 but how often i have felt proud of her  proud of her majestic beauty and social tact   thought he   been proud of my house  in which she received all petersburg  proud of her unapproachability and beauty
so this is what i was proud of  i then thought that i did not understand her
how often when considering her character i have told myself that i was to blame for not understanding her  for not understanding that constant composure and complacency and lack of all interests or desires  and the whole secret lies in the terrible truth that she is a depraved woman
now i have spoken that terrible word to myself all has become clear
 anatole used to come to borrow money from her and used to kiss her naked shoulders
she did not give him the money  but let herself be kissed
her father in jest tried to rouse her jealousy  and she replied with a calm smile that she was not so stupid as to be jealous  'let him do what he pleases ' she used to say of me
one day i asked her if she felt any symptoms of pregnancy she laughed contemptuously and said she was not a fool to want to have children  and that she was not going to have any children by me   then he recalled the coarseness and bluntness of her thoughts and the vulgarity of the expressions that were natural to her  though she had been brought up in the most aristocratic circles
 i'm not such a fool   
just you try it on   
allez vous promener   * she used to say
often seeing the success she had with young and old men and women pierre could not understand why he did not love her
*  you clear out of this    yes  i never loved her   said he to himself   i knew she was a depraved woman   he repeated   but dared not admit it to myself and now there's dolokhov sitting in the snow with a forced smile and perhaps dying  while meeting my remorse with some forced bravado   pierre was one of those people who  in spite of an appearance of what is called weak character  do not seek a confidant in their troubles
he digested his sufferings alone
 it is all  all her fault   he said to himself   but what of that  why did i bind myself to her  why did i say 'je vous aime' * to her  which was a lie  and worse than a lie  i am guilty and must endure   what  a slur on my name  a misfortune for life  oh  that's nonsense   he thought
 the slur on my name and honor that's all apart from myself   * i love you
 louis xvi was executed because they said he was dishonorable and a criminal   came into pierre's head   and from their point of view they were right  as were those too who canonized him and died a martyr's death for his sake
then robespierre was beheaded for being a despot
who is right and who is wrong  no one  but if you are alive live  tomorrow you'll die as i might have died an hour ago
and is it worth tormenting oneself  when one has only a moment of life in comparison with eternity   but at the moment when he imagined himself calmed by such reflections  she suddenly came into his mind as she was at the moments when he had most strongly expressed his insincere love for her  and he felt the blood rush to his heart and had again to get up and move about and break and tear whatever came to his hand  why did i tell her that 'je vous aime'   he kept repeating to himself and when he had said it for the tenth time  moliere's words   mais que diable allait il faire dans cette galere  * occurred to him  and he began to laugh at himself *  but what the devil was he doing in that galley   in the night he called his valet and told him to pack up to go to petersburg
he could not imagine how he could speak to her now
he resolved to go away next day and leave a letter informing her of his intention to part from her forever
next morning when the valet came into the room with his coffee  pierre was he woke up and looked round for a while with a startled expression  unable to realize where he was
 the countess told me to inquire whether your excellency was at home   said the valet
but before pierre could decide what answer he would send  the countess herself in a white satin dressing gown embroidered with silver and with simply dressed hair  two immense plaits twice round her lovely head like a coronet  entered the room  calm and majestic  except that there was a wrathful wrinkle on her rather prominent marble brow
with her imperturbable calm she did not begin to speak in front of the valet
she knew of the duel and had come to speak about it
she waited till the valet had set down the coffee things and left the room
pierre looked at her timidly over his spectacles  and like a hare surrounded by hounds who lays back her ears and continues to crouch motionless before her enemies  he tried to continue reading
but feeling this to be senseless and impossible  he again glanced timidly at her
she did not sit down but looked at him with a contemptuous smile  waiting for the valet to go
 well  what's this now  what have you been up to now  i should like to know   she asked sternly
 i  what have i      stammered pierre
 so it seems you're a hero  eh  come now  what was this duel about  what is it meant to prove  what  i ask you   pierre turned over heavily on the ottoman and opened his mouth  but could not reply  if you won't answer  i'll tell you     helene went on
 you believe everything you're told
you were told     helene laughed   that dolokhov was my lover   she said in french with her coarse plainness of speech  uttering the word amant as casually as any other word   and you believed it  well  what have you proved  what does this duel prove  that you're a fool  que vous etes un sot  but everybody knew that
what will be the result  that i shall be the laughingstock of all moscow  that everyone will say that you  drunk and not knowing what you were about  challenged a man you are jealous of without cause   helene raised her voice and became more and more excited   a man who's a better man than you in every way      hm  
hm      growled pierre  frowning without looking at her  and not moving a muscle
 and how could you believe he was my lover  why  because i like his company  if you were cleverer and more agreeable  i should prefer yours    don't speak to me  
i beg you   muttered pierre hoarsely
 why shouldn't i speak  i can speak as i like  and i tell you plainly that there are not many wives with husbands such as you who would not have taken lovers  des amants   but i have not done so   said she
pierre wished to say something  looked at her with eyes whose strange expression she did not understand  and lay down again
he was suffering physically at that moment  there was a weight on his chest and he could not breathe
he knew that he must do something to put an end to this suffering  but what he wanted to do was too terrible
 we had better separate   he muttered in a broken voice
 separate  very well  but only if you give me a fortune   said helene
 separate  that's a thing to frighten me with   pierre leaped up from the sofa and rushed staggering toward her
 i'll kill you   he shouted  and seizing the marble top of a table with a strength he had never before felt  he made a step toward her brandishing the slab
helene's face became terrible  she shrieked and sprang aside
his father's nature showed itself in pierre
he felt the fascination and delight of frenzy
he flung down the slab  broke it  and swooping down on her with outstretched hands shouted   get out   in such a terrible voice that the whole house heard it with horror god knows what he would have done at that moment had helene not fled from the room
a week later pierre gave his wife full power to control all his estates in great russia  which formed the larger part of his property  and left for petersburg alone
two months had elapsed since the news of the battle of austerlitz and the loss of prince andrew had reached bald hills  and in spite of the letters sent through the embassy and all the searches made  his body had not been found nor was he on the list of prisoners
what was worst of all for his relations was the fact that there was still a possibility of his having been picked up on the battlefield by the people of the place and that he might now be lying  recovering or dying  alone among strangers and unable to send news of himself the gazettes from which the old prince first heard of the defeat at austerlitz stated  as usual very briefly and vaguely  that after brilliant engagements the russians had had to retreat and had made their withdrawal in perfect order
the old prince understood from this official report that our army had been defeated
a week after the gazette report of the battle of austerlitz came a letter from kutuzov informing the prince of the fate that had befallen his son
 your son   wrote kutuzov   fell before my eyes  a standard in his hand and at the head of a regiment he fell as a hero  worthy of his father and his fatherland
to the great regret of myself and of the whole army it is still uncertain whether he is alive or not
i comfort myself and you with the hope that your son is alive  for otherwise he would have been mentioned among the officers found on the field of battle  a list of whom has been sent me under flag of truce   after receiving this news late in the evening  when he was alone in his study  the old prince went for his walk as usual next morning  but he was silent with his steward  the gardener  and the architect  and though he looked very grim he said nothing to anyone
when princess mary went to him at the usual hour he was working at his lathe and  as usual  did not look round at her
 ah  princess mary   he said suddenly in an unnatural voice  throwing down his chisel
 the wheel continued to revolve by its own impetus  and princess mary long remembered the dying creak of that wheel  which merged in her memory with what followed   she approached him  saw his face  and something gave way within her
her eyes grew dim
by the expression of her father's face  not sad  not crushed  but angry and working unnaturally  she saw that hanging over her and about to crush her was some terrible misfortune  the worst in life  one she had not yet experienced  irreparable and incomprehensible the death of one she loved
 father  andrew   said the ungraceful  awkward princess with such an indescribable charm of sorrow and self forgetfulness that her father could not bear her look but turned away with a sob
 bad news  he's not among the prisoners nor among the killed  kutuzov writes     and he screamed as piercingly as if he wished to drive the princess away by that scream  
 killed   the princess did not fall down or faint
she was already pale  but on hearing these words her face changed and something brightened in her beautiful  radiant eyes
it was as if joy a supreme joy apart from the joys and sorrows of this world overflowed the great grief within her
she forgot all fear of her father  went up to him  took his hand  and drawing him down put her arm round his thin  scraggy neck
 father   she said   do not turn away from me  let us weep together    scoundrels  blackguards   shrieked the old man  turning his face away from her
 destroying the army  destroying the men  and why  go  go and tell lise   the princess sank helplessly into an armchair beside her father and wept
she saw her brother now as he had been at the moment when he took leave of her and of lise  his look tender yet proud
she saw him tender and amused as he was when he put on the little icon
 did he believe  had he repented of his unbelief  was he now there  there in the realms of eternal peace and blessedness   she thought  father  tell me how it happened   she asked through her tears
 go  go  killed in battle  where the best of russian men and russia's glory were led to destruction
go  princess mary
go and tell lise
i will follow   when princess mary returned from her father  the little princess sat working and looked up with that curious expression of inner  happy calm peculiar to pregnant women
it was evident that her eyes did not see princess mary but were looking within  
into herself  
at something joyful and mysterious taking place within her
 mary   she said  moving away from the embroidery frame and lying back   give me your hand   she took her sister in law's hand and held it below her waist
her eyes were smiling expectantly  her downy lip rose and remained lifted in childlike happiness
princess mary knelt down before her and hid her face in the folds of her sisterin law's dress
 there  there  do you feel it  i feel so strange
and do you know  mary  i am going to love him very much   said lise  looking with bright and happy eyes at her sister in law
princess mary could not lift her head  she was weeping
 what is the matter  mary    nothing  
only i feel sad  
sad about andrew   she said  wiping away her tears on her sister in law's knee
several times in the course of the morning princess mary began trying to prepare her sister in law  and every time began to cry
unobservant as was the little princess  these tears  the cause of which she did not understand  agitated her
she said nothing but looked about uneasily as if in search of something
before dinner the old prince  of whom she was always afraid  came into her room with a peculiarly restless and malign expression and went out again without saying a word
she looked at princess mary  then sat thinking for a while with that expression of attention to something within her that is only seen in pregnant women  and suddenly began to cry
 has anything come from andrew   she asked
 no  you know it's too soon for news
but my father is anxious and i feel afraid    so there's nothing    nothing   answered princess mary  looking firmly with her radiant eyes at her sister in law
she had determined not to tell her and persuaded her father to hide the terrible news from her till after her confinement  which was expected within a few days
princess mary and the old prince each bore and hid their grief in their own way
the old prince would not cherish any hope  he made up his mind that prince andrew had been killed  and though he sent an official to austria to seek for traces of his son  he ordered a monument from moscow which he intended to erect in his own garden to his memory  and he told everybody that his son had been killed
he tried not to change his former way of life  but his strength failed him
he walked less  ate less  slept less  and became weaker every day
princess mary hoped
she prayed for her brother as living and was always awaiting news of his return
 dearest   said the little princess after breakfast on the morning of the nineteenth march  and her downy little lip rose from old habit  but as sorrow was manifest in every smile  the sound of every word  and even every footstep in that house since the terrible news had come  so now the smile of the little princess influenced by the general mood though without knowing its cause  was such as to remind one still more of the general sorrow
 dearest  i'm afraid this morning's fruschtique * as foka the cook calls it  has disagreed with me   * fruhstuck  breakfast
 what is the matter with you  my darling  you look pale
oh  you are very pale   said princess mary in alarm  running with her soft  ponderous steps up to her sister in law
 your excellency  should not mary bogdanovna be sent for   said one of the maids who was present
 mary bogdanovna was a midwife from the neighboring town  who had been at bald hills for the last fortnight    oh yes   assented princess mary   perhaps that's it
i'll go
courage  my angel   she kissed lise and was about to leave the room
 oh  no  no   and besides the pallor and the physical suffering on the little princess' face  an expression of childish fear of inevitable pain showed itself
 no  it's only indigestion   
say it's only indigestion  say so  mary  say     and the little princess began to cry capriciously like a suffering child and to wring her little hands even with some affectation
princess mary ran out of the room to fetch mary bogdanovna  mon dieu  mon dieu  oh   she heard as she left the room
the midwife was already on her way to meet her  rubbing her small  plump white hands with an air of calm importance
 mary bogdanovna  i think it's beginning   said princess mary looking at the midwife with wide open eyes of alarm
 well  the lord be thanked  princess   said mary bogdanovna  not hastening her steps
 you young ladies should not know anything about it    but how is it the doctor from moscow is not here yet   said the princess
 in accordance with lise's and prince andrew's wishes they had sent in good time to moscow for a doctor and were expecting him at any moment    no matter  princess  don't be alarmed   said mary bogdanovna
 we'll manage very well without a doctor   five minutes later princess mary from her room heard something heavy being carried by
she looked out
the men servants were carrying the large leather sofa from prince andrew's study into the bedroom
on their faces was a quiet and solemn look
princess mary sat alone in her room listening to the sounds in the house  now and then opening her door when someone passed and watching what was going on in the passage
some women passing with quiet steps in and out of the bedroom glanced at the princess and turned away
she did not venture to ask any questions  and shut the door again  now sitting down in her easy chair  surprise and distress she found that her prayers did not calm her excitement
suddenly her door opened softly and her old nurse  praskovya savishna  who hardly ever came to that room as the old prince had forbidden it  appeared on the threshold with a shawl round her head
 i've come to sit with you a bit  masha   said the nurse   and here i've brought the prince's wedding candles to light before his saint  my angel   she said with a sigh
 oh  nurse  i'm so glad    god is merciful  birdie   the nurse lit the gilt candles before the icons and sat down by the door with footsteps or voices were heard did they look at one another  the princess anxious and inquiring  the nurse encouraging
everyone in the house was dominated by the same feeling that princess mary experienced as she sat in her room
but owing to the superstition that the fewer the people who know of it the less a woman in travail suffers  everyone tried to pretend not to know  no one spoke of it  but apart from the ordinary staid and respectful good manners habitual in the prince's household  a common anxiety  a softening of the heart  and a consciousness that something great and mysterious was being accomplished at that moment made itself felt
there was no laughter in the maids' large hall
in the men servants' hall all sat waiting  silently and alert
in the outlying serfs' quarters torches and candles were burning and no one slept
the old prince  stepping on his heels  paced up and down his study and sent tikhon to ask mary bogdanovna what news
  say only that 'the prince told me to ask ' and come and tell me her answer    inform the prince that labor has begun   said mary bogdanovna  giving the messenger a significant look
tikhon went and told the prince
 very good   said the prince closing the door behind him  and tikhon did not hear the slightest sound from the study after that
after a while he re entered it as if to snuff the candles  and  seeing the prince was lying on the sofa  looked at him  noticed his perturbed face  shook his head  and going up to him silently kissed him on the shoulder and left the room without snuffing the candles or saying why he had entered
the most solemn mystery in the world continued its course
evening passed  night came  and the feeling of suspense and softening of heart in the presence of the unfathomable did not lessen but increased
no one slept
it was one of those march nights when winter seems to wish to resume its sway and scatters its last snows and storms with desperate fury a relay of horses had been sent up the highroad to meet the german doctor from moscow who was expected every moment  and men on horseback with lanterns were sent to the crossroads to guide him over the country road with its hollows and snow covered pools of water
eyes fixed on her nurse's wrinkled face  every line of which she knew so well   on the lock of gray hair that escaped from under the kerchief  and the loose skin that hung under her chin
nurse savishna  knitting in hand  was telling in low tones  scarcely hearing or understanding her own words  what she had told hundreds of times before  how the late princess had given birth to princess mary in kishenev with only a moldavian peasant woman to help instead of a midwife
 god is merciful  doctors are never needed   she said
suddenly a gust of wind beat violently against the casement of the window  from which the double frame had been removed  by order of the prince  one window frame was removed in each room as soon as the larks returned   and  forcing open a loosely closed latch  set the damask curtain flapping and blew out the candle with its chill  snowy draft
princess mary shuddered  her nurse  putting down the stocking she was knitting  went to the window and leaning out tried to catch the open casement
the cold wind flapped the ends of her kerchief and her loose locks of gray hair
 princess  my dear  there's someone driving up the avenue   she said  holding the casement and not closing it
 with lanterns
most likely the doctor    oh  my god  thank god   said princess mary
 i must go and meet him  he does not know russian   princess mary threw a shawl over her head and ran to meet the newcomer
as she was crossing the anteroom she saw through the window a carriage with lanterns  standing at the entrance
she went out on the stairs
on a banister post stood a tallow candle which guttered in the draft
on the landing below  philip  the footman  stood looking scared and holding another candle
still lower  beyond the turn of the staircase  one could hear the footstep of someone in thick felt boots  and a voice that seemed familiar to princess mary was saying something
 thank god   said the voice
 and father    gone to bed   replied the voice of demyan the house steward  who was downstairs
then the voice said something more  demyan replied  and the steps in the felt boots approached the unseen bend of the staircase more rapidly
 it's andrew   thought princess mary
 no it can't be  that would be too extraordinary   and at the very moment she thought this  the face and figure of prince andrew  in a fur cloak the deep collar of which covered with snow  appeared on the landing where the footman stood with the candle
yes  it was he  pale  thin  with a changed and strangely softened but agitated expression on his face
he came up the stairs and embraced his sister
 you did not get my letter   he asked  and not waiting for a reply which he would not have received  for the princess was unable to speak he turned back  rapidly mounted the stairs again with the doctor who had entered the hall after him  they had met at the last post station   and again embraced his sister
 what a strange fate  masha darling   and having taken off his cloak and felt boots  he went to the little princess' apartment
the little princess lay supported by pillows  with a white cap on her head  the pains had just left her 
strands of her black hair lay round her inflamed and perspiring cheeks  her charming rosy mouth with its downy lip was open and she was smiling joyfully
prince andrew entered and paused facing her at the foot of the sofa on which she was lying
her glittering eyes  filled with childlike fear and excitement  rested on him without changing their expression
 i love you all and have done no harm to anyone  why must i suffer so  help me   her look seemed to say
she saw her husband  but did not realize the significance of his appearance before her now
prince andrew went round the sofa and kissed her forehead
 my darling   he said a word he had never used to her before
 god is merciful      she looked at him inquiringly and with childlike reproach
 i expected help from you and i get none  none from you either   said her eyes
she was not surprised at his having come  she did not realize that he had come
his coming had nothing to do with her sufferings or with their relief
the pangs began again and mary bogdanovna advised prince andrew to leave the room
the doctor entered
prince andrew went out and  meeting princess mary  again joined her
they began talking in whispers  but their talk broke off at every moment
they waited and listened
 go  dear   said princess mary
prince andrew went again to his wife and sat waiting in the room next to hers
a woman came from the bedroom with a frightened face and became confused when she saw prince andrew
he covered his face with his hands and remained so for some minutes
piteous  helpless  animal moans came through the door
prince andrew got up  went to the door  and tried to open it
someone was holding it shut
 you can't come in  you can't   said a terrified voice from within
he began pacing the room
the screaming ceased  and a few more seconds went by
then suddenly a terrible shriek it could not be hers  she could not scream like that came from the bedroom
prince andrew ran to the door  the scream ceased and he heard the wail of an infant
 what have they taken a baby in there for   thought prince andrew in the first second
 a baby  what baby     why is there a baby there  or is the baby born   then suddenly he realized the joyful significance of that wail  tears choked him  and leaning his elbows on the window sill be began to cry  sobbing like a child
the door opened
the doctor with his shirt sleeves tucked up  without a coat  pale and with a trembling jaw  came out of the room
prince andrew turned to him  but the doctor gave him a bewildered look and passed by without a word
a woman rushed out and seeing prince andrew stopped  hesitating on the threshold
he went into his wife's room
she was lying dead  in the same position he had seen her in five minutes before and  despite the fixed eyes and the pallor of the cheeks  the same expression was on her charming childlike face with its upper lip covered with tiny black hair
 i love you all  and have done no harm to anyone  and what have you done to me   said her charming  pathetic  dead face
in a corner of the room something red and tiny gave a grunt and squealed in mary bogdanovna's trembling white hands
two hours later prince andrew  stepping softly  went into his father's room
the old man already knew everything
he was standing close to the door and as soon as it opened his rough old arms closed like a vise round his son's neck  and without a word he began to sob like a child three days later the little princess was buried  and prince andrew went up the steps to where the coffin stood  to give her the farewell kiss
and there in the coffin was the same face  though with closed eyes
 ah  what have you done to me   it still seemed to say  and prince andrew felt that something gave way in his soul and that he was guilty of a sin he could neither remedy nor forget
he could not weep
the old man too came up and kissed the waxen little hands that lay quietly crossed one on the other on her breast  and to him  too  her face seemed to say   ah  what have you done to me  and why   and at the sight the old man turned angrily away
another five days passed  and then the young prince nicholas andreevich was baptized
the wet nurse supported the coverlet with her chin  while the priest with a goose feather anointed the boy's little red and wrinkled soles and palms his grandfather  who was his godfather  trembling and afraid of dropping him  carried the infant round the battered tin font and handed him over to the godmother  princess mary
prince andrew sat in another room  faint with fear lest the baby should be drowned in the font  and awaited the termination of the ceremony
he looked up joyfully at the baby when the nurse brought it to him and nodded approval when she told him that the wax with the baby's hair had not sunk in the font but had floated
rostov's share in dolokhov's duel with bezukhov was hushed up by the efforts of the old count  and instead of being degraded to the ranks as he expected he was appointed an adjutant to the governor general of moscow
as a result he could not go to the country with the rest of the family  but was kept all summer in moscow by his new duties
dolokhov recovered  and rostov became very friendly with him during his convalescence
dolokhov lay ill at his mother's who loved him passionately and tenderly  and old mary ivanovna  who had grown fond of rostov for his friendship to her fedya  often talked to him about her son
 yes  count   she would say   he is too noble and pure souled for our present  depraved world
no one now loves virtue  it seems like a reproach to everyone now tell me  count  was it right  was it honorable  of bezukhov  and fedya  with his noble spirit  loved him and even now never says a word against him
those pranks in petersburg when they played some tricks on a policeman  didn't they do it together  and there  bezukhov got off scotfree  while fedya had to bear the whole burden on his shoulders
fancy what he had to go through  it's true he has been reinstated  but how could they fail to do that  i think there were not many such gallant sons of the fatherland out there as he
and now this duel  have these people no feeling  or honor  knowing him to be an only son  to challenge him and shoot so straight  it's well god had mercy on us
and what was it for  who doesn't have intrigues nowadays  why  if he was so jealous  as i see things he should have shown it sooner  but he lets it go on for months
and then to call him out  reckoning on fedya not fighting because he owed him money  what baseness  what meanness  i know you understand fedya  my dear count  that  believe me  is why i am so fond of you
few people do understand him
he is such a lofty  heavenly soul   dolokhov himself during his convalescence spoke to rostov in a way no one would have expected of him  i know people consider me a bad man   he said
 let them  i don't care a straw about anyone but those i love  but those i love  i love so that i would give my life for them  and the others i'd throttle if they stood in my way
i have an adored  a priceless mother  and two or three friends you among them  and as for the rest i only care about them in so far as they are harmful or useful
and most of them are harmful  especially the women
yes  dear boy   he continued   i have met loving  noble  high minded men  but i have not yet met any women countesses or cooks who were not venal
i have not yet met that divine purity and devotion i look for in women
if i found such a one i'd give my life for her  but those      and he made a gesture of contempt
 and believe me  if i still value my life it is only because i still hope to meet such a divine creature  who will regenerate  purify  and elevate me
but you don't understand it    oh  yes  i quite understand   answered rostov  who was under his new friend's influence
in the autumn the rostovs returned to moscow
early in the winter denisov also came back and stayed with them
the first half of the winter of 1806  which nicholas rostov spent in moscow  was one of the happiest  merriest times for him and the whole family
nicholas brought many young men to his parents' house
vera was a handsome girl of twenty  sonya a girl of sixteen with all the charm of an opening flower  natasha  half grown up and half child  was now childishly amusing  now girlishly enchanting
at that time in the rostovs' house there prevailed an amorous atmosphere characteristic of homes where there are very young and very charming girls
every young man who came to the house seeing those impressionable  smiling young faces  smiling probably at their own happiness   feeling the eager bustle around him  and hearing the fitful bursts of song and music and the inconsequent but friendly prattle of young girls ready for anything and full of hope experienced the same feeling  sharing with the young folk of the rostovs' household a readiness to fall in love and an expectation of happiness
among the young men introduced by rostov one of the first was dolokhov  whom everyone in the house liked except natasha
she almost quarreled with her brother about him
she insisted that he was a bad man  and that in the duel with bezukhov  pierre was right and dolokhov wrong  and further that he was disagreeable and unnatural
 there's nothing for me to understand   she cried out with resolute self will   he is wicked and heartless
there now  i like your denisov though he is a rake and all that  still i like him  so you see i do understand
i don't know how to put it  
with this one everything is calculated  and i don't like that
but denisov      oh  denisov is quite different   replied nicholas  implying that even denisov was nothing compared to dolokhov  you must understand what a soul there is in dolokhov  you should see him with his mother
what a heart    well  i don't know about that  but i am uncomfortable with him
and do you know he has fallen in love with sonya    what nonsense      i'm certain of it  you'll see   natasha's prediction proved true
dolokhov  who did not usually care for the society of ladies  began to come often to the house  and the question for whose sake he came  though no one spoke of it  was soon settled
he came because of sonya
and sonya  though she would never have dared to say so  knew it and blushed scarlet every time dolokhov appeared
dolokhov often dined at the rostovs'  never missed a performance at which they were present  and went to iogel's balls for young people which the rostovs always attended
he was pointedly attentive to sonya and looked at her in such a way that not only could she not bear his glances without coloring  but even the old countess and natasha blushed when they saw his looks
it was evident that this strange  strong man was under the irresistible influence of the dark  graceful girl who loved another
rostov noticed something new in dolokhov's relations with sonya  but he did not explain to himself what these new relations were  they're always in love with someone   he thought of sonya and natasha
but he was not as much at ease with sonya and dolokhov as before and was less frequently at home
in the autumn of 1806 everybody had again begun talking of the war with napoleon with even greater warmth than the year before
orders were given to raise recruits  ten men in every thousand for the regular army  and besides this  nine men in every thousand for the militia
everywhere bonaparte was anathematized and in moscow nothing but the coming war was talked of
for the rostov family the whole interest of these preparations for war lay in the fact that nicholas would not hear of remaining in moscow  and only awaited the termination of denisov's furlough after christmas to return with him to their regiment
his approaching departure did not prevent his amusing himself  but rather gave zest to his pleasures he spent the greater part of his time away from home  at dinners  parties  and balls
on the third day after christmas nicholas dined at home  a thing he had rarely done of late
it was a grand farewell dinner  as he and denisov were leaving to join their regiment after epiphany
about twenty people were present  including dolokhov and denisov
never had love been so much in the air  and never had the amorous atmosphere made itself so strongly felt in the rostovs' house as at this holiday time
 seize the moments of happiness  love and be loved  that is the only reality in the world  all else is folly
it is the one thing we are interested in here   said the spirit of the place
nicholas  having as usual exhausted two pairs of horses  without visiting all the places he meant to go to and where he had been invited  returned home just before dinner
as soon as he entered he noticed and felt the tension of the amorous air in the house  and also noticed a curious embarrassment among some of those present
sonya  dolokhov  and the old countess were especially disturbed  and to a lesser degree natasha
nicholas understood that something must have happened between sonya and dolokhov before dinner  and with the kindly sensitiveness natural to him was very gentle and wary with them both at dinner
on that same evening there was to be one of the balls that iogel  the dancing master  gave for his pupils during the holidays
 nicholas  will you come to iogel's  please do   said natasha
 he asked you  and vasili dmitrich * is also going   * denisov
 where would i not go at the countess' command   said denisov  who at the rostovs' had jocularly assumed the role of natasha's knight
 i'm even weady to dance the pas de chale    if i have time   answered nicholas
 but i promised the arkharovs  they have a party    and you   he asked dolokhov  but as soon as he had asked the question he noticed that it should not have been put
 perhaps   coldly and angrily replied dolokhov  glancing at sonya  and  scowling  he gave nicholas just such a look as he had given pierre at the club dinner
 there is something up   thought nicholas  and he was further confirmed in this conclusion by the fact that dolokhov left immediately after dinner
he called natasha and asked her what was the matter
 and i was looking for you   said natasha running out to him
 i told you  but you would not believe it   she said triumphantly
 he has proposed to sonya   little as nicholas had occupied himself with sonya of late  something seemed to give way within him at this news dolokhov was a suitable and in some respects a brilliant match for the dowerless  orphan girl
from the point of view of the old countess and of society it was out of the question for her to refuse him
and therefore nicholas' first feeling on hearing the news was one of anger with sonya   
he tried to say   that's capital  of course she'll forget her childish promises and accept the offer   but before he had time to say it natasha began again
 and fancy  she refused him quite definitely   adding  after a pause   she told him she loved another    yes  my sonya could not have done otherwise   thought nicholas
 much as mamma pressed her  she refused  and i know she won't change once she has said      and mamma pressed her   said nicholas reproachfully
 yes   said natasha
 do you know  nicholas don't be angry but i know you will not marry her
i know  heaven knows how  but i know for certain that you won't marry her    now you don't know that at all   said nicholas
 but i must talk to her
what a darling sonya is   he added with a smile
 ah  she is indeed a darling  i'll send her to you   and natasha kissed her brother and ran away
a minute later sonya came in with a frightened  guilty  and scared look
nicholas went up to her and kissed her hand
this was the first time since his return that they had talked alone and about their love
 sophie   he began  timidly at first and then more and more boldly   if you wish to refuse one who is not only a brilliant and advantageous match but a splendid  noble fellow  
he is my friend     sonya interrupted him
 i have already refused   she said hurriedly
 if you are refusing for my sake  i am afraid that i     sonya again interrupted
she gave him an imploring  frightened look
 nicholas  don't tell me that   she said
 no  but i must
it may be arrogant of me  but still it is best to say it
if you refuse him on my account  i must tell you the whole truth
i love you  and i think i love you more than anyone else       that is enough for me   said sonya  blushing
 no  but i have been in love a thousand times and shall fall in love again  though for no one have i such a feeling of friendship  confidence  and love as i have for you
then i am young
mamma does not wish it
in a word  i make no promise
and i beg you to consider dolokhov's offer   he said  articulating his friend's name with difficulty
 don't say that to me  i want nothing
i love you as a brother and always shall  and i want nothing more    you are an angel  i am not worthy of you  but i am afraid of misleading you   and nicholas again kissed her hand
iogel's were the most enjoyable balls in moscow
so said the mothers as they watched their young people executing their newly learned steps  and so said the youths and maidens themselves as they danced till they were ready to drop  and so said the grown up young men and women who came to these balls with an air of condescension and found them most enjoyable that year two marriages had come of these balls
the two pretty young princesses gorchakov met suitors there and were married and so further increased the fame of these dances
what distinguished them from others was the absence of host or hostess and the presence of the good natured iogel  flying about like a feather and bowing according to the rules of his art  as he collected the tickets from all his visitors
there was the fact that only those came who wished to dance and amuse themselves as girls of thirteen and fourteen do who are wearing long dresses for the first time with scarcely any exceptions they all were  or seemed to be  pretty so rapturous were their smiles and so sparkling their eyes
sometimes the best of the pupils  of whom natasha  who was exceptionally graceful  was first  even danced the pas de chale  but at this last ball only the ecossaise  the anglaise  and the mazurka  which was just coming into fashion  were danced
iogel had taken a ballroom in bezukhov's house  and the ball  as everyone said  was a great success
there were many pretty girls and the rostov girls were among the prettiest
they were both particularly happy and gay
that evening  proud of dolokhov's proposal  her refusal  and her explanation with nicholas  sonya twirled about before she left home so that the maid could hardly get her hair plaited  and she was transparently radiant with impulsive joy
natasha no less proud of her first long dress and of being at a real ball was even happier
they were both dressed in white muslin with pink ribbons
natasha fell in love the very moment she entered the ballroom
she was not in love with anyone in particular  but with everyone
whatever person she happened to look at she was in love with for that moment
 oh  how delightful it is   she kept saying  running up to sonya
nicholas and denisov were walking up and down  looking with kindly patronage at the dancers
 how sweet she is she will be a weal beauty   said denisov
 who    countess natasha   answered denisov
 and how she dances  what gwace   he said again after a pause
 who are you talking about    about your sister   ejaculated denisov testily
rostov smiled
 my dear count  you were one of my best pupils you must dance   said little iogel coming up to nicholas
 look how many charming young ladies   he turned with the same request to denisov who was also a former pupil of his
 no  my dear fellow  i'll be a wallflower   said denisov
 don't you wecollect what bad use i made of your lessons    oh no   said iogel  hastening to reassure him
 you were only inattentive  but you had talent oh yes  you had talent   the band struck up the newly introduced mazurka
nicholas could not refuse iogel and asked sonya to dance
denisov sat down by the old ladies and  leaning on his saber and beating time with his foot  told them something funny and kept them amused  while he watched the young people dancing  iogel with natasha  his pride and his best pupil  were the first couple
noiselessly  skillfully stepping with his little feet in low shoes  iogel flew first across the hall with natasha  who  though shy  went on carefully executing her steps
denisov did not take his eyes off her and beat time with his saber in a way that clearly indicated that if he was not dancing it was because he would not and not because he could not
in the middle of a figure he beckoned to rostov who was passing   this is not at all the thing   he said
 what sort of polish mazuwka is this  but she does dance splendidly   knowing that denisov had a reputation even in poland for the masterly way in which he danced the mazurka  nicholas ran up to natasha   go and choose denisov
he is a real dancer  a wonder   he said
when it came to natasha's turn to choose a partner  she rose and  tripping rapidly across in her little shoes trimmed with bows  ran timidly to the corner where denisov sat
she saw that everybody was looking at her and waiting
nicholas saw that denisov was refusing though he smiled delightedly
he ran up to them
 please  vasili dmitrich   natasha was saying   do come    oh no  let me off  countess   denisov replied
 now then  vaska   said nicholas
 they coax me as if i were vaska the cat   said denisov jokingly
 i'll sing for you a whole evening   said natasha
 oh  the faiwy  she can do anything with me   said denisov  and he unhooked his saber
he came out from behind the chairs  clasped his partner's hand firmly  threw back his head  and advanced his foot  waiting for the beat
only on horse back and in the mazurka was denisov's short stature not noticeable and he looked the fine fellow he felt himself to be at the right beat of the music he looked sideways at his partner with a merry and triumphant air  suddenly stamped with one foot  bounded from the floor like a ball  and flew round the room taking his partner with him
he glided silently on one foot half across the room  and seeming not to notice the chairs was dashing straight at them  when suddenly  clinking his spurs and spreading out his legs  he stopped short on his heels  stood so a second  stamped on the spot clanking his spurs  whirled rapidly round  and  striking his left heel against his right  flew round again in a circle
natasha guessed what he meant to do  and abandoning herself to him followed his lead hardly knowing how
first he spun her round  holding her now with his left  now with his right hand  then falling on one knee he twirled her round him  and again jumping up  dashed so impetuously forward that it seemed as if he would rush through the whole suite of rooms without drawing breath  and then he suddenly stopped and performed some new and unexpected steps when at last  smartly whirling his partner round in front of her chair  he drew up with a click of his spurs and bowed to her  natasha did not even make him a curtsy
she fixed her eyes on him in amazement  smiling as if she did not recognize him
 what does this mean   she brought out
although iogel did not acknowledge this to be the real mazurka  everyone was delighted with denisov's skill  he was asked again and again as a partner  and the old men began smilingly to talk about poland and the good old days
denisov  flushed after the mazurka and mopping himself with his handkerchief  sat down by natasha and did not leave her for the rest of the evening for two days after that rostov did not see dolokhov at his own or at dolokhov's home  on the third day he received a note from him  as i do not intend to be at your house again for reasons you know of  and am going to rejoin my regiment  i am giving a farewell supper tonight to my friends come to the english hotel
about ten o'clock rostov went to the english hotel straight from the theater  where he had been with his family and denisov
he was at once shown to the best room  which dolokhov had taken for that evening
some twenty men were gathered round a table at which dolokhov sat between two candles
on the table was a pile of gold and paper money  and he was keeping the bank
rostov had not seen him since his proposal and sonya's refusal and felt uncomfortable at the thought of how they would meet
dolokhov's clear  cold glance met rostov as soon as he entered the door  as though he had long expected him
 it's a long time since we met   he said
 thanks for coming
i'll just finish dealing  and then ilyushka will come with his chorus    i called once or twice at your house   said rostov  reddening
dolokhov made no reply
 you may punt   he said
rostov recalled at that moment a strange conversation he had once had with dolokhov
 none but fools trust to luck in play   dolokhov had then said
 or are you afraid to play with me   dolokhov now asked as if guessing rostov's thought
beneath his smile rostov saw in him the mood he had shown at the club dinner and at other times  when as if tired of everyday life he had felt a need to escape from it by some strange  and usually cruel  action
rostov felt ill at ease
he tried  but failed  to find some joke with which to reply to dolokhov's words
but before he had thought of anything  dolokhov  looking straight in his face  said slowly and deliberately so that everyone could hear   do you remember we had a talk about cards  
'he's a fool who trusts to luck  one should make certain ' and i want to try    to try his luck or the certainty   rostov asked himself  well  you'd better not play   dolokhov added  and springing a new pack of cards said   bank  gentlemen   moving the money forward he prepared to deal
rostov sat down by his side and at first did not play
dolokhov kept glancing at him
 why don't you play   he asked
and strange to say nicholas felt that he could not help taking up a card  putting a small stake on it  and beginning to play
 i have no money with me   he said
 i'll trust you   rostov staked five rubles on a card and lost  staked again  and again lost
dolokhov  killed   that is  beat  ten cards of rostov's running
 gentlemen   said dolokhov after he had dealt for some time
 please place your money on the cards or i may get muddled in the reckoning   one of the players said he hoped he might be trusted
 yes  you might  but i am afraid of getting the accounts mixed
so i ask you to put the money on your cards   replied dolokhov
 don't stint yourself  we'll settle afterwards   he added  turning to rostov
the game continued  a waiter kept handing round champagne
all rostov's cards were beaten and he had eight hundred rubles scored up against him
he wrote  800 rubles  on a card  but while the waiter filled his glass he changed his mind and altered it to his usual stake of twenty rubles
 leave it   said dolokhov  though he did not seem to be even looking at rostov   you'll win it back all the sooner
i lose to the others but win from you
or are you afraid of me   he asked again
rostov submitted
he let the eight hundred remain and laid down a seven of hearts with a torn corner  which he had picked up from the floor
he well remembered that seven afterwards
he laid down the seven of hearts  on which with a broken bit of chalk he had written  800 rubles  in clear upright figures  he emptied the glass of warm champagne that was handed him  smiled at dolokhov's words  and with a sinking heart  waiting for a seven to turn up  gazed at dolokhov's hands which held the pack
much depended on rostov's winning or losing on that seven of hearts
on the previous sunday the old count had given his son two thousand rubles  and though he always disliked speaking of money difficulties had told nicholas that this was all he could let him have till may  and asked him to be more economical this time
nicholas had replied that it would be more than enough for him and that he gave his word of honor not to take anything more till the spring
now only twelve hundred rubles was left of that money  so that this seven of hearts meant for him not only the loss of sixteen hundred rubles  but the necessity of going back on his word
with a sinking heart he watched dolokhov's hands and thought   now then  make haste and let me have this card and i'll take my cap and drive home to supper with denisov  natasha  and sonya  and will certainly never touch a card again   at that moment his home life  jokes with petya  talks with sonya  duets with natasha  piquet with his father  and even his comfortable bed in the house on the povarskaya rose before him with such vividness  clearness  and charm that it seemed as if it were all a lost and unappreciated bliss  long past
he could not conceive that a stupid chance  letting the seven be dealt to the right rather than to the left  might deprive him of all this happiness  newly appreciated and newly illumined  and plunge him into the depths of unknown and undefined misery
that could not be  yet he awaited with a sinking heart the movement of dolokhov's hands
those broad  reddish hands  with hairy wrists visible from under the shirt cuffs  laid down the pack and took up a glass and a pipe that were handed him
 so you are not afraid to play with me   repeated dolokhov  and as if about to tell a good story he put down the cards  leaned back in his chair  and began deliberately with a smile   yes  gentlemen  i've been told there's a rumor going about moscow that i'm a sharper  so i advise you to be careful    come now  deal   exclaimed rostov
 oh  those moscow gossips   said dolokhov  and he took up the cards with a smile
 aah   rostov almost screamed lifting both hands to his head
the seven he needed was lying uppermost  the first card in the pack
he had lost more than he could pay
 still  don't ruin yourself   said dolokhov with a side glance at rostov as he continued to deal
an hour and a half later most of the players were but little interested in their own play
the whole interest was concentrated on rostov
instead of sixteen hundred rubles he had a long column of figures scored against him  which he had reckoned up to ten thousand  but that now  as he vaguely supposed  must have risen to fifteen thousand
in reality it already exceeded twenty thousand rubles
dolokhov was no longer listening to stories or telling them  but followed every movement of rostov's hands and occasionally ran his eyes over the score against him
he had decided to play until that score reached forty three thousand
he had fixed on that number because forty three was the sum of his and sonya's joint ages
rostov  leaning his head on both hands  sat at the table which was scrawled over with figures  wet with spilled wine  and littered with cards
one tormenting impression did not leave him  that those broad boned reddish hands with hairy wrists visible from under the shirt sleeves  those hands which he loved and hated  held him in their power
 six hundred rubles  ace  a corner  a nine  
winning it back's impossible  
oh  how pleasant it was at home   
the knave  double or quits  
it can't be   
and why is he doing this to me   rostov pondered
sometimes he staked a large sum  but dolokhov refused to accept it and fixed the stake himself nicholas submitted to him  and at one moment prayed to god as he had done on the battlefield at the bridge over the enns  and then guessed that the card that came first to hand from the crumpled heap under the table would save him  now counted the cords on his coat and took a card with that number and tried staking the total of his losses on it  then he looked round for aid from the other players  or peered at the now cold face of dolokhov and tried to read what was passing in his mind
 he knows of course what this loss means to me
he can't want my ruin
wasn't he my friend  wasn't i fond of him  but it's not his fault
what's he to do if he has such luck   
and it's not my fault either   he thought to himself   i have done nothing wrong have i killed anyone  or insulted or wished harm to anyone  why such a terrible misfortune  and when did it begin  such a little while ago i came to this table with the thought of winning a hundred rubles to buy that casket for mamma's name day and then going home
i was so happy  so free  so lighthearted  and i did not realize how happy i was  when did that end and when did this new  terrible state of things begin  what marked the change  i sat all the time in this same place at this table  chose and placed cards  and watched those broad boned agile hands in the same way
when did it happen and what has happened  i am well and strong and still the same and in the same place
no  it can't be  surely it will all end in nothing   he was flushed and bathed in perspiration  though the room was not hot
his face was terrible and piteous to see  especially from its helpless efforts to seem calm
the score against him reached the fateful sum of forty three thousand
rostov had just prepared a card  by bending the corner of which he meant to double the three thousand just put down to his score  when dolokhov  slamming down the pack of cards  put it aside and began rapidly adding up the total of rostov's debt  breaking the chalk as he marked the figures in his clear  bold hand
 supper  it's time for supper  and here are the gypsies   some swarthy men and women were really entering from the cold outside and saying something in their gypsy accents
nicholas understood that it was all over  but he said in an indifferent tone   well  won't you go on  i had a splendid card all ready   as if it were the fun of the game which interested him most
 it's all up  i'm lost   thought he
 now a bullet through my brain that's all that's left me   and at the same time he said in a cheerful voice   come now  just this one more little card    all right   said dolokhov  having finished the addition
 all right  twentyone rubles   he said  pointing to the figure twenty one by which the total exceeded the round sum of forty three thousand  and taking up a pack he prepared to deal
rostov submissively unbent the corner of his card and  instead of the six thousand he had intended  carefully wrote twenty one
 it's all the same to me   he said
 i only want to see whether you will let me win this ten  or beat it   dolokhov began to deal seriously
oh  how rostov detested at that moment those hands with their short reddish fingers and hairy wrists  which held him in their power   
the ten fell to him
 you owe forty three thousand  count   said dolokhov  and stretching himself he rose from the table  one does get tired sitting so long   he added  yes  i'm tired too   said rostov
dolokhov cut him short  as if to remind him that it was not for him to jest
 when am i to receive the money  count   rostov  flushing  drew dolokhov into the next room
 i cannot pay it all immediately
will you take an i o u    he said
 i say  rostov   said dolokhov clearly  smiling and looking nicholas straight in the eyes   you know the saying  'lucky in love  unlucky at cards ' your cousin is in love with you  i know    oh  it's terrible to feel oneself so in this man's power   thought rostov
he knew what a shock he would inflict on his father and mother by the news of this loss  he knew what a relief it would be to escape it all  and felt that dolokhov knew that he could save him from all this shame and sorrow  but wanted now to play with him as a cat does with a mouse
 your cousin     dolokhov started to say  but nicholas interrupted him
 my cousin has nothing to do with this and it's not necessary to mention her   he exclaimed fiercely
 then when am i to have it    tomorrow   replied rostov and left the room
to say  tomorrow  and keep up a dignified tone was not difficult  but to go home alone  see his sisters  brother  mother  and father  confess and ask for money he had no right to after giving his word of honor  was terrible
at home  they had not yet gone to bed
the young people  after returning from the theater  had had supper and were grouped round the clavichord
as soon as nicholas entered  he was enfolded in that poetic atmosphere of love which pervaded the rostov household that winter and  now after dolokhov's proposal and iogel's ball  seemed to have grown thicker round sonya and natasha as the air does before a thunderstorm
sonya and natasha  in the lightblue dresses they had worn at the theater  looking pretty and conscious of it  were standing by the clavichord  happy and smiling
vera was playing chess with shinshin in the drawing room
the old countess  waiting for the return of her husband and son  sat playing patience with the old gentlewoman who lived in their house
denisov  with sparkling eyes and ruffled hair  sat at the clavichord striking chords with his short fingers  his legs thrown back and his eyes rolling as he sang  with his small  husky  but true voice  some verses called  enchantress   which he had composed  and to which he was trying to fit music  enchantress  say  to my forsaken lyre what magic power is this recalls me still  what spark has set my inmost soul on fire  what is this bliss that makes my fingers thrill  he was singing in passionate tones  gazing with his sparkling black agate eyes at the frightened and happy natasha
 splendid  excellent   exclaimed natasha
 another verse   she said  without noticing nicholas
 everything's still the same with them   thought nicholas  glancing into the drawing room  where he saw vera and his mother with the old lady
 ah  and here's nicholas   cried natasha  running up to him
 is papa at home   he asked
 i am so glad you've come   said natasha  without answering him
 we are enjoying ourselves  vasili dmitrich is staying a day longer for my sake  did you know    no  papa is not back yet   said sonya
 nicholas  have you come  come here  dear   called the old countess from the drawing room
nicholas went to her  kissed her hand  and sitting down silently at her table began to watch her hands arranging the cards
from the dancing room  they still heard the laughter and merry voices trying to persuade natasha to sing
 all wight  all wight   shouted denisov
 it's no good making excuses now  it's your turn to sing the ba'cawolla i entweat you   the countess glanced at her silent son
 what is the matter   she asked
 oh  nothing   said he  as if weary of being continually asked the same question
 will papa be back soon    i expect so    everything's the same with them
they know nothing about it  where am i to go   thought nicholas  and went again into the dancing room where the clavichord stood
sonya was sitting at the clavichord  playing the prelude to denisov's favorite barcarolle
natasha was preparing to sing
denisov was looking at her with enraptured eyes
nicholas began pacing up and down the room
 why do they want to make her sing  how can she sing  there's nothing to be happy about   thought he
sonya struck the first chord of the prelude
 my god  i'm a ruined and dishonored man  a bullet through my brain is the only thing left me not singing   his thoughts ran on
 go away  but where to  it's one let them sing   he continued to pace the room  looking gloomily at denisov and the girls and avoiding their eyes
 nikolenka  what is the matter   sonya's eyes fixed on him seemed to ask
she noticed at once that something had happened to him
nicholas turned away from her
natasha too  with her quick instinct  had instantly noticed her brother's condition
but  though she noticed it  she was herself in such high spirits at that moment  so far from sorrow  sadness  or self reproach  that she purposely deceived herself as young people often do
 no  i am too happy now to spoil my enjoyment by sympathy with anyone's sorrow   she felt  and she said to herself   no  i must be mistaken  he must be feeling happy  just as i am    now  sonya   she said  going to the very middle of the room  where she considered the resonance was best
having lifted her head and let her arms droop lifelessly  as ballet dancers do  natasha  rising energetically from her heels to her toes  stepped to the middle of the room and stood still  yes  that's me   she seemed to say  answering the rapt gaze with which denisov followed her
 and what is she so pleased about   thought nicholas  looking at his sister
 why isn't she dull and ashamed   natasha took the first note  her throat swelled  her chest rose  her eyes became serious
at that moment she was oblivious of her surroundings  and from her smiling lips flowed sounds which anyone may produce at the same intervals and hold for the same time  but which leave you cold a thousand times and the thousand and first time thrill you and make you weep
natasha  that winter  had for the first time begun to sing seriously  mainly because denisov so delighted in her singing
she no longer sang as a child  there was no longer in her singing that comical  childish  painstaking effect that had been in it before  but she did not yet sing well  as all the connoisseurs who heard her said   it is not trained  but it is a beautiful voice that must be trained   only they generally said this some time after she had finished singing
while that untrained voice  with its incorrect breathing and labored transitions  was sounding  even the connoisseurs said nothing  but only delighted in it and wished to hear it again
in her voice there was a virginal freshness  an unconsciousness of her own powers  and an as yet untrained velvety softness  which so mingled with her lack of art in singing that it seemed as if nothing in that voice could be altered without spoiling it
 what is this   thought nicholas  listening to her with widely opened eyes
 what has happened to her  how she is singing today   and suddenly the whole world centered for him on anticipation of the next note  the next phrase  and everything in the world was divided into three beats   oh mio crudele affetto    
one  two  three  
one  two  three  
one  
 oh mio crudele affetto    
one  two  three  
one
 oh  this senseless life of ours   thought nicholas
 all this misery  and money  and dolokhov  and anger  and honor  it's all nonsense  
but this is real   
now then  natasha  now then  dearest  now then  darling  how will she take that si  she's taken it  thank god   and without noticing that he was singing  to strengthen the si he sung a second  a third below the high note
 ah  god  how fine  did i really take it  how fortunate   he thought
oh  how that chord vibrated  and how moved was something that was finest in rostov's soul  and this something was apart from everything else in the world and above everything in the world
 what were losses  and dolokhov  and words of honor   
all nonsense  one might kill and rob and yet be happy     it was long since rostov had felt such enjoyment from music as he did that day
but no sooner had natasha finished her barcarolle than reality again presented itself
he got up without saying a word and went downstairs to his own room
a quarter of an hour later the old count came in from his club  cheerful and contented
nicholas  hearing him drive up  went to meet him
 well had a good time   said the old count  smiling gaily and proudly at his son
nicholas tried to say  yes   but could not  and he nearly burst into sobs
the count was lighting his pipe and did not notice his son's condition
 ah  it can't be avoided   thought nicholas  for the first and last time
and suddenly  in the most casual tone  which made him feel ashamed of himself  he said  as if merely asking his father to let him have the carriage to drive to town   papa  i have come on a matter of business i was nearly forgetting
i need some money    dear me   said his father  who was in a specially good humor
 i told you it would not be enough
how much    very much   said nicholas flushing  and with a stupid careless smile  for which he was long unable to forgive himself   i have lost a little  i mean a good deal  a great deal forty three thousand    what  to whom    nonsense   cried the count  suddenly reddening with an apoplectic flush over neck and nape as old people do
 i promised to pay tomorrow   said nicholas
 well      said the old count  spreading out his arms and sinking helplessly on the sofa  it can't be helped it happens to everyone   said the son  with a bold  free  and easy tone  while in his soul he regarded himself as a worthless scoundrel whose whole life could not atone for his crime he longed to kiss his father's hands and kneel to beg his forgiveness  but said  in a careless and even rude voice  that it happens to everyone  the old count cast down his eyes on hearing his son's words and began bustlingly searching for something
 yes  yes   he muttered   it will be difficult  i fear  difficult to raise  
happens to everybody  yes  who has not done it   and with a furtive glance at his son's face  the count went out of the room   
nicholas had been prepared for resistance  but had not at all expected this
 papa  pa pa   he called after him  sobbing   forgive me   and seizing his father's hand  he pressed it to his lips and burst into tears
while father and son were having their explanation  the mother and daughter were having one not less important
natasha came running to her mother  quite excited
 mamma   
mamma   
he has made me      made what    made  made me an offer  mamma  mamma   she exclaimed
the countess did not believe her ears
denisov had proposed
to whom  to this chit of a girl  natasha  who not so long ago was playing with dolls and who was still having lessons
 don't  natasha  what nonsense   she said  hoping it was a joke
 nonsense  indeed  i am telling you the fact   said natasha indignantly
 i come to ask you what to do  and you call it 'nonsense '  the countess shrugged her shoulders
 if it is true that monsieur denisov has made you a proposal  tell him he is a fool  that's all    no  he's not a fool   replied natasha indignantly and seriously
 well then  what do you want  you're all in love nowadays
well  if you are in love  marry him   said the countess  with a laugh of annoyance
 good luck to you    no  mamma  i'm not in love with him  i suppose i'm not in love with him    well then  tell him so    mamma  are you cross  don't be cross  dear  is it my fault    no  but what is it  my dear  do you want me to go and tell him   said the countess smiling
 no  i will do it myself  only tell me what to say
it's all very well for you   said natasha  with a responsive smile
 you should have seen how he said it  i know he did not mean to say it  but it came out accidently    well  all the same  you must refuse him    no  i mustn't
i am so sorry for him  he's so nice    well then  accept his offer
it's high time for you to be married   answered the countess sharply and sarcastically
 no  mamma  but i'm so sorry for him
i don't know how i'm to say it    and there's nothing for you to say
i shall speak to him myself   said the countess  indignant that they should have dared to treat this little natasha as grown up
 no  not on any account  i will tell him myself  and you'll listen at the door   and natasha ran across the drawing room to the dancing hall  where denisov was sitting on the same chair by the clavichord with his face in his hands
he jumped up at the sound of her light step
 nataly   he said  moving with rapid steps toward her   decide my fate
it is in your hands    vasili dmitrich  i'm so sorry for you   
no  but you are so nice  
but it won't do   not that  
but as a friend  i shall always love you   denisov bent over her hand and she heard strange sounds she did not understand
she kissed his rough curly black head
at this instant  they heard the quick rustle of the countess' dress
she came up to them
 vasili dmitrich  i thank you for the honor   she said  with an embarrassed voice  though it sounded severe to denisov  but my daughter is so young  and i thought that  as my son's friend  you would have addressed yourself first to me
in that case you would not have obliged me to give this refusal    countess     said denisov  with downcast eyes and a guilty face
he tried to say more  but faltered
natasha could not remain calm  seeing him in such a plight
she began to sob aloud
 countess  i have done w'ong   denisov went on in an unsteady voice   but believe me  i so adore your daughter and all your family that i would give my life twice over     he looked at the countess  and seeing her severe face said   well  good by  countess   and kissing her hand  he left the room with quick resolute strides  without looking at natasha
next day rostov saw denisov off
he did not wish to stay another day in moscow
all denisov's moscow friends gave him a farewell entertainment at the gypsies'  with the result that he had no recollection of how he was put in the sleigh or of the first three stages of his journey
after denisov's departure  rostov spent another fortnight in moscow  without going out of the house  waiting for the money his father could not at once raise  and he spent most of his time in the girls' room
sonya was more tender and devoted to him than ever
it was as if she wanted to show him that his losses were an achievement that made her love him all the more  but nicholas now considered himself unworthy of her he filled the girls' albums with verses and music  and having at last sent dolokhov the whole forty three thousand rubles and received his receipt  he left at the end of november  without taking leave of any of his acquaintances  to overtake his regiment which was already in poland after his interview with his wife pierre left for petersburg
at the torzhok post station  either there were no horses or the postmaster would not supply them
pierre was obliged to wait
without undressing  he lay down on the leather sofa in front of a round table  put his big feet in their overboots on the table  and began to reflect
 will you have the portmanteaus brought in  and a bed got ready  and tea   asked his valet
pierre gave no answer  for he neither heard nor saw anything
he had begun to think of the last station and was still pondering on the same question one so important that he took no notice of what went on around him
not only was he indifferent as to whether he got to petersburg earlier or later  or whether he secured accommodation at this station  but compared to the thoughts that now occupied him it was a matter of indifference whether he remained there for a few hours or for the rest of his life
the postmaster  his wife  the valet  and a peasant woman selling torzhok embroidery came into the room offering their services
without changing his careless attitude  pierre looked at them over his spectacles unable to understand what they wanted or how they could go on living without having solved the problems that so absorbed him he had been engrossed by the same thoughts ever since the day he returned from sokolniki after the duel and had spent that first agonizing  sleepless night
but now  in the solitude of the journey  they seized him with special force
no matter what he thought about  he always returned to these same questions which he could not solve and yet could not cease to ask himself it was as if the thread of the chief screw which held his life together were stripped  so that the screw could not get in or out  but went on turning uselessly in the same place
the postmaster came in and began obsequiously to beg his excellency to wait only two hours  when  come what might  he would let his excellency have the courier horses
it was plain that he was lying and only wanted to get more money from the traveler
 is this good or bad   pierre asked himself  it is good for me  bad for another traveler  and for himself it's unavoidable  because he needs money for food  the man said an officer had once given him a thrashing for letting a private traveler have the courier horses but the officer thrashed him because he had to get on as quickly as possible
and i   continued pierre   shot dolokhov because i considered myself injured  and louis xvi was executed because they considered him a criminal  and a year later they executed those who executed him also for some reason
what is bad  what is good  what should one love and what hate  what does one live for  and what am i  what is life  and what is death  what power governs all   there was no answer to any of these questions  except one  and that not a logical answer and not at all a reply to them
the answer was   you'll die and all will end
you'll die and know all  or cease asking   but dying was also dreadful
the torzhok peddler woman  in a whining voice  went on offering her wares  especially a pair of goatskin slippers
 i have hundreds of rubles i don't know what to do with  and she stands in her tattered cloak looking timidly at me   he thought
 and what does she want the money for  as if that money could add a hair's breadth to happiness or peace of mind
can anything in the world make her or me less a prey to evil and death  death which ends all and must come today or tomorrow at any rate  in an instant as compared with eternity   and again he twisted the screw with the stripped thread  and again it turned uselessly in the same place
his servant handed him a half cut novel  in the form of letters  by madame de souza
he began reading about the sufferings and virtuous struggles of a certain emilie de mansfeld
 and why did she resist her seducer when she loved him   he thought
 god could not have put into her heart an impulse that was against his will
my wife as she once was did not struggle  and perhaps she was right
nothing has been found out  nothing discovered   pierre again said to himself  all we can know is that we know nothing
and that's the height of human wisdom   everything within and around him seemed confused  senseless  and repellent
yet in this very repugnance to all his circumstances pierre found a kind of tantalizing satisfaction  i make bold to ask your excellency to move a little for this gentleman   said the postmaster  entering the room followed by another traveler  also detained for lack of horses
the newcomer was a short  large boned  yellow faced  wrinkled old man  with gray bushy eyebrows overhanging bright eyes of an indefinite grayish color
pierre took his feet off the table  stood up  and lay down on a bed that had been got ready for him  glancing now and then at the newcomer  who  with a gloomy and tired face  was wearily taking off his wraps with the aid of his servant  and not looking at pierre
with a pair of felt boots on his thin bony legs  and keeping on a worn  nankeen covered  sheepskin coat  the traveler sat down on the sofa  leaned back his big head with its broad temples and closecropped hair  and looked at bezukhov
the stern  shrewd  and penetrating expression of that look struck pierre
he felt a wish to speak to the stranger  but by the time he had made up his mind to ask him a question about the roads  the traveler had closed his eyes
his shriveled old hands were folded and on the finger of one of them pierre noticed a large cast iron ring with a seal representing a death's head
the stranger sat without stirring  either resting or  as it seemed to pierre  sunk in profound and calm meditation
his servant was also a yellow  wrinkled old man  without beard or mustache  evidently not because he was shaven but because they had never grown
this active old servant was unpacking the traveler's canteen and preparing tea
he brought in a boiling samovar
when everything was ready  the stranger opened his eyes  moved to the table  filled a tumbler with tea for himself and one for the beardless old man to whom he passed it pierre began to feel a sense of uneasiness  and the need  even the inevitability  of entering into conversation with this stranger
the servant brought back his tumbler turned upside down  * with an unfinished bit of nibbled sugar  and asked if anything more would be wanted
* to indicate he did not want more tea
the traveler became absorbed in it
pierre looked at him
all at once the on the back of the sofa  sat in his former position with his eyes shut
pierre looked at him and had not time to turn away when the old man  opening his eyes  fixed his steady and severe gaze straight on pierre's face
pierre felt confused and wished to avoid that look  but the bright old eyes attracted him irresistibly
 i have the pleasure of addressing count bezukhov  if i am not mistaken   said the stranger in a deliberate and loud voice
pierre looked silently and inquiringly at him over his spectacles
 i have heard of you  my dear sir   continued the stranger   and of your misfortune   he seemed to emphasize the last word  as if to say  yes  misfortune  call it what you please  i know that what happened to you in moscow was a misfortune    i regret it very much  my dear sir   pierre flushed and  hurriedly putting his legs down from the bed  bent forward toward the old man with a forced and timid smile
 i have not referred to this out of curiosity  my dear sir  but for greater reasons   he paused  his gaze still on pierre  and moved aside on the sofa by way of inviting the other to take a seat beside him
pierre felt reluctant to enter into conversation with this old man  but  submitting to him involuntarily  came up and sat down beside him
 you are unhappy  my dear sir   the stranger continued
 you are young and i am old
i should like to help you as far as lies in my power    oh  yes   said pierre  with a forced smile
 i am very grateful to you
where are you traveling from   the stranger's face was not genial  it was even cold and severe  but in spite of this  both the face and words of his new acquaintance were irresistibly attractive to pierre
 but if for reason you don't feel inclined to talk to me   said the old man   say so  my dear sir   and he suddenly smiled  in an unexpected and tenderly paternal way
 oh no  not at all  on the contrary  i am very glad to make your acquaintance   said pierre
and again  glancing at the stranger's hands  he looked more closely at the ring  with its skull a masonic sign
 allow me to ask   he said   are you a mason    yes  i belong to the brotherhood of the freemasons   said the stranger  looking deeper and deeper into pierre's eyes
 and in their name and my own i hold out a brotherly hand to you    i am afraid   said pierre  smiling  and wavering between the confidence the personality of the freemason inspired in him and his own habit of ridiculing the masonic beliefs  i am afraid i am very far from understanding how am i to put it  i am afraid my way of looking at the world is so opposed to yours that we shall not understand one another    i know your outlook   said the mason   and the view of life you mention  and which you think is the result of your own mental efforts  is the one held by the majority of people  and is the invariable fruit of pride  indolence  and ignorance
forgive me  my dear sir  but if i had not known it i should not have addressed you
your view of life is a regrettable delusion    just as i may suppose you to be deluded   said pierre  with a faint smile
 i should never dare to say that i know the truth   said the mason  whose words struck pierre more and more by their precision and firmness
 no one can attain to truth by himself only by laying stone on stone with the cooperation of all  by the millions of generations from our forefather adam to our own times  is that temple reared which is to be a worthy dwelling place of the great god   he added  and closed his eyes
 i ought to tell you that i do not believe  
do not believe in god   said pierre  regretfully and with an effort  feeling it essential to speak the whole truth
the mason looked intently at pierre and smiled as a rich man with millions in hand might smile at a poor fellow who told him that he  poor man  had not the five rubles that would make him happy
 yes  you do not know him  my dear sir   said the mason
 you cannot know him
you do not know him and that is why you are unhappy    yes  yes  i am unhappy   assented pierre
 but what am i to do    you know him not  my dear sir  and so you are very unhappy
you do not know him  but he is here  he is in me  he is in my words  he is in thee  and even in those blasphemous words thou hast just uttered   pronounced the mason in a stern and tremulous voice
he paused and sighed  evidently trying to calm himself  if he were not   he said quietly   you and i would not be speaking of him  my dear sir
of what  of whom  are we speaking  whom hast thou denied   he suddenly asked with exulting austerity and authority in his voice
 who invented him  if he did not exist  whence came thy conception of the existence of such an incomprehensible being  didst thou  and why did the whole world  conceive the idea of the existence of such an incomprehensible being  a being all powerful  eternal  and infinite in all his attributes      he stopped and remained silent for a long time
pierre could not and did not wish to break this silence
 he exists  but to understand him is hard   the mason began again  looking his old hands which from excitement he could not keep still
 if it were a man whose existence thou didst doubt i could bring him to thee  could take him by the hand and show him to thee
but how can i  an insignificant mortal  show his omnipotence  his infinity  and all his mercy to one who is blind  or who shuts his eyes that he may not see or understand him and may not see or understand his own vileness and sinfulness   he paused again
 who art thou  thou dreamest that thou art wise because thou couldst utter those blasphemous words   he went on  with a somber and scornful smile
 and thou art more foolish and unreasonable than a little child  who  playing with the parts of a skillfully made watch  dares to say that  as he does not understand its use  he does not believe in the master who made it
to know him is hard   
for ages  from our forefather adam to our own day  we labor to attain that knowledge and are still infinitely far from our aim  but in our lack of understanding we see only our weakness and his greatness      pierre listened with swelling heart  gazing into the mason's face with shining eyes  not interrupting or questioning him  but believing with his whole soul what the stranger said
whether he accepted the wise reasoning contained in the mason's words  or believed as a child believes  in the speaker's tone of conviction and earnestness  or the tremor of the speaker's voice which sometimes almost broke or those brilliant aged eyes grown old in this conviction  or the calm firmness and certainty of his vocation  which radiated from his whole being  and which struck pierre especially by contrast with his own dejection and hopelessness  at any rate  pierre longed with his whole soul to believe and he did believe  and felt a joyful sense of comfort  regeneration  and return to life
 he is not to be apprehended by reason  but by life   said the mason
 i do not understand   said pierre  feeling with dismay doubts reawakening
he was afraid of any want of clearness  any weakness  in the mason's arguments  he dreaded not to be able to believe in him
 i don't understand   he said   how it is that the mind of man cannot attain the knowledge of which you speak   the mason smiled with his gentle fatherly smile
 the highest wisdom and truth are like the purest liquid we may wish to imbibe   he said
 can i receive that pure liquid into an impure vessel and judge of its purity  only by the inner purification of myself can i retain in some degree of purity the liquid i receive    yes  yes  that is so   said pierre joyfully
 the highest wisdom is not founded on reason alone  not on those worldly sciences of physics  history  chemistry  and the like  into which intellectual knowledge is divided
the highest wisdom is one
the highest wisdom has but one science the science of the whole the science explaining the whole creation and man's place in it
to receive that science it is necessary to purify and renew one's inner self  and so before one can know  it is necessary to believe and to perfect one's self
and to attain this end  we have the light called conscience that god has implanted in our souls    yes  yes   assented pierre
 look then at thy inner self with the eyes of the spirit  and ask thyself whether thou art content with thyself
what hast thou attained relying on reason only  what art thou  you are young  you are rich  you are clever  you are well educated
and what have you done with all these good gifts  are you content with yourself and with your life    no  i hate my life   pierre muttered  wincing
 thou hatest it
then change it  purify thyself  and as thou art purified  thou wilt gain wisdom
look at your life  my dear sir
how have you spent it  in riotous orgies and debauchery  receiving everything from society and giving nothing in return
you have become the possessor of wealth
how have you used it  what have you done for your neighbor  have you ever thought of your tens of thousands of slaves  have you helped them physically and morally  no  you have profited by their toil to lead a profligate life
that is what you have done
have you chosen a post in which you might be of service to your neighbor  no  you have spent your life in idleness
then you married  my dear sir took on yourself responsibility for the guidance of a young woman  and what have you done  you have not helped her to find the way of truth  my dear sir  but have thrust her into an abyss of deceit and misery
a man offended you and you shot him  and you say you do not know god and hate your life
there is nothing strange in that  my dear sir   after these words  the mason  as if tired by his long discourse  again leaned his arms on the back of the sofa and closed his eyes pierre looked at that aged  stern  motionless  almost lifeless face and moved his lips without uttering a sound
he wished to say   yes  a vile  idle  vicious life   but dared not break the silence
the mason cleared his throat huskily  as old men do  and called his servant
 how about the horses   he asked  without looking at pierre
 the exchange horses have just come   answered the servant
 will you not rest here    no  tell them to harness    can he really be going away leaving me alone without having told me all  and without promising to help me   thought pierre  rising with downcast head  and he began to pace the room  glancing occasionally at the mason
 yes  i never thought of it  but i have led a contemptible and profligate life  though i did not like it and did not want to   thought pierre
 but this man knows the truth and  if he wished to  could disclose it to me   pierre wished to say this to the mason  but did not dare to
the traveler  having packed his things with his practiced hands  began fastening his coat
when he had finished  he turned to bezukhov  and said in a tone of indifferent politeness   where are you going to now  my dear sir    i   
i'm going to petersburg   answered pierre  in a childlike  hesitating voice
 i thank you
i agree with all you have said
but do not suppose me to be so bad
with my whole soul i wish to be what you would have me be  but i have never had help from anyone   
but it is i  above all  who am to blame for everything
help me  teach me  and perhaps i may     pierre could not go on
he gulped and turned away
the mason remained silent for a long time  evidently considering
 help comes from god alone   he said   but such measure of help as our order can bestow it will render you  my dear sir
you are going to petersburg
hand large sheet of paper folded in four 
 allow me to give you a piece of advice
when you reach the capital  first of all devote some time to solitude and selfexamination and do not resume your former way of life
and now i wish you a good journey  my dear sir   he added  seeing that his servant had entered  
 and success   the traveler was joseph alexeevich bazdeev  as pierre saw from the martinists  even in novikov's time
for a long while after he had gone  pierre did not go to bed or order horses but paced up and down the room  pondering over his vicious past  and with a rapturous sense of beginning anew pictured to himself the blissful  irreproachable  virtuous future that seemed to him so easy it seemed to him that he had been vicious only because he had somehow forgotten how good it is to be virtuous
not a trace of his former doubts remained in his soul
he firmly believed in the possibility of the brotherhood of men united in the aim of supporting one another in the path of virtue  and that is how freemasonry presented itself to him
on reaching petersburg pierre did not let anyone know of his arrival  he went been sent him by someone unknown
one thing he continually realized as he of attaining perfection  and in the possibility of active brotherly love among men  which joseph alexeevich had revealed to him
a week after his arrival  the young polish count  willarski  whom pierre had known slightly in petersburg society  came into his room one evening in the official and ceremonious manner in which dolokhov's second had called on him  and  having closed the door behind him and satisfied himself that there was nobody else in the room  addressed pierre  i have come to you with a message and an offer  count   he said without sitting down
 a person of very high standing in our brotherhood has made application for you to be received into our order before the usual term and has proposed to me to be your sponsor
i consider it a sacred duty to fulfill that person's wishes
do you wish to enter the brotherhood of freemasons under my sponsorship   the cold  austere tone of this man  whom he had almost always before met at balls  amiably smiling in the society of the most brilliant women  surprised pierre
 yes  i do wish it   said he
willarski bowed his head
 one more question  count   he said   which i beg you to answer in all sincerity not as a future mason but as an honest man  have you renounced your former convictions do you believe in god   pierre considered
 yes  
yes  i believe in god   he said
 in that case     began willarski  but pierre interrupted him
 yes  i do believe in god   he repeated
 in that case we can go   said willarski
 my carriage is at your service   willarski was silent throughout the drive
to pierre's inquiries as to what he must do and how he should answer  willarski only replied that brothers more worthy than he would test him and that pierre had only to tell the truth
having entered the courtyard of a large house where the lodge had its headquarters  and having ascended a dark staircase  they entered a small welllit anteroom where they took off their cloaks without the aid of a servant
from there they passed into another room
a man in strange attire appeared at the door
willarski  stepping toward him  said something to him in french in an undertone and then went up to a small wardrobe in which pierre noticed garments such as he had never seen before
having taken a kerchief from the cupboard  willarski bound pierre's eyes with it and tied it in a knot behind  catching some hairs painfully in the knot
then he drew his face down  kissed him  and taking him by the hand led him forward
the hairs tied in the knot hurt pierre and there were lines of pain on his face and a shamefaced smile
his huge figure  with arms hanging down and with a puckered  though smiling face  moved after willarski with uncertain  timid steps having led him about ten paces  willarski stopped
 whatever happens to you   he said   you must bear it all manfully if you have firmly resolved to join our brotherhood    pierre nodded affirmatively    when you hear a knock at the door  you will uncover your eyes   added willarski
 i wish you courage and success   and  pressing pierre's hand  he went out
left alone  pierre went on smiling in the same way
once or twice he shrugged his shoulders and raised his hand to the kerchief  as if wishing to take it off  but let it drop again
the five minutes spent with his eyes bandaged seemed to him an hour
his arms felt numb  his legs almost gave way  it seemed to him that he was tired out he experienced a variety of most complex sensations
he felt afraid of what would happen to him and still more afraid of showing his fear
he felt curious to know what was going to happen and what would be revealed to him  but most of all  he felt joyful that the moment had come when he would at last start on that path of regeneration and on the actively virtuous life of which he had been dreaming since he met joseph alexeevich
loud knocks were heard at the door
pierre took the bandage off his eyes and glanced around him
the room was in black darkness  only a small lamp was burning inside something white
pierre went nearer and saw that the lamp and the white thing with the lamp inside was a human skull with its cavities and teeth
after reading the first words of the gospel   in the beginning was the word and the word was with god   pierre went round the table and saw a large open box filled with something
it was a coffin with bones inside
he was not at all surprised by what he saw
hoping to enter on an entirely new life quite unlike the old one  he expected everything to be unusual  even more unusual than what he was seeing
a skull  a coffin  the gospel it seemed to him that he had expected all this and even more
trying to stimulate his emotions he looked around
 god  death  love  the brotherhood of man   he kept saying to himself  associating these words with vague yet joyful ideas the door opened and someone came in
by the dim light  to which pierre had already become accustomed  he saw a rather short man
having evidently come from the light into the darkness  the man paused  then moved with cautious steps toward the table and placed on it his small leather gloved hands
this short man had on a white leather apron which covered his chest and part of his legs  he had on a kind of necklace above which rose a high white ruffle  outlining his rather long face which was lit up from below
 for what have you come hither   asked the newcomer  turning in pierre's direction at a slight rustle made by the latter
 why have you  who do not believe in the truth of the light and who have not seen the light  come here  what do you seek from us  wisdom  virtue  enlightenment   at the moment the door opened and the stranger came in  pierre felt a sense of awe and veneration such as he had experienced in his boyhood at confession  he felt himself in the presence of one socially a complete stranger  yet nearer to him through the brotherhood of man with bated breath and beating heart he moved toward the rhetor  by which name the brother who prepared a seeker for entrance into the brotherhood was known 
drawing nearer  he recognized in the rhetor a man he knew  smolyaninov  and it mortified him to think that the newcomer was an acquaintance he wished him simply a brother and a virtuous instructor
for a long time he could not utter a word  so that the rhetor had to repeat his question
 yes  
i  
i  
desire regeneration   pierre uttered with difficulty
 very well   said smolyaninov  and went on at once   have you any idea of the means by which our holy order will help you to reach your aim   said he quietly and quickly
 i  
hope  
for guidance  
help  
in regeneration   said pierre  with a trembling voice and some difficulty in utterance due to his excitement and to being unaccustomed to speak of abstract matters in russian
 what is your conception of freemasonry    i imagine that freemasonry is the fraternity and equality of men who have virtuous aims   said pierre  feeling ashamed of the inadequacy of his words for the solemnity of the moment  as he spoke  i imagine      good   said the rhetor quickly  apparently satisfied with this answer
 have you sought for means of attaining your aim in religion    no  i considered it erroneous and did not follow it   said pierre  so softly that the rhetor did not hear him and asked him what he was saying
 i have been an atheist   answered pierre
 you are seeking for truth in order to follow its laws in your life  therefore you seek wisdom and virtue
is that not so   said the rhetor  after a moment's pause
 yes  yes   assented pierre
the rhetor cleared his throat  crossed his gloved hands on his breast  and began to speak
 now i must disclose to you the chief aim of our order   he said   and if this aim coincides with yours  you may enter our brotherhood with profit
the first and chief object of our order  the foundation on which it rests and which no human power can destroy  is the preservation and handing on to posterity of a certain important mystery  
which has come down to us from the remotest ages  even from the first man a mystery on which perhaps the fate of mankind depends
but since this mystery is of such a nature that nobody can know or use it unless he be prepared by long and diligent self purification  not everyone can hope to attain it quickly
hence we have a secondary aim  that of preparing our members as much as possible to reform their hearts  to purify and enlighten their minds  by means handed on to us by tradition from those who have striven to attain this mystery  and thereby to render them capable of receiving it
 by purifying and regenerating our members we try  thirdly  to improve the whole human race  offering it in our members an example of piety and virtue  and thereby try with all our might to combat the evil which sways the world
think this over and i will come to you again    to combat the evil which sways the world     pierre repeated  and a mental image of his future activity in this direction rose in his mind
he imagined men such as he had himself been a fortnight ago  and he addressed an edifying exhortation to them he imagined to himself vicious and unfortunate people whom he would assist by word and deed  imagined oppressors whose victims he would rescue of the three objects mentioned by the rhetor  this last  that of improving mankind  especially appealed to pierre
the important mystery mentioned by the rhetor  though it aroused his curiosity  did not seem to him essential  and the second aim  that of purifying and regenerating himself  did not much interest him because at that moment he felt with delight that he was already perfectly cured of his former faults and was ready for all that was good half an hour later  the rhetor returned to inform the seeker of the seven virtues  corresponding to the seven steps of solomon's temple  which every freemason should cultivate in himself these virtues were  1
discretion  the keeping of the secrets of the order
2
obedience to those of higher ranks in the order
3
morality
4
love of mankind
5
courage
6
generosity
7
the love of death
 in the seventh place  try  by the frequent thought of death   the rhetor said   to bring yourself to regard it not as a dreaded foe  but as a friend that frees the soul grown weary in the labors of virtue from this distressful life  and leads it to its place of recompense and peace    yes  that must be so   thought pierre  when after these words the rhetor went away  leaving him to solitary meditation
 it must be so  but i am still so weak that i love my life  the meaning of which is only now gradually opening before me   but five of the other virtues which pierre recalled  counting them on his fingers  he felt already in his soul  courage  generosity  morality  love of mankind  and especially obedience which did not even seem to him a virtue  but a joy
 he now felt so glad to be free from his own lawlessness and to submit his will to those who knew the indubitable truth   he forgot what the seventh virtue was and could not recall it
the third time the rhetor came back more quickly and asked pierre whether he was still firm in his intention and determined to submit to all that would be required of him
 i am ready for everything   said pierre
 i must also inform you   said the rhetor   that our order delivers its teaching not in words only but also by other means  which may perhaps have a stronger effect on the sincere seeker after wisdom and virtue than mere words
this chamber with what you see therein should already have suggested to your heart  if it is sincere  more than words could do
you will perhaps also see in your further initiation a like method of enlightenment
our order imitates the ancient societies that explained their teaching by hieroglyphics
a hieroglyph   said the rhetor   is an emblem of something not cognizable by the senses but which possesses qualities resembling those of the symbol   pierre knew very well what a hieroglyph was  but dared not speak
he listened to the rhetor in silence  feeling from all he said that his ordeal was about to begin
 if you are resolved  i must begin your initiation   said the rhetor coming closer to pierre
 in token of generosity i ask you to give me all your valuables    but i have nothing here   replied pierre  supposing that he was asked to give up all he possessed
 what you have with you  watch  money  rings      pierre quickly took out his purse and watch  but could not manage for some time to get the wedding ring off his fat finger
when that had been done  the rhetor said   in token of obedience  i ask you to undress   pierre took off his coat  waistcoat  and left boot according to the rhetor's instructions
the mason drew the shirt back from pierre's left breast  and stooping down pulled up the left leg of his trousers to above the knee
pierre hurriedly began taking off his right boot also and was going to tuck up the other trouser leg to save this stranger the trouble  but the mason told him that was not necessary and gave him a slipper for his left foot
with a childlike smile of embarrassment  doubt  and self derision  which appeared on his face against his will  pierre stood with his arms hanging down and legs apart  before his brother rhetor  and awaited his further commands  and now  in token of candor  i ask you to reveal to me your chief passion   said the latter
 my passion  i have had so many   replied pierre
 that passion which more than all others caused you to waver on the path of virtue   said the mason
pierre paused  seeking a reply
 wine  gluttony  idleness  laziness  irritability  anger  women   he went over his vices in his mind  not knowing to which of them to give the preeminence
 women   he said in a low  scarcely audible voice
the mason did not move and for a long time said nothing after this answer
at last he moved up to pierre and  taking the kerchief that lay on the table  again bound his eyes
 for the last time i say to you turn all your attention upon yourself  put a bridle on your senses  and seek blessedness  not in passion but in your own heart
the source of blessedness is not without us but within      pierre had already long been feeling in himself that refreshing source of blessedness which now flooded his heart with glad emotion soon after this there came into the dark chamber to fetch pierre  not the rhetor but pierre's sponsor  willarski  whom he recognized by his voice to fresh questions as to the firmness of his resolution pierre replied   yes  yes  i agree   and with a beaming  childlike smile  his fat chest uncovered  stepping unevenly and timidly in one slippered and one booted foot  he advanced  while willarski held a sword to his bare chest
he was conducted from that room along passages that turned backwards and forwards and was at last brought to the doors of the lodge
willarski coughed  he was answered by the masonic knock with mallets  the doors opened before them
a bass voice  pierre was still blindfolded  questioned him as to who he was  when and where he was born  and so on
then he was again led somewhere still blindfolded  and as they went along he was told allegories of the toils of his pilgrimage  of holy friendship  of the eternal architect of the universe  and of the courage with which he should endure toils and dangers
during these wanderings  pierre noticed that he was spoken of now as the  seeker   now as the  sufferer   and now as the  postulant   to the accompaniment of various knockings with mallets and swords
as he was being led up to some object he noticed a hesitation and uncertainty among his conductors
he heard those around him disputing in whispers and one of them insisting that he should be led along a certain carpet
after that they took his right hand  placed it on something  and told him to hold a pair of compasses to his left breast with the other hand and to repeat after someone who read aloud an oath of fidelity to the laws of the order
the candles were then extinguished and some spirit lighted  as pierre knew by the smell  and he was told that he would now see the lesser light
the bandage was taken off his eyes and  by the faint light of the burning spirit  pierre  as in a dream  saw several men standing before him  wearing aprons like the rhetor's and holding swords in their hands pointed at his breast
among them stood a man whose white shirt was stained with blood
on seeing this  pierre moved forward with his breast toward the swords  meaning them to pierce it
but the swords were drawn back from him and he was at once blindfolded again
 now thou hast seen the lesser light   uttered a voice
then the candles were relit and he was told that he would see the full light  the bandage was again removed and more than ten voices said together   sic transit gloria mundi   pierre gradually began to recover himself and looked about at the room and at the people in it round a long table covered with black sat some twelve men in garments like those he had already seen
some of them pierre had met in petersburg society
in the president's chair sat a young man he did not know  with a peculiar cross hanging from his neck
on his right sat the italian abbe whom pierre had met at anna pavlovna's two years before
there were also present a very distinguished dignitary and a swiss who had formerly been tutor at the kuragins'
all maintained a solemn silence  listening to the words of the president  who held a mallet in his hand
let into the wall was a starshaped light
at one side of the table was a small carpet with various figures worked upon it  at the other was something resembling an altar on which lay a testament and a skull
round it stood seven large candlesticks like those used in churches
two of the brothers led pierre up to the altar  placed his feet at right angles  and bade him lie down  saying that he must prostrate himself at the gates of the temple  he must first receive the trowel   whispered one of the brothers
 oh  hush  please   said another
pierre  perplexed  looked round with his shortsighted eyes without obeying  and suddenly doubts arose in his mind
 where am i  what am i doing  aren't they laughing at me  shan't i be ashamed to remember this   but these doubts only lasted a moment
pierre glanced at the serious faces of those around  remembered all he had already gone through  and realized that he could not stop halfway
he was aghast at his hesitation and  trying to arouse his former devotional feeling  prostrated himself before the gates of the temple and really  the feeling of devotion returned to him even more strongly than before
when he had lain there some time  he was told to get up  and a white leather apron  such as the others wore  was put on him  he was given a trowel and three pairs of gloves  and then the grand master addressed him
he told him that he should try to do nothing to stain the whiteness of that apron  which symbolized strength and purity  then of the unexplained trowel  he told him to toil with it to cleanse his own heart from vice  and indulgently to smooth with it the heart of his neighbor
as to the first pair of gloves  a man's  he said that pierre could not know their meaning but must keep them
the second pair of man's gloves he was to wear at the meetings  and finally of the third  a pair of women's gloves  he said   dear brother  these woman's gloves are intended for you too
give them to the woman whom you shall honor most of all
this gift will be a pledge of your purity of heart to her whom you select to be your worthy helpmeet in masonry   and after a pause  he added   but beware  dear brother  that these gloves do not deck hands that are unclean   while the grand master said these last words it seemed to pierre that he grew embarrassed
pierre himself grew still more confused  blushed like a child till tears came to his eyes  began looking about him uneasily  and an awkward pause followed this silence was broken by one of the brethren  who led pierre up to the rug figures on it  the sun  the moon  a hammer  a plumb line  a trowel  a rough stone and a squared stone  a pillar  three windows  and so on
then a place was assigned to pierre  he was shown the signs of the lodge  told the password  and at last was permitted to sit down
the grand master began reading the statutes
they were very long  and pierre  from joy  agitation  and embarrassment  was not in a state to understand what was being read
he managed to follow only the last words of the statutes and these remained in his mind
 in our temples we recognize no other distinctions   read the grand master   but those between virtue and vice
beware of making any distinctions which may infringe equality
fly to a brother's aid whoever he may be  exhort him who goeth astray  raise him that falleth  never bear malice or enmity toward thy brother
be kindly and courteous
kindle in all hearts the flame of virtue
share thy happiness with thy neighbor  and may envy never dim the purity of that bliss
forgive thy enemy  do not avenge thyself except by doing him good
thus fulfilling the highest law thou shalt regain traces of the ancient dignity which thou hast lost   he finished and  getting up  embraced and kissed pierre  who  with tears of joy in his eyes  looked round him  not knowing how to answer the congratulations and greetings from acquaintances that met him on all sides
he acknowledged no acquaintances but saw in all these men only brothers  and burned with impatience to set to work with them
the grand master rapped with his mallet
all the masons sat down in their places  and one of them read an exhortation on the necessity of humility
the grand master proposed that the last duty should be performed  and the distinguished dignitary who bore the title of  collector of alms  went round to all the brothers pierre would have liked to subscribe all he had  but fearing that it might look like pride subscribed the same amount as the others
the meeting was at an end  and on reaching home pierre felt as if he had returned from a long journey on which he had spent dozens of years  had become completely changed  and had quite left behind his former habits and way of life
the day after he had been received into the lodge  pierre was sitting at home which symbolized god  another moral things  a third physical things  and the fourth a combination of these
now and then his attention wandered from the previous evening at the lodge  he had heard that a rumor of his duel had reached the emperor and that it would be wiser for him to leave petersburg
pierre proposed going to his estates in the south and there attending to the welfare of his serfs
he was joyfully planning this new life  when prince vasili suddenly entered the room
 my dear fellow  what have you been up to in moscow  why have you quarreled with helene  mon cher  you are under a delusion   said prince vasili  as he entered
 i know all about it  and i can tell you positively that helene is as innocent before you as christ was before the jews   pierre was about to reply  but prince vasili interrupted him
 and why didn't you simply come straight to me as to a friend  i know all about it and understand it all   he said
 you behaved as becomes a man who values his honor  perhaps too hastily  but we won't go into that
but consider the position in which you are placing her and me in the eyes of society  and even of the court   he added  lowering his voice
 she is living in moscow and you are here
remember  dear boy   and he drew pierre's arm downwards   it is simply a misunderstanding
i expect you feel it so yourself
let us write her a letter at once  and she'll come here and all will be explained  or else  my dear boy  let me tell you it's quite likely you'll have to suffer for it   prince vasili gave pierre a significant look
 i know from reliable sources that the dowager empress is taking a keen interest in the whole affair
you know she is very gracious to helene   pierre tried several times to speak  but  on one hand  prince vasili did not let him and  on the other  pierre himself feared to begin to speak in the tone of decided refusal and disagreement in which he had firmly resolved to answer his father in law moreover  the words of the masonic statutes   be kindly and courteous   recurred to him
he blinked  went red  got up and sat down again  struggling with himself to do what was for him the most difficult thing in life  to say an unpleasant thing to a man's face  to say what the other  whoever he might be  did not expect he was so used to submitting to prince vasili's tone of careless self assurance that he felt he would be unable to withstand it now  but he also felt that on what he said now his future depended whether he would follow the same old road  or that new path so attractively shown him by the masons  on which he firmly believed he would be reborn to a new life
 now  dear boy   said prince vasili playfully   say 'yes ' and i'll write to her myself  and we will kill the fatted calf   but before prince vasili had finished his playful speech  pierre  without looking at him  and with a kind of fury that made him like his father  muttered in a whisper   prince  i did not ask you here
go  please go   and he jumped up and opened the door for him
 go   he repeated  amazed at himself and glad to see the look of confusion and fear that showed itself on prince vasili's face  what's the matter with you  are you ill    go   the quivering voice repeated
and prince vasili had to go without receiving any explanation
a week later  pierre  having taken leave of his new friends  the masons  and leaving large sums of money with them for alms  went away to his estates his new brethren gave him letters to the kiev and odessa masons and promised to write to him and guide him in his new activity
the duel between pierre and dolokhov was hushed up and  in spite of the emperor's severity regarding duels at that time  neither the principals nor their seconds suffered for it
but the story of the duel  confirmed by pierre's rupture with his wife  was the talk of society
pierre who had been regarded with patronizing condescension when he was an illegitimate son  and petted and extolled when he was the best match in russia  had sunk greatly in the esteem of society after his marriage when the marriageable daughters and their mothers had nothing to hope from him especially as he did not know how  and did not wish  to court society's favor
now he alone was blamed for what had happened  he was said to be insanely jealous and subject like his father to fits of bloodthirsty rage
and when after pierre's departure helene returned to petersburg  she was received by all her acquaintances not only cordially  but even with a shade of deference due to her misfortune
when conversation turned on her husband helene assumed a dignified expression  which with characteristic tact she had acquired though she did not understand its significance
this expression suggested that she had resolved to endure her troubles uncomplainingly and that her husband was a cross laid upon her by god
prince vasili expressed his opinion more openly
he shrugged his shoulders when pierre was mentioned and  pointing to his forehead  remarked   a bit touched i always said so    i said from the first   declared anna pavlovna referring to pierre   i said at the time and before anyone else   she insisted on her priority   that that senseless young man was spoiled by the depraved ideas of these days
i said so even at the time when everybody was in raptures about him  when he had just returned from abroad  and when  if you remember  he posed as a sort of marat at one of my soirees
and how has it ended  i was against this marriage even then and foretold all that has happened   anna pavlovna continued to give on free evenings the same kind of soirees as before such as she alone had the gift of arranging at which was to be found  the cream of really good society  the bloom of the intellectual essence of petersburg   as she herself put it
besides this refined selection of society anna pavlovna's receptions were also distinguished by the fact that she always presented some new and interesting person to the visitors and that nowhere else was the state of the political thermometer of legitimate petersburg court society so dearly and distinctly indicated
toward the end of 1806  when all the sad details of napoleon's destruction of the prussian army at jena and auerstadt and the surrender of most of the prussian fortresses had been received  when our troops had already entered prussia and our second war with napoleon was beginning  anna pavlovna gave one of her soirees
the  cream of really good society  consisted of the fascinating helene  forsaken by her husband  mortemart  the delightful prince hippolyte who had just returned from vienna  two diplomatists  the old aunt  a young man referred to in that drawing room as  a man of great merit   un homme de beaucoup de merite   a newly appointed maid of honor and her mother  and several other less noteworthy persons
the novelty anna pavlovna was setting before her guests that evening was boris drubetskoy  who had just arrived as a special messenger from the prussian army and was aide de camp to a very important personage
the temperature shown by the political thermometer to the company that evening was this   whatever the european sovereigns and commanders may do to countenance bonaparte  and to cause me  and us in general  annoyance and mortification  our opinion of bonaparte cannot alter
we shall not cease to express our sincere views on that subject  and can only say to the king of prussia and others  'so much the worse for you
tu l'as voulu  george dandin ' that's all we have to say about it   when boris  who was to be served up to the guests  entered the drawing room  almost all the company had assembled  and the conversation  guided by anna pavlovna  was about our diplomatic relations with austria and the hope of an alliance with her
boris  grown more manly and looking fresh  rosy and self possessed  entered the drawing room elegantly dressed in the uniform of an aide de camp and was duly conducted to pay his respects to the aunt and then brought back to the general circle
anna pavlovna gave him her shriveled hand to kiss and introduced him to several persons whom he did not know  giving him a whispered description of each
 prince hippolyte kuragin  m
krug  the charge d'affaires from copenhagen  a profound intellect   and simply   mr shitov a man of great merit  this of the man usually so described
thanks to anna mikhaylovna's efforts  his own tastes  and the peculiarities of his reserved nature  boris had managed during his service to place himself very advantageously he was aide de camp to a very important personage  had been sent on a very important mission to prussia  and had just returned from there as a special messenger
he had become thoroughly conversant with that unwritten code with which he had been so pleased at olmutz and according to which an ensign might rank incomparably higher than a general  and according to which what was needed for success in the service was not effort or work  or courage  or perseverance  but only the knowledge of how to get on with those who can grant rewards  and he was himself often surprised at the rapidity of his success and at the inability of others to understand these things in consequence of this discovery his whole manner of life  all his relations with old friends  all his plans for his future  were completely altered
he was not rich  but would spend his last groat to be better dressed than others  and would rather deprive himself of many pleasures than allow himself to be seen in a shabby equipage or appear in the streets of petersburg in an old uniform he made friends with and sought the acquaintance of only those above him in position and who could therefore be of use to him
he liked petersburg and despised moscow
the remembrance of the rostovs' house and of his childish love for natasha was unpleasant to him and he had not once been to see the rostovs since the day of his departure for the army
to be in anna pavlovna's drawing room he considered an important step up in the service  and he at once understood his role  letting his hostess make use of whatever interest he had to offer
he himself carefully scanned each face  appraising the possibilities of establishing intimacy with each of those present  and the advantages that might accrue he took the seat indicated to him beside the fair helene and listened to the general conversation
 vienna considers the bases of the proposed treaty so unattainable that not even a continuity of most brilliant successes would secure them  and she doubts the means we have of gaining them
that is the actual phrase used by the vienna cabinet   said the danish charge d'affaires
 the doubt is flattering   said  the man of profound intellect   with a subtle smile
 we must distinguish between the vienna cabinet and the emperor of austria   said mortemart
 the emperor of austria can never have thought of such a thing  it is only the cabinet that says it    ah  my dear vicomte   put in anna pavlovna   l'urope   for some reason she called it urope as if that were a specially refined french pronunciation which she could allow herself when conversing with a frenchman    l'urope ne sera jamais notre alliee sincere   * *  europe will never be our sincere ally   after that anna pavlovna led up to the courage and firmness of the king of prussia  in order to draw boris into the conversation
boris listened attentively to each of the speakers  awaiting his turn  but managed meanwhile to look round repeatedly at his neighbor  the beautiful helene  whose eyes several times met those of the handsome young aide decamp with a smile
speaking of the position of prussia  anna pavlovna very naturally asked boris to tell them about his journey to glogau and in what state he found the prussian army
boris  speaking with deliberation  told them in pure  correct french many interesting details about the armies and the court  carefully abstaining from expressing an opinion of his own about the facts he was recounting
for some time he engrossed the general attention  and anna pavlovna felt that the novelty she had served up was received with pleasure by all her visitors
the greatest attention of all to boris' narrative was shown by helene
she asked him several questions about his journey and seemed greatly interested in the state of the prussian army
as soon as he had finished she turned to him with her usual smile
 you absolutely must come and see me   she said in a tone that implied that  for certain considerations he could not know of  this was absolutely necessary
 on tuesday between eight and nine
it will give me great pleasure   boris promised to fulfill her wish and was about to begin a conversation with her  when anna pavlovna called him away on the pretext that her aunt wished to hear him
 you know her husband  of course   said anna pavlovna  closing her eyes and indicating helene with a sorrowful gesture
 ah  she is such an unfortunate and charming woman  don't mention him before her please don't  it is too painful for her   when boris and anna pavlovna returned to the others prince hippolyte had the ear of the company
bending forward in his armchair he said   le roi de prusse   and having said this laughed
everyone turned toward him
 le roi de prusse   hippolyte said interrogatively  again laughing  and then calmly and seriously sat back in his chair
anna pavlovna waited for him to go on  but as he seemed quite decided to say no more she began to tell of how at potsdam the impious bonaparte had stolen the sword of frederick the great
 it is the sword of frederick the great which i     she began  but hippolyte interrupted her with the words   le roi de prusse     and again  as soon as all turned toward him  excused himself and said no more anna pavlovna frowned
mortemart  hippolyte's friend  addressed him firmly
 come now  what about your roi de prusse   hippolyte laughed as if ashamed of laughing
 oh  it's nothing
i only wished to say      he wanted to repeat a joke he had heard in vienna and which he had been trying all that evening to get in   i only wished to say that we are wrong to fight pour le roi de prusse   boris smiled circumspectly  so that it might be taken as ironical or appreciative according to the way the joke was received everybody laughed
 your joke is too bad  it's witty but unjust   said anna pavlovna  shaking her little shriveled finger at him
 we are not fighting pour le roi de prusse  but for right principles
oh  that wicked prince hippolyte   she said
the conversation did not flag all evening and turned chiefly on the political news
it became particularly animated toward the end of the evening when the rewards bestowed by the emperor were mentioned
 you know n  n  received a snuffbox with the portrait last year   said  the man of profound intellect    why shouldn't s  s  get the same distinction    pardon me  a snuffbox with the emperor's portrait is a reward but not a distinction   said the diplomatist  a gift  rather    there are precedents  i may mention schwarzenberg    it's impossible   replied another
 will you bet  the ribbon of the order is a different matter      when everybody rose to go  helene who had spoken very little all the evening again turned to boris  asking him in a tone of caressing significant command to come to her on tuesday
 it is of great importance to me   she said  turning with a smile toward anna pavlovna  and anna pavlovna  with the same sad smile with which she spoke of her exalted patroness  supported helene's wish
it seemed as if from some words boris had spoken that evening about the prussian army  helene had suddenly found it necessary to see him
she seemed to promise to explain that necessity to him when he came on tuesday
but on tuesday evening  having come to helene's splendid salon  boris received no clear explanation of why it had been necessary for him to come
there were other guests and the countess talked little to him  and only as he kissed her hand on taking leave said unexpectedly and in a whisper  with a strangely unsmiling face   come to dinner tomorrow  
in the evening
you must come   
come   during that stay in petersburg  boris became an intimate in the countess' house
the war was flaming up and nearing the russian frontier
everywhere one heard curses on bonaparte   the enemy of mankind   militiamen and recruits were being enrolled in the villages  and from the seat of war came contradictory news  false as usual and therefore variously interpreted
the life of old prince bolkonski  prince andrew  and princess mary had greatly changed since 1805
in 1806 the old prince was made one of the eight commanders in chief then appointed to supervise the enrollment decreed throughout russia
despite the weakness of age  which had become particularly noticeable since the time when he thought his son had been killed  he did not think it right to refuse a duty to which he had been appointed by the emperor himself  and this fresh opportunity for action gave him new energy and strength he was continually traveling through the three provinces entrusted to him  was pedantic in the fulfillment of his duties  severe to cruel with his subordinates  and went into everything down to the minutest details himself princess mary had ceased taking lessons in mathematics from her father  and when the old prince was at home went to his study with the wet nurse and little prince nicholas  as his grandfather called him 
the baby prince nicholas lived with his wet nurse and nurse savishna in the late princess' rooms and princess mary spent most of the day in the nursery  taking a mother's place to her little nephew as best she could mademoiselle bourienne  too  seemed passionately fond of the boy  and princess mary often deprived herself to give her friend the pleasure of dandling the little angel as she called her nephew and playing with him
near the altar of the church at bald hills there was a chapel over the tomb of the little princess  and in this chapel was a marble monument brought from italy  representing an angel with outspread wings ready to fly upwards
the angel's upper lip was slightly raised as though about to smile  and once on coming out of the chapel prince andrew and princess mary admitted to one another that the angel's face reminded them strangely of the little princess
but what was still stranger  though of this prince andrew said nothing to his sister  was that in the expression the sculptor had happened to give the angel's face  prince andrew read the same mild reproach he had read on the face of his dead wife   ah  why have you done this to me   soon after prince andrew's return the old prince made over to him a large estate  bogucharovo  about twenty five miles from bald hills
partly because of the depressing memories associated with bald hills  partly because prince andrew did not always feel equal to bearing with his father's peculiarities  and partly because he needed solitude  prince andrew made use of bogucharovo  began building and spent most of his time there
after the austerlitz campaign prince andrew had firmly resolved not to continue his military service  and when the war recommenced and everybody had to serve  he took a post under his father in the recruitment so as to avoid active service
the old prince and his son seemed to have changed roles since the campaign of 1805
the old man  roused by activity  expected the best results from the new campaign  while prince andrew on the contrary  taking no part in the war and secretly regretting this  saw only the dark side
on february 26  1807  the old prince set off on one of his circuits
prince andrew remained at bald hills as usual during his father's absence
little nicholas had been unwell for four days
the coachman who had driven the old prince to town returned bringing papers and letters for prince andrew
not finding the young prince in his study the valet went with the letters to princess mary's apartments  but did not find him there
he was told that the prince had gone to the nursery
 if you please  your excellency  petrusha has brought some papers   said one of the nursemaids to prince andrew who was sitting on a child's little chair while  frowning and with trembling hands  he poured drops from a medicine bottle into a wineglass half full of water
 what is it   he said crossly  and  his hand shaking unintentionally  he poured too many drops into the glass
he threw the mixture onto the floor and asked for some more water
the maid brought it
there were in the room a child's cot  two boxes  two armchairs  a table  a child's table  and the little chair on which prince andrew was sitting
the curtains were drawn  and a single candle was burning on the table  screened by  my dear   said princess mary  addressing her brother from beside the cot where she was standing   better wait a bit  
later      oh  leave off  you always talk nonsense and keep putting things off and this is what comes of it   said prince andrew in an exasperated whisper  evidently meaning to wound his sister
 my dear  really  
it's better not to wake him  
he's asleep   said the princess in a tone of entreaty
prince andrew got up and went on tiptoe up to the little bed  wineglass in hand
 perhaps we'd really better not wake him   he said hesitating
 as you please  
really  
i think so  
but as you please   said princess mary  evidently intimidated and confused that her opinion had prevailed
she drew her brother's attention to the maid who was calling him in a whisper
it was the second night that neither of them had slept  watching the boy who was in a high fever
these last days  mistrusting their household doctor and expecting another for whom they had sent to town  they had been trying first one remedy and then another
worn out by sleeplessness and anxiety they threw their burden of sorrow on one another and reproached and disputed with each other
 petrusha has come with papers from your father   whispered the maid
prince andrew went out
 devil take them   he muttered  and after listening to the verbal instructions his father had sent and taking the correspondence and his father's letter  he returned to the nursery
 well   he asked
 still the same
wait  for heaven's sake
karl ivanich always says that sleep is more important than anything   whispered princess mary with a sigh
prince andrew went up to the child and felt him
he was burning hot
 confound you and your karl ivanich   he took the glass with the drops and again went up to the cot
 andrew  don't   said princess mary
but he scowled at her angrily though also with suffering in his eyes  and stooped glass in hand over the infant
 but i wish it   he said
 i beg you give it him   princess mary shrugged her shoulders but took the glass submissively and calling the nurse began giving the medicine
the child screamed hoarsely
prince andrew winced and  clutching his head  went out and sat down on a sofa in the next room
he still had all the letters in his hand
opening them mechanically he began reading
the old prince  now and then using abbreviations  wrote in his large elongated hand on blue paper as follows  have just this moment received by special messenger very joyful news if it's not false
bennigsen seems to have obtained a complete victory over buonaparte at eylau in petersburg everyone is rejoicing  and the rewards sent to the army are innumerable
though he is a german i congratulate him  i can't make out what the commander at korchevo a certain khandrikov is up to  till now the additional men and provisions have not arrived
gallop off to him at once and say i'll have his head off if everything is not here in a week
have received another letter about the preussisch eylau battle from petenka  he took part in it and it's all true
when mischief makers don't meddle even a german beats buonaparte
he is said to be fleeing in great disorder
mind you gallop off to korchevo without delay and carry out instructions  prince andrew sighed and broke the seal of another envelope
it was a closely written letter of two sheets from bilibin
he folded it up without reading it and reread his father's letter  ending with the words   gallop off to korchevo and carry out instructions    no  pardon me  i won't go now till the child is better   thought he  going to the door and looking into the nursery
princess mary was still standing by the cot  gently rocking the baby
 ah yes  and what else did he say that's unpleasant   thought prince andrew  recalling his father's letter
 yes  we have gained a victory over bonaparte  just when i'm not serving
yes  yes  he's always poking fun at me   
ah  well  let him   and he began reading bilibin's letter which was written in french
he read without understanding half of it  read only to forget  if but for a moment  what he had too long been thinking of so painfully to the exclusion of all else
bilibin was now at army headquarters in a diplomatic capacity  and though he wrote in french and used french jests and french idioms  he described the whole campaign with a fearless self censure and self derision genuinely russian bilibin wrote that the obligation of diplomatic discretion tormented him  and he was happy to have in prince andrew a reliable correspondent to whom he could pour out the bile he had accumulated at the sight of all that was being done in the army
the letter was old  having been written before the battle at preussisch eylau
 since the day of our brilliant success at austerlitz   wrote bilibin   as you know  my dear prince  i never leave headquarters
i have certainly acquired a taste for war  and it is just as well for me  what i have seen during these last three months is incredible
 i begin ab ovo
'the enemy of the human race ' as you know  attacks the prussians
the prussians are our faithful allies who have only betrayed us three times in three years
we take up their cause  but it turns out that 'the enemy of the human race' pays no heed to our fine speeches and in his rude and savage way throws himself on the prussians without giving them time to finish the parade they had begun  and in two twists of the hand he breaks them to smithereens and installs himself in the palace at potsdam  'i most ardently desire ' writes the king of prussia to bonaparte  'that your majesty should be received and treated in my palace in a manner agreeable to yourself  and in so far as circumstances allowed  i have hastened to take all steps to that end may i have succeeded ' the prussian generals pride themselves on being polite to the french and lay down their arms at the first demand  the head of the garrison at glogau  with ten thousand men  asks the king of prussia what he is to do if he is summoned to surrender   
all this is absolutely true
 in short  hoping to settle matters by taking up a warlike attitude  it turns out that we have landed ourselves in war  and what is more  in war on our own frontiers  with and for the king of prussia
we have everything in perfect order  only one little thing is lacking  namely  a commander in chief
as it was considered that the austerlitz success might have been more decisive had the commander in chief not been so young  all our octogenarians were reviewed  and of prozorovski and kamenski the latter was preferred
the general comes to us  suvorov like  in a kibitka  and is received with acclamations of joy and triumph
 on the 4th  the first courier arrives from petersburg
the mails are taken to the field marshal's room  for he likes to do everything himself i am called in to help sort the letters and take those meant for us
the field marshal looks on and waits for letters addressed to him
we search  but none are to be found
the field marshal grows impatient and sets to work himself and finds letters from the emperor to count t   prince v   and others then he bursts into one of his wild furies and rages at everyone and everything  seizes the letters  opens them  and reads those from the emperor addressed to others
'ah  so that's the way they treat me  no confidence in me  ah  ordered to keep an eye on me  very well then  get along with you ' so he writes the famous order of the day to general bennigsen  'i am wounded and cannot ride and consequently cannot command the army
you have brought your army corps to pultusk  routed  here it is exposed  and without fuel or forage  so something must be done  and  as you yourself reported to count buxhowden yesterday  you must think of retreating to our frontier which do today '  'from all my riding ' he writes to the emperor  'i have got a saddle sore which  coming after all my previous journeys  quite prevents my riding and commanding so vast an army  so i have passed on the command to the general next in seniority  count buxhowden  having sent him my whole staff and all that belongs to it  advising him if there is a lack of bread  to move farther into the interior of prussia  for only one day's ration of bread remains  and in some regiments none at all  as reported by the division commanders  ostermann and sedmoretzki  and all that the peasants had has been eaten up
i myself will remain in hospital at ostrolenka till i recover
in regard to which i humbly submit my report  with the information that if the army remains in its present bivouac another fortnight there will not be a healthy man left in it by spring
 'grant leave to retire to his country seat to an old man who is already in any case dishonored by being unable to fulfill the great and glorious task for which he was chosen
i shall await your most gracious permission here in hospital  that i may not have to play the part of a secretary rather than commander in the army
my removal from the army does not produce the slightest stir a blind man has left it
there are thousands such as i in russia '  the field marshal is angry with the emperor and he punishes us all  isn't it logical   this is the first act
those that follow are naturally increasingly interesting and entertaining
after the field marshal's departure it appears that we are within sight of the enemy and must give battle
buxhowden is commander inchief by seniority  but general bennigsen does not quite see it  more particularly as it is he and his corps who are within sight of the enemy and he wishes to profit by the opportunity to fight a battle 'on his own hand' as the germans say
he does so
this is the battle of pultusk  which is considered a great victory but in my opinion was nothing of the kind
we civilians  as you know  have a very bad way of deciding whether a battle was won or lost
those who retreat after a battle have lost it is what we say  and according to that it is we who lost the battle of pultusk
in short  we retreat after the battle but send a courier to petersburg with news of a victory  and general bennigsen  hoping to receive from petersburg the post of commander in chief as a reward for his victory  does not give up the command of the army to general buxhowden
during this interregnum we begin a very original and interesting series of maneuvers
our aim is no longer  as it should be  to avoid or attack the enemy  but solely to avoid general buxhowden who by right of seniority should be our chief
so energetically do we pursue this aim that after crossing an unfordable river we burn the bridges to separate ourselves from our enemy  who at the moment is not bonaparte but buxhowden
general buxhowden was all but attacked and captured by a superior enemy force as a result of one of these maneuvers that enabled us to escape him
buxhowden pursues us we scuttle
he hardly crosses the river to our side before we recross to the other
at last our enemy  buxhowden  catches us and attacks
both generals are angry  and the result is a challenge on buxhowden's part and an epileptic fit on bennigsen's
but at the critical moment the courier who carried the news of our victory at pultusk to petersburg returns bringing our appointment as commander in chief  and our first foe  buxhowden  is vanquished  we can now turn our thoughts to the second  bonaparte
but as it turns out  just at that moment a third enemy rises before us namely the orthodox russian soldiers  loudly demanding bread  meat  biscuits  fodder  and whatnot  the stores are empty  the roads impassable
the orthodox begin looting  and in a way of which our last campaign can give you no idea
half the regiments form bands and scour the countryside and put everything to fire and sword
the inhabitants are totally ruined  the hospitals overflow with sick  and famine is everywhere
twice the marauders even attack our headquarters  and the commander in chief has to ask for a battalion to disperse them
during one of these attacks they carried off my empty portmanteau and my dressing gown
the emperor proposes to give all commanders of divisions the right to shoot marauders  but i much fear this will oblige one half the army to shoot the other   at first prince andrew read with his eyes only  but after a while  in spite of himself  although he knew how far it was safe to trust bilibin   what he had read began to interest him more and more when he had read thus far  he crumpled the letter up and threw it away
it was not what he had read that vexed him  but the fact that the life out there in which he had now no part could perturb him
he shut his eyes  rubbed his forehead as if to rid himself of all interest in what he had read  and listened to what was passing in the nursery suddenly he thought he heard a strange noise through the door
he was seized with alarm lest something should have happened to the child while he was reading the letter
he went on tiptoe to the nursery door and opened it
just as he went in he saw that the nurse was hiding something from him with a scared look and that princess mary was no longer by the cot
 my dear   he heard what seemed to him her despairing whisper behind him
as often happens after long sleeplessness and long anxiety  he was seized by an unreasoning panic it occurred to him that the child was dead
all that he saw and heard seemed to confirm this terror
 all is over   he thought  and a cold sweat broke out on his forehead
he went to the cot in confusion  sure that he would find it empty and that the nurse had been hiding the dead baby
he drew the curtain aside and for some time his frightened  restless eyes could not find the baby
at last he saw him  the rosy boy had tossed about till he lay across the bed with his head lower than the pillow  and was smacking his lips in his sleep and breathing evenly
prince andrew was as glad to find the boy like that  as if he had already lost him
he bent over him and  as his sister had taught him  tried with his lips whether the child was still feverish
the soft forehead was moist
prince andrew touched the head with his hand  even the hair was wet  so profusely had the child perspired
he was not dead  but evidently the crisis was over and he was convalescent
prince andrew longed to snatch up  to squeeze  to hold to his heart  this helpless little creature  but dared not do so
he stood over him  gazing at his head and at the little arms and legs which showed under the blanket he heard a rustle behind him and a shadow appeared under the curtain of the cot
he did not look round  but still gazing at the infant's face listened to his regular breathing
the dark shadow was princess mary  who had come up to the cot with noiseless steps  lifted the curtain  and dropped it again behind her
prince andrew recognized her without looking and held out his hand to her
she pressed it
 he has perspired   said prince andrew
 i was coming to tell you so   the child moved slightly in his sleep  smiled  and rubbed his forehead against the pillow
prince andrew looked at his sister
in the dim shadow of the curtain her luminous eyes shone more brightly than usual from the tears of joy that were in them
she leaned over to her brother and kissed him  slightly catching the curtain of the cot
each made the other a warning gesture and stood still in the dim light beneath the curtain as if not wishing to leave that seclusion where they three were shut off from all the world
prince andrew was the first to move away  ruffling his hair against the muslin of the curtain
 yes  this is the one thing left me now   he said with a sigh
soon after his admission to the masonic brotherhood  pierre went to the kiev province  where he had the greatest number of serfs  taking with him full directions which he had written down for his own guidance as to what he should do on his estates
when he reached kiev he sent for all his stewards to the head office and explained to them his intentions and wishes
he told them that steps would be taken immediately to free his serfs and that till then they were not to be overburdened with labor  women while nursing their babies were not to be sent to work  assistance was to be given to the serfs  punishments were to be admonitory and not corporal  and hospitals  asylums  and schools were to be established on all the estates some of the stewards  there were semiliterate foremen among them  listened with alarm  supposing these words to mean that the young count was displeased with their management and embezzlement of money  some after their first fright were amused by pierre's lisp and the new words they had not heard before  others simply enjoyed hearing how the master talked  while the cleverest among them  including the chief steward  understood from this speech how they could best handle the master for their own ends
the chief steward expressed great sympathy with pierre's intentions  but remarked that besides these changes it would be necessary to go into the general state of affairs which was far from satisfactory
despite count bezukhov's enormous wealth  since he had come into an income which was said to amount to five hundred thousand rubles a year  pierre felt himself far poorer than when his father had made him an allowance of ten thousand rubles he had a dim perception of the following budget  about 80 000 went in payments on all the estates to the land bank  about 30 000 went for the upkeep of the estate near moscow  the town house  and the allowance to the three princesses  about 15 000 was given in pensions and the same amount for asylums  150 000 alimony was sent to the countess  about 70 000 went for interest on debts the building of a new church  previously begun  had cost about 10 000 in each of the last two years  and he did not know how the rest  about 100 000 rubles  was spent  and almost every year he was obliged to borrow
besides this the chief steward wrote every year telling him of fires and bad harvests  or of the necessity of rebuilding factories and workshops
so the first task pierre had to face was one for which he had very little aptitude or inclination practical business
he discussed estate affairs every day with his chief steward
but he felt that this did not forward matters at all
he felt that these consultations were detached from real affairs and did not link up with them or make them move
on the one hand  the chief steward put the state of things to him in the very worst light  pointing out the necessity of paying off the debts and undertaking new activities with serf labor  to which pierre did not agree
on the other hand  pierre demanded that steps should be taken to liberate the serfs  which the steward met by showing the necessity of first paying off the loans from the land bank  and the consequent impossibility of a speedy emancipation
the steward did not say it was quite impossible  but suggested selling the forests in the province of kostroma  the land lower down the river  and the crimean estate  in order to make it possible  all of which operations according to him were connected with such complicated measures the removal of injunctions  petitions  permits  and so on that pierre became quite bewildered and only replied   yes  yes  do so   pierre had none of the practical persistence that would have enabled him to attend to the business himself and so he disliked it and only tried to pretend to the steward that he was attending to it the steward for his part tried to pretend to the count that he considered these consultations very valuable for the proprietor and troublesome to himself in kiev pierre found some people he knew  and strangers hastened to make his acquaintance and joyfully welcomed the rich newcomer  the largest landowner of the province
temptations to pierre's greatest weakness the one to which he had confessed when admitted to the lodge were so strong that he could not resist them
again whole days  weeks  and months of his life passed in as great a rush and were as much occupied with evening parties  dinners  lunches  and balls  giving him no time for reflection  as in petersburg
instead of the new life he had hoped to lead he still lived the old life  only in new surroundings
of the three precepts of freemasonry pierre realized that he did not fulfill the one which enjoined every mason to set an example of moral life  and that of the seven virtues he lacked two morality and the love of death
he consoled himself with the thought that he fulfilled another of the precepts that of reforming the human race and had other virtues love of his neighbor  and especially generosity in the spring of 1807 he decided to return to petersburg
on the way he intended to visit all his estates and see for himself how far his orders had been carried out and in what state were the serfs whom god had entrusted to his care and whom he intended to benefit the chief steward  who considered the young count's attempts almost insane  unprofitable to himself  to the count  and to the serfs made some concessions continuing to represent the liberation of the serfs as impracticable  he arranged for the erection of large buildings schools  hospitals  and asylums on all the estates before the master arrived everywhere preparations were made not for ceremonious welcomes  which he knew pierre would not like   but for just such gratefully religious ones  with offerings of icons and the bread and salt of hospitality  as  according to his understanding of his master  would touch and delude him
the southern spring  the comfortable rapid traveling in a vienna carriage  and the solitude of the road  all had a gladdening effect on pierre
the estates he had not before visited were each more picturesque than the other  the serfs everywhere seemed thriving and touchingly grateful for the benefits conferred on them
everywhere were receptions  which though they embarrassed pierre awakened a joyful feeling in the depth of his heart
in one place the peasants presented him with bread and salt and an icon of saint peter and saint paul  asking permission  as a mark of their gratitude for the benefits he had conferred on them  to build a new chantry to the church at their own expense in honor of peter and paul  his patron saints
in another place the women with infants in arms met him to thank him for releasing them from hard work on a third estate the priest  bearing a cross  came to meet him surrounded by children whom  by the count's generosity  he was instructing in reading  writing  and religion
on all his estates pierre saw with his own eyes brick buildings erected or in course of erection  all on one plan  for hospitals  schools  and almshouses  which were soon to be opened everywhere he saw the stewards' accounts  according to which the serfs' manorial labor had been diminished  and heard the touching thanks of deputations of serfs in their fullskirted blue coats
what pierre did not know was that the place where they presented him with bread and salt and wished to build a chantry in honor of peter and paul was a market village where a fair was held on st
peter's day  and that the richest peasants  who formed the deputation  had begun the chantry long before  but that nine tenths of the peasants in that villages were in a state of the greatest poverty
he did not know that since the nursing mothers were no longer sent to work on his land  they did still harder work on their own land
he did not know that the priest who met him with the cross oppressed the peasants by his exactions  and that the pupils' parents wept at having to let him take their children and secured their release by heavy payments
he did not know that the brick buildings  built to plan  were being built by serfs whose manorial labor was thus increased  though lessened on paper
he did not know that where the steward had shown him in the accounts that the serfs' payments had been diminished by a third  their obligatory manorial work had been increased by a half
and so pierre was delighted with his visit to his estates and quite recovered the philanthropic mood in which he had left petersburg  and wrote enthusiastic letters to his  brother instructor  as he called the grand master
 how easy it is  how little effort it needs  to do so much good   thought pierre   and how little attention we pay to it   he was pleased at the gratitude he received  but felt abashed at receiving it
this gratitude reminded him of how much more he might do for these simple  kindly people
the chief steward  a very stupid but cunning man who saw perfectly through the naive and intelligent count and played with him as with a toy  seeing the effect these prearranged receptions had on pierre  pressed him still harder with proofs of the impossibility and above all the uselessness of freeing the serfs  who were quite happy as it was
pierre in his secret soul agreed with the steward that it would be difficult to imagine happier people  and that god only knew what would happen to them when they were free  but he insisted  though reluctantly  on what he thought right
the steward promised to do all in his power to carry out the count's wishes  seeing clearly that not only would the count never be able to find out whether all measures had been taken for the sale of the land and forests and to release them from the land bank  but would probably never even inquire and would never know that the newly erected buildings were standing empty and that the serfs continued to give in money and work all that other people's serfs gave that is to say  all that could be got out of them
returning from his journey through south russia in the happiest state of mind  pierre carried out an intention he had long had of visiting his friend bolkonski  whom he had not seen for two years
bogucharovo lay in a flat uninteresting part of the country among fields and forests of fir and birch  which were partly cut down
the house lay behind a newly dug pond filled with water to the brink and with banks still bare of grass
it was at the end of a village that stretched along the highroad in the midst of a young copse in which were a few fir trees the homestead consisted of a threshing floor  outhouses  stables  a bathhouse  a lodge  and a large brick house with semicircular facade still in course of construction
round the house was a garden newly laid out
the fences and gates were new and solid  two fire pumps and a water cart  painted green  stood in a shed  the paths were straight  the bridges were strong and had handrails
everything bore an impress of tidiness and good management
some domestic serfs pierre met  in reply to inquiries as to where the prince lived  pointed out a small newly built lodge close to the pond
anton  a man who had looked after prince andrew in his boyhood  helped pierre out of his carriage  said that the prince was at home  and showed him into a clean little anteroom
pierre was struck by the modesty of the small though clean house after the brilliant surroundings in which he had last met his friend in petersburg
he quickly entered the small reception room with its still unplastered wooden walls redolent of pine  and would have gone farther  but anton ran ahead on tiptoe and knocked at a door
 well  what is it   came a sharp  unpleasant voice
 a visitor   answered anton
 ask him to wait   and the sound was heard of a chair being pushed back
pierre went with rapid steps to the door and suddenly came face to face with prince andrew  who came out frowning and looking old
pierre embraced him and lifting his spectacles kissed his friend on the cheek and looked at him closely
 well  i did not expect you  i am very glad   said prince andrew
pierre said nothing  he looked fixedly at his friend with surprise
he was struck by the change in him
his words were kindly and there was a smile on his lips and face  but his eyes were dull and lifeless and in spite of his evident wish to do so he could not give them a joyous and glad sparkle
prince andrew had grown thinner  paler  and more manly looking  but what amazed and estranged pierre till he got used to it were his inertia and a wrinkle on his brow indicating prolonged concentration on some one thought
as is usually the case with people meeting after a prolonged separation  it was long before their conversation could settle on anything
they put questions and gave brief replies about things they knew ought to be talked over at length
at last the conversation gradually settled on some of the topics at first lightly touched on  their past life  plans for the future  pierre's journeys and occupations  the war  and so on
the preoccupation and despondency which pierre had noticed in his friend's look was now still more clearly expressed in the smile with which he listened to pierre  especially when he spoke with joyful animation of the past or the future
it was as if prince andrew would have liked to sympathize with what pierre was saying  but could not
the latter began to feel that it was in bad taste to speak of his enthusiasms  dreams  and hopes of happiness or goodness  in prince andrew's presence he was ashamed to express his new masonic views  which had been particularly revived and strengthened by his late tour
he checked himself  fearing to seem naive  yet he felt an irresistible desire to show his friend as soon as possible that he was now a quite different  and better  pierre than he had been in petersburg  i can't tell you how much i have lived through since then
i hardly know myself again    yes  we have altered much  very much  since then   said prince andrew
 well  and you  what are your plans    plans   repeated prince andrew ironically
 my plans   he said  as if astonished at the word
 well  you see  i'm building
i mean to settle here altogether next year      pierre looked silently and searchingly into prince andrew's face  which had grown much older
 no  i meant to ask     pierre began  but prince andrew interrupted him
 but why talk of me   
talk to me  yes  tell me about your travels and all you have been doing on your estates   pierre began describing what he had done on his estates  trying as far as possible to conceal his own part in the improvements that had been made
prince andrew several times prompted pierre's story of what he had been doing  as though it were all an old time story  and he listened not only without interest but even as if ashamed of what pierre was telling him
pierre felt uncomfortable and even depressed in his friend's company and at last became silent
 i'll tell you what  my dear fellow   said prince andrew  who evidently also felt depressed and constrained with his visitor   i am only bivouacking here and have just come to look round
i am going back to my sister today
i will introduce you to her
but of course you know her already   he said  evidently trying to entertain a visitor with whom he now found nothing in common
 we will go after dinner
and would you now like to look round my place   they went out and walked about till dinnertime  talking of the political news and common acquaintances like people who do not know each other intimately
prince andrew spoke with some animation and interest only of the new homestead he was constructing and its buildings  but even here  while on the scaffolding  in the midst of a talk explaining the future arrangements of the house  he interrupted himself   however  this is not at all interesting let us have dinner  and then we'll set off   at dinner  conversation turned on pierre's marriage
 i was very much surprised when i heard of it   said prince andrew
pierre blushed  as he always did when it was mentioned  and said hurriedly   i will tell you some time how it all happened
but you know it is all over  and forever    forever   said prince andrew
 nothing's forever    but you know how it all ended  don't you  you heard of the duel    and so you had to go through that too    one thing i thank god for is that i did not kill that man   said pierre
 why so   asked prince andrew
 to kill a vicious dog is a very good thing really    no  to kill a man is bad wrong    why is it wrong   urged prince andrew
 it is not given to man to know what is right and what is wrong
men always did and always will err  and in nothing more than in what they consider right and wrong    what does harm to another is wrong   said pierre  feeling with pleasure that for the first time since his arrival prince andrew was roused  had begun to talk  and wanted to express what had brought him to his present state
 and who has told you what is bad for another man   he asked
 bad  bad   exclaimed pierre
 we all know what is bad for ourselves    yes  we know that  but the harm i am conscious of in myself is something i cannot inflict on others   said prince andrew  growing more and more animated and evidently wishing to express his new outlook to pierre
he spoke in french
 i only know two very real evils in life  remorse and illness
the only good is the absence of those evils
to live for myself avoiding those two evils is my whole philosophy now    and love of one's neighbor  and self sacrifice   began pierre
 no  i can't agree with you  to live only so as not to do evil and not to have to repent is not enough
i lived like that  i lived for myself and ruined my life
and only now when i am living  or at least trying   pierre's modesty made him correct himself   to live for others  only now have i understood all the happiness of life no  i shall not agree with you  and you do not really believe what you are saying   prince andrew looked silently at pierre with an ironic smile
 when you see my sister  princess mary  you'll get on with her   he said
 perhaps you are right for yourself   he added after a short pause   but everyone lives in his own way
you lived for yourself and say you nearly ruined your life and only found happiness when you began living for others
i experienced just the reverse
i lived for glory  and after all what is glory  the same love of others  a desire to do something for them  a desire for their approval  so i lived for others  and not almost  but quite  ruined my life
and i have become calmer since i began to live only for myself    but what do you mean by living only for yourself   asked pierre  growing excited
 what about your son  your sister  and your father    but that's just the same as myself they are not others   explained prince andrew
 the others  one's neighbors  le prochain  as you and princess mary call it  are the chief source of all error and evil
le prochain your kiev peasants to whom you want to do good   and he looked at pierre with a mocking  challenging expression
he evidently wished to draw him on
 you are joking   replied pierre  growing more and more excited
 what error or evil can there be in my wishing to do good  and even doing a little though i did very little and did it very badly  what evil can there be in it if unfortunate people  our serfs  people like ourselves  were growing up and dying with no idea of god and truth beyond ceremonies and meaningless prayers and are now instructed in a comforting belief in future life  retribution  recompense  and consolation  what evil and error are there in it  if people were dying of disease without help while material assistance could so easily be rendered  and i supplied them with a doctor  a hospital  and an asylum for the aged  and is it not a palpable  unquestionable good if a peasant  or a woman with a baby  has no rest day or night and i give them rest and leisure   said pierre  hurrying and lisping
 and i have done that though badly and to a small extent  but i have done something toward it and you cannot persuade me that it was not a good action  and more than that  you can't make me believe that you do not think so yourself
and the main thing is   he continued   that i know  and know for certain  that the enjoyment of doing this good is the only sure happiness in life    yes  if you put it like that it's quite a different matter   said prince andrew
 i build a house and lay out a garden  and you build hospitals
the one and the other may serve as a pastime
but what's right and what's good must be judged by one who knows all  but not by us
well  you want an argument   he added   come on then   they rose from the table and sat down in the entrance porch which served as a veranda
 come  let's argue then   said prince andrew   you talk of schools   he went on  crooking a finger   education and so forth  that is  you want to raise him   pointing to a peasant who passed by them taking off his cap   from his animal condition and awaken in him spiritual needs  while it seems to me that animal happiness is the only happiness possible  and that is just what you want to deprive him of i envy him  but you want to make him what i am  without giving him my means
then you say  'lighten his toil ' but as i see it  physical labor is as essential to him  as much a condition of his existence  as mental activity is to you or me
you can't help thinking
i go to bed after two in the morning  thoughts come and i can't sleep but toss about till dawn  because i think and can't help thinking  just as he can't help plowing and mowing  if he didn't  he would go to the drink shop or fall ill
just as i could not stand his terrible physical labor but should die of it in a week  so he could not stand my physical idleness  but would grow fat and die
the third thing what else was it you talked about   and prince andrew crooked a third finger
 ah  yes  hospitals  medicine
he has a fit  he is dying  and you come and bleed him and patch him up
he will drag about as a cripple  a burden to everybody  for another ten years
it would be far easier and simpler for him to die
others are being born and there are plenty of them as it is
it would be different if you grudged losing a laborer that's how i regard him but you want to cure him from love of him
and he does not want that
and besides  what a notion that medicine ever cured anyone  killed them  yes   said he  frowning angrily and turning away from pierre
prince andrew expressed his ideas so clearly and distinctly that it was evident he had reflected on this subject more than once  and he spoke readily and rapidly like a man who has not talked for a long time
his glance became more animated as his conclusions became more hopeless
 oh  that is dreadful  dreadful   said pierre
 i don't understand how one can live with such ideas
i had such moments myself not long ago  in moscow and when traveling  but at such times i collapsed so that i don't live at all  everything seems hateful to me   myself most of all
then i don't eat  don't wash  
and how is it with you       why not wash  that is not cleanly   said prince andrew   on the contrary one must try to make one's life as pleasant as possible
i'm alive  that is not my fault  so i must live out my life as best i can without hurting others    but with such ideas what motive have you for living  one would sit without moving  undertaking nothing       life as it is leaves one no peace
i should be thankful to do nothing  but here on the one hand the local nobility have done me the honor to choose me to be their marshal  it was all i could do to get out of it
they could not understand that i have not the necessary qualifications for it the kind of good natured  fussy shallowness necessary for the position
then there's this house  which must be built in order to have a nook of one's own in which to be quiet
and now there's this recruiting    why aren't you serving in the army    after austerlitz   said prince andrew gloomily
 no  thank you very much  i have promised myself not to serve again in the active russian army
and i won't not even if bonaparte were here at smolensk threatening bald hills  even then i wouldn't serve in the russian army  well  as i was saying   he continued  recovering his composure   now there's this recruiting
my father is chief in command of the third district  and my only way of avoiding active service is to serve under him    then you are serving    i am   he paused a little while
 and why do you serve    why  for this reason  my father is one of the most remarkable men of his time
but he is growing old  and though not exactly cruel he has too energetic a character
he is so accustomed to unlimited power that he is terrible  and now he has this authority of a commander in chief of the recruiting  granted by the emperor
if i had been two hours late a fortnight ago he would have had a paymaster's clerk at yukhnovna hanged   said prince andrew with a smile
 so i am serving because i alone have any influence with my father  and now and then can save him from actions which would torment him afterwards    well  there you see    yes  but it is not as you imagine   prince andrew continued
 i did not  and do not  in the least care about that scoundrel of a clerk who had stolen some boots from the recruits  i should even have been very glad to see him hanged  but i was sorry for my father that again is for myself   prince andrew grew more and more animated
his eyes glittered feverishly while he tried to prove to pierre that in his actions there was no desire to do good to his neighbor
 there now  you wish to liberate your serfs   he continued   that is a very good thing  but not for you i don't suppose you ever had anyone flogged or sent to siberia and still less for your serfs
if they are beaten  flogged  or sent to siberia  i don't suppose they are any the worse off
in siberia they lead the same animal life  and the stripes on their bodies heal  and they are happy as before
but it is a good thing for proprietors who perish morally  bring remorse upon themselves  stifle this remorse and grow callous  as a result of being able to inflict punishments justly and unjustly it is those people i pity  and for their sake i should like to liberate the serfs
you may not have seen  but i have seen  how good men brought up in those traditions of unlimited power  in time when they grow more irritable  become cruel and harsh  are conscious of it  but cannot restrain themselves and grow more and more miserable   prince andrew spoke so earnestly that pierre could not help thinking that these thoughts had been suggested to prince andrew by his father's case he did not reply
 so that's what i'm sorry for human dignity  peace of mind  purity  and not the serfs' backs and foreheads  which  beat and shave as you may  always remain the same backs and foreheads    no  no  a thousand times no  i shall never agree with you   said pierre
in the evening andrew and pierre got into the open carriage and drove to bald hills
prince andrew  glancing at pierre  broke the silence now and then with remarks which showed that he was in a good temper
pointing to the fields  he spoke of the improvements he was making in his husbandry
pierre remained gloomily silent  answering in monosyllables and apparently immersed in his own thoughts
he was thinking that prince andrew was unhappy  had gone astray  did not see the true light  and that he  pierre  ought to aid  enlighten  and raise him
but as soon as he thought of what he should say  he felt that prince andrew with one word  one argument  would upset all his teaching  and he shrank from beginning  afraid of exposing to possible ridicule what to him was precious and sacred
 no  but why do you think so   pierre suddenly began  lowering his head and looking like a bull about to charge   why do you think so  you should not think so    think  what about   asked prince andrew with surprise
 about life  about man's destiny
it can't be so
i myself thought like that  and do you know what saved me  freemasonry  no  don't smile
freemasonry is not a religious ceremonial sect  as i thought it was  freemasonry is the best expression of the best  the eternal  aspects of humanity   and he began to explain freemasonry as he understood it to prince andrew
he said that freemasonry is the teaching of christianity freed from the bonds of state and church  a teaching of equality  brotherhood  and love
 only our holy brotherhood has the real meaning of life  all the rest is a dream   said pierre
 understand  my dear fellow  that outside this union all is filled with deceit and falsehood and i agree with you that nothing is left for an intelligent and good man but to live out his life  like you  merely trying not to harm others
but make our fundamental convictions your own  join our brotherhood  give yourself up to us  let yourself be guided  and you will at once feel yourself  as i have felt myself  a part of that vast invisible chain the beginning of which is hidden in heaven   said pierre
prince andrew  looking straight in front of him  listened in silence to pierre's words
more than once  when the noise of the wheels prevented his catching what pierre said  he asked him to repeat it  and by the peculiar glow that came into prince andrew's eyes and by his silence  pierre saw that his words were not in vain and that prince andrew would not interrupt him or laugh at what he said
they reached a river that had overflowed its banks and which they had to cross by ferry
while the carriage and horses were being placed on it  they also stepped on the raft
prince andrew  leaning his arms on the raft railing  gazed silently at the flooding waters glittering in the setting sun  well  what do you think about it   pierre asked
 why are you silent    what do i think about it  i am listening to you
it's all very well   
you say  join our brotherhood and we will show you the aim of life  the destiny of man  and the laws which govern the world
but who are we  men
how is it you know everything  why do i alone not see what you see  you see a reign of goodness and truth on earth  but i don't see it   pierre interrupted him
 do you believe in a future life   he asked
 a future life   prince andrew repeated  but pierre  giving him no time to reply  took the repetition for a denial  the more readily as he knew prince andrew's former atheistic convictions
 you say you can't see a reign of goodness and truth on earth
nor could i  and it cannot be seen if one looks on our life here as the end of everything
on earth  here on this earth   pierre pointed to the fields    there is no truth  all is false and evil  but in the universe  in the whole universe there is a kingdom of truth  and we who are now the children of earth are eternally children of the whole universe
don't i feel in my soul that i am part of this vast harmonious whole  don't i feel that i form one link  one step  between the lower and higher beings  in this vast harmonious multitude of beings in whom the deity the supreme power if you prefer the term is manifest  if i see  clearly see  that ladder leading from plant to man  why should i suppose it breaks off at me and does not go farther and farther  i feel that i cannot vanish  since nothing vanishes in this world  but that i shall always exist and always have existed
i feel that beyond me and above me there are spirits  and that in this world there is truth    yes  that is herder's theory   said prince andrew   but it is not that which can convince me  dear friend life and death are what convince
what convinces is when one sees a being dear to one  bound up with one's own life  before whom one was to blame and had hoped to make it right   prince andrew's voice trembled and he turned away    and suddenly that being is seized with pain  suffers  and ceases to exist   
why  it cannot be that there is no answer
and i believe there is   
that's what convinces  that is what has convinced me   said prince andrew
 yes  yes  of course   said pierre   isn't that what i'm saying    no
all i say is that it is not argument that convinces me of the necessity of a future life  but this  when you go hand in hand with someone and all at once that person vanishes there  into nowhere  and you yourself are left facing that abyss  and look in
and i have looked in       well  that's it then  you know that there is a there and there is a someone  there is the future life
the someone is god   prince andrew did not reply
the carriage and horses had long since been taken off  onto the farther bank  and reharnessed
the sun had sunk half below the horizon and an evening frost was starring the puddles near the ferry  but pierre and andrew  to the astonishment of the footmen  coachmen  and ferrymen  still stood on the raft and talked
 if there is a god and future life  there is truth and good  and man's highest happiness consists in striving to attain them
we must live  we must love  and we must believe that we live not only today on this scrap of earth  but have lived and shall live forever  there  in the whole   said pierre  and he pointed to the sky
prince andrew stood leaning on the railing of the raft listening to pierre  and he gazed with his eyes fixed on the red reflection of the sun gleaming on the blue waters
there was perfect stillness
pierre became silent
the raft had long since stopped and only the waves of the current beat softly against it below
prince andrew felt as if the sound of the waves kept up a refrain to pierre's words  whispering   it is true  believe it   he sighed  and glanced with a radiant  childlike  tender look at pierre's face  flushed and rapturous  but yet shy before his superior friend
 yes  if it only were so   said prince andrew
 however  it is time to get on   he added  and  stepping off the raft  he looked up at the sky to which pierre had pointed  and for the first time since austerlitz saw that high  everlasting sky he had seen while lying on that battlefield  and something that had long been slumbering  something that was best within him  suddenly awoke  joyful and youthful  in his soul
it vanished as soon as he returned to the customary conditions of his life  but he knew that this feeling which he did not know how to develop existed within him
his meeting with pierre formed an epoch in prince andrew's life
though outwardly he continued to live in the same old way  inwardly he began a new life
it was getting dusk when prince andrew and pierre drove up to the front entrance of the house at bald hills
as they approached the house  prince andrew with a smile drew pierre's attention to a commotion going on at the back porch
a woman  bent with age  with a wallet on her back  and a short  long haired  young man in a black garment had rushed back to the gate on seeing the carriage driving up
two women ran out after them  and all four  looking round at the carriage  ran in dismay up the steps of the back porch
 those are mary's 'god's folk '  said prince andrew
 they have mistaken us for my father
this is the one matter in which she disobeys him
he orders these pilgrims to be driven away  but she receives them    but what are 'god's folk'   asked pierre prince andrew had no time to answer
the servants came out to meet them  and he asked where the old prince was and whether he was expected back soon
the old prince had gone to the town and was expected back any minute
prince andrew led pierre to his own apartments  which were always kept in perfect order and readiness for him in his father's house  he himself went to the nursery  let us go and see my sister   he said to pierre when he returned
 i have not found her yet  she is hiding now  sitting with her 'god's folk ' it will serve her right  she will be confused  but you will see her 'god's folk ' it's really very curious    what are 'god's folk'   asked pierre
 come  and you'll see for yourself   princess mary really was disconcerted and red patches came on her face when they went in
in her snug room  with lamps burning before the icon stand  a young lad with a long nose and long hair  wearing a monk's cassock  sat on the sofa beside her  behind a samovar
near them  in an armchair  sat a thin  shriveled  old woman  with a meek expression on her childlike face
 andrew  why didn't you warn me   said the princess  with mild reproach  as she stood before her pilgrims like a hen before her chickens  charmee de vous voir
je suis tres contente de vous voir   * she said to pierre as he kissed her hand
she had known him as a child  and now his friendship with andrew  his misfortune with his wife  and above all his kindly  simple face disposed her favorably toward him
she looked at him with her beautiful radiant eyes and seemed to say   i like you very much  but please don't laugh at my people   after exchanging the first greetings  they sat down
*  delighted to see you
i am very glad to see you    ah  and ivanushka is here too   said prince andrew  glancing with a smile at the young pilgrim
 andrew   said princess mary  imploringly
 il faut que vous sachiez que c'est une femme   * said prince andrew to pierre
 andrew  au nom de dieu   * 2  princess mary repeated
*  you must know that this is a woman   *  2   for heaven's sake   it was evident that prince andrew's ironical tone toward the pilgrims and princess mary's helpless attempts to protect them were their customary longestablished relations on the matter  mais  ma bonne amie   said prince andrew   vous devriez au contraire m'être reconnaissante de ce que j'explique a pierre votre intimité avec ce jeune homme   * *  but  my dear  you ought on the contrary to be grateful to me for explaining to pierre your intimacy with this young man    really   said pierre  gazing over his spectacles with curiosity and seriousness  for which princess mary was specially grateful to him  into ivanushka's face  who  seeing that she was being spoken about  looked round at them all with crafty eyes
princess mary's embarrassment on her people's account was quite unnecessary
they were not in the least abashed
the old woman  lowering her eyes but casting side glances at the newcomers  had turned her cup upside down and placed a nibbled bit of sugar beside it  and sat quietly in her armchair  though hoping to be offered another cup of tea
ivanushka  sipping out of her saucer  looked with sly womanish eyes from under her brows at the young men
 where have you been  to kiev   prince andrew asked the old woman
 i have  good sir   she answered garrulously
 just at christmastime i was deemed worthy to partake of the holy and heavenly sacrament at the shrine of the saint
and now i'm from kolyazin  master  where a great and wonderful blessing has been revealed    and was ivanushka with you    i go by myself  benefactor   said ivanushka  trying to speak in a bass voice
 i only came across pelageya in yukhnovo     pelageya interrupted her companion  she evidently wished to tell what she had seen
 in kolyazin  master  a wonderful blessing has been revealed    what is it  some new relics   asked prince andrew
 andrew  do leave off   said princess mary
 don't tell him  pelageya    no  
why not  my dear  why shouldn't i  i like him
he is kind  he is one of god's chosen  he's a benefactor  he once gave me ten rubles  i remember
when i was in kiev  crazy cyril says to me  he's one of god's own and goes barefoot summer and winter   he says  'why are you not going to the right place  go to kolyazin where a wonder working icon of the holy mother of god has been revealed ' on hearing those words i said good by to the holy folk and went   all were silent  only the pilgrim woman went on in measured tones  drawing in her breath
 so i come  master  and the people say to me  'a great blessing has been revealed  holy oil trickles from the cheeks of our blessed mother  the holy virgin mother of god'       all right  all right  you can tell us afterwards   said princess mary  flushing
 let me ask her   said pierre
 did you see it yourselves   he inquired
 oh  yes  master  i was found worthy
such a brightness on the face like the light of heaven  and from the blessed mother's cheek it drops and drops       but  dear me  that must be a fraud   said pierre  naively  who had listened attentively to the pilgrim
 oh  master  what are you saying   exclaimed the horrified pelageya  turning to princess mary for support
 they impose on the people   he repeated
 lord jesus christ   exclaimed the pilgrim woman  crossing herself
 oh  don't speak so  master  there was a general who did not believe  and said  'the monks cheat ' and as soon as he'd said it he went blind
and he dreamed that the holy virgin mother of the kiev catacombs came to him and said  'believe in me and i will make you whole ' so he begged  'take me to her  take me to her ' it's the real truth i'm telling you  i saw it myself
so he was brought  quite blind  straight to her  and he goes up to her and falls down and says  'make me whole ' says he  'and i'll give thee what the tsar bestowed on me ' i saw it myself  master  the star is fixed into the icon
well  and what do you think  he received his sight  it's a sin to speak so
god will punish you   she said admonishingly  turning to pierre
 how did the star get into the icon   pierre asked
 and was the holy mother promoted to the rank of general   said prince andrew  with a smile
pelageya suddenly grew quite pale and clasped her hands
 oh  master  master  what a sin  and you who have a son   she began  her pallor suddenly turning to a vivid red
 master  what have you said  god forgive you   and she crossed herself
 lord forgive him  my dear  what does it mean      she asked  turning to princess mary
she got up and  almost crying  began to arrange her wallet
she evidently felt frightened and ashamed to have accepted charity in a house where such things could be said  and was at the same time sorry to have now to forgo the charity of this house
 now  why need you do it   said princess mary
 why did you come to me       come  pelageya  i was joking   said pierre
 princesse  ma parole  je n'ai pas voulu l'offenser
* i did not mean anything  i was only joking   he said  smiling shyly and trying to efface his offense
 it was all my fault  and andrew was only joking   *  princess  on my word  i did not wish to offend her   pelageya stopped doubtfully  but in pierre's face there was such a look of sincere penitence  and prince andrew glanced so meekly now at her and now at pierre  that she was gradually reassured
the pilgrim woman was appeased and  being encouraged to talk  gave a long account of father amphilochus  who led so holy a life that his hands smelled of incense  and how on her last visit to kiev some monks she knew let her have the keys of the catacombs  and how she  taking some dried bread with her  had spent two days in the catacombs with the saints
 i'd pray awhile to one  ponder awhile  then go on to another
i'd sleep a bit and then again go and kiss the relics  and there was such peace all around  such blessedness  that one don't want to come out  even into the light of heaven again   pierre listened to her attentively and seriously
prince andrew went out of the room  and then  leaving  god's folk  to finish their tea  princess mary took pierre into the drawing room
 you are very kind   she said to him
 oh  i really did not mean to hurt her feelings
i understand them so well and have the greatest respect for them   princess mary looked at him silently and smiled affectionately
 i have known you a long time  you see  and am as fond of you as of a brother   she said
 how do you find andrew   she added hurriedly  not giving him time to reply to her affectionate words
 i am very anxious about him
his health was better in the winter  but last spring his wound reopened and the doctor said he ought to go away for a cure
and i am also very much afraid for him spiritually
he has not a character like us women who  when we suffer  can weep away our sorrows
he keeps it all within him
today he is cheerful and in good spirits  but that is the effect of your visit he is not often like that
if you could persuade him to go abroad
he needs activity  and this quiet regular life is very bad for him
others don't notice it  but i see it   toward ten o'clock the men servants rushed to the front door  hearing the bells of the old prince's carriage approaching
prince andrew and pierre also went out into the porch
 who's that   asked the old prince  noticing pierre as he got out of the carriage
 ah  very glad  kiss me   he said  having learned who the young stranger was
the old prince was in a good temper and very gracious to pierre
before supper  prince andrew  coming back to his father's study  found him disputing hotly with his visitor
pierre was maintaining that a time would come when there would be no more wars
the old prince disputed it chaffingly  but without getting angry
 drain the blood from men's veins and put in water instead  then there will be no more war  old women's nonsense old women's nonsense   he repeated  but still he patted pierre affectionately on the shoulder  and then went up to the table where prince andrew  evidently not wishing to join in the conversation  was looking over the papers his father had brought from town
the old prince went up to him and began to talk business
 the marshal  a count rostov  hasn't sent half his contingent
he came to town and wanted to invite me to dinner i gave him a pretty dinner   
and there  look at this   
well  my boy   the old prince went on  addressing his son and patting pierre on the shoulder
 a fine fellow your friend i like him  he stirs me up
another says clever things and one doesn't care to listen  but this one talks rubbish yet stirs an old fellow up
well  go  get along  perhaps i'll come and sit with you at supper
we'll have another dispute
make friends with my little fool  princess mary   he shouted after pierre  through the door
only now  on his visit to bald hills  did pierre fully realize the strength and charm of his friendship with prince andrew
that charm was not expressed so much in his relations with him as with all his family and with the household
with the stern old prince and the gentle  timid princess mary  though he had scarcely known them  pierre at once felt like an old friend
they were all fond of him already
not only princess mary  who had been won by his gentleness with the pilgrims  gave him her most radiant looks  but even the one year old  prince nicholas   as his grandfather called him  smiled at pierre and let himself be taken in his arms  and michael ivanovich and mademoiselle bourienne looked at him with pleasant smiles when he talked to the old prince the old prince came in to supper  this was evidently on pierre's account
and during the two days of the young man's visit he was extremely kind to him and told him to visit them again
when pierre had gone and the members of the household met together  they began to express their opinions of him as people always do after a new acquaintance has left  but as seldom happens  no one said anything but what was good of him
when returning from his leave  rostov felt  for the first time  how close was the bond that united him to denisov and the whole regiment
on approaching it  rostov felt as he had done when approaching his home in moscow
when he saw the first hussar with the unbuttoned uniform of his regiment  when he recognized red haired dementyev and saw the picket ropes of the roan horses  when lavrushka gleefully shouted to his master   the count has come   and denisov  who had been asleep on his bed  ran all disheveled out of the mud hut to embrace him  and the officers collected round to greet the new arrival  rostov experienced the same feeling as when his mother  his father  and his sister had embraced him  and tears of joy choked him so that he could not speak
the regiment was also a home  and as unalterably dear and precious as his parents' house
when he had reported himself to the commander of the regiment and had been reassigned to his former squadron  had been on duty and had gone out foraging  when he had again entered into all the little interests of the regiment and felt himself deprived of liberty and bound in one narrow  unchanging frame  he experienced the same sense of peace  of moral support  and the same sense of being at home here in his own place  as he had felt under the parental roof but here was none of all that turmoil of the world at large  where he did not know his right place and took mistaken decisions  here was no sonya with whom he ought  or ought not  to have an explanation  here was no possibility of going there or not going there  here there were not twenty four hours in the day which could be spent in such a variety of ways  there was not that innumerable crowd of people of whom not one was nearer to him or farther from him than another  there were none of those uncertain and undefined money relations with his father  and nothing to recall that terrible loss to dolokhov
here  in the regiment  all was clear and simple
the whole world was divided into two unequal parts  one  our pavlograd regiment  the other  all the rest
and the rest was no concern of his
in the regiment  everything was definite  who was lieutenant  who captain  who was a good fellow  who a bad one  and most of all  who was a comrade the canteenkeeper gave one credit  one's pay came every four months  there was nothing to think out or decide  you had only to do nothing that was considered bad in the pavlograd regiment and  when given an order  to do what was clearly  distinctly  and definitely ordered and all would be well
having once more entered into the definite conditions of this regimental life  rostov felt the joy and relief a tired man feels on lying down to rest
life in the regiment  during this campaign  was all the pleasanter for him  because  after his loss to dolokhov  for which  in spite of all his family's efforts to console him  he could not forgive himself   he had made up his mind to atone for his fault by serving  not as he had done before  but really well  and by being a perfectly first rate comrade and officer in a word  a splendid man altogether  a thing which seemed so difficult out in the world  but so possible in the regiment after his losses  he had determined to pay back his debt to his parents in five years he received ten thousand rubles a year  but now resolved to take only two thousand and leave the rest to repay the debt to his parents
our army  after repeated retreats and advances and battles at pultusk and preussisch eylau  was concentrated near bartenstein
it was awaiting the emperor's arrival and the beginning of a new campaign
the pavlograd regiment  belonging to that part of the army which had served in the 1805 campaign  had been recruiting up to strength in russia  and arrived too late to take part in the first actions of the campaign
it had been neither at pultusk nor at preussisch eylau and  when it joined the army in the field in the second half of the campaign  was attached to platov's division
platov's division was acting independently of the main army
several times parts of the pavlograd regiment had exchanged shots with the enemy  had taken prisoners  and once had even captured marshal oudinot's carriages
in april the pavlograds were stationed immovably for some weeks near a totally ruined and deserted german village
a thaw had set in  it was muddy and cold  the ice on the river broke  and the roads became impassable
for days neither provisions for the men nor fodder for the horses had been issued
as no transports could arrive  the men dispersed about the abandoned and deserted villages  searching for potatoes  but found few even of these
everything had been eaten up and the inhabitants had all fled if any remained  they were worse than beggars and nothing more could be taken from them  even the soldiers  usually pitiless enough  instead of taking anything from them  often gave them the last of their rations
the pavlograd regiment had had only two men wounded in action  but had lost nearly half its men from hunger and sickness
in the hospitals  death was so certain that soldiers suffering from fever  or the swelling that came from bad food  preferred to remain on duty  and hardly able to drag their legs went to the front rather than to the hospitals
when spring came on  the soldiers found a plant just showing out of the ground that looked like asparagus  which  for some reason  they called  mashka's sweet root   it was very bitter  but they wandered about the fields seeking it and dug it out with their sabers and ate it  though they were ordered not to do so  as it was a noxious plant
that spring a new disease broke out among the soldiers  a swelling of the arms  legs  and face  which the doctors attributed to eating this root but in spite of all this  the soldiers of denisov's squadron fed chiefly on  mashka's sweet root   because it was the second week that the last of the biscuits were being doled out at the rate of half a pound a man and the last potatoes received had sprouted and frozen
the horses also had been fed for a fortnight on straw from the thatched roofs and had become terribly thin  though still covered with tufts of felty winter hair
despite this destitution  the soldiers and officers went on living just as usual
despite their pale swollen faces and tattered uniforms  the hussars formed line for roll call  kept things in order  groomed their horses  polished their arms  brought in straw from the thatched roofs in place of fodder  and sat down to dine round the caldrons from which they rose up hungry  joking about their nasty food and their hunger as usual  in their spare time  they lit bonfires  steamed themselves before them naked  smoked  picked out and baked sprouting rotten potatoes  told and listened to stories of potemkin's and suvorov's campaigns  or to legends of alesha the sly  or the priest's laborer mikolka the officers  as usual  lived in twos and threes in the roofless  half ruined houses
the seniors tried to collect straw and potatoes and  in general  food for the men
the younger ones occupied themselves as before  some playing cards  there was plenty of money  though there was no food   some with more innocent games  such as quoits and skittles the general trend of the campaign was rarely spoken of  partly because nothing certain was known about it  partly because there was a vague feeling that in the main it was going badly
rostov lived  as before  with denisov  and since their furlough they had become more friendly than ever
denisov never spoke of rostov's family  but by the tender friendship his commander showed him  rostov felt that the elder hussar's luckless love for natasha played a part in strengthening their friendship
denisov evidently tried to expose rostov to danger as seldom as possible  and after an action greeted his safe return with evident joy
on one of his foraging expeditions  in a deserted and ruined village to which he had come in search of provisions  rostov found a family consisting of an old pole and his daughter with an infant in arms they were half clad  hungry  too weak to get away on foot and had no means of obtaining a conveyance
rostov brought them to his quarters  placed them in his own lodging  and kept them for some weeks while the old man was recovering
one of his comrades  talking of women  began chaffing rostov  saying that he was more wily than any of them and that it would not be a bad thing if he introduced to them the pretty polish girl he had saved rostov took the joke as an insult  flared up  and said such unpleasant things to the officer that it was all denisov could do to prevent a duel
when the officer had gone away  denisov  who did not himself know what rostov's relations with the polish girl might be  began to upbraid him for his quickness of temper  and rostov replied   say what you like    she is like a sister to me  and i can't tell you how it offended me  
because  
well  for that reason      denisov patted him on the shoulder and began rapidly pacing the room without looking at rostov  as was his way at moments of deep feeling
 ah  what a mad bweed you wostovs are   he muttered  and rostov noticed tears in his eyes
in april the troops were enlivened by news of the emperor's arrival  but rostov had no chance of being present at the review he held at bartenstein  as the pavlograds were at the outposts far beyond that place
they were bivouacking
denisov and rostov were living in an earth hut  dug out for them by the soldiers and roofed with branches and turf
the hut was made in the following manner  which had then come into vogue
a trench was dug three and a half feet wide  four feet eight inches deep  and eight feet long
at one end of the trench  steps were cut out and these formed the entrance and vestibule
the trench itself was the room  in which the lucky ones  such as the squadron commander  had a board  lying on piles at the end opposite the entrance  to serve as a table
on each side of the trench  the earth was cut out to a breadth of about two and a half feet  and this did duty for bedsteads and couches
the roof was so constructed that one could stand up in the middle of the trench and could even sit up on the beds if one drew close to the table
denisov  who was living luxuriously because the soldiers of his squadron liked him  had also a board in the roof at the farther end  with a piece of  broken but mended  glass in it for a window
when it was very cold  embers from the soldiers' campfire were placed on a bent sheet of iron on the steps in the  reception room  as denisov called that part of the hut and it was then so warm that the officers  of whom there were always some with denisov and rostov  sat in their shirt sleeves
in april  rostov was on orderly duty
one morning  between seven and eight  returning after a sleepless night  he sent for embers  changed his rain soaked underclothes  said his prayers  drank tea  got warm  then tidied up the things on the table and in his own corner  and  his face glowing from exposure to the wind and with nothing on but his shirt  lay down on his back  putting his arms under his head he was pleasantly considering the probability of being promoted in a few days for his last reconnoitering expedition  and was awaiting denisov  who had gone out somewhere and with whom he wanted a talk
suddenly he heard denisov shouting in a vibrating voice behind the hut  evidently much excited
rostov moved to the window to see whom he was speaking to  and saw the quartermaster  topcheenko
 i ordered you not to let them eat that mashka woot stuff   denisov was shouting
 and i saw with my own eyes how lazarchuk bwought some fwom the fields    i have given the order again and again  your honor  but they don't obey   answered the quartermaster
rostov lay down again on his bed and thought complacently   let him fuss and bustle now  my job's done and i'm lying down capitally   he could hear that lavrushka that sly  bold orderly of denisov's was talking  as well as the quartermaster
lavrushka was saying something about loaded wagons  biscuits  and oxen he had seen when he had gone out for provisions
then denisov's voice was heard shouting farther and farther away
 saddle  second platoon    where are they off to now   thought rostov
five minutes later  denisov came into the hut  climbed with muddy boots on the bed  lit his pipe  furiously scattered his things about  took his leaded whip  buckled on his saber  and went out again
in answer to rostov's inquiry where he was going  he answered vaguely and crossly that he had some business
 let god and our gweat monarch judge me afterwards   said denisov going out  and rostov heard the hoofs of several horses splashing through the mud
he did not even trouble to find out where denisov had gone
having got warm in his corner  he fell asleep and did not leave the hut till toward evening
denisov had not yet returned
the weather had cleared up  and near the next hut two officers and a cadet were playing svayka  laughing as they threw their missiles which buried themselves in the soft mud rostov joined them
in the middle of the game  the officers saw some wagons approaching with fifteen hussars on their skinny horses behind them
the wagons escorted by the hussars drew up to the picket ropes and a crowd of hussars surrounded them
 there now  denisov has been worrying   said rostov   and here are the provisions    so they are   said the officers
 won't the soldiers be glad   a little behind the hussars came denisov  accompanied by two infantry officers with whom he was talking
rostov went to meet them
 i warn you  captain   one of the officers  a short thin man  evidently very angry  was saying
 haven't i told you i won't give them up   replied denisov
 you will answer for it  captain
it is mutiny seizing the transport of one's own army
our men have had nothing to eat for two days    and mine have had nothing for two weeks   said denisov
 it is robbery  you'll answer for it  sir   said the infantry officer  raising his voice
 now  what are you pestewing me for   cried denisov  suddenly losing his temper
 i shall answer for it and not you  and you'd better not buzz about here till you get hurt
be off  go   he shouted at the officers
 very well  then   shouted the little officer  undaunted and not riding away
 if you are determined to rob  i'll      go to the devil  quick ma'ch  while you're safe and sound   and denisov turned his horse on the officer
 very well  very well   muttered the officer  threateningly  and turning his horse he trotted away  jolting in his saddle
 a dog astwide a fence  a weal dog astwide a fence   shouted denisov after him  the most insulting expression a cavalryman can address to a mounted infantryman  and riding up to rostov  he burst out laughing
 i've taken twansports from the infantwy by force   he said
 after all  can't let our men starve   the wagons that had reached the hussars had been consigned to an infantry regiment  but learning from lavrushka that the transport was unescorted  denisov with his hussars had seized it by force
the soldiers had biscuits dealt out to them freely  and they even shared them with the other squadrons
the next day the regimental commander sent for denisov  and holding his fingers spread out before his eyes said   this is how i look at this affair  i know nothing about it and won't begin proceedings  but i advise you to ride over to the staff and settle the business there in the commissariat department and if possible sign a receipt for such regiment  there will be a row and the affair may end badly   from the regimental commander's  denisov rode straight to the staff with a sincere desire to act on this advice
in the evening he came back to his dugout in a state such as rostov had never yet seen him in
denisov could not speak and gasped for breath
when rostov asked what was the matter  he only uttered some incoherent oaths and threats in a hoarse  feeble voice
alarmed at denisov's condition  rostov suggested that he should undress  drink some water  and send for the doctor
 twy me for wobbewy  
oh  some more water  
let them twy me  but i'll always thwash scoundwels  
and i'll tell the empewo'  
ice     he muttered
the regimental doctor  when he came  said it was absolutely necessary to bleed denisov
a deep saucer of black blood was taken from his hairy arm and only then was he able to relate what had happened to him
 i get there   began denisov
 'now then  where's your chief's quarters ' they were pointed out
'please to wait ' 'i've widden twenty miles and have duties to attend to and no time to wait
announce me ' vewy well  so out comes their head chief also took it into his head to lecture me  'it's wobbewy ' 'wobbewy ' i say  'is not done by man who seizes pwovisions to feed his soldiers  but by him who takes them to fill his own pockets ' 'will you please be silent ' 'vewy good ' then he says  'go and give a weceipt to the commissioner  but your affair will be passed on to headquarters ' i go to the commissioner
i enter  and at the table  
who do you think  no  but wait a bit   
who is it that's starving us   shouted denisov  hitting the table with the fist of his newly bled arm so violently that the table nearly broke down and the tumblers on it jumped about
 telyanin  'what  so it's you who's starving us to death  is it  take this and this ' and i hit him so pat  stwaight on his snout  
'ah  what a  
what a    ' and i sta'ted fwashing him  
well  i've had a bit of fun i can tell you   cried denisov  gleeful and yet angry  his white teeth showing under his black mustache
 i'd have killed him if they hadn't taken him away    but what are you shouting for  calm yourself   said rostov
 you've set your arm bleeding afresh
wait  we must tie it up again   denisov was bandaged up again and put to bed
next day he woke calm and cheerful
but at noon the adjutant of the regiment came into rostov's and denisov's dugout with a grave and serious face and regretfully showed them a paper addressed to major denisov from the regimental commander in which inquiries were made about yesterday's occurrence
the adjutant told them that the affair was likely to take a very bad turn  that a court martial had been appointed  and that in view of the severity with which marauding and insubordination were now regarded  degradation to the ranks would be the best that could be hoped for
the case  as represented by the offended parties  was that  after seizing the transports  major denisov  being drunk  went to the chief quartermaster and without any provocation called him a thief  threatened to strike him  and on being led out had rushed into the office and given two officials a thrashing  and dislocated the arm of one of them
in answer to rostov's renewed questions  denisov said  laughing  that he thought he remembered that some other fellow had got mixed up in it  but that it was all nonsense and rubbish  and he did not in the least fear any kind of trial  and that if those scoundrels dared attack him he would give them an answer that they would not easily forget
denisov spoke contemptuously of the whole matter  but rostov knew him too well not to detect that  while hiding it from others  at heart he feared a courtmartial and was worried over the affair  which was evidently taking a bad turn
every day  letters of inquiry and notices from the court arrived  and on the first of may  denisov was ordered to hand the squadron over to the next in seniority and appear before the staff of his division to explain his violence at the commissariat office
on the previous day platov reconnoitered with two cossack regiments and two squadrons of hussars
denisov  as was his wont  rode out in front of the outposts  parading his courage
a bullet fired by a french sharpshooter hit him in the fleshy part of his leg
perhaps at another time denisov would not have left the regiment for so slight a wound  but now he took advantage of it to excuse himself from appearing at the staff and went into hospital in june the battle of friedland was fought  in which the pavlograds did not take part  and after that an armistice was proclaimed
rostov  who felt his friend's absence very much  having no news of him since he left and feeling very anxious about his wound and the progress of his affairs  took advantage of the armistice to get leave to visit denisov in hospital
the hospital was in a small prussian town that had been twice devastated by russian and french troops
because it was summer  when it is so beautiful out in the fields  the little town presented a particularly dismal appearance with its broken roofs and fences  its foul streets  tattered inhabitants  and the sick and drunken soldiers wandering about
the hospital was in a brick building with some of the window frames and panes broken and a courtyard surrounded by the remains of a wooden fence that had been pulled to pieces
several bandaged soldiers  with pale swollen faces  were sitting or walking about in the sunshine in the yard
directly rostov entered the door he was enveloped by a smell of putrefaction and hospital air
on the stairs he met a russian army doctor smoking a cigar
the doctor was followed by a russian assistant
 i can't tear myself to pieces   the doctor was saying
 come to makar alexeevich in the evening
i shall be there   the assistant asked some further questions
 oh  do the best you can  isn't it all the same   the doctor noticed rostov coming upstairs
 what do you want  sir   said the doctor
 what do you want  the bullets having spared you  do you want to try typhus  this is a pesthouse  sir    how so   asked rostov
 typhus  sir
it's death to go in
only we two  makeev and i   he pointed to the assistant    keep on here
some five of us doctors have died in this place   
when a new one comes he is done for in a week   said the doctor with evident satisfaction
 prussian doctors have been invited here  but our allies don't like it at all   rostov explained that he wanted to see major denisov of the hussars  who was wounded
 i don't know
i can't tell you  sir
only think  i am alone in charge of three hospitals with more than four hundred patients  it's well that the charitable prussian ladies send us two pounds of coffee and some lint each month or we should be lost   he laughed
 four hundred  sir  and they're always sending me fresh ones
there are four hundred  eh   he asked  turning to the assistant
the assistant looked fagged out
he was evidently vexed and impatient for the talkative doctor to go
 major denisov   rostov said again
 he was wounded at molliten    dead  i fancy
eh  makeev   queried the doctor  in a tone of indifference
the assistant  however  did not confirm the doctor's words
 is he tall and with reddish hair   asked the doctor
rostov described denisov's appearance
 there was one like that   said the doctor  as if pleased
 that one is dead  i fancy
however  i'll look up our list
we had a list
have you got it  makeev    makar alexeevich has the list   answered the assistant
 but if you'll step into the officers' wards you'll see for yourself   he added  turning to rostov
 ah  you'd better not go  sir   said the doctor   or you may have to stay here yourself   but rostov bowed himself away from the doctor and asked the assistant to show him the way  only don't blame me   the doctor shouted up after him
rostov and the assistant went into the dark corridor
the smell was so strong there that rostov held his nose and had to pause and collect his strength before he could go on
a door opened to the right  and an emaciated sallow man on crutches  barefoot and in underclothing  limped out and  leaning against the doorpost  looked with glittering envious eyes at those who were passing
glancing in at the door  rostov saw that the sick and wounded were lying on the floor on straw and overcoats
 may i go in and look    what is there to see   said the assistant
but  just because the assistant evidently did not want him to go in  rostov entered the soldiers' ward
the foul air  to which he had already begun to get used in the corridor  was still stronger here
it was a little different  more pungent  and one felt that this was where it originated
in the long room  brightly lit up by the sun through the large windows  the sick and wounded lay in two rows with their heads to the walls  and leaving a passage in the middle
most of them were unconscious and paid no attention to the newcomers
those who were conscious raised themselves or lifted their thin yellow faces  and all looked intently at rostov with the same expression of hope  of relief  reproach  and envy of another's health rostov went to the middle of the room and looking through the open doors into the two adjoining rooms saw the same thing there he stood still  looking silently around
he had not at all expected such a sight
just before him  almost across the middle of the passage on the bare floor  lay a sick man  probably a cossack to judge by the cut of his hair
the man lay on his back  his huge arms and legs outstretched his face was purple  his eyes were rolled back so that only the whites were seen  and on his bare legs and arms which were still red  the veins stood out like cords he was knocking the back of his head against the floor  hoarsely uttering some word which he kept repeating rostov listened and made out the word
it was  drink  drink  a drink   rostov glanced round  looking for someone who would put this man back in his place and bring him water
 who looks after the sick here   he asked the assistant
just then a commissariat soldier  a hospital orderly  came in from the next room  marching stiffly  and drew up in front of rostov
 good day  your honor   he shouted  rolling his eyes at rostov and evidently mistaking him for one of the hospital authorities
 get him to his place and give him some water   said rostov  pointing to the cossack
 yes  your honor   the soldier replied complacently  and rolling his eyes more than ever he drew himself up still straighter  but did not move  no  it's impossible to do anything here   thought rostov  lowering his eyes  and he was going out  but became aware of an intense look fixed on him on his right  and he turned
close to the corner  on an overcoat  sat an old  unshaven  gray bearded soldier as thin as a skeleton  with a stern sallow face and eyes intently fixed on rostov
the man's neighbor on one side whispered something to him  pointing at rostov  who noticed that the old man wanted to speak to him
he drew nearer and saw that the old man had only one leg bent under him  the other had been amputated above the knee
his neighbor on the other side  who lay motionless some distance from him with his head thrown back  was a young soldier with a snub nose
his pale waxen face was still freckled and his eyes were rolled back
rostov looked at the young soldier and a cold chill ran down his back
 why  this one seems     he began  turning to the assistant  and how we've been begging  your honor   said the old soldier  his jaw quivering
 he's been dead since morning
after all we're men  not dogs    i'll send someone at once
he shall be taken away taken away at once   said the assistant hurriedly
 let us go  your honor    yes  yes  let us go   said rostov hastily  and lowering his eyes and shrinking  he tried to pass unnoticed between the rows of reproachful envious eyes that were fixed upon him  and went out of the room
going along the corridor  the assistant led rostov to the officers' wards  consisting of three rooms  the doors of which stood open there were beds in these rooms and the sick and wounded officers were lying or sitting on them some were walking about the rooms in hospital dressing gowns the first person rostov met in the officers' ward was a thin little man with one arm  who was walking about the first room in a nightcap and hospital dressing gown  with a pipe between his teeth
rostov looked at him  trying to remember where he had seen him before
 see where we've met again   said the little man
 tushin  tushin  don't you remember  who gave you a lift at schon grabern  and i've had a bit cut off  you see     he went on with a smile  pointing to the empty sleeve of his dressing gown
 looking for vasili dmitrich denisov  my neighbor   he added  when he heard who rostov wanted
 here  here   and tushin led him into the next room  from whence came sounds of several laughing voices
 how can they laugh  or even live at all here   thought rostov  still aware of that smell of decomposing flesh that had been so strong in the soldiers' ward  and still seeming to see fixed on him those envious looks which had followed him out from both sides  and the face of that young soldier with eyes rolled back
denisov lay asleep on his bed with his head under the blanket  though it was nearly noon
 ah  wostov  how are you  how are you   he called out  still in the same voice as in the regiment  but rostov noticed sadly that under this habitual ease and animation some new  sinister  hidden feeling showed itself in the expression of denisov's face and the intonations of his voice
his wound  though a slight one  had not yet healed even now  six weeks after he had been hit
his face had the same swollen pallor as the faces of the other hospital patients  but it was not this that struck rostov
what struck him was that denisov did not seem glad to see him  and smiled at him unnaturally
he did not ask about the regiment  nor about the general state of affairs  and when rostov spoke of these matters did not listen
rostov even noticed that denisov did not like to be reminded of the regiment  or in general of that other free life which was going on outside the hospital
he seemed to try to forget that old life and was only interested in the affair with the commissariat officers
on rostov's inquiry as to how the matter stood  he at once produced from under his pillow a paper he had received from the commission and the rough draft of his answer to it
he became animated when he began reading his paper and specially drew rostov's attention to the stinging rejoinders he made to his enemies
his hospital companions  who had gathered round rostov a fresh arrival from the world outside gradually began to disperse as soon as denisov began reading his answer
rostov noticed by their faces that all those gentlemen had already heard that story more than once and were tired of it
only the man who had the next bed  a stout uhlan  continued to sit on his bed  gloomily frowning and smoking a pipe  and little one armed tushin still listened  shaking his head disapprovingly
in the middle of the reading  the uhlan interrupted denisov
 but what i say is   he said  turning to rostov   it would be best simply to petition the emperor for pardon
they say great rewards will now be distributed  and surely a pardon would be granted       me petition the empewo'   exclaimed denisov  in a voice to which he tried hard to give the old energy and fire  but which sounded like an expression of irritable impotence
 what for  if i were a wobber i would ask mercy  but i'm not afwaid of anyone
i've served the tsar and my countwy honowably and have not stolen  and am i to be degwaded   
listen  i'm w'iting to them stwaight
this is what i say  'if i had wobbed the tweasuwy   '   it's certainly well written   said tushin   but that's not the point  vasili dmitrich   and he also turned to rostov
 one has to submit  and vasili dmitrich doesn't want to
you know the auditor told you it was a bad business    well  let it be bad   said denisov
 the auditor wrote out a petition for you   continued tushin   and you ought to sign it and ask this gentleman to take it
no doubt he   indicating rostov   has connections on the staff
you won't find a better opportunity    haven't i said i'm not going to gwovel   denisov interrupted him  went on reading his paper
rostov had not the courage to persuade denisov  though he instinctively felt that the way advised by tushin and the other officers was the safest  and though he would have been glad to be of service to denisov
he knew his stubborn will and straightforward hasty temper
when the reading of denisov's virulent reply  which took more than an hour  was over  rostov said nothing  and he spent the rest of the day in a most dejected state of mind amid denisov's hospital comrades  who had gathered round him  telling them what he knew and listening to their stories denisov was moodily silent all the evening
late in the evening  when rostov was about to leave  he asked denisov whether he had no commission for him
 yes  wait a bit   said denisov  glancing round at the officers  and taking his papers from under his pillow he went to the window  where he had an inkpot  and sat down to write
 it seems it's no use knocking one's head against a wall   he said  coming from the window and giving rostov a large envelope in it was the petition to the emperor drawn up by the auditor  in which denisov  without alluding to the offenses of the commissariat officials  simply asked for pardon
 hand it in
it seems     he did not finish  but gave a painfully unnatural smile having returned to the regiment and told the commander the state of denisov's affairs  rostov rode to tilsit with the letter to the emperor
on the thirteenth of june the french and russian emperors arrived in tilsit
boris drubetskoy had asked the important personage on whom he was in attendance  to include him in the suite appointed for the stay at tilsit
 i should like to see the great man   he said  alluding to napoleon  whom hitherto he  like everyone else  had always called buonaparte
 you are speaking of buonaparte   asked the general  smiling
boris looked at his general inquiringly and immediately saw that he was being tested
 i am speaking  prince  of the emperor napoleon   he replied
the general patted him on the shoulder  with a smile
 you will go far   he said  and took him to tilsit with him
boris was among the few present at the niemen on the day the two emperors met
he saw the raft  decorated with monograms  saw napoleon pass before the french guards on the farther bank of the river  saw the pensive face of the emperor alexander as he sat in silence in a tavern on the bank of the niemen awaiting napoleon's arrival  saw both emperors get into boats  and saw how napoleon reaching the raft first stepped quickly forward to meet alexander and held out his hand to him  and how they both retired into the pavilion since he had begun to move in the highest circles boris had made it his habit to watch attentively all that went on around him and to note it down
at the time of the meeting at tilsit he asked the names of those who had come with napoleon and about the uniforms they wore  and listened attentively to words spoken by important personages at the moment the emperors went into the pavilion he looked at his watch  and did not forget to look at it again when alexander came out
the interview had lasted an hour and fifty three minutes
he noted this down that same evening  among other facts he felt to be of historic importance
as the emperor's suite was a very small one  it was a matter of great importance  for a man who valued his success in the service  to be at tilsit on the occasion of this interview between the two emperors  and having succeeded in this  boris felt that henceforth his position was fully assured
he had not only become known  but people had grown accustomed to him and accepted him
twice he had executed commissions to the emperor himself  so that the latter knew his face  and all those at court  far from coldshouldering him as at first when they considered him a newcomer  would now have been surprised had he been absent boris lodged with another adjutant  the polish count zhilinski
zhilinski  a pole brought up in paris  was rich  and passionately fond of the french  and almost every day of the stay at tilsit  french officers of the guard and from french headquarters were dining and lunching with him and boris
on the evening of the twenty fourth of june  count zhilinski arranged a supper for his french friends
the guest of honor was an aide de camp of napoleon's  there were also several french officers of the guard  and a page of napoleon's  a young lad of an old aristocratic french family
that same day  rostov  profiting by the darkness to avoid being recognized in civilian dress  came to tilsit and went to the lodging occupied by boris and zhilinski
rostov  in common with the whole army from which he came  was far from having experienced the change of feeling toward napoleon and the french  who from being foes had suddenly become friends that had taken place at headquarters and in boris
in the army  bonaparte and the french were still regarded with mingled feelings of anger  contempt  and fear
only recently  talking with one of platov's cossack officers  rostov had argued that if napoleon were taken prisoner he would be treated not as a sovereign  but as a criminal
quite lately  happening to meet a wounded french colonel on the road  rostov had maintained with heat that peace was impossible between a legitimate sovereign and the criminal bonaparte
rostov was therefore unpleasantly struck by the presence of french officers in boris' lodging  dressed in uniforms he had been accustomed to see from quite a different point of view from the outposts of the flank as soon as he noticed a french officer  who thrust his head out of the door  that warlike feeling of hostility which he always experienced at the sight of the enemy suddenly seized him
he stopped at the threshold and asked in russian whether drubetskoy lived there
boris  hearing a strange voice in the anteroom  came out to meet him
an expression of annoyance showed itself for a moment on his face on first recognizing rostov
 ah  it's you  very glad  very glad to see you   he said  however  coming toward him with a smile
but rostov had noticed his first impulse
 i've come at a bad time i think
i should not have come  but i have business   he said coldly
 no  i only wonder how you managed to get away from your regiment
dans un moment je suis a vous   * he said  answering someone who called him
*  in a minute i shall be at your disposal    i see i'm intruding   rostov repeated
the look of annoyance had already disappeared from boris' face  having evidently reflected and decided how to act  he very quietly took both rostov's hands and led him into the next room
his eyes  looking serenely and steadily at rostov  seemed to be veiled by something  as if screened by blue spectacles of conventionality
so it seemed to rostov
 oh  come now  as if you could come at a wrong time   said boris  and he led him into the room where the supper table was laid and introduced him to his guests  explaining that he was not a civilian  but an hussar officer  and an old friend of his
 count zhilinski le comte n
n  le capitaine s
s    said he  naming his guests
rostov looked frowningly at the frenchmen  bowed reluctantly  and remained silent
zhilinski evidently did not receive this new russian person very willingly into his circle and did not speak to rostov
boris did not appear to notice the constraint the newcomer produced and  with the same pleasant composure and the same veiled look in his eyes with which he had met rostov  tried to enliven the conversation
one of the frenchmen  with the politeness characteristic of his countrymen  addressed the obstinately taciturn rostov  saying that the latter had probably come to tilsit to see the emperor
 no  i came on business   replied rostov  briefly
rostov had been out of humor from the moment he noticed the look of dissatisfaction on boris' face  and as always happens to those in a bad humor  it seemed to him that everyone regarded him with aversion and that he was in everybody's way
he really was in their way  for he alone took no part in the conversation which again became general
the looks the visitors cast on him seemed to say   and what is he sitting here for   he rose and went up to boris
 anyhow  i'm in your way   he said in a low tone
 come and talk over my business and i'll go away    oh  no  not at all   said boris
 but if you are tired  come and lie down in my room and have a rest    yes  really     they went into the little room where boris slept
rostov  without sitting down  began at once  irritably  as if boris were to blame in some way  telling him about denisov's affair  asking him whether  through his general  he could and would intercede with the emperor on denisov's behalf and get denisov's petition handed in
when he and boris were alone  rostov felt for the first time that he could not look boris in the face without a sense of awkwardness
boris  with one leg crossed over the other and stroking his left hand with the slender fingers of his right  listened to rostov as a general listens to the report of a subordinate  now looking aside and now gazing straight into rostov's eyes with the same veiled look
each time this happened rostov felt uncomfortable and cast down his eyes
 i have heard of such cases and know that his majesty is very severe in such affairs
i think it would be best not to bring it before the emperor  but to apply to the commander of the corps   
but in general  i think      so you don't want to do anything  well then  say so   rostov almost shouted  not looking boris in the face
boris smiled
 on the contrary  i will do what i can
only i thought     at that moment zhilinski's voice was heard calling boris
 well then  go  go  go     said rostov  and refusing supper and remaining alone in the little room  he walked up and down for a long time  hearing the lighthearted french conversation from the next room
rostov had come to tilsit the day least suitable for a petition on denisov's behalf
he could not himself go to the general in attendance as he was in mufti and had come to tilsit without permission to do so  and boris  even had he wished to  could not have done so on the following day on that day  june 27  the preliminaries of peace were signed
the emperors exchanged decorations  alexander received the cross of the legion of honor and napoleon the order of st
andrew of the first degree  and a dinner had been arranged for the evening  given by a battalion of the french guards to the preobrazhensk battalion
the emperors were to be present at that banquet
rostov felt so ill at ease and uncomfortable with boris that  when the latter looked in after supper  he pretended to be asleep  and early next morning went away  avoiding boris
in his civilian clothes and a round hat  he wandered about the town  staring at the french and their uniforms and at the streets and houses where the russian and french emperors were staying in a square he saw tables being set up and preparations made for the dinner  he saw the russian and french colors draped from side to side of the streets  with huge monograms a and n in the windows of the houses also flags and bunting were displayed
 boris doesn't want to help me and i don't want to ask him
that's settled   thought nicholas
 all is over between us  but i won't leave here without having done all i can for denisov and certainly not without getting his letter to the emperor
the emperor   
he is here   thought rostov  who had unconsciously returned to the house where alexander lodged
saddled horses were standing before the house and the suite were assembling  evidently preparing for the emperor to come out
 i may see him at any moment   thought rostov
 if only i were to hand the letter direct to him and tell him all  
could they really arrest me for my civilian clothes  surely not  he would understand on whose side justice lies
he understands everything  knows everything
who can be more just  more magnanimous than he  and even if they did arrest me for being here  what would it matter   thought he  looking at an officer who was entering the house the emperor occupied
 after all  people do go in   
it's all nonsense  i'll go in and hand the letter to the emperor myself so much the worse for drubetskoy who drives me to it   and suddenly with a determination he himself did not expect  rostov felt for the letter in his pocket and went straight to the house  no  i won't miss my opportunity now  as i did after austerlitz   he thought  expecting every moment to meet the monarch  and conscious of the blood that rushed to his heart at the thought
 i will fall at his feet and beseech him
he will lift me up  will listen  and will even thank me
'i am happy when i can do good  but to remedy injustice is the greatest happiness '  rostov fancied the sovereign saying
and passing people who looked after him with curiosity  he entered the porch of the emperor's house
a broad staircase led straight up from the entry  and to the right he saw a closed door
below  under the staircase  was a door leading to the lower floor
 whom do you want   someone inquired
 to hand in a letter  a petition  to his majesty   said nicholas  with a tremor in his voice
 a petition  this way  to the officer on duty   he was shown the door leading downstairs    only it won't be accepted   on hearing this indifferent voice  rostov grew frightened at what he was doing  the thought of meeting the emperor at any moment was so fascinating and consequently so alarming that he was ready to run away  but the official who had questioned him opened the door  and rostov entered
a short stout man of about thirty  in white breeches and high boots and a batiste shirt that he had evidently only just put on  standing in that room  and his valet was buttoning on to the back of his breeches a new pair of handsome silk embroidered braces that  for some reason  attracted rostov's attention
this man was speaking to someone in the adjoining room
 a good figure and in her first bloom   he was saying  but on seeing rostov  he stopped short and frowned
 what is it  a petition    what is it   asked the person in the other room
 another petitioner   answered the man with the braces
 tell him to come later
he'll be coming out directly  we must go    later  
later  tomorrow
it's too late     rostov turned and was about to go  but the man in the braces stopped him
 whom have you come from  who are you    i come from major denisov   answered rostov
 are you an officer    lieutenant count rostov    what audacity  hand it in through your commander
and go along with you  
go   and he continued to put on the uniform the valet handed him
rostov went back into the hall and noticed that in the porch there were many officers and generals in full parade uniform  whom he had to pass
cursing his temerity  his heart sinking at the thought of finding himself at any moment face to face with the emperor and being put to shame and arrested in his presence  fully alive now to the impropriety of his conduct and repenting of it  rostov  with downcast eyes  was making his way out of the house through the brilliant suite when a familiar voice called him and a hand detained him  what are you doing here  sir  in civilian dress   asked a deep voice
it was a cavalry general who had obtained the emperor's special favor during this campaign  and who had formerly commanded the division in which rostov was serving
rostov  in dismay  began justifying himself  but seeing the kindly  jocular face of the general  he took him aside and in an excited voice told him the whole affair  asking him to intercede for denisov  whom the general knew having heard rostov to the end  the general shook his head gravely
 i'm sorry  sorry for that fine fellow
give me the letter   hardly had rostov handed him the letter and finished explaining denisov's case  when hasty steps and the jingling of spurs were heard on the stairs  and the general  leaving him  went to the porch
the gentlemen of the emperor's suite ran down the stairs and went to their horses
hayne  the same groom who had been at austerlitz  led up the emperor's horse  and the faint creak of a footstep rostov knew at once was heard on the stairs
forgetting the danger of being recognized  rostov went close to the porch  together with some inquisitive civilians  and again  after two years  saw those features he adored  that same face and same look and step  and the same union of majesty and mildness   
and the feeling of enthusiasm and love for his sovereign rose again in rostov's soul in all its old force
in the uniform of the preobrazhensk regiment white chamois leather breeches and high boots and wearing a star rostov did not know  it was that of the legion d'honneur   the monarch came out into the porch  putting on his gloves and carrying his hat under his arm
he stopped and looked about him  brightening everything around by his glance
he spoke a few words to some of the generals  and  recognizing the former commander of rostov's division  smiled and beckoned to him
all the suite drew back and rostov saw the general talking for some time to the emperor
the emperor said a few words to him and took a step toward his horse
again the crowd of members of the suite and street gazers  among whom was rostov  moved nearer to the emperor
stopping beside his horse  with his hand on the saddle  the emperor turned to the cavalry general and said in a loud voice  evidently wishing to be heard by all   i cannot do it  general
i cannot  because the law is stronger than i   and he raised his foot to the stirrup
the general bowed his head respectfully  and the monarch mounted and rode down the street at a gallop
beside himself with enthusiasm  rostov ran after him with the crowd the emperor rode to the square where  facing one another  a battalion of the preobrazhensk regiment stood on the right and a battalion of the french guards in their bearskin caps on the left
as the tsar rode up to one flank of the battalions  which presented arms  another group of horsemen galloped up to the opposite flank  and at the head of them rostov recognized napoleon it could be no one else
he came at a gallop  wearing a small hat  a blue uniform open over a white vest  and the st
andrew ribbon over his shoulder
he was riding a very fine thoroughbred gray arab horse with a crimson gold embroidered saddlecloth on approaching alexander he raised his hat  and as he did so  rostov  with his cavalryman's eye  could not help noticing that napoleon did not sit well or firmly in the saddle
the battalions shouted  hurrah   and  vive l'empereur   napoleon said something to alexander  and both emperors dismounted and took each other's hands
napoleon's face wore an unpleasant and artificial smile
alexander was saying something affable to him
in spite of the trampling of the french gendarmes' horses  which were pushing back the crowd  rostov kept his eyes on every movement of alexander and bonaparte
it struck him as a surprise that alexander treated bonaparte as an equal and that the latter was quite at ease with the tsar  as if such relations with an emperor were an everyday matter to him
alexander and napoleon  with the long train of their suites  approached the right flank of the preobrazhensk battalion and came straight up to the crowd standing there
the crowd unexpectedly found itself so close to the emperors that rostov  standing in the front row  was afraid he might be recognized
 sire  i ask your permission to present the legion of honor to the bravest of your soldiers   said a sharp  precise voice  articulating every letter
this was said by the undersized napoleon  looking up straight into alexander's eyes
alexander listened attentively to what was said to him and  bending his head  smiled pleasantly
 to him who has borne himself most bravely in this last war   added napoleon  accentuating each syllable  as with a composure and assurance exasperating to rostov  he ran his eyes over the russian ranks drawn up before him  who all presented arms with their eyes fixed on their emperor  will your majesty allow me to consult the colonel   said alexander and took a few hasty steps toward prince kozlovski  the commander of the battalion
bonaparte meanwhile began taking the glove off his small white hand  tore it in doing so  and threw it away
an aide de camp behind him rushed forward and picked it up
 to whom shall it be given   the emperor alexander asked koslovski  in russian in a low voice
 to whomever your majesty commands   the emperor knit his brows with dissatisfaction and  glancing back  remarked   but we must give him an answer   kozlovski scanned the ranks resolutely and included rostov in his scrutiny
 can it be me   thought rostov
 lazarev   the colonel called  with a frown  and lazarev  the first soldier in the rank  stepped briskly forward
 where are you off to  stop here   voices whispered to lazarev who did not know where to go
lazarev stopped  casting a sidelong look at his colonel in alarm
his face twitched  as often happens to soldiers called before the ranks
napoleon slightly turned his head  and put his plump little hand out behind him as if to take something
the members of his suite  guessing at once what he wanted  moved about and whispered as they passed something from one to another  and a page the same one rostov had seen the previous evening at boris' ran forward and  bowing respectfully over the outstretched hand and not keeping it waiting a moment  laid in it an order on a red ribbon napoleon  without looking  pressed two fingers together and the badge was between them
then he approached lazarev  who rolled his eyes and persistently gazed at his own monarch   looked round at the emperor alexander to imply that what he was now doing was done for the sake of his ally  and the small white hand holding the order touched one of lazarev's buttons
it was as if napoleon knew that it was only necessary for his hand to deign to touch that soldier's breast for the soldier to be forever happy  rewarded  and distinguished from everyone else in the world
napoleon merely laid the cross on lazarev's breast and  dropping his hand  turned toward alexander as though sure that the cross would adhere there
and it really did
officious hands  russian and french  immediately seized the cross and fastened it to the uniform
lazarev glanced morosely at the little man with white hands who was doing something to him and  still standing motionless presenting arms  looked again straight into alexander's eyes  as if asking whether he should stand there  or go away  or do something else but receiving no orders  he remained for some time in that rigid position
the emperors remounted and rode away
the preobrazhensk battalion  breaking rank  mingled with the french guards and sat down at the tables prepared for them
lazarev sat in the place of honor
russian and french officers embraced him  congratulated him  and pressed his hands
crowds of officers and civilians drew near merely to see him
a rumble of russian and french voices and laughter filled the air round the tables in the square
two officers with flushed faces  looking cheerful and happy  passed by rostov
 what d'you think of the treat  all on silver plate   one of them was saying
 have you seen lazarev    i have    tomorrow  i hear  the preobrazhenskis will give them a dinner    yes  but what luck for lazarev  twelve hundred francs' pension for life    here's a cap  lads   shouted a preobrazhensk soldier  donning a shaggy french cap
 it's a fine thing  first rate    have you heard the password   asked one guards' officer of another
 the day before yesterday it was 'napoleon  france  bravoure'  yesterday  'alexandre  russie  grandeur ' one day our emperor gives it and next day napoleon
tomorrow our emperor will send a st
george's cross to the bravest of the french guards
it has to be done
he must respond in kind   boris  too  with his friend zhilinski  came to see the preobrazhensk banquet
on his way back  he noticed rostov standing by the corner of a house
 rostov  how d'you do  we missed one another   he said  and could not refrain from asking what was the matter  so strangely dismal and troubled was rostov's face
 nothing  nothing   replied rostov
 you'll call round    yes  i will   rostov stood at that corner for a long time  watching the feast from a distance
in his mind  a painful process was going on which he could not bring to a conclusion
terrible doubts rose in his soul
now he remembered denisov with his changed expression  his submission  and the whole hospital  with arms and legs torn off and its dirt and disease so vividly did he recall that hospital stench of dead flesh that he looked round to see where the smell came from
next he thought of that self satisfied bonaparte  with his small white hand  who was now an emperor  liked and respected by alexander
then why those severed arms and legs and those dead men    then again he thought of lazarev rewarded and denisov punished and unpardoned
he caught himself harboring such strange thoughts that he was frightened the smell of the food the preobrazhenskis were eating and a sense of hunger recalled him from these reflections  he had to get something to eat before going away
he went to a hotel he had noticed that morning
there he found so many people  among them officers who  like himself  had come in civilian clothes  that he had difficulty in getting a dinner two officers of his own division joined him
the conversation naturally turned on the peace
the officers  his comrades  like most of the army  were dissatisfied with the peace concluded after the battle of friedland they said that had we held out a little longer napoleon would have been done for  as his troops had neither provisions nor ammunition
nicholas ate and drank  chiefly the latter  in silence
he finished a couple of bottles of wine by himself the process in his mind went on tormenting him without reaching a conclusion
he feared to give way to his thoughts  yet could not get rid of them
suddenly  on one of the officers' saying that it was humiliating to look at the french  rostov began shouting with uncalled for wrath  and therefore much to the surprise of the officers   how can you judge what's best   he cried  the blood suddenly rushing to his face
 how can you judge the emperor's actions  what right have we to argue  we cannot comprehend either the emperor's aims or his actions    but i never said a word about the emperor   said the officer  justifying himself  and unable to understand rostov's outburst  except on the supposition that he was drunk but rostov did not listen to him
 we are not diplomatic officials  we are soldiers and nothing more   he went on
 if we are ordered to die  we must die
if we're punished  it means that we have deserved it  it's not for us to judge
if the emperor pleases to recognize bonaparte as emperor and to conclude an alliance with him  it means that that is the right thing to do
if once we begin judging and arguing about everything  nothing sacred will be left  that way we shall be saying there is no god  nothing   shouted nicholas  banging the table very little to the point as it seemed to his listeners  but quite relevantly to the course of his own thoughts
 our business is to do our duty  to fight and not to think  that's all      said he
 and to drink   said one of the officers  not wishing to quarrel
 yes  and to drink   assented nicholas
 hullo there  another bottle   he shouted
in 1808 the emperor alexander went to erfurt for a fresh interview with the emperor napoleon  and in the upper circles of petersburg there was much talk of the grandeur of this important meeting
in 1809 the intimacy between  the world's two arbiters   as napoleon and alexander were called  was such that when napoleon declared war on austria a russian corps crossed the frontier to co operate with our old enemy bonaparte against our old ally the emperor of austria  and in court circles the possibility of marriage between napoleon and one of alexander's sisters was spoken of
but besides considerations of foreign policy  the attention of russian society was at that time keenly directed on the internal changes that were being undertaken in all the departments of government
life meanwhile real life  with its essential interests of health and sickness  toil and rest  and its intellectual interests in thought  science  poetry  music  love  friendship  hatred  and passions went on as usual  independently of and apart from political friendship or enmity with napoleon bonaparte and from all the schemes of reconstruction
prince andrew had spent two years continuously in the country
all the plans pierre had attempted on his estates and constantly changing from one thing to another had never accomplished were carried out by prince andrew without display and without perceptible difficulty
he had in the highest degree a practical tenacity which pierre lacked  and without fuss or strain on his part this set things going
on one of his estates the three hundred serfs were liberated and became free agricultural laborers this being one of the first examples of the kind in russia
on other estates the serfs' compulsory labor was commuted for a quitrent
a trained midwife was engaged for bogucharovo at his expense  and a priest was paid to teach reading and writing to the children of the peasants and household serfs
prince andrew spent half his time at bald hills with his father and his son  who was still in the care of nurses
the other half he spent in  bogucharovo cloister   as his father called prince andrew's estate
despite the indifference to the affairs of the world he had expressed to pierre  he diligently followed all his father had visitors from petersburg  the very vortex of life  these people lagged behind himself who never left the country in knowledge of what was happening in home and foreign affairs prince andrew was at this time busy with a critical survey of our last two unfortunate campaigns  and with drawing up a proposal for a reform of the army rules and regulations
in the spring of 1809 he went to visit the ryazan estates which had been inherited by his son  whose guardian he was
warmed by the spring sunshine he sat in the caleche looking at the new grass  the first leaves on the birches  and the first puffs of white spring clouds floating across the clear blue sky
he was not thinking of anything  but looked absent mindedly and cheerfully from side to side
they crossed the ferry where he had talked with pierre the year before
they went through the muddy village  past threshing floors and green fields of winter rye  downhill where snow still lodged near the bridge  uphill where the clay had been liquefied by the rain  past strips of stubble land and bushes touched with green here and there  and into a birch forest growing on both sides of the road
in the forest it was almost hot  no wind could be felt
the birches with their sticky green leaves were motionless  and lilac colored flowers and the first blades of green grass were pushing up and lifting last year's leaves
the coarse evergreen color of the small fir trees scattered here and there among the birches was an unpleasant reminder of winter
on entering the forest the horses began to snort and sweated visibly
peter the footman made some remark to the coachman  the latter assented
but apparently the coachman's sympathy was not enough for peter  and he turned on the box toward his master
 how pleasant it is  your excellency   he said with a respectful smile
 what    it's pleasant  your excellency    what is he talking about   thought prince andrew
 oh  the spring  i suppose   he thought as he turned round
 yes  really everything is green already   
how early  the birches and cherry and alders too are coming out   
but the oaks show no sign yet
ah  here is one oak   at the edge of the road stood an oak
probably ten times the age of the birches that formed the forest  it was ten times as thick and twice as tall as they
it was an enormous tree  its girth twice as great as a man could embrace  and evidently long ago some of its branches had been broken off and its bark scarred
with its huge ungainly limbs sprawling unsymmetrically  and its gnarled hands and fingers  it stood an aged  stern  and scornful monster among the smiling birch trees
only the dead looking evergreen firs dotted about in the forest  and this oak  refused to yield to the charm of spring or notice either the spring or the sunshine
 spring  love  happiness   this oak seemed to say
 are you not weary of that stupid  meaningless  constantly repeated fraud  always the same and always a fraud  there is no spring  no sun  no happiness  look at those cramped dead firs  ever the same  and at me too  sticking out my broken and barked fingers just where they have grown  whether from my back or my sides  as they have grown so i stand  and i do not believe in your hopes and your lies   as he passed through the forest prince andrew turned several times to look at that oak  as if expecting something from it
under the oak  too  were flowers and grass  but it stood among them scowling  rigid  misshapen  and grim as ever
 yes  the oak is right  a thousand times right   thought prince andrew
 let others the young yield afresh to that fraud  but we know life  our life is finished   a whole sequence of new thoughts  hopeless but mournfully pleasant  rose in his soul in connection with that tree
during this journey he  as it were  considered his life afresh and arrived at his old conclusion  restful in its hopelessness  that it was not for him to begin anything anew but that he must live out his life  content to do no harm  and not disturbing himself or desiring anything prince andrew had to see the marshal of the nobility for the district in connection with the affairs of the ryazan estate of which he was trustee
this marshal was count ilya rostov  and in the middle of may prince andrew went to visit him
it was now hot spring weather
the whole forest was already clothed in green
it was dusty and so hot that on passing near water one longed to bathe
prince andrew  depressed and preoccupied with the business about which he had to speak to the marshal  was driving up the avenue in the grounds of the rostovs' house at otradnoe
he heard merry girlish cries behind some trees on the right and saw a group of girls running to cross the path of his caleche
ahead of the rest and nearer to him ran a dark haired  remarkably slim  pretty girl in a yellow chintz dress  with a white handkerchief on her head from under which loose locks of hair escaped
the girl was shouting something but  seeing that he was a stranger  ran back laughing without looking at him
suddenly  he did not know why  he felt a pang
the day was so beautiful  the sun so bright  everything around so gay  but that slim pretty girl did not know  or wish to know  of his existence and was contented and cheerful in her own separate probably foolish but bright and happy life
 what is she so glad about  what is she thinking of  not of the military regulations or of the arrangement of the ryazan serfs' quitrents
of what is she thinking  why is she so happy   prince andrew asked himself with instinctive curiosity in 1809 count ilya rostov was living at otradnoe just as he had done in former years  that is  entertaining almost the whole province with hunts  theatricals  dinners  and music
he was glad to see prince andrew  as he was to see any new visitor  and insisted on his staying the night
during the dull day  in the course of which he was entertained by his elderly hosts and by the more important of the visitors  the old count's house was crowded on account of an approaching name day   prince andrew repeatedly glanced at natasha  gay and laughing among the younger members of the company  and asked himself each time   what is she thinking about  why is she so glad   that night  alone in new surroundings  he was long unable to sleep he read awhile and then put out his candle  but relit it
it was hot in the room  the inside shutters of which were closed
he was cross with the stupid old man  as he called rostov   who had made him stay by assuring him that some necessary documents had not yet arrived from town  and he was vexed with himself for having stayed he got up and went to the window to open it
as soon as he opened the shutters the moonlight  as if it had long been watching for this  burst into the room
he opened the casement
the night was fresh  bright  and very still
just before the window was a row of pollard trees  looking black on one side and with a silvery light on the other
beneath the trees grew some kind of lush  wet  bushy vegetation with silver lit leaves and stems here and there farther back beyond the dark trees a roof glittered with dew  to the right was a leafy tree with brilliantly white trunk and branches  and above it shone the moon  nearly at its full  in a pale  almost starless  spring sky
prince andrew leaned his elbows on the window ledge and his eyes rested on that sky
his room was on the first floor
those in the rooms above were also awake he heard female voices overhead
 just once more   said a girlish voice above him which prince andrew recognized at once
 but when are you coming to bed   replied another voice
 i won't  i can't sleep  what's the use  come now for the last time   two girlish voices sang a musical passage the end of some song
 oh  how lovely  now go to sleep  and there's an end of it    you go to sleep  but i can't   said the first voice  coming nearer to the window
she was evidently leaning right out  for the rustle of her dress and even her breathing could be heard
everything was stone still  like the moon and its light and the shadows
prince andrew  too  dared not stir  for fear of betraying his unintentional presence
 sonya  sonya   he again heard the first speaker
 oh  how can you sleep  only look how glorious it is  ah  how glorious  do wake up  sonya   she said almost with tears in her voice
 there never  never was such a lovely night before   sonya made some reluctant reply
 do just come and see what a moon   
oh  how lovely  come here   
darling  sweetheart  come here  there  you see  i feel like sitting down on my heels  putting my arms round my knees like this  straining tight  as tight as possible  and flying away  like this       take care  you'll fall out   he heard the sound of a scuffle and sonya's disapproving voice   it's past one o'clock    oh  you only spoil things for me all right  go  go   again all was silent  but prince andrew knew she was still sitting there
from time to time he heard a soft rustle and at times a sigh
 o god  o god  what does it mean   she suddenly exclaimed
 to bed then  if it must be   and she slammed the casement
 for her i might as well not exist   thought prince andrew while he listened to her voice  for some reason expecting yet fearing that she might say something about him
 there she is again  as if it were on purpose   thought he
in his soul there suddenly arose such an unexpected turmoil of youthful thoughts and hopes  contrary to the whole tenor of his life  that unable to explain his condition to himself he lay down and fell asleep at once next morning  having taken leave of no one but the count  and not waiting for the ladies to appear  prince andrew set off for home
it was already the beginning of june when on his return journey he drove into the birch forest where the gnarled old oak had made so strange and memorable an impression on him
in the forest the harness bells sounded yet more muffled than they had done six weeks before  for now all was thick  shady  and dense  and the young firs dotted about in the forest did not jar on the general beauty but  lending themselves to the mood around  were delicately green with fluffy young shoots the whole day had been hot
somewhere a storm was gathering  but only a small cloud had scattered some raindrops lightly  sprinkling the road and the sappy leaves
the left side of the forest was dark in the shade  the right side glittered in the sunlight  wet and shiny and scarcely swayed by the breeze
everything was in blossom  the nightingales trilled  and their voices reverberated now near  now far away
 yes  here in this forest was that oak with which i agreed   thought prince andrew
 but where is it   he again wondered  gazing at the left side of the road  and without recognizing it he looked with admiration at the very oak he sought
the old oak  quite transfigured  spreading out a canopy of sappy darkgreen foliage  stood rapt and slightly trembling in the rays of the evening sun
neither gnarled fingers nor old scars nor old doubts and sorrows were any of them in evidence now
through the hard century old bark  even where there were no twigs  leaves had sprouted such as one could hardly believe the old veteran could have produced
 yes  it is the same oak   thought prince andrew  and all at once he was seized by an unreasoning springtime feeling of joy and renewal
all the best moments of his life suddenly rose to his memory
austerlitz with the lofty heavens  his wife's dead reproachful face  pierre at the ferry  that girl thrilled by the beauty of the night  and that night itself and the moon  and   
all this rushed suddenly to his mind
 no  life is not over at thirty one   prince andrew suddenly decided finally and decisively
 it is not enough for me to know what i have in me everyone must know it  pierre  and that young girl who wanted to fly away into the sky  everyone must know me  so that my life may not be lived for myself alone while others live so apart from it  but so that it may be reflected in them all  and they and i may live in harmony   on reaching home prince andrew decided to go to petersburg that autumn and found all sorts of reasons for this decision
a whole series of sensible and logical considerations showing it to be essential for him to go to petersburg  and even to re enter the service  kept springing up in his mind
he could not now understand how he could ever even have doubted the necessity of taking an active share in life  just as a month before he had not understood how the idea of leaving the quiet country could ever enter his head
it now seemed clear to him that all his experience of life must be senselessly wasted unless he applied it to some kind of work and again played an active part in life
he did not even remember how formerly  on the strength of similar wretched logical arguments  it had seemed obvious that he would be degrading himself if he now  after the lessons he had had in life  allowed himself to believe in the possibility of being useful and in the possibility of happiness or love now reason suggested quite the opposite after that journey to ryazan he found the country dull  his former pursuits no longer interested him  and often when sitting alone in his study he got up  went to the mirror  and gazed a long time at his own face
then he would turn away to the portrait of his dead lise  who with hair curled a la grecque looked tenderly and gaily at him out of the gilt frame
she did not now say those former terrible words to him  but looked simply  merrily  and inquisitively at him
and prince andrew  crossing his arms behind him  long paced the room  now frowning  now smiling  as he reflected on those irrational  inexpressible thoughts  secret as a crime  which altered his whole life and were connected with pierre  with fame  with the girl at the window  the oak  and woman's beauty and love and if anyone came into his room at such moments he was particularly cold  stern  and above all unpleasantly logical
 my dear   princess mary entering at such a moment would say   little nicholas can't go out today  it's very cold    if it were hot   prince andrew would reply at such times very dryly to his sister   he could go out in his smock  but as it is cold he must wear warm clothes  which were designed for that purpose
that is what follows from the fact that it is cold  and not that a child who needs fresh air should remain at home   he would add with extreme logic  as if punishing someone for those secret illogical emotions that stirred within him
at such moments princess mary would think how intellectual work dries men up
prince andrew arrived in petersburg in august  1809
it was the time when the youthful speranski was at the zenith of his fame and his reforms were being pushed forward with the greatest energy that same august the emperor was thrown from his caleche  injured his leg  and remained three weeks at peterhof  receiving speranski every day and no one else
at that time the two famous decrees were being prepared that so agitated society abolishing court ranks and introducing examinations to qualify for the grades of collegiate assessor and state councilor and not merely these but a whole state constitution  intended to change the existing order of government in russia  legal  administrative  and financial  from the council of state down to the district tribunals
now those vague liberal dreams with which the emperor alexander had ascended the throne  and which he had tried to put into effect with the aid of his associates  czartoryski  novosiltsev  kochubey  and strogonov whom he himself in jest had called his comite de salut public  were taking shape and being realized now all these men were replaced by speranski on the civil side  and arakcheev on the military
soon after his arrival prince andrew  as a gentleman of the chamber  presented himself at court and at a levee the emperor  though he met him twice  did not favor him with a single word
it had always seemed to prince andrew before that he was antipathetic to the emperor and that the latter disliked his face and personality generally  and in the cold  repellent glance the emperor gave him  he now found further confirmation of this surmise
the courtiers explained the emperor's neglect of him by his majesty's displeasure at bolkonski's not having served since 1805
 i know myself that one cannot help one's sympathies and antipathies   thought prince andrew   so it will not do to present my proposal for the reform of the army regulations to the emperor personally  but the project will speak for itself   he mentioned what he had written to an old field marshal  a friend of his father's
the field marshal made an appointment to see him  received him graciously  and promised to inform the emperor
a few days later prince andrew received notice that he was to go to see the minister of war  count arakcheev
on the appointed day prince andrew entered count arakcheev's waiting room at nine in the morning
he did not know arakcheev personally  had never seen him  and all he had heard of him inspired him with but little respect for the man
 he is minister of war  a man trusted by the emperor  and i need not concern myself about his personal qualities  he has been commissioned to consider my project  so he alone can get it adopted   thought prince andrew as he waited among a number of important and unimportant people in count arakcheev's waiting room
during his service  chiefly as an adjutant  prince andrew had seen the anterooms of many important men  and the different types of such rooms were well known to him count arakcheev's anteroom had quite a special character
the faces of the unimportant people awaiting their turn for an audience showed embarrassment and servility  the faces of those of higher rank expressed a common feeling of awkwardness  covered by a mask of unconcern and ridicule of themselves  their situation  and the person for whom they were waiting some walked thoughtfully up and down  others whispered and laughed
prince andrew heard the nickname  sila andreevich  and the words   uncle will give it to us hot   in reference to count arakcheev
one general  an important personage   evidently feeling offended at having to wait so long  sat crossing and uncrossing his legs and smiling contemptuously to himself but the moment the door opened one feeling alone appeared on all faces that of fear
prince andrew for the second time asked the adjutant on duty to take in his name  but received an ironical look and was told that his turn would come in due course
after some others had been shown in and out of the minister's room by the adjutant on duty  an officer who struck prince andrew by his humiliated and frightened air was admitted at that terrible door
this officer's audience lasted a long time
then suddenly the grating sound of a harsh voice was heard from the other side of the door  and the officer with pale face and trembling lips came out and passed through the waiting room  clutching his head
after this prince andrew was conducted to the door and the officer on duty said in a whisper   to the right  at the window   prince andrew entered a plain tidy room and saw at the table a man of forty with a long waist  a long closely cropped head  deep wrinkles  scowling brows above dull greenish hazel eyes and an overhanging red nose
arakcheev turned his head toward him without looking at him
 what is your petition   asked arakcheev
 i am not petitioning  your excellency   returned prince andrew quietly
arakcheev's eyes turned toward him
 sit down   said he
 prince bolkonski    i am not petitioning about anything
his majesty the emperor has deigned to send your excellency a project submitted by me      you see  my dear sir  i have read your project   interrupted arakcheev  uttering only the first words amiably and then again without looking at prince andrew relapsing gradually into a tone of grumbling contempt
 you are proposing new military laws  there are many laws but no one to carry out the old ones
nowadays everybody designs laws  it is easier writing than doing    i came at his majesty the emperor's wish to learn from your excellency how you propose to deal with the memorandum i have presented   said prince andrew politely
 i have endorsed a resolution on your memorandum and sent it to the committee
i do not approve of it   said arakcheev  rising and taking a paper from his writing table
 here   and he handed it to prince andrew
across the paper was scrawled in pencil  without capital letters  misspelled  and without punctuation   unsoundly constructed because resembles an imitation of the french military code and from the articles of war needlessly deviating    to what committee has the memorandum been referred   inquired prince andrew
 to the committee on army regulations  and i have recommended that your honor should be appointed a member  but without a salary   prince andrew smiled
 i don't want one    a member without salary   repeated arakcheev
 i have the honor  
eh  call the next one  who else is there   he shouted  bowing to prince andrew
while waiting for the announcement of his appointment to the committee prince andrew looked up his former acquaintances  particularly those he knew to be in power and whose aid he might need
in petersburg he now experienced the same feeling he had had on the eve of a battle  when troubled by anxious curiosity and irresistibly attracted to the ruling circles where the future  on which the fate of millions depended  was being shaped
from the irritation of the older men  the curiosity of the uninitiated  the reserve of the initiated  the hurry and preoccupation of everyone  and the innumerable committees and commissions of whose existence he learned every day  he felt that now  in 1809  here in petersburg a vast civil conflict was in preparation  the commander in chief of which was a mysterious person he did not know  but who was supposed to be a man of genius speranski
and this movement of reconstruction of which prince andrew had a vague idea  and speranski its chief promoter  began to interest him so keenly that the question of the army regulations quickly receded to a secondary place in his consciousness
prince andrew was most favorably placed to secure good reception in the highest and most diverse petersburg circles of the day
the reforming party cordially welcomed and courted him  in the first place because he was reputed to be clever and very well read  and secondly because by liberating his serfs he had obtained the reputation of being a liberal
the party of the old and dissatisfied  who censured the innovations  turned to him expecting his sympathy in their disapproval of the reforms  simply because he was the son of his father the feminine society world welcomed him gladly  because he was rich  distinguished  a good match  and almost a newcomer  with a halo of romance on account of his supposed death and the tragic loss of his wife
besides this the general opinion of all who had known him previously was that he had greatly improved during these last five years  having softened and grown more manly  lost his former affectation  pride  and contemptuous irony  and acquired the serenity that comes with years
people talked about him  were interested in him  and wanted to meet him
the day after his interview with count arakcheev  prince andrew spent the evening at count kochubey's
he told the count of his interview with sila andreevich  kochubey spoke of arakcheev by that nickname with the same vague irony prince andrew had noticed in the minister of war's anteroom 
 mon cher  even in this case you can't do without michael mikhaylovich speranski
he manages everything
i'll speak to him
he has promised to come this evening    what has speranski to do with the army regulations   asked prince andrew
kochubey shook his head smilingly  as if surprised at bolkonski's simplicity
 we were talking to him about you a few days ago   kochubey continued   and about your freed plowmen    oh  is it you  prince  who have freed your serfs   said an old man of catherine's day  turning contemptuously toward bolkonski
 it was a small estate that brought in no profit   replied prince andrew  trying to extenuate his action so as not to irritate the old man uselessly
 afraid of being late     said the old man  looking at kochubey
 there's one thing i don't understand   he continued
 who will plow the land if they are set free  it is easy to write laws  but difficult to rule   
just the same as now i ask you  count who will be heads of the departments when everybody has to pass examinations    those who pass the examinations  i suppose   replied kochubey  crossing his legs and glancing round
 well  i have pryanichnikov serving under me  a splendid man  a priceless man  but he's sixty
is he to go up for examination    yes  that's a difficulty  as education is not at all general  but     count kochubey did not finish
he rose  took prince andrew by the arm  and went to meet a tall  bald  fair man of about forty with a large open forehead and a long face of unusual and peculiar whiteness  who was just entering
the newcomer wore a blue swallow tail coat with a cross suspended from his neck and a star on his left breast
it was speranski
prince andrew recognized him at once  and felt a throb within him  as happens at critical moments of life
whether it was from respect  envy  or anticipation  he did not know
speranski's whole figure was of a peculiar type that made him easily recognizable
in the society in which prince andrew lived he had never seen anyone who together with awkward and clumsy gestures possessed such calmness and self assurance  he had never seen so resolute yet gentle an expression as that in those half closed  rather humid eyes  or so firm a smile that expressed nothing  nor had he heard such a refined  smooth  soft voice  above all he had never seen such delicate whiteness of face or hands hands which were broad  but very plump  soft  and white such whiteness and softness prince andrew had only seen on the faces of soldiers who had been long in hospital
this was speranski  secretary of state  reporter to the emperor and his companion at erfurt  where he had more than once met and talked with napoleon
speranski did not shift his eyes from one face to another as people involuntarily do on entering a large company and was in no hurry to speak
he spoke slowly  with assurance that he would be listened to  and he looked only at the person with whom he was conversing
prince andrew followed speranski's every word and movement with particular attention
as happens to some people  especially to men who judge those near to them severely  he always on meeting anyone new especially anyone whom  like speranski  he knew by reputation expected to discover in him the perfection of human qualities
speranski told kochubey he was sorry he had been unable to come sooner as he had been detained at the palace
he did not say that the emperor had kept him  and prince andrew noticed this affectation of modesty
when kochubey introduced prince andrew  speranski slowly turned his eyes to bolkonski with his customary smile and looked at him in silence
 i am very glad to make your acquaintance
i had heard of you  as everyone has   he said after a pause
kochubey said a few words about the reception arakcheev had given bolkonski
speranski smiled more markedly
 the chairman of the committee on army regulations is my good friend monsieur magnitski   he said  fully articulating every word and syllable   and if you like i can put you in touch with him   he paused at the full stop
 i hope you will find him sympathetic and ready to co operate in promoting all that is reasonable   a circle soon formed round speranski  and the old man who had talked about his subordinate pryanichnikov addressed a question to him
prince andrew without joining in the conversation watched every movement of speranski's  this man  not long since an insignificant divinity student  who now  bolkonski thought  held in his hands those plump white hands the fate of russia
prince andrew was struck by the extraordinarily disdainful composure with which speranski answered the old man
he appeared to address condescending words to him from an immeasurable height
when the old man began to speak too loud  speranski smiled and said he could not judge of the advantage or disadvantage of what pleased the sovereign
having talked for a little while in the general circle  speranski rose and coming up to prince andrew took him along to the other end of the room
it was clear that he thought it necessary to interest himself in bolkonski  i had no chance to talk with you  prince  during the animated conversation in which that venerable gentleman involved me   he said with a mildly contemptuous smile  as if intimating by that smile that he and prince andrew understood the insignificance of the people with whom he had just been talking
this flattered prince andrew
 i have known of you for a long time  first from your action with regard to your serfs  a first example  of which it is very desirable that there should be more imitators  and secondly because you are one of those gentlemen of the chamber who have not considered themselves offended by the new decree concerning the ranks allotted to courtiers  which is causing so much gossip and tittle tattle    no   said prince andrew   my father did not wish me to take advantage of the privilege i began the service from the lower grade    your father  a man of the last century  evidently stands above our contemporaries who so condemn this measure which merely reestablishes natural justice    i think  however  that these condemnations have some ground   returned prince andrew  trying to resist speranski's influence  of which he began to be conscious
he did not like to agree with him in everything and felt a wish to contradict
though he usually spoke easily and well  he felt a difficulty in expressing himself now while talking with speranski he was too much absorbed in observing the famous man's personality
 grounds of personal ambition maybe   speranski put in quietly
 and of state interest to some extent   said prince andrew
 what do you mean   asked speranski quietly  lowering his eyes
 i am an admirer of montesquieu   replied prince andrew   and his idea that le principe des monarchies est l'honneur me parait incontestable
certains droits et privileges de la noblesse me paraissent etre des moyens de soutenir ce sentiment   * *  the principle of monarchies is honor seems to me incontestable certain rights and privileges for the aristocracy appear to me a means of maintaining that sentiment   the smile vanished from speranski's white face  which was much improved by the change
probably prince andrew's thought interested him
 si vous envisagez la question sous ce point de vue   * he began  pronouncing french with evident difficulty  and speaking even slower than in russian but quite calmly
*  if you regard the question from that point of view   speranski went on to say that honor  l'honneur  cannot be upheld by privileges harmful to the service  that honor  l'honneur  is either a negative concept of not doing what is blameworthy or it is a source of emulation in pursuit of commendation and rewards  which recognize it
his arguments were concise  simple  and clear
 an institution upholding honor  the source of emulation  is one similar to the legion d'honneur of the great emperor napoleon  not harmful but helpful to the success of the service  but not a class or court privilege    i do not dispute that  but it cannot be denied that court privileges have attained the same end   returned prince andrew
 every courtier considers himself bound to maintain his position worthily    yet you do not care to avail yourself of the privilege  prince   said speranski  indicating by a smile that he wished to finish amiably an argument which was embarrassing for his companion  if you will do me the honor of calling on me on wednesday   he added   i will  after talking with magnitski  let you know what may interest you  and shall also have the pleasure of a more detailed chat with you   closing his eyes  he bowed a la francaise  without taking leave  and trying to attract as little attention as possible  he left the room
during the first weeks of his stay in petersburg prince andrew felt the whole trend of thought he had formed during his life of seclusion quite overshadowed by the trifling cares that engrossed him in that city
five necessary calls or appointments for certain hours
the mechanism of life  the arrangement of the day so as to be in time everywhere  absorbed the greater part of his vital energy
he did nothing  did not even think or find time to think  but only talked  and talked successfully  of what he had thought while in the country
he sometimes noticed with dissatisfaction that he repeated the same remark on the same day in different circles
but he was so busy for whole days together that he had no time to notice that he was thinking of nothing
as he had done on their first meeting at kochubey's  speranski produced a strong impression on prince andrew on the wednesday  when he received him tête à tête at his own house and talked to him long and confidentially
to bolkonski so many people appeared contemptible and insignificant creatures  and he so longed to find in someone the living ideal of that perfection toward which he strove  that he readily believed that in speranski he had found this ideal of a perfectly rational and virtuous man
had speranski sprung from the same class as himself and possessed the same breeding and traditions  bolkonski would soon have discovered his weak  human  unheroic sides  but as it was  speranski's strange and logical turn of mind inspired him with respect all the more because he did not quite understand him moreover  speranski  either because he appreciated the other's capacity or because he considered it necessary to win him to his side  showed off his dispassionate calm reasonableness before prince andrew and flattered him with that subtle flattery which goes hand in hand with self assurance and consists in a tacit assumption that one's companion is the only man besides oneself capable of understanding the folly of the rest of mankind and the reasonableness and profundity of one's own ideas
during their long conversation on wednesday evening  speranski more than once remarked   we regard everything that is above the common level of rooted custom     or  with a smile   but we want the wolves to be fed and the sheep to be safe     or   they cannot understand this     and all in a way that seemed to say   we  you and i  understand what they are and who we are   this first long conversation with speranski only strengthened in prince andrew the feeling he had experienced toward him at their first meeting
he saw in him a remarkable  clear thinking man of vast intellect who by his energy and persistence had attained power  which he was using solely for the welfare of russia
in prince andrew's eyes speranski was the man he would himself have wished to be one who explained all the facts of life reasonably  considered important only what was rational  and was capable of applying the standard of reason to everything everything seemed so simple and clear in speranski's exposition that prince andrew involuntarily agreed with him about everything
if he replied and argued  it was only because he wished to maintain his independence and not submit to speranski's opinions entirely
everything was right and everything was as it should be  only one thing disconcerted prince andrew
this was speranski's cold  mirrorlike look  which did not allow one to penetrate to his soul  and his delicate white hands  which prince andrew involuntarily watched as one does watch the hands of those who possess power
this mirrorlike gaze and those delicate hands irritated prince andrew  he knew not why
he was unpleasantly struck  too  by the excessive contempt for others that he observed in speranski  and by the diversity of lines of argument he used to support his opinions
he made use of every kind of mental device  except analogy  and passed too boldly  it seemed to prince andrew  from one to another
now he would take up the position of a practical man and condemn dreamers  now that of a satirist  and laugh ironically at his opponents  now grow severely logical  or suddenly rise to the realm of metaphysics
 this last resource was one he very frequently employed   he would transfer a question to metaphysical heights  pass on to definitions of space  time  and thought  and  having deduced the refutation he needed  would again descend to the level of the original discussion
in general the trait of speranski's mentality which struck prince andrew most was his absolute and unshakable belief in the power and authority of reason
it was evident that the thought could never occur to him which to prince andrew seemed so natural  namely  that it is after all impossible to express all one thinks  and that he had never felt the doubt   is not all i think and believe nonsense   and it was just this peculiarity of speranski's mind that particularly attracted prince andrew
during the first period of their acquaintance bolkonski felt a passionate admiration for him similar to that which he had once felt for bonaparte
the fact that speranski was the son of a village priest  and that stupid people might meanly despise him on account of his humble origin  as in fact many did   caused prince andrew to cherish his sentiment for him the more  and unconsciously to strengthen it
on that first evening bolkonski spent with him  having mentioned the commission for the revision of the code of laws  speranski told him sarcastically that the commission had existed for a hundred and fifty years  had cost millions  and had done nothing except that rosenkampf had stuck labels on the corresponding paragraphs of the different codes
 and that is all the state has for the millions it has spent   said he
 we want to give the senate new juridical powers  but we have no laws
that is why it is a sin for men like you  prince  not to serve in these times   prince andrew said that for that work an education in jurisprudence was needed which he did not possess
 but nobody possesses it  so what would you have  it is a vicious circle from which we must break a way out   a week later prince andrew was a member of the committee on army regulations and what he had not at all expected was chairman of a section of the committee for the revision of the laws
at speranski's request he took the first part of the civil code that was being drawn up and  with the aid of the code napoleon and the institutes of justinian  he worked at formulating the section on personal rights
nearly two years before this  in 1808  pierre on returning to petersburg after visiting his estates had involuntarily found himself in a leading position among the petersburg freemasons he arranged dining and funeral lodge meetings  enrolled new members  and busied himself uniting various lodges and acquiring authentic charters he gave money for the erection of temples and supplemented as far as he could the collection of alms  in regard to which the majority of members were stingy and irregular he supported almost singlehanded a poorhouse the order had founded in petersburg
his life meanwhile continued as before  with the same infatuations and dissipations
he liked to dine and drink well  and though he considered it immoral and humiliating could not resist the temptations of the bachelor circles in which he moved
amid the turmoil of his activities and distractions  however  pierre at the end of a year began to feel that the more firmly he tried to rest upon it  the more masonic ground on which he stood gave way under him
at the same time he felt that the deeper the ground sank under him the closer bound he involuntarily became to the order
when he had joined the freemasons he had experienced the feeling of one who confidently steps onto the smooth surface of a bog
when he put his foot down it sank in
to make quite sure of the firmness of the ground  he put his other foot down and sank deeper still  became stuck in it  and involuntarily waded knee deep in the bog
joseph alexeevich was not in petersburg he had of late stood aside from the affairs of the petersburg lodges  and lived almost entirely in moscow
all the members of the lodges were men pierre knew in ordinary life  and it was difficult for him to regard them merely as brothers in freemasonry and not as prince b
or ivan vasilevich d   whom he knew in society mostly as weak and insignificant men
under the masonic aprons and insignia he saw the uniforms and decorations at which they aimed in ordinary life often after collecting alms  and reckoning up twenty to thirty rubles received for the most part in promises from a dozen members  of whom half were as well able to pay as himself  pierre remembered the masonic vow in which each brother promised to devote all his belongings to his neighbor  and doubts on which he tried not to dwell arose in his soul he divided the brothers he knew into four categories
in the first he put those who did not take an active part in the affairs of the lodges or in human affairs  but were exclusively occupied with the mystical science of the order  with questions of the threefold designation of god  the three primordial elements  sulphur  mercury  and salt or the meaning of the square and all the various figures of the temple of solomon
pierre respected this class of brothers to which the elder ones chiefly belonged  including  pierre thought  joseph alexeevich himself  but he did not share their interests his heart was not in the mystical aspect of freemasonry
in the second category pierre reckoned himself and others like him  seeking and vacillating  who had not yet found in freemasonry a straight and comprehensible path  but hoped to do so in the third category he included those brothers  the majority  who saw nothing in freemasonry but the external forms and ceremonies  and prized the strict performance of these forms without troubling about their purport or significance such were willarski and even the grand master of the principal lodge
finally  to the fourth category also a great many brothers belonged  particularly those who had lately joined
these according to pierre's observations were men who had no belief in anything  nor desire for anything  but joined the freemasons merely to associate with the wealthy young brothers who were influential through their connections or rank  and of whom there were very many in the lodge
pierre began to feel dissatisfied with what he was doing
freemasonry  at any rate as he saw it here  sometimes seemed to him based merely on externals
he did not think of doubting freemasonry itself  but suspected that russian masonry had taken a wrong path and deviated from its original principles
and so toward the end of the year he went abroad to be initiated into the higher secrets of the order
in the summer of 1809 pierre returned to petersburg
our freemasons knew from correspondence with those abroad that bezukhov had obtained the confidence of many highly placed persons  had been initiated into many mysteries  had been raised to a higher grade  and was bringing back with him much that might conduce to the advantage of the masonic cause in russia
the petersburg freemasons all came to see him  tried to ingratiate themselves with him  and it seemed to them all that he was preparing something for them and concealing it a solemn meeting of the lodge of the second degree was convened  at which pierre promised to communicate to the petersburg brothers what he had to deliver to them from the highest leaders of their order
the meeting was a full one
after the usual ceremonies pierre rose and began his address
 dear brothers   he began  blushing and stammering  with a written speech in his hand   it is not sufficient to observe our mysteries in the seclusion of our lodge we must act act  we are drowsing  but we must act   pierre raised  for the dissemination of pure truth and to secure the triumph of virtue   he read   we must cleanse men from prejudice  diffuse principles in harmony with the spirit of the times  undertake the education of the young  unite ourselves in indissoluble bonds with the wisest men  boldly yet prudently overcome superstitions  infidelity  and folly  and form of those devoted to us a body linked together by unity of purpose and possessed of authority and power
 to attain this end we must secure a preponderance of virtue over vice and must endeavor to secure that the honest man may  even in this world  receive a lasting reward for his virtue
but in these great endeavors we are gravely hampered by the political institutions of today
what is to be done in these circumstances  to favor revolutions  overthrow everything  repel force by force    no  we are very far from that
every violent reform deserves censure  for it quite fails to remedy evil while men remain what they are  and also because wisdom needs no violence
 the whole plan of our order should be based on the idea of preparing men of firmness and virtue bound together by unity of conviction aiming at the punishment of vice and folly  and patronizing talent and virtue  raising worthy men from the dust and attaching them to our brotherhood
only then will our order have the power unobtrusively to bind the hands of the protectors of disorder and to control them without their being aware of it
in a word  we must found a form of government holding universal sway  which should be diffused over the whole world without destroying the bonds of citizenship  and beside which all other governments can continue in their customary course and do everything except what impedes the great aim of our order  which is to obtain for virtue the victory over vice
this aim was that of christianity itself
it taught men to be wise and good and for their own benefit to follow the example and instruction of the best and wisest men
 at that time  when everything was plunged in darkness  preaching alone was of course sufficient
the novelty of truth endowed her with special strength  but now we need much more powerful methods
it is now necessary that man  governed by his senses  should find in virtue a charm palpable to those senses
it is impossible to eradicate the passions  but we must strive to direct them to a noble aim  and it is therefore necessary that everyone should be able to satisfy his passions within the limits of virtue
our order should provide means to that end
 as soon as we have a certain number of worthy men in every state  each of them again training two others and all being closely united  everything will be possible for our order  which has already in secret accomplished much for the welfare of mankind   this speech not only made a strong impression  but created excitement in the lodge
the majority of the brothers  seeing in it dangerous designs of illuminism  * met it with a coldness that surprised pierre
the grand master began answering him  and pierre began developing his views with more and more warmth
it was long since there had been so stormy a meeting
parties were formed  some accusing pierre of illuminism  others supporting him
at that meeting he was struck for the first time by the endless variety of men's minds  which prevents a truth from ever presenting itself identically to two persons
even those members who seemed to be on his side understood him in their own way with limitations and alterations he could not agree to  as what he always wanted most was to convey his thought to others just as he himself understood it * the illuminati sought to substitute republican for monarchical institutions
at the end of the meeting the grand master with irony and ill will reproved bezukhov for his vehemence and said it was not love of virtue alone  but also a love of strife that had moved him in the dispute
pierre did not answer him and asked briefly whether his proposal would be accepted
he was told that it would not  and without waiting for the usual formalities he left the lodge and went home
again pierre was overtaken by the depression he so dreaded
for three days after the delivery of his speech at the lodge he lay on a sofa at home receiving no one and going nowhere
it was just then that he received a letter from his wife  who implored him to see her  telling him how grieved she was about him and how she wished to devote her whole life to him
at the end of the letter she informed him that in a few days she would return to petersburg from abroad
following this letter one of the masonic brothers whom pierre respected less than the others forced his way in to see him and  turning the conversation upon pierre's matrimonial affairs  by way of fraternal advice expressed the opinion that his severity to his wife was wrong and that he was neglecting one of the first rules of freemasonry by not forgiving the penitent
at the same time his mother in law  prince vasili's wife  sent to him imploring him to come if only for a few minutes to discuss a most important matter
pierre saw that there was a conspiracy against him and that they wanted to reunite him with his wife  and in the mood he then was  this was not even unpleasant to him
nothing mattered to him
nothing in life seemed to him of much importance  and under the influence of the depression that possessed him he valued neither his liberty nor his resolution to punish his wife
 no one is right and no one is to blame  so she too is not to blame   he thought
if he did not at once give his consent to a reunion with his wife  it was only because in his state of depression he did not feel able to take any step
had his wife come to him  he would not have turned her away
compared to what preoccupied him  was it not a matter of indifference whether he lived with his wife or not  without replying either to his wife or his mother in law  pierre late one night prepared for a journey and started for moscow to see joseph alexeevich
this is what he noted in his diary  moscow  17th november i have just returned from my benefactor  and hasten to write down what i have experienced
joseph alexeevich is living poorly and has for three years been suffering from a painful disease of the bladder
no one has ever heard him utter a groan or a word of complaint
from morning till late at night  except when he eats his very plain food  he is working at science
he received me graciously and made me sit down on the bed on which he lay
i made the sign of the knights of the east and of jerusalem  and he responded in the same manner  asking me with a mild smile what i had learned and gained in the prussian and scottish lodges
i told him everything as best i could  and told him what i had proposed to our petersburg lodge  of the bad reception i had encountered  and of my rupture with the brothers
joseph alexeevich  having remained silent and thoughtful for a good while  told me his view of the matter  which at once lit up for me my whole past and the future path i should follow
he surprised me by asking whether i remembered the threefold aim of the order   1  the preservation and study of the mystery
 2  the purification and reformation of oneself for its reception  and  3  the improvement of the human race by striving for such purification
which is the principal aim of these three  certainly self reformation and self purification
only to this aim can we always strive independently of circumstances but at the same time just this aim demands the greatest efforts of us  and so  led astray by pride  losing sight of this aim  we occupy ourselves either with the mystery which in our impurity we are unworthy to receive  or seek the reformation of the human race while ourselves setting an example of baseness and profligacy
illuminism is not a pure doctrine  just because it is attracted by social activity and puffed up by pride
on this ground joseph alexeevich condemned my speech and my whole activity  and in the depth of my soul i agreed with him
talking of my family affairs he said to me   the chief duty of a true mason  as i have told you  lies in perfecting himself we often think that by removing all the difficulties of our life we shall more quickly reach our aim  but on the contrary  my dear sir  it is only in the midst of worldly cares that we can attain our three chief aims   1  self knowledge for man can only know himself by comparison   2  self perfecting  which can only be attained by conflict  and  3  the attainment of the chief virtue love of death only the vicissitudes of life can show us its vanity and develop our innate love of death or of rebirth to a new life   these words are all the more remarkable because  in spite of his great physical sufferings  joseph alexeevich is never weary of life though he loves death  for which in spite of the purity and loftiness of his inner man  he does not yet feel himself sufficiently prepared my benefactor then explained to me fully the meaning of the great square of creation and pointed out to me that the numbers three and seven are the basis of everything
he advised me not to avoid intercourse with the petersburg brothers  but to take up only second grade posts in the lodge  to try  while diverting the brothers from pride  to turn them toward the true path self knowledge and selfperfecting
besides this he advised me for myself personally above all to keep writing in and in which i will in future note down all my actions
petersburg  23rd november i am again living with my wife
my mother in law came to me in tears and said that helene was here and that she implored me to hear her  that she was innocent and unhappy at my desertion  and much more
i knew that if i once let myself see her i should not have strength to go on refusing what she wanted
in my perplexity i did not know whose aid and advice to seek
had my benefactor been here he would have told me what to do
i went to my room and reread joseph alexeevich's letters and recalled my conversations with him  and deduced from it all that i ought not to refuse a supplicant  and ought to reach a helping hand to everyone especially to one so closely bound to me and that i must bear my cross
but if i forgive her for the sake of doing right  then let union with her have only a spiritual aim
that is what i decided  and what i wrote to joseph alexeevich
i told my wife that i begged her to forget the past  to forgive me whatever wrong i may have done her  and that i had nothing to forgive
it gave me joy to tell her this
she need not know how hard it was for me to see her again
i have settled on the upper floor of this big house and am experiencing a happy feeling of regeneration
at that time  as always happens  the highest society that met at court and at the grand balls was divided into several circles  each with its own particular tone
the largest of these was the french circle of the napoleonic alliance  the circle of count rumyantsev and caulaincourt
in this group helene  as soon as she had settled in petersburg with her husband  took a very prominent place
she was visited by the members of the french embassy and by many belonging to that circle and noted for their intellect and polished manners
helene had been at erfurt during the famous meeting of the emperors and had brought from there these connections with the napoleonic notabilities
at erfurt her success had been brilliant
napoleon himself had noticed her in the theater and said of her   c'est un superbe animal   * her success as a beautiful and elegant woman did not surprise pierre  for she had become even handsomer than before what did surprise him was that during these last two years his wife had succeeded in gaining the reputation  d' une femme charmante  aussi spirituelle que belle   * 2  the distinguished prince de ligne wrote her eight page letters
bilibin saved up his epigrams to produce them in countess bezukhova's presence to be received in the countess bezukhova's attending helene's evenings  to have something to say in her salon  and secretaries of the embassy  and even ambassadors  confided diplomatic secrets to her  so that in a way helene was a power
pierre  who knew she was very stupid  sometimes attended  with a strange feeling of perplexity and fear  her evenings and dinner parties  where politics  poetry  and philosophy were discussed
at these parties his feelings were like those of a conjuror who always expects his trick to be found out at any moment
but whether because stupidity was just what was needed to run such a salon  or because those who were deceived found pleasure in the deception  at any rate it remained unexposed and helene bezukhova's reputation as a lovely and clever woman became so firmly established that she could say the emptiest and stupidest things and everybody would go into raptures over every word of hers and look for a profound meaning in it of which she herself had no conception
*  that's a superb animal   *  2   of a charming woman  as witty as she is lovely   pierre was just the husband needed for a brilliant society woman
he was that absent minded crank  a grand seigneur husband who was in no one's way  and far from spoiling the high tone and general impression of the drawing room  he served  by the contrast he presented to her  as an advantageous background to his elegant and tactful wife
pierre during the last two years  as a result of his continual absorption in abstract interests and his sincere contempt for all else  had acquired in his wife's circle  which did not interest him  that air of unconcern  indifference  and benevolence toward all  which cannot be acquired artificially and therefore inspires involuntary respect
he entered his wife's drawing room as one enters a theater  was acquainted with everybody  equally pleased to see everyone  and equally indifferent to them all
sometimes he joined in a conversation which interested him and  regardless of whether any  gentlemen of the embassy  were present or not  lispingly expressed his views  which were sometimes not at all in accord with the accepted tone of the moment
but the general opinion concerning the queer husband of  the most distinguished woman in petersburg  was so well established that no one took his freaks seriously
among the many young men who frequented her house every day  boris drubetskoy  who had already achieved great success in the service  was the most intimate friend of the bezukhov household since helene's return from erfurt
helene spoke of him as  mon page  and treated him like a child
her smile for him was the same as for everybody  but sometimes that smile made pierre uncomfortable
toward him boris behaved with a particularly dignified and sad deference
this shade of deference also disturbed pierre
he had suffered so painfully three years before from the mortification to which his wife had subjected him that he now protected himself from the danger of its repetition  first by not being a husband to his wife  and secondly by not allowing himself to suspect  no  now that she has become a bluestocking she has finally renounced her former infatuations   he told himself  there has never been an instance of a bluestocking being carried away by affairs of the heart  a statement which  though gathered from an unknown source  he believed implicitly
yet strange to say boris' presence in his wife's drawing room  and he was almost always there  had a physical effect upon pierre  it constricted his limbs and destroyed the unconsciousness and freedom of his movements
 what a strange antipathy   thought pierre   yet i used to like him very much   in the eyes of the world pierre was a great gentleman  the rather blind and absurd husband of a distinguished wife  a clever crank who did nothing but harmed nobody and was a first rate  good natured fellow
but a complex and difficult process of internal development was taking place all this time in pierre's soul  revealing much to him and causing him many spiritual doubts and joys
pierre went on with his diary  and this is what he wrote in it during that time  24th november got up at eight  read the scriptures  then went to my duties
 by joseph alexeevich's advice pierre had entered the service of the state and served on one of the committees   returned home for dinner and dined alone the countess had many visitors i do not like
i ate and drank moderately and after dinner copied out some passages for the brothers
in the evening i went down to the countess and told a funny story about b   and only remembered that i ought not to have done so when everybody laughed loudly at it
i am going to bed with a happy and tranquil mind
great god  help me to walk in thy paths   1  to conquer anger by calmness and deliberation   2  to vanquish lust by self restraint and repulsion   3  to withdraw from worldliness  but not avoid  a  the service of the state   b  family duties   c  relations with my friends  and the management of my affairs
27th november i got up late
on waking i lay long in bed yielding to sloth
o god  help and strengthen me that i may walk in thy ways  read the scriptures  but without proper feeling
brother urusov came and we talked about worldly vanities
he told me of the emperor's new projects
i began to criticize them  but remembered my rules and my benefactor's words that a true freemason should be a zealous worker for the state when his aid is required and a quiet onlooker when not called on to assist
my tongue is my enemy
brothers g
v
and o
visited me and we had a preliminary talk about the reception of a new brother
they laid on me the duty of rhetor
i feel myself weak and unworthy
then our talk turned to the interpretation of the seven pillars and steps of the temple  the seven sciences  the seven virtues  the seven vices  and the seven gifts of the holy spirit
brother o
was very eloquent
in the evening the admission took place
the new decoration of the premises contributed much to the magnificence of the spectacle
it was boris drubetskoy who was admitted
i nominated him and was the rhetor
a strange feeling agitated me all the time i was alone with him in the dark chamber
i caught myself harboring a feeling of hatred toward him which i vainly tried to overcome
that is why i should really like to save him from evil and lead him into the path of truth  but evil thoughts of him did not leave me
it seemed to me that his object in entering the brotherhood was merely to be intimate and in favor with members of our lodge
apart from the fact that he had asked me several times whether n
and s
were members of our lodge  a question to which i could not reply  and that according to my observation he is incapable of feeling respect for our holy order and is too preoccupied and satisfied with the outer man to desire spiritual improvement  i had no cause to doubt him  but he seemed to me insincere  and all the time i stood alone with him in the dark temple it seemed to me that he was smiling contemptuously at my words  and i wished really to stab his bare breast with the sword i held to it
i could not be eloquent  nor could i frankly mention my doubts to the brothers and to the grand master
great architect of nature  help me to find the true path out of the labyrinth of lies  after this  three pages were left blank in the diary  and then the following was written  i have had a long and instructive talk alone with brother v   who advised me to hold fast by brother a
though i am unworthy  much was revealed to me
adonai is the name of the creator of the world
elohim is the name of the ruler of all
the third name is the name unutterable which means the all
talks with brother v
strengthen  refresh  and support me in the path of virtue
in his presence doubt has no place
the distinction between the poor teachings of mundane science and our sacred all embracing teaching is clear to me
human sciences dissect everything to comprehend it  and kill everything to examine it
in the holy science of our order all is one  all is known in its entirety and life
the trinity the three elements of matter are sulphur  mercury  and salt
sulphur is of an oily and fiery nature  in combination with salt by its fiery nature it arouses a desire in the latter by means of which it attracts mercury  seizes it  holds it  and in combination produces other bodies
mercury is a fluid  volatile  spiritual essence
christ  the holy spirit  him   
3rd december awoke late  read the scriptures but was apathetic
afterwards went and paced up and down the large hall
i wished to meditate  but instead my imagination pictured an occurrence of four years ago  when dolokhov  meeting me in moscow after our duel  said he hoped i was enjoying perfect peace of mind in spite of my wife's absence
at the time i gave him no answer
now i recalled every detail of that meeting and in my mind gave him the most malevolent and bitter replies
i recollected myself and drove away that thought only when i found myself glowing with anger  but i did not sufficiently repent
afterwards boris drubetskoy came and began relating various adventures
his coming vexed me from the first  and i said something disagreeable to him
he replied
i flared up and said much that was unpleasant and even rude to him
he became silent  and i recollected myself only when it was too late
my god  i cannot get on with him at all
the cause of this is my egotism
i set myself above him and so become much worse than he  for he is lenient to my rudeness while i on the contrary nourish contempt for him
o god  grant that in his presence i may rather see my own vileness  and behave so that he too may benefit
after dinner i fell asleep and as i was drowsing off i clearly heard a voice saying in my left ear   thy day   i dreamed that i was walking in the dark and was suddenly surrounded by dogs  but i went on undismayed
suddenly a smallish dog seized my left thigh with its teeth and would not let go
i began to throttle it with my hands
scarcely had i torn it off before another  a bigger one  began biting me
i lifted it up  but the higher i lifted it the bigger and heavier it grew
and suddenly brother a
came and  taking my arm  led me to a building to enter which we had to pass along a narrow plank
i stepped on it  but it bent and gave way and i began to clamber up a fence which i could scarcely reach with my hands
after much effort i dragged myself up  so that my leg hung down on one side and my body on the other
i looked round and saw brother a
standing on the fence and pointing me to a broad avenue and garden  and in the garden was a large and beautiful building
i woke up
o lord  great architect of nature  help me to tear from myself these dogs my passions especially the last  which unites in itself the strength of all the former ones  and aid me to enter that temple of virtue to a vision of which i attained in my dream
7th december i dreamed that joseph alexeevich was sitting in my house  and that i was very glad and wished to entertain him
it seemed as if i chattered incessantly with other people and suddenly remembered that this could not please him  and i wished to come close to him and embrace him
but as soon as i drew near i saw that his face had changed and grown young  and he was quietly telling me something about the teaching of our order  but so softly that i could not hear it
then it seemed that we all left the room and something strange happened
we were sitting or lying on the floor
he was telling me something  and i wished to show him my sensibility  and not listening to what he was saying i began picturing to myself the condition of my inner man and the grace of god sanctifying me
and tears came into my eyes  and i was glad he noticed this
but he looked at me with vexation and jumped up  breaking off his remarks
i felt abashed and asked whether what he had been saying did not concern me  but he did not reply  gave me a kind look  and then we suddenly found ourselves in my bedroom where there is a double bed
he lay down on the edge of it and i burned with longing to caress him and lie down too
and he said   tell me frankly what is your chief temptation  do you know it  i think you know it already   abashed by this question  i replied that sloth was my chief temptation
he shook his head incredulously  and even more abashed  i said that though i was living with my wife as he advised  i was not living with her as her husband
to this he replied that one should not deprive a wife of one's embraces and gave me to understand that that was my duty
but i replied that i should be ashamed to do it  and suddenly everything vanished
and i awoke and found in my mind the text from the gospel   the life was the light of men
and the light shineth in darkness  and the darkness comprehended it not   joseph alexeevich's face had looked young and bright
that day i received a letter from my benefactor in which he wrote about  conjugal duties   9th december i had a dream from which i awoke with a throbbing heart
i saw that i was in moscow in my house  in the big sitting room  and joseph alexeevich came in from the drawing room
i seemed to know at once that the process of regeneration had already taken place in him  and i rushed to meet him
i embraced him and kissed his hands  and he said   hast thou noticed that my face is different   i looked at him  still holding him in my arms  and saw that his face was young  but that he had no hair on his head and his features were quite changed and i said   i should have known you had i met you by chance   and i thought to myself   am i telling the truth   and suddenly i saw him lying like a dead body  then he gradually recovered and went with me into pages there were excellent drawings
and in my dream i knew that these drawings represented the love adventures of the soul with its beloved
and on its pages i saw a beautiful representation of a maiden in transparent garments and with a transparent body  flying up to the clouds
and i seemed to know that this maiden was nothing else than a representation of the song of songs
and looking at those drawings i dreamed i felt that i was doing wrong  but could not tear myself away from them
lord  help me  my god  if thy forsaking me is thy doing  thy will be done  but if i am myself the cause  teach me what i should do  i shall perish of my debauchery if thou utterly desertest me  the rostovs' monetary affairs had not improved during the two years they had spent in the country
though nicholas rostov had kept firmly to his resolution and was still serving modestly in an obscure regiment  spending comparatively little  the way of life at otradnoe mitenka's management of affairs  in particular was such that the debts inevitably increased every year
the only resource obviously presenting itself to the old count was to apply for an official post  so he had come to petersburg to look for one and also  as he said  to let the lassies enjoy themselves for the last time soon after their arrival in petersburg berg proposed to vera and was accepted
though in moscow the rostovs belonged to the best society without themselves giving it a thought  yet in petersburg their circle of acquaintances was a mixed and indefinite one in petersburg they were provincials  and the very people they had entertained in moscow without inquiring to what set they belonged  here looked down on them
the rostovs lived in the same hospitable way in petersburg as in moscow  and the most diverse people met at their suppers
country neighbors from otradnoe  impoverished old squires and their daughters  peronskaya a maid of honor  pierre bezukhov  and the son of their district postmaster who had obtained a post in petersburg
among the men who very soon became frequent visitors at the rostovs' house in petersburg were boris  pierre whom the count had met in the street and dragged home with him  and berg who spent whole days at the rostovs' and paid the eldest daughter  countess vera  the attentions a young man pays when he intends to propose
not in vain had berg shown everybody his right hand wounded at austerlitz and held a perfectly unnecessary sword in his left
he narrated that episode so persistently and with so important an air that everyone believed in the merit and usefulness of his deed  and he had obtained two decorations for austerlitz
in the finnish war he also managed to distinguish himself he had picked up the scrap of a grenade that had killed an aide de camp standing near the commander in chief and had taken it to his commander
just as he had done after austerlitz  he related this occurrence at such length and so insistently that everyone again believed it had been necessary to do this  and he received two decorations for the finnish war also
in 1809 he was a captain in the guards  wore medals  and held some special lucrative posts in petersburg
though some skeptics smiled when told of berg's merits  it could not be denied that he was a painstaking and brave officer  on excellent terms with his superiors  and a moral young man with a brilliant career before him and an assured position in society four years before  meeting a german comrade in the stalls of a moscow theater  berg had pointed out vera rostova to him and had said in german   das soll mein weib werden   * and from that moment had made up his mind to marry her now in petersburg  having considered the rostovs' position and his own  he decided that the time had come to propose
*  that girl shall be my wife   berg's proposal was at first received with a perplexity that was not flattering to him
at first it seemed strange that the son of an obscure livonian gentleman should propose marriage to a countess rostova  but berg's chief characteristic was such a naive and good natured egotism that the rostovs involuntarily came to think it would be a good thing  since he himself was so firmly convinced that it was good  indeed excellent moreover  the rostovs' affairs were seriously embarrassed  as the suitor could not but know  and above all  vera was twenty four  had been taken out everywhere  and though she was certainly good looking and sensible  no one up to now had proposed to her
so they gave their consent
 you see   said berg to his comrade  whom he called  friend  only because he knew that everyone has friends   you see  i have considered it all  and should not marry if i had not thought it all out or if it were in any way unsuitable but on the contrary  my papa and mamma are now provided for i have arranged that rent for them in the baltic provinces and i can live in petersburg on my pay  and with her fortune and my good management we can get along nicely
i am not marrying for money i consider that dishonorable but a wife should bring her share and a husband his
i have my position in the service  she has connections and some means
in our times that is worth something  isn't it  but above all  she is a handsome  estimable girl  and she loves me     berg blushed and smiled
 and i love her  because her character is sensible and very good
now the other sister  though they are the same family  is quite different an unpleasant character and has not the same intelligence
she is so  
you know   
unpleasant  
but my fiancee   
well  you will be coming   he was going to say   to dine   but changed his mind and said  to take tea with us   and quickly doubling up his tongue he blew a small round ring of tobacco smoke  perfectly embodying his dream of happiness
after the first feeling of perplexity aroused in the parents by berg's proposal  the holiday tone of joyousness usual at such times took possession of the family  but the rejoicing was external and insincere
in the family's feeling toward this wedding a certain awkwardness and constraint was evident  as if they were ashamed of not having loved vera sufficiently and of being so ready to get her off their hands
the old count felt this most
he would probably have been unable to state the cause of his embarrassment  but it resulted from the state of his affairs
he did not know at all how much he had  what his debts amounted to  or what dowry he could give vera
when his daughters were born he had assigned to each of them  for her dowry  an estate with three hundred serfs  but one of these estates had already been sold  and the other was mortgaged and the interest so much in arrears that it would have to be sold  so that it was impossible to give it to vera
nor had he any money
berg had already been engaged a month  and only a week remained before the wedding  but the count had not yet decided in his own mind the question of the dowry  nor spoken to his wife about it
at one time the count thought of giving her the ryazan estate or of selling a forest  at another time of borrowing money on a note of hand
a few days before the wedding berg entered the count's study early one morning and  with a pleasant smile  respectfully asked his future father in law to let him know what vera's dowry would be
the count was so disconcerted by this long foreseen inquiry that without consideration he gave the first reply that came into his head
 i like your being businesslike about it   
i like it
you shall be satisfied      and patting berg on the shoulder he got up  wishing to end the conversation
but berg  smiling pleasantly  explained that if he did not know for certain how much vera would have and did not receive at least part of the dowry in advance  he would have to break matters off
 because  consider  count if i allowed myself to marry now without having definite means to maintain my wife  i should be acting badly      the conversation ended by the count  who wished to be generous and to avoid further importunity  saying that he would give a note of hand for eighty thousand rubles
berg smiled meekly  kissed the count on the shoulder  and said that he was very grateful  but that it was impossible for him to arrange his new life without receiving thirty thousand in ready money
 or at least twenty thousand  count   he added   and then a note of hand for only sixty thousand    yes  yes  all right   said the count hurriedly
 only excuse me  my dear fellow  i'll give you twenty thousand and a note of hand for eighty thousand as well
yes  yes  kiss me   natasha was sixteen and it was the year 1809  the very year to which she had counted on her fingers with boris after they had kissed four years ago
since then she had not seen him
before sonya and her mother  if boris happened to be mentioned  she spoke quite freely of that episode as of some childish  longforgotten matter that was not worth mentioning
but in the secret depths of her soul the question whether her engagement to boris was a jest or an important  binding promise tormented her
since boris left moscow in 1805 to join the army he had not seen the rostovs
he had been in moscow several times  and had passed near otradnoe  but had never been to see them
sometimes it occurred to natasha that he did not wish to see her  and this conjecture was confirmed by the sad tone in which her elders spoke of him
 nowadays old friends are not remembered   the countess would say when boris was mentioned
anna mikhaylovna also had of late visited them less frequently  seemed to hold herself with particular dignity  and always spoke rapturously and gratefully of the merits of her son and the brilliant career on which he had entered
when the rostovs came to petersburg boris called on them
he drove to their house in some agitation
the memory of natasha was his most poetic recollection
but he went with the firm intention of letting her and her parents feel that the childish relations between himself and natasha could not be binding either on her or on him he had a brilliant position in society thanks to his intimacy with countess bezukhova  a brilliant position in the service thanks to the patronage of an important personage whose complete confidence he enjoyed  and he was beginning to make plans for marrying one of the richest heiresses in petersburg  plans which might very easily be realized
when he entered the rostovs' drawing room natasha was in her own room
when she heard of his arrival she almost ran into the drawing room  flushed and beaming with a more than cordial smile
boris remembered natasha in a short dress  with dark eyes shining from under her curls and boisterous  childish laughter  as he had known her four years before  and so he was taken aback when quite a different natasha entered  and his face expressed rapturous astonishment
this expression on his face pleased natasha
 well  do you recognize your little madcap playmate   asked the countess
boris kissed natasha's hand and said that he was astonished at the change in her
 how handsome you have grown    i should think so   replied natasha's laughing eyes
 and is papa older   she asked
natasha sat down and  without joining in boris' conversation with the countess  silently and minutely studied her childhood's suitor
he felt the weight of that resolute and affectionate scrutiny and glanced at her occasionally
boris' uniform  spurs  tie  and the way his hair was brushed were all comme il faut and in the latest fashion
this natasha noticed at once
he sat rather sideways in the armchair next to the countess  arranging with his right hand the cleanest of gloves that fitted his left hand like a skin  and he spoke with a particularly refined compression of his lips about the amusements of the highest petersburg society  recalling with mild irony old times in moscow and moscow acquaintances
it was not accidentally  natasha felt  that he alluded  when speaking of the highest aristocracy  to an ambassador's ball he had attended  and to invitations he had received from n n
and s s
all this time natasha sat silent  glancing up at him from under her brows
this gaze disturbed and confused boris more and more
he looked round more frequently toward her  and broke off in what he was saying
he did not stay more than ten minutes  then rose and took his leave
the same inquisitive  challenging  and rather mocking eyes still looked at him
after his first visit boris said to himself that natasha attracted him just as much as ever  but that he must not yield to that feeling  because to marry her  a girl almost without fortune  would mean ruin to his career  while to renew their former relations without intending to marry her would be dishonorable boris made up his mind to avoid meeting natasha  but despite that resolution he called again a few days later and began calling often and spending whole days at the rostovs'
it seemed to him that he ought to have an explanation with natasha and tell her that the old times must be forgotten  that in spite of everything  
she could not be his wife  that he had no means  and they would never let her marry him
but he failed to do so and felt awkward about entering on such an explanation
from day to day he became more and more entangled
it seemed to her mother and sonya that natasha was in love with boris as of old
she sang him his favorite songs  showed him her album  making him write in it  did not allow him to allude to the past  letting it be understood how delightful was the present  and every day he went away in a fog  without having said what he meant to  and not knowing what he was doing or why he came  or how it would all end
he left off visiting helene and received reproachful notes from her every day  and yet he continued to spend whole days with the rostovs
one night when the old countess  in nightcap and dressing jacket  without her false curls  and with her poor little knob of hair showing under her white cotton cap  knelt sighing and groaning on a rug and bowing to the ground in prayer  her door creaked and natasha  also in a dressing jacket with slippers on her bare feet and her hair in curlpapers  ran in
the countess her prayerful mood dispelled looked round and frowned
she was finishing her last prayer   can it be that this couch will be my grave   natasha  flushed and eager  seeing her mother in prayer  suddenly checked her rush  half sat down  and unconsciously put out her tongue as if chiding herself
seeing that her mother was still praying she ran on tiptoe to the bed and  rapidly slipping one little foot against the other  pushed off her slippers and jumped onto the bed the countess had feared might become her grave
this couch was high  with a feather bed and five pillows each smaller than the one below
natasha jumped on it  sank into the feather bed  rolled over to the wall  and began snuggling up the bedclothes as she settled down  raising her knees to her chin  kicking out and laughing almost inaudibly  now covering herself up head and all  and now peeping at her mother
the countess finished her prayers and came to the bed with a stern face  but seeing  that natasha's head was covered  she smiled in her kind  weak way
 now then  now then   said she
 mamma  can we have a talk  yes   said natasha
 now  just one on your throat and another  
that'll do   and seizing her mother round the neck  she kissed her on the throat
in her behavior to her mother natasha seemed rough  but she was so sensitive and tactful that however she clasped her mother she always managed to do it without hurting her or making her feel uncomfortable or displeased
 well  what is it tonight   said the mother  having arranged her pillows and waited until natasha  after turning over a couple of times  had settled down beside her under the quilt  spread out her arms  and assumed a serious expression these visits of natasha's at night before the count returned from his club were one of the greatest pleasures of both mother  and daughter
 what is it tonight  but i have to tell you     natasha put her hand on her mother's mouth
 about boris  
i know   she said seriously   that's what i have come about
don't say it i know
no  do tell me   and she removed her hand
 tell me  mamma  he's nice    natasha  you are sixteen
at your age i was married
you say boris is nice
he is very nice  and i love him like a son
but what then   
what are you thinking about  you have quite turned his head  i can see that      as she said this the countess looked round at her daughter
natasha was lying looking steadily straight before her at one of the mahogany sphinxes carved on the corners of the bedstead  so that the countess only saw her daughter's face in profile
that face struck her by its peculiarly serious and concentrated expression
natasha was listening and considering
 well  what then   said she
 you have quite turned his head  and why  what do you want of him  you know you can't marry him    why not   said natasha  without changing her position
 because he is young  because he is poor  because he is a relation  
and because you yourself don't love him    how do you know    i know
it is not right  darling    but if i want to     said natasha
 leave off talking nonsense   said the countess
 but if i want to      natasha  i am in earnest     natasha did not let her finish
she drew the countess' large hand to her  kissed it on the back and then on the palm  then again turned it over and began kissing first one knuckle  then the space between the knuckles  then the next knuckle  whispering   january  february  march  april  may
speak  mamma  why don't you say anything  speak   said she  turning to her mother  who was tenderly gazing at her daughter and in that contemplation seemed to have forgotten all she had wished to say
 it won't do  my love  not everyone will understand this friendship dating from your childish days  and to see him so intimate with you may injure you in the eyes of other young men who visit us  and above all it torments him for nothing
he may already have found a suitable and wealthy match  and now he's half crazy    crazy   repeated natasha
 i'll tell you some things about myself
i had a cousin      i know  cyril matveich  
but he is old    he was not always old
but this is what i'll do  natasha  i'll have a talk with boris
he need not come so often       why not  if he likes to    because i know it will end in nothing       how can you know  no  mamma  don't speak to him  what nonsense   said natasha in the tone of one being deprived of her property
 well  i won't marry  but let him come if he enjoys it and i enjoy it   natasha smiled and looked at her mother
 not to marry  but just so   she added
 how so  my pet    just so
there's no need for me to marry him
but  
just so    just so  just so   repeated the countess  and shaking all over  she went off into a good humored  unexpected  elderly laugh
 don't laugh  stop   cried natasha
 you're shaking the whole bed  you're awfully like me  just such another giggler   
wait     and she seized the countess' hands and kissed a knuckle of the little finger  saying   june   and continued  kissing   july  august   on the other hand
 but  mamma  is he very much in love  what do you think  was anybody ever so much in love with you  and he's very nice  very  very nice
only not quite my taste he is so narrow  like the dining room clock   
don't you understand  narrow  you know gray  light gray      what rubbish you're talking   said the countess
natasha continued   don't you really understand  nicholas would understand   
bezukhov  now  is blue  dark blue and red  and he is square    you flirt with him too   said the countess  laughing
 no  he is a freemason  i have found out
he is fine  dark blue and red   
how can i explain it to you    little countess   the count's voice called from behind the door
 you're not asleep   natasha jumped up  snatched up her slippers  and ran barefoot to her own room
it was a long time before she could sleep
she kept thinking that no one could understand all that she understood and all there was in her
 sonya   she thought  glancing at that curled up  sleeping little kitten with her enormous plait of hair
 no  how could she  she's virtuous
she fell in love with nicholas and does not wish to know anything more
even mamma does not understand
it is wonderful how clever i am and how  
charming she is   she went on  speaking of herself in the third person  and imagining it was some very wise man the wisest and best of men who was saying it of her
 there is everything  everything in her   continued this man
 she is unusually intelligent  charming  
and then she is pretty  uncommonly pretty  and agile  she swims and rides splendidly   and her voice  one can really say it's a wonderful voice   she hummed a scrap from her favorite opera by cherubini  threw herself on her bed  laughed at the pleasant thought that she would immediately fall asleep  called dunyasha the maid to put out the candle  and before dunyasha had left the room had already passed into yet another happier world of dreams  where everything was as light and beautiful as in reality  and even more so because it was different next day the countess called boris aside and had a talk with him  after which he ceased coming to the rostovs'
on the thirty first of december  new year's eve  1809   10 an old grandee of catherine's day was giving a ball and midnight supper
the diplomatic corps and the emperor himself were to be present the grandee's well known mansion on the english quay glittered with innumerable lights
police were stationed at the brightly lit entrance which was carpeted with red baize  and not only gendarmes but dozens of police officers and even the police master himself stood at the porch carriages kept driving away and fresh ones arriving  with red liveried footmen and footmen in plumed hats
from the carriages emerged men wearing uniforms  stars  and ribbons  while ladies in satin and ermine cautiously descended the carriage steps which were let down for them with a clatter  and then walked hurriedly and noiselessly over the baize at the entrance almost every time a new carriage drove up a whisper ran through the crowd and caps were doffed
 the emperor   
no  a minister   
prince  
ambassador
don't you see the plumes      was whispered among the crowd
one person  better dressed than the rest  seemed to know everyone and mentioned by name the greatest dignitaries of the day
a third of the visitors had already arrived  but the rostovs  who were to be present  were still hurrying to get dressed
there had been many discussions and preparations for this ball in the rostov family  many fears that the invitation would not arrive  that the dresses would not be ready  or that something would not be arranged as it should be
marya ignatevna peronskaya  a thin and shallow maid of honor at the court of the dowager empress  who was a friend and relation of the countess and piloted the provincial rostovs in petersburg high society  was to accompany them to the ball
they were to call for her at her house in the taurida gardens at ten o'clock  but it was already five minutes to ten  and the girls were not yet dressed
natasha was going to her first grand ball
she had got up at eight that morning and had been in a fever of excitement and activity all day
all her powers since morning had been concentrated on ensuring that they all she herself  mamma  and sonya should be as well dressed as possible
sonya and her mother put themselves entirely in her hands the countess was to wear a claret colored velvet dress  and the two girls white gauze over pink silk slips  with roses on their bodices and their hair dressed a la grecque
everything essential had already been done  feet  hands  necks  and ears washed  perfumed  and powdered  as befits a ball  the openwork silk stockings and white satin shoes with ribbons were already on  the hairdressing was almost done
sonya was finishing dressing and so was the countess  but natasha  who had bustled about helping them all  was behindhand
she was still sitting before a looking glass with a dressing jacket thrown over her slender shoulders
sonya stood ready dressed in the middle of the room and  pressing the head of a pin till it hurt her dainty finger  was fixing on a last ribbon that squeaked as the pin went through it
 that's not the way  that's not the way  sonya   cried natasha turning her head and clutching with both hands at her hair which the maid who was dressing it had not time to release
 that bow is not right
come here   sonya sat down and natasha pinned the ribbon on differently
 allow me  miss  i can't do it like that   said the maid who was holding natasha's hair
 oh  dear  well then  wait
that's right  sonya    aren't you ready  it is nearly ten   came the countess' voice
 directly  directly  and you  mamma    i have only my cap to pin on    don't do it without me   called natasha
 you won't do it right    but it's already ten   they had decided to be at the ball by half past ten  and natasha had still to get dressed and they had to call at the taurida gardens
when her hair was done  natasha  in her short petticoat from under which her dancing shoes showed  and in her mother's dressing jacket  ran up to sonya  scrutinized her  and then ran to her mother
turning her mother's head this way and that  she fastened on the cap and  hurriedly kissing her gray hair  ran back to the maids who were turning up the hem of her skirt
the cause of the delay was natasha's skirt  which was too long
two maids were turning up the hem and hurriedly biting off the ends of thread
a third with pins in her mouth was running about between the countess and sonya  and a fourth held the whole of the gossamer garment up high on one uplifted hand
 mavra  quicker  darling    give me my thimble  miss  from there      whenever will you be ready   asked the count coming to the door
 here is some scent
peronskaya must be tired of waiting    it's ready  miss   said the maid  holding up the shortened gauze dress with two fingers  and blowing and shaking something off it  as if by this to express a consciousness of the airiness and purity of what she held
natasha began putting on the dress
 in a minute  in a minute  don't come in  papa   she cried to her father as he opened the door speaking from under the filmy skirt which still covered her whole face
sonya slammed the door to
a minute later they let the count in
he was wearing a blue swallow tail coat  shoes and stockings  and was perfumed and his hair pomaded
 oh  papa  how nice you look  charming   cried natasha  as she stood in the middle of the room smoothing out the folds of the gauze
 if you please  miss  allow me   said the maid  who on her knees was pulling the skirt straight and shifting the pins from one side of her mouth to the other with her tongue
 say what you like   exclaimed sonya  in a despairing voice as she looked at natasha   say what you like  it's still too long   natasha stepped back to look at herself in the pier glass
the dress was too long
 really  madam  it is not at all too long   said mavra  crawling on her knees after her young lady
 well  if it's too long we'll tack it up  
we'll tack it up in one minute   said the resolute dunyasha taking a needle that was stuck on the front of her little shawl and  still kneeling on the floor  set to work once more
at that moment  with soft steps  the countess came in shyly  in her cap and velvet gown
 oo oo  my beauty   exclaimed the count   she looks better than any of you   he would have embraced her but  blushing  she stepped aside fearing to be rumpled
 mamma  your cap  more to this side   said natasha
 i'll arrange it   and she rushed forward so that the maids who were tacking up her skirt could not move fast enough and a piece of gauze was torn off
 oh goodness  what has happened  really it was not my fault    never mind  i'll run it up  it won't show   said dunyasha
 what a beauty a very queen   said the nurse as she came to the door
 and sonya  they are lovely   at a quarter past ten they at last got into their carriages and started
but they had still to call at the taurida gardens
peronskaya was quite ready
in spite of her age and plainness she had gone through the same process as the rostovs  but with less flurry for to her it was a matter of routine
her ugly old body was washed  perfumed  and powdered in just the same way
she had washed behind her ears just as carefully  and when she entered her drawing room in her yellow dress  wearing her badge as maid of honor  her old lady's maid was as full of rapturous admiration as the rostovs' servants had been
she praised the rostovs' toilets
they praised her taste and toilet  and at eleven o'clock  careful of their coiffures and dresses  they settled themselves in their carriages and drove off natasha had not had a moment free since early morning and had not once had time to think of what lay before her
in the damp chill air and crowded closeness of the swaying carriage  she for the first time vividly imagined what was in store for her there at the ball  in those brightly lighted rooms with music  flowers  dances  the emperor  and all the brilliant young people of petersburg the prospect was so splendid that she hardly believed it would come true  so out of keeping was it with the chill darkness and closeness of the carriage
she understood all that awaited her only when  after stepping over the red baize at the entrance  she entered the hall  took off her fur cloak  and  beside sonya and in front of her mother  mounted the brightly illuminated stairs between the flowers
only then did she remember how she must behave at a ball  and tried to assume the majestic air she considered indispensable for a girl on such an occasion
but  fortunately for her  she felt her eyes growing misty  she saw nothing clearly  her pulse beat a hundred to the minute  and the blood throbbed at her heart
she could not assume that pose  which would have made her ridiculous  and she moved on almost fainting from excitement and trying with all her might to conceal it
and this was the very attitude that became her best
before and behind them other visitors were entering  also talking in low tones and wearing ball dresses
the mirrors on the landing reflected ladies in white  pale blue  and pink dresses  with diamonds and pearls on their bare necks and arms natasha looked in the mirrors and could not distinguish her reflection from the others
all was blended into one brilliant procession
on entering the ballroom the regular hum of voices  footsteps  and greetings deafened natasha  and the light and glitter dazzled her still more
the host and hostess  who had already been standing at the door for half an hour repeating the same words to the various arrivals   charme de vous voir   * greeted the rostovs and peronskaya in the same manner
*  delighted to see you   the two girls in their white dresses  each with a rose in her black hair  both curtsied in the same way  but the hostess' eye involuntarily rested longer on the slim natasha
she looked at her and gave her alone a special smile in addition to her usual smile as hostess
looking at her she may have recalled the golden  irrecoverable days of her own girlhood and her own first ball
the host also followed natasha with his eyes and asked the count which was his daughter
 charming   said he  kissing the tips of his fingers
in the ballroom guests stood crowding at the entrance doors awaiting the emperor
the countess took up a position in one of the front rows of that crowd
natasha heard and felt that several people were asking about her and looking at her
she realized that those noticing her liked her  and this observation helped to calm her
 there are some like ourselves and some worse   she thought
peronskaya was pointing out to the countess the most important people at the ball
 that is the dutch ambassador  do you see  that gray haired man   she said  indicating an old man with a profusion of silver gray curly hair  who was surrounded by ladies laughing at something he said
 ah  here she is  the queen of petersburg  countess bezukhova   said peronskaya  indicating helene who had just entered
 how lovely  she is quite equal to marya antonovna
see how the men  young and old  pay court to her
beautiful and clever  
they say prince is quite mad about her
but see  those two  though not good looking  are even more run after   she pointed to a lady who was crossing the room followed by a very plain daughter
 she is a splendid match  a millionairess   said peronskaya
 and look  here come her suitors    that is bezukhova's brother  anatole kuragin   she said  indicating a handsome officer of the horse guards who passed by them with head erect  looking at something over the heads of the ladies
 he's handsome  isn't he  i hear they will marry him to that rich girl
but your cousin  drubetskoy  is also very attentive to her
they say she has millions
oh yes  that's the french ambassador himself   she replied to the countess' inquiry about caulaincourt  looks as if he were a king  all the same  the french are charming  very charming
no one more charming in society
ah  here she is  yes  she is still the most beautiful of them all  our marya antonovna  and how simply she is dressed  lovely  and that stout one in spectacles is the universal freemason   she went on  indicating pierre
 put him beside his wife and he looks a regular buffoon   pierre  swaying his stout body  advanced  making way through the crowd and nodding to right and left as casually and good naturedly as if he were passing through a crowd at a fair
he pushed through  evidently looking for someone
natasha looked joyfully at the familiar face of pierre   the buffoon   as peronskaya had called him  and knew he was looking for them  and for her in particular
he had promised to be at the ball and introduce partners to her
but before he reached them pierre stopped beside a very handsome  dark man of middle height  and in a white uniform  who stood by a window talking to a tall man wearing stars and a ribbon
natasha at once recognized the shorter and younger man in the white uniform  it was bolkonski  who seemed to her to have grown much younger  happier  and better looking
 there's someone else we know bolkonski  do you see  mamma   said natasha  pointing out prince andrew
 you remember  he stayed a night with us at otradnoe    oh  you know him   said peronskaya
 i can't bear him
il fait a present la pluie et le beau temps
* he's too proud for anything
takes after his father
and he's hand in glove with speranski  writing some project or other
just look how he treats the ladies  there's one talking to him and he has turned away   she said  pointing at him
 i'd give it to him if he treated me as he does those ladies   *  he is all the rage just now   suddenly everybody stirred  began talking  and pressed forward and then back  and between the two rows  which separated  the emperor entered to the sounds of music that had immediately struck up
behind him walked his host and hostess
he walked in rapidly  bowing to right and left as if anxious to get the first moments of the reception over
the band played the polonaise in vogue at that time on account of the words that had been set to it  beginning   alexander  elisaveta  all our hearts you ravish quite     the emperor passed on to the drawing room  the crowd made a rush for the doors  and several persons with excited faces hurried there and back again
then the crowd hastily retired from the drawing room door  at which the emperor reappeared talking to the hostess
a young man  looking distraught  pounced down on the ladies  asking them to move aside
some ladies  with faces betraying complete forgetfulness of all the rules of decorum  pushed forward to the detriment of their toilets
the men began to choose partners and take their places for the polonaise
everyone moved back  and the emperor came smiling out of the drawing room leading his hostess by the hand but not keeping time to the music
the host followed with marya antonovna naryshkina  then came ambassadors  ministers  and various generals  whom peronskaya diligently named
more than half the ladies already had partners and were taking up  or preparing to take up  their positions for the polonaise
natasha felt that she would be left with her mother and sonya among a minority of women who crowded near the wall  not having been invited to dance
she stood with her slender arms hanging down  her scarcely defined bosom rising and falling regularly  and with bated breath and glittering  frightened eyes gazed straight before her  evidently prepared for the height of joy or misery she was not concerned about the emperor or any of those great people whom peronskaya was pointing out she had but one thought   is it possible no one will ask me  that i shall not be among the first to dance  is it possible that not one of all these men will notice me  they do not even seem to see me  or if they do they look as if they were saying  'ah  she's not the one i'm after  so it's not worth looking at her ' no  it's impossible   she thought
 they must know how i long to dance  how splendidly i dance  and how they would enjoy dancing with me   the strains of the polonaise  which had continued for a considerable time  had begun to sound like a sad reminiscence to natasha's ears
she wanted to cry
peronskaya had left them
the count was at the other end of the room
she and the countess and sonya were standing by themselves as in the depths of a forest amid that crowd of strangers  with no one interested in them and not wanted by anyone prince andrew with a lady passed by  evidently not recognizing them
the handsome anatole was smilingly talking to a partner on his arm and looked at natasha as one looks at a wall
boris passed them twice and each time turned away
berg and his wife  who were not dancing  came up to them
this family gathering seemed humiliating to natasha as if there were nowhere else for the family to talk but here at the ball
she did not listen to or look at vera  who was telling her something about her own green dress
at last the emperor stopped beside his last partner  he had danced with three  and the music ceased
a worried aide de camp ran up to the rostovs requesting them to stand farther back  though as it was they were already close to the wall  and from the gallery resounded the distinct  precise  enticingly rhythmical strains of a waltz
the emperor looked smilingly down the room
a minute passed but no one had yet begun dancing
an aide de camp  the master of ceremonies  went up to countess bezukhova and asked her to dance
she smilingly raised her hand and laid it on his shoulder without looking at him
the aide de camp  an adept in his art  grasping his partner firmly round her waist  with confident deliberation started smoothly  gliding first round the edge of the circle  then at the corner of the room he caught helene's left hand and turned her  the only sound audible  apart from the everquickening music  being the rhythmic click of the spurs on his rapid  agile feet  while at every third beat his partner's velvet dress spread out and seemed to flash as she whirled round
natasha gazed at them and was ready to cry because it was not she who was dancing that first turn of the waltz
prince andrew  in the white uniform of a cavalry colonel  wearing stockings and dancing shoes  stood looking animated and bright in the front row of the circle not far from the rostovs
baron firhoff was talking to him about the first sitting of the council of state to be held next day
prince andrew  as one closely connected with speranski and participating in the work of the legislative commission  could give reliable information about that sitting  concerning which various rumors were current
but not listening to what firhoff was saying  he was gazing now at the sovereign and now at the men intending to dance who had not yet gathered courage to enter the circle
prince andrew was watching these men abashed by the emperor's presence  and the women who were breathlessly longing to be asked to dance
pierre came up to him and caught him by the arm
 you always dance
i have a protegee  the young rostova  here
ask her   he said
 where is she   asked bolkonski
 excuse me   he added  turning to the baron   we will finish this conversation elsewhere at a ball one must dance   he stepped forward in the direction pierre indicated
the despairing  dejected expression of natasha's face caught his eye
he recognized her  guessed her feelings  saw that it was her debut  remembered her conversation at the window  and with an expression of pleasure on his face approached countess rostova
 allow me to introduce you to my daughter   said the countess  with heightened color
 i have the pleasure of being already acquainted  if the countess remembers me   said prince andrew with a low and courteous bow quite belying peronskaya's remarks about his rudeness  and approaching natasha he held out his arm to grasp her waist before he had completed his invitation
he asked her to waltz
that tremulous expression on natasha's face  prepared either for despair or rapture  suddenly brightened into a happy  grateful  childlike smile
 i have long been waiting for you   that frightened happy little girl seemed to say by the smile that replaced the threatened tears  as she raised her hand to prince andrew's shoulder
they were the second couple to enter the circle
prince andrew was one of the best dancers of his day and natasha danced exquisitely
her little feet in their white satin dancing shoes did their work swiftly  lightly  and independently of herself  while her face beamed with ecstatic happiness
her slender bare arms and neck were not beautiful  compared to helene's her shoulders looked thin and her bosom undeveloped but helene seemed  as it were  hardened by a varnish left by the thousands of looks that had scanned her person  while natasha was like a girl exposed for the first time  who would have felt very much ashamed had she not been assured that this was absolutely necessary
prince andrew liked dancing  and wishing to escape as quickly as possible from the political and clever talk which everyone addressed to him  wishing also to break up the circle of restraint he disliked  caused by the emperor's presence  he danced  and had chosen natasha because pierre pointed her out to him and because she was the first pretty girl who caught his eye  but scarcely had he embraced that slender supple figure and felt her stirring so close to him and smiling so near him than the wine of her charm rose to his head  and he felt himself revived and rejuvenated when after leaving her he stood breathing deeply and watching the other dancers after prince andrew  boris came up to ask natasha for a dance  and then the aide de camp who had opened the ball  and several other young men  so that  flushed and happy  and passing on her superfluous partners to sonya  she did not cease dancing all the evening
she noticed and saw nothing of what occupied everyone else
not only did she fail to notice that the emperor talked a long time with the french ambassador  and how particularly gracious he was to a certain lady  or that prince so and so and so and so did and said this and that  and that helene had great success and was honored by the special attention of so and so  but she did not even see the emperor  and only noticed that he had gone because the ball became livelier after his departure
for one of the merry cotillions before supper prince andrew was again her partner
he reminded her of their first encounter in the otradnoe avenue  and how she had been unable to sleep that moonlight night  and told her how he had involuntarily overheard her
natasha blushed at that recollection and tried to excuse herself  as if there had been something to be ashamed of in what prince andrew had overheard
like all men who have grown up in society  prince andrew liked meeting someone there not of the conventional society stamp
and such was natasha  with her surprise  her delight  her shyness  and even her mistakes in speaking french
with her he behaved with special care and tenderness  sitting beside her and talking of the simplest and most unimportant matters  he admired her shy grace
in the middle of the cotillion  having completed one of the figures  natasha  still out of breath  was returning to her seat when another dancer chose her
she was tired and panting and evidently thought of declining  but immediately put her hand gaily on the man's shoulder  smiling at prince andrew
 i'd be glad to sit beside you and rest  i'm tired  but you see how they keep asking me  and i'm glad of it  i'm happy and i love everybody  and you and i understand it all   and much  much more was said in her smile
when her partner left her natasha ran across the room to choose two ladies for the figure
 if she goes to her cousin first and then to another lady  she will be my wife   said prince andrew to himself quite to his own surprise  as he watched her she did go first to her cousin
 what rubbish sometimes enters one's head   thought prince andrew   but what is certain is that that girl is so charming  so original  that she won't be dancing here a month before she will be married   
such as she are rare here   he thought  as natasha  readjusting a rose that was slipping on her bodice  settled herself beside him
when the cotillion was over the old count in his blue coat came up to the dancers
he invited prince andrew to come and see them  and asked his daughter whether she was enjoying herself
natasha did not answer at once but only looked up with a smile that said reproachfully   how can you ask such a question    i have never enjoyed myself so much before   she said  and prince andrew noticed how her thin arms rose quickly as if to embrace her father and instantly dropped again natasha was happier than she had ever been in her life
she was at that height of bliss when one becomes completely kind and good and does not believe in the possibility of evil  unhappiness  or sorrow
at that ball pierre for the first time felt humiliated by the position his wife occupied in court circles
he was gloomy and absent minded
a deep furrow ran across his forehead  and standing by a window he stared over his spectacles seeing no one
on her way to supper natasha passed him
pierre's gloomy  unhappy look struck her
she stopped in front of him
she wished to help him  to bestow on him the superabundance of her own happiness
 how delightful it is  count   said she
 isn't it   pierre smiled absent mindedly  evidently not grasping what she said
 yes  i am very glad   he said
 how can people be dissatisfied with anything   thought natasha
 especially such a capital fellow as bezukhov   in natasha's eyes all the people at the ball alike were good  kind  and splendid people  loving one another  none of them capable of injuring another and so they ought all to be happy
next day prince andrew thought of the ball  but his mind did not dwell on it long
 yes  it was a very brilliant ball   and then  
 yes  that little rostova is very charming
there's something fresh  original  un petersburg like about her that distinguishes her   that was all he thought about yesterday's ball  and after his morning tea he set to work
but either from fatigue or want of sleep he was ill disposed for work and could get nothing done
he kept criticizing his own work  as he often did  and was glad when he heard someone coming
the visitor was bitski  who served on various committees  frequented all the societies in petersburg  and a passionate devotee of the new ideas and of speranski  and a diligent petersburg newsmonger one of those men who choose their opinions like their clothes according to the fashion  but who for that very reason appear to be the warmest partisans
hardly had he got rid of his hat before he ran into prince andrew's room with a preoccupied air and at once began talking
he had just heard particulars of that morning's sitting of the council of state opened by the emperor  and he spoke of it enthusiastically
the emperor's speech had been extraordinary
it had been a speech such as only constitutional monarchs deliver
 the sovereign plainly said that the council and senate are estates of the realm  he said that the government must rest not on authority but on secure bases
the emperor said that the fiscal system must be reorganized and the accounts published   recounted bitski  emphasizing certain words and opening his eyes significantly
 ah  yes  today's events mark an epoch  the greatest epoch in our history   he concluded
prince andrew listened to the account of the opening of the council of state  which he had so impatiently awaited and to which he had attached such importance  and was surprised that this event  now that it had taken place  did not affect him  and even seemed quite insignificant
he listened with quiet irony to bitski's enthusiastic account of it
a very simple thought occurred to him   what does it matter to me or to bitski what the emperor was pleased to say at the council  can all that make me any happier or better   and this simple reflection suddenly destroyed all the interest prince andrew had felt in the impending reforms he was going to dine that evening at speranski's   with only a few friends   as the host had said when inviting him
the prospect of that dinner in the intimate home circle of the man he so admired had greatly interested prince andrew  especially as he had not yet seen speranski in his domestic surroundings  but now he felt disinclined to go to it
at the appointed hour  however  he entered the modest house speranski owned in the taurida gardens
in the parqueted dining room this small house  remarkable for its extreme cleanliness  suggesting that of a monastery   prince andrew  who was rather late  found the friendly gathering of speranski's intimate acquaintances already assembled at five o'clock
there were no ladies present except speranski's little daughter  long faced like her father  and her governess
the other guests were gervais  magnitski  and stolypin
while still in the anteroom prince andrew heard loud voices and a ringing staccato laugh  a laugh such as one hears on the stage
someone it sounded like speranski  was distinctly ejaculating ha ha ha
prince andrew had never before heard speranski's famous laugh  and this ringing  high pitched laughter from a statesman made a strange impression on him
he entered the dining room
the whole company were standing between two windows at a small table laid with hors d'oeuvres
speranski  wearing a gray swallow tail coat with a star on the breast  and evidently still the same waistcoat and high white stock he had worn at the meeting of the council of state  stood at the table with a beaming countenance
his guests surrounded him
magnitski  addressing himself to speranski  was relating an anecdote  and speranski was laughing in advance at what magnitski was going to say when prince andrew entered the room magnitski's words were again crowned by laughter
stolypin gave a deep bass guffaw as he munched a piece of bread and cheese
gervais laughed softly with a hissing chuckle  and speranski in a high pitched staccato manner
still laughing  speranski held out his soft white hand to prince andrew
 very pleased to see you  prince   he said
 one moment     he went on  turning to magnitski and interrupting his story
 we have agreed that this is a dinner for recreation  with not a word about business   and turning again to the narrator he began to laugh afresh
prince andrew looked at the laughing speranski with astonishment  regret  and disillusionment
it seemed to him that this was not speranski but someone else
everything that had formerly appeared mysterious and fascinating in speranski suddenly became plain and unattractive
at dinner the conversation did not cease for a moment and seemed to consist his story someone else was anxious to relate something still funnier
most of the anecdotes  if not relating to the state service  related to people in the service
it seemed that in this company the insignificance of those people was so definitely accepted that the only possible attitude toward them was one of good humored ridicule
speranski related how at the council that morning a deaf dignitary  when asked his opinion  replied that he thought so too
gervais gave a long account of an official revision  remarkable for the stupidity of everybody concerned
stolypin  stuttering  broke into the conversation and began excitedly talking of the abuses that existed under the former order of things threatening to give a serious turn to the conversation
magnitski starting quizzing stolypin about his vehemence
gervais intervened with a joke  and the talk reverted to its former lively tone
evidently speranski liked to rest after his labors and find amusement in a circle of friends  and his guests  understanding his wish  tried to enliven him and amuse themselves but their gaiety seemed to prince andrew mirthless and tiresome
speranski's high pitched voice struck him unpleasantly  and the incessant laughter grated on him like a false note
prince andrew did not laugh and feared that he would be a damper on the spirits of the company  but no one took any notice of his being out of harmony with the general mood
they all seemed very gay
he tried several times to join in the conversation  but his remarks were tossed aside each time like a cork thrown out of the water  and he could not jest with them
there was nothing wrong or unseemly in what they said  it was witty and might have been funny  but it lacked just that something which is the salt of mirth  and they were not even aware that such a thing existed
after dinner speranski's daughter and her governess rose
he patted the little girl with his white hand and kissed her
and that gesture  too  seemed unnatural to prince andrew
the men remained at table over their port english fashion
in the midst of a conversation that was started about napoleon's spanish affairs  which they all agreed in approving  prince andrew began to express a contrary opinion
speranski smiled and  with an evident wish to prevent the conversation from taking an unpleasant course  told a story that had no connection with the previous conversation
for a few moments all were silent
having sat some time at table  speranski corked a bottle of wine and  remarking   nowadays good wine rides in a carriage and pair   passed it to the servant and got up
all rose and continuing to talk loudly went into the drawing room
two letters brought by a courier were handed to speranski and he took them to his study
as soon as he had left the room the general merriment stopped and the guests began to converse sensibly and quietly with one another
 now for the recitation   said speranski on returning from his study
 a wonderful talent   he said to prince andrew  and magnitski immediately assumed a pose and began reciting some humorous verses in french which he had composed about various well known petersburg people
he was interrupted several times by applause
when the verses were finished prince andrew went up to speranski and took his leave
 where are you off to so early   asked speranski
 i promised to go to a reception   they said no more
prince andrew looked closely into those mirrorlike  impenetrable eyes  and felt that it had been ridiculous of him to have expected anything from speranski and from any of his own activities connected with him  or ever to have attributed importance to what speranski was doing
that precise  mirthless laughter rang in prince andrew's ears long after he had left the house
when he reached home prince andrew began thinking of his life in petersburg during those last four months as if it were something new
he recalled his exertions and solicitations  and the history of his project of army reform  which had been accepted for consideration and which they were trying to pass over in silence simply because another  a very poor one  had already been prepared and submitted to the emperor
he thought of the meetings of a committee of which berg was a member
he remembered how carefully and at what length everything relating to form and procedure was discussed at those meetings  and how sedulously and promptly all that related to the gist of the business was evaded
he recalled his labors on the legal code  and how painstakingly he had translated the articles of the roman and french codes into russian  and he felt ashamed of himself then he vividly pictured to himself bogucharovo  his occupations in the country  his journey to ryazan  he remembered the peasants and dron the village elder  and mentally applying to them the personal rights he had divided into paragraphs  he felt astonished that he could have spent so much time on such useless work next day prince andrew called at a few houses he had not visited before  and among them at the rostovs' with whom he had renewed acquaintance at the ball
apart from considerations of politeness which demanded the call  he wanted to see that original  eager girl who had left such a pleasant impression on his mind  in her own home
natasha was one of the first to meet him
she was wearing a dark blue house dress in which prince andrew thought her even prettier than in her ball dress
she and all the rostov family welcomed him as an old friend  simply and cordially
the whole family  whom he had formerly judged severely  now seemed to him to consist of excellent  simple  and kindly people
the old count's hospitality and good nature  which struck one especially in petersburg as a pleasant surprise  were such that prince andrew could not refuse to stay to dinner
 yes   he thought   they are capital people  who of course have not the slightest idea what a treasure they possess in natasha  but they are kindly folk and form the best possible setting for this strikingly poetic  charming girl  overflowing with life   in natasha prince andrew was conscious of a strange world completely alien to him and brimful of joys unknown to him  a different world  that in the otradnoe avenue and at the window that moonlight night had already begun to disconcert him
now this world disconcerted him no longer and was no longer alien to him  but he himself having entered it found in it a new enjoyment after dinner natasha  at prince andrew's request  went to the clavichord and began singing
prince andrew stood by a window talking to the ladies and listened to her
in the midst of a phrase he ceased speaking and suddenly felt tears choking him  a thing he had thought impossible for him
he looked at natasha as she sang  and something new and joyful stirred in his soul
he felt happy and at the same time sad
he had absolutely nothing to weep about yet he was ready to weep
what about  his former love  the little princess  his disillusionments   
his hopes for the future   
yes and no
the chief reason was a sudden  vivid sense of the terrible contrast between something infinitely great and illimitable within him and that limited and material something that he  and even she  was
this contrast weighed on and yet cheered him while she sang
as soon as natasha had finished she went up to him and asked how he liked her voice
she asked this and then became confused  feeling that she ought not to have asked it
he smiled  looking at her  and said he liked her singing as he liked everything she did
prince andrew left the rostovs' late in the evening
he went to bed from habit  but soon realized that he could not sleep
having lit his candle he sat up in bed  then got up  then lay down again not at all troubled by his sleeplessness  his soul was as fresh and joyful as if he had stepped out of a stuffy room into god's own fresh air
it did not enter his head that he was in love with natasha  he was not thinking about her  but only picturing her to himself  and in consequence all life appeared in a new light  why do i strive  why do i toil in this narrow  confined frame  when life  all life with all its joys  is open to me   said he to himself and for the first time for a very long while he began making happy plans for the future
he decided that he must attend to his son's education by finding a tutor and putting the boy in his charge  then he ought to retire from the service and go abroad  and see england  switzerland and italy
 i must use my freedom while i feel so much strength and youth in me   he said to himself  pierre was right when he said one must believe in the possibility of happiness in order to be happy  and now i do believe in it
let the dead bury their dead  but while one has life one must live and be happy   thought he
one morning colonel berg  whom pierre knew as he knew everybody in moscow and petersburg  came to see him
berg arrived in an immaculate brand new uniform  with his hair pomaded and brushed forward over his temples as the emperor alexander wore his hair
 i have just been to see the countess  your wife
unfortunately she could not grant my request  but i hope  count  i shall be more fortunate with you   he said with a smile
 what is it you wish  colonel  i am at your service    i have now quite settled in my new rooms  count   berg said this with perfect conviction that this information could not but be agreeable    and so i wish to arrange just a small party for my own and my wife's friends    he smiled still more pleasantly    i wished to ask the countess and you to do me the honor of coming to tea and to supper   only countess helene  considering the society of such people as the bergs beneath her  could be cruel enough to refuse such an invitation berg explained so clearly why he wanted to collect at his house a small but select company  and why this would give him pleasure  and why though he grudged spending money on cards or anything harmful  he was prepared to run into some expense for the sake of good society that pierre could not refuse  and promised to come
 but don't be late  count  if i may venture to ask  about ten minutes to eight  please
we shall make up a rubber
our general is coming
he is very good to me
we shall have supper  count
so you will do me the favor   contrary to his habit of being late  pierre on that day arrived at the bergs' house  not at ten but at fifteen minutes to eight
having prepared everything necessary for the party  the bergs were ready for their guests' arrival
in their new  clean  and light study with its small busts and pictures and new furniture sat berg and his wife
berg  closely buttoned up in his new uniform  sat beside his wife explaining to her that one always could and should be acquainted with people above one  because only then does one get satisfaction from acquaintances
 you can get to know something  you can ask for something
see how i managed from my first promotion    berg measured his life not by years but by promotions    my comrades are still nobodies  while i am only waiting for a vacancy to command a regiment  and have the happiness to be your husband    he rose and kissed vera's hand  and on the way to her straightened out a turned up corner of the carpet    and how have i obtained all this  chiefly by knowing how to choose my aquaintances it goes without saying that one must be conscientious and methodical   berg smiled with a sense of his superiority over a weak woman  and paused  reflecting that this dear wife of his was after all but a weak woman who could not understand all that constitutes a man's dignity  what it was ein mann zu sein
* vera at the same time smiling with a sense of superiority over her good  conscientious husband  who all the same understood life wrongly  as according to vera all men did
berg  judging by his wife  thought all women weak and foolish
vera  judging only by her husband and generalizing from that observation  supposed that all men  though they understand nothing and are conceited and selfish  ascribe common sense to themselves alone * to be a man
berg rose and embraced his wife carefully  so as not to crush her lace fichu for which he had paid a good price  kissing her straight on the lips
 the only thing is  we mustn't have children too soon   he continued  following an unconscious sequence of ideas
 yes   answered vera   i don't at all want that
we must live for society    princess yusupova wore one exactly like this   said berg  pointing to the fichu with a happy and kindly smile
just then count bezukhov was announced
husband and wife glanced at one another  both smiling with self satisfaction  and each mentally claiming the honor of this visit
 this is what comes of knowing how to make acquaintances   thought berg
 this is what comes of knowing how to conduct oneself    but please don't interrupt me when i am entertaining the guests   said vera   because i know what interests each of them and what to say to different people   berg smiled again
 it can't be helped  men must sometimes have masculine conversation   said he
they received pierre in their small  new drawing room  where it was impossible to sit down anywhere without disturbing its symmetry  neatness  and order  so it was quite comprehensible and not strange that berg  having generously offered to disturb the symmetry of an armchair or of the sofa for his dear guest  but being apparently painfully undecided on the matter himself  eventually left the visitor to settle the question of selection pierre disturbed the symmetry by moving a chair for himself  and berg and vera immediately began their evening party  interrupting each other in their efforts to entertain their guest vera  having decided in her own mind that pierre ought to be entertained with conversation about the french embassy  at once began accordingly
berg  having decided that masculine conversation was required  interrupted his wife's remarks and touched on the question of the war with austria  and unconsciously jumped from the general subject to personal considerations as to the proposals made him to take part in the austrian campaign and the reasons why he had declined them
though the conversation was very incoherent and vera was angry at the intrusion of the masculine element  both husband and wife felt with satisfaction that  even if only one guest was present  their evening had begun very well and was as like as two peas to every other evening party with its talk  tea  and lighted candles
before long boris  berg's old comrade  arrived there was a shade of condescension and patronage in his treatment of berg and vera
after boris came a lady with the colonel  then the general himself  then the rostovs  and the party became unquestionably exactly like all other evening parties berg and vera could not repress their smiles of satisfaction at the sight of all this movement in their drawing room  at the sound of the disconnected talk  the rustling of dresses  and the bowing and scraping
everything was just as everybody always has it  especially so the general  who admired the apartment  patted berg on the shoulder  and with parental authority superintended the setting out of the table for boston
the general sat down by count ilya rostov  who was next to himself the most important guest the old people sat with the old  the young with the young  and the hostess at the tea table  on which stood exactly the same kind of cakes in a silver cake basket as the panins had at their party
everything was just as it was everywhere else
pierre  as one of the principal guests  had to sit down to boston with count rostov  the general  and the colonel
at the card table he happened to be directly facing natasha  and was struck by a curious change that had come over her since the ball
she was silent  and not only less pretty than at the ball  but only redeemed from plainness by her look of gentle indifference to everything around
 what's the matter with her   thought pierre  glancing at her
she was sitting by her sister at the tea table  and reluctantly  without looking at him  made some reply to boris who sat down beside her
after playing out a whole suit and to his partner's delight taking five tricks  pierre  hearing greetings and the steps of someone who had entered the room while he was picking up his tricks  glanced again at natasha
 what has happened to her   he asked himself with still greater surprise prince andrew was standing before her  saying something to her with a look of tender solicitude
she  having raised her head  was looking up at him  flushed and evidently trying to master her rapid breathing
and the bright glow of some inner fire that had been suppressed was again alight in her
she was completely transformed and from a plain girl had again become what she had been at the ball
prince andrew went up to pierre  and the latter noticed a new and youthful expression in his friend's face
pierre changed places several times during the game  sitting now with his back to natasha and now facing her  but during the whole of the six rubbers he watched her and his friend
 something very important is happening between them   thought pierre  and a feeling that was both joyful and painful agitated him and made him neglect the game
after six rubbers the general got up  saying that it was no use playing like that  and pierre was released
natasha on one side was talking with sonya and boris  and vera with a subtle smile was saying something to prince andrew
pierre went up to his friend and  asking whether they were talking secrets  sat down beside them
vera  having noticed prince andrew's attentions to natasha  decided that at a party  a real evening party  subtle allusions to the tender passion were absolutely necessary and  seizing a moment when prince andrew was alone  began a conversation with him about feelings in general and about her sister
with so intellectual a guest as she considered prince andrew to be  she felt that she had to employ her diplomatic tact
when pierre went up to them he noticed that vera was being carried away by her self satisfied talk  but that prince andrew seemed embarrassed  a thing that rarely happened with him
 what do you think   vera was saying with an arch smile
 you are so discerning  prince  and understand people's characters so well at a glance
what do you think of natalie  could she be constant in her attachments  could she  like other women   vera meant herself    love a man once for all and remain true to him forever  that is what i consider true love
what do you think  prince    i know your sister too little   replied prince andrew  with a sarcastic smile under which he wished to hide his embarrassment   to be able to solve so delicate a question  and then i have noticed that the less attractive a woman is the more constant she is likely to be   he added  and looked up at pierre who was just approaching them
 yes  that is true  prince
in our days   continued vera mentioning  our days  as people of limited intelligence are fond of doing  imagining that they have discovered and appraised the peculiarities of  our days  and that human characteristics change with the times  in our days a girl has so much freedom that the pleasure of being courted often stifles real feeling in her
and it must be confessed that natalie is very susceptible   this return to the subject of natalie caused prince andrew to knit his brows with discomfort  he was about to rise  but vera continued with a still more subtle smile   i think no one has been more courted than she   she went on   but till quite lately she never cared seriously for anyone
now you know  count   she said to pierre   even our dear cousin boris  who  between ourselves  was very far gone in the land of tenderness      alluding to a map of love much in vogue at that time 
prince andrew frowned and remained silent
 you are friendly with boris  aren't you   asked vera
 yes  i know him      i expect he has told you of his childish love for natasha    oh  there was childish love   suddenly asked prince andrew  blushing unexpectedly
 yes  you know between cousins intimacy often leads to love
le cousinage est un dangereux voisinage
* don't you think so   *  cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood    oh  undoubtedly   said prince andrew  and with sudden and unnatural liveliness he began chaffing pierre about the need to be very careful with his fifty year old moscow cousins  and in the midst of these jesting remarks he rose  taking pierre by the arm  and drew him aside
 well   asked pierre  seeing his friend's strange animation with surprise  and noticing the glance he turned on natasha as he rose
 i must  
i must have a talk with you   said prince andrew
 you know that pair of women's gloves    he referred to the masonic gloves given to a newly initiated brother to present to the woman he loved    i  
but no  i will talk to you later on   and with a strange light in his eyes and restlessness in his movements  prince andrew approached natasha and sat down beside her
pierre saw how prince andrew asked her something and how she flushed as she replied
but at that moment berg came to pierre and began insisting that he should take part in an argument between the general and the colonel on the affairs in spain
berg was satisfied and happy
the smile of pleasure never left his face
the party was very successful and quite like other parties he had seen
everything was similar  the ladies' subtle talk  the cards  the general raising his voice at the card table  and the samovar and the tea cakes  only one thing was lacking that he had always seen at the evening parties he wished to imitate
they had not yet had a loud conversation among the men and a dispute about something important and clever
now the general had begun such a discussion and so berg drew pierre to it
next day  having been invited by the count  prince andrew dined with the rostovs and spent the rest of the day there
everyone in the house realized for whose sake prince andrew came  and without concealing it he tried to be with natasha all day
not only in the soul of the frightened yet happy and enraptured natasha  but in the whole house  there was a feeling of awe at something important that was bound to happen
the countess looked with sad and sternly serious eyes at prince andrew when he talked to natasha and timidly started some artificial conversation about trifles as soon as he looked her way
sonya was afraid to leave natasha and afraid of being in the way when she was with them
natasha grew pale  in a panic of expectation  when she remained alone with him for a moment
prince andrew surprised her by his timidity
she felt that he wanted to say something to her but could not bring himself to do so in the evening  when prince andrew had left  the countess went up to natasha and whispered   well  what    mamma  for heaven's sake don't ask me anything now  one can't talk about that   said natasha
but all the same that night natasha  now agitated and now frightened  lay a long time in her mother's bed gazing straight before her
she told her how he had complimented her  how he told her he was going abroad  asked her where they were going to spend the summer  and then how he had asked her about boris
 but such a  
such a  
never happened to me before   she said
 only i feel afraid in his presence
i am always afraid when i'm with him
what does that mean  does it mean that it's the real thing  yes  mamma  are you asleep    no  my love  i am frightened myself   answered her mother
 now go    all the same i shan't sleep
what silliness  to sleep  mummy  mummy  such a thing never happened to me before   she said  surprised and alarmed at the feeling she was aware of in herself
 and could we ever have thought      it seemed to natasha that even at the time she first saw prince andrew at otradnoe she had fallen in love with him
it was as if she feared this strange  unexpected happiness of meeting again the very man she had then chosen  she was firmly convinced she had done so  and of finding him  as it seemed  not indifferent to her
 and it had to happen that he should come specially to petersburg while we are here
and it had to happen that we should meet at that ball
it is fate
clearly it is fate that everything led up to this  already then  directly i saw him i felt something peculiar    what else did he say to you  what are those verses  read them     said her mother  thoughtfully  referring to some verses prince andrew had written in natasha's album
 mamma  one need not be ashamed of his being a widower    don't  natasha  pray to god
'marriages are made in heaven '  said her mother
 darling mummy  how i love you  how happy i am   cried natasha  shedding tears of joy and excitement and embracing her mother
at that very time prince andrew was sitting with pierre and telling him of his love for natasha and his firm resolve to make her his wife
that day countess helene had a reception at her house
the french ambassador was there  and a foreign prince of the blood who had of late become a frequent visitor of hers  and many brilliant ladies and gentlemen
pierre  who had come downstairs  walked through the rooms and struck everyone by his preoccupied  absent minded  and morose air since the ball he had felt the approach of a fit of nervous depression and had made desperate efforts to combat it
since the intimacy of his wife with the royal prince  pierre had unexpectedly been made a gentleman of the bedchamber  and from that time he had begun to feel oppressed and ashamed in court society  and dark thoughts of the vanity of all things human came to him oftener than before
at the same time the feeling he had noticed between his protegee natasha and prince andrew accentuated his gloom by the contrast between his own position and his friend's
he tried equally to avoid thinking about his wife  and about natasha and prince andrew  and again everything seemed to him insignificant in comparison with eternity  again the question  for what  presented itself  and he forced himself to work day and night at masonic labors  hoping to drive away the evil spirit that threatened him toward midnight  after he had left the countess' apartments  he was sitting upstairs in a shabby dressing gown  copying out the original transaction of the scottish lodge of freemasons at a table in his low room cloudy with tobacco smoke  when someone came in
it was prince andrew
 ah  it's you   said pierre with a preoccupied  dissatisfied air
 and i  you see  from the ills of life with which unhappy people look at their work
prince andrew  with a beaming  ecstatic expression of renewed life on his face  paused in front of pierre and  not noticing his sad look  smiled at him with the egotism of joy
 well  dear heart   said he   i wanted to tell you about it yesterday and i have come to do so today
i never experienced anything like it before
i am in love  my friend   suddenly pierre heaved a deep sigh and dumped his heavy person down on the sofa beside prince andrew
 with natasha rostova  yes   said he
 yes  yes  who else should it be  i should never have believed it  but the feeling is stronger than i
yesterday i tormented myself and suffered  but i would not exchange even that torment for anything in the world  i have not lived till now
at last i live  but i can't live without her  but can she love me   
i am too old for her   
why don't you speak    i  i  what did i tell you   said pierre suddenly  rising and beginning to pace up and down the room
 i always thought it   
that girl is such a treasure  
she is a rare girl   
my dear friend  i entreat you  don't philosophize  don't doubt  marry  marry  marry   
and i am sure there will not be a happier man than you    but what of her    she loves you    don't talk rubbish     said prince andrew  smiling and looking into pierre's eyes
 she does  i know   pierre cried fiercely
 but do listen   returned prince andrew  holding him by the arm
 do you know the condition i am in  i must talk about it to someone    well  go on  go on
i am very glad   said pierre  and his face really changed  his brow became smooth  and he listened gladly to prince andrew
prince andrew seemed  and really was  quite a different  quite a new man
where was his spleen  his contempt for life  his disillusionment  pierre was the only person to whom he made up his mind to speak openly  and to him he told all that was in his soul
now he boldly and lightly made plans for an extended future  said he could not sacrifice his own happiness to his father's caprice  and spoke of how he would either make his father consent to this marriage and love her  or would do without his consent  then he marveled at the feeling that had mastered him as at something strange  apart from and independent of himself  i should not have believed anyone who told me that i was capable of such love   said prince andrew
 it is not at all the same feeling that i knew in the past
the whole world is now for me divided into two halves  one half is she  and there all is joy  hope  light  the other half is everything where she is not  and there is all gloom and darkness       darkness and gloom   reiterated pierre   yes  yes  i understand that    i cannot help loving the light  it is not my fault
and i am very happy  you understand me  i know you are glad for my sake    yes  yes   pierre assented  looking at his friend with a touched and sad expression in his eyes
the brighter prince andrew's lot appeared to him  the gloomier seemed his own
prince andrew needed his father's consent to his marriage  and to obtain this he started for the country next day
his father received his son's communication with external composure  but inward wrath
he could not comprehend how anyone could wish to alter his life or introduce anything new into it  when his own life was already ending
 if only they would let me end my days as i want to   thought the old man   then they might do as they please   with his son  however  he employed the diplomacy he reserved for important occasions and  adopting a quiet tone  discussed the whole matter
in the first place the marriage was not a brilliant one as regards birth  wealth  or rank
secondly  prince andrew was no longer as young as he had been and his health was poor  the old man laid special stress on this   while she was very young
thirdly  he had a son whom it would be a pity to entrust to a chit of a girl
 fourthly and finally   the father said  looking ironically at his son   i beg you to put it off for a year  go abroad  take a cure  look out as you wanted to for a german tutor for prince nicholas
then if your love or passion or obstinacy as you please is still as great  marry  and that's my last word on it
mind  the last     concluded the prince  in a tone which showed that nothing would make him alter his decision
prince andrew saw clearly that the old man hoped that his feelings  or his fiancee's  would not stand a year's test  or that he  the old prince himself  would die before then  and he decided to conform to his father's wish to propose  and postpone the wedding for a year three weeks after the last evening he had spent with the rostovs  prince andrew returned to petersburg
next day after her talk with her mother natasha expected bolkonski all day  but he did not come
on the second and third day it was the same
pierre did not come either and natasha  not knowing that prince andrew had gone to see his father  could not explain his absence to herself
three weeks passed in this way
natasha had no desire to go out anywhere and wandered from room to room like a shadow  idle and listless  she wept secretly at night and did not go to her mother in the evenings
she blushed continually and was irritable
it seemed to her that everybody knew about her disappointment and was laughing at her and pitying her
strong as was her inward grief  this wound to her vanity intensified her misery
once she came to her mother  tried to say something  and suddenly began to cry
her tears were those of an offended child who does not know why it is being punished
the countess began to soothe natasha  who after first listening to her mother's words  suddenly interrupted her   leave off  mamma  i don't think  and don't want to think about it  he just came and then left off  left off     her voice trembled  and she again nearly cried  but recovered and went on quietly   and i don't at all want to get married
and i am afraid of him  i have now become quite calm  quite calm   the day after this conversation natasha put on the old dress which she knew had the peculiar property of conducing to cheerfulness in the mornings  and that day she returned to the old way of life which she had abandoned since the ball
having finished her morning tea she went to the ballroom  which she particularly liked for its loud resonance  and began singing her solfeggio
when she had finished her first exercise she stood still in the middle of the room and sang a musical phrase that particularly pleased her
she listened joyfully  as though she had not expected it  to the charm of the notes reverberating  filling the whole empty ballroom  and slowly dying away  and all at once she felt cheerful
 what's the good of making so much of it  things are nice as it is   she said to herself  and she began walking up and down the room  not stepping simply on the resounding parquet but treading with each step from the heel to the toe  she had on a new and favorite pair of shoes  and listening to the regular tap of the heel and creak of the toe as gladly as she had to the sounds of her own voice
passing a mirror she glanced into it
 there  that's me   the expression of her face seemed to say as she caught sight of herself
 well  and very nice too  i need nobody   a footman wanted to come in to clear away something in the room but she would not let him  and having closed the door behind him continued her walk
that morning she had returned to her favorite mood love of  and delight in  herself
 how charming that natasha is   she said again  speaking as some third  collective  male person
 pretty  a good voice  young  and in nobody's way if only they leave her in peace   but however much they left her in peace she could not now be at peace  and immediately felt this
in the hall the porch door opened  and someone asked   at home   and then footsteps were heard
natasha was looking at the mirror  but did not see herself
she listened to the sounds in the hall
when she saw herself  her face was pale
it was he
she knew this for certain  though she hardly heard his voice through the closed doors
pale and agitated  natasha ran into the drawing room
 mamma  bolkonski has come   she said
 mamma  it is awful  it is unbearable  i don't want  
to be tormented  what am i to do      before the countess could answer  prince andrew entered the room with an agitated and serious face
as soon as he saw natasha his face brightened
he kissed the countess' hand and natasha's  and sat down beside the sofa
 it is long since we had the pleasure     began the countess  but prince andrew interrupted her by answering her intended question  obviously in haste to say what he had to
 i have not been to see you all this time because i have been at my father's
i had to talk over a very important matter with him
i only got back last night   he said glancing at natasha   i want to have a talk with you  countess   he added after a moment's pause
the countess lowered her eyes  sighing deeply
 i am at your disposal   she murmured
natasha knew that she ought to go away  but was unable to do so  something gripped her throat  and regardless of manners she stared straight at prince andrew with wide open eyes
 at once  this instant   
no  it can't be   she thought
again he glanced at her  and that glance convinced her that she was not mistaken
yes  at once  that very instant  her fate would be decided
 go  natasha  i will call you   said the countess in a whisper
natasha glanced with frightened imploring eyes at prince andrew and at her mother and went out
 i have come  countess  to ask for your daughter's hand   said prince andrew
the countess' face flushed hotly  but she said nothing
 your offer     she began at last sedately
he remained silent  looking into her eyes
 your offer      she grew confused   is agreeable to us  and i accept your offer
i am glad
and my husband  
i hope  
but it will depend on her       i will speak to her when i have your consent   
do you give it to me   said prince andrew
 yes   replied the countess
she held out her hand to him  and with a mixed feeling of estrangement and tenderness pressed her lips to his forehead as he stooped to kiss her hand
she wished to love him as a son  but felt that to her he was a stranger and a terrifying man
 i am sure my husband will consent   said the countess   but your father      my father  to whom i have told my plans  has made it an express condition of his consent that the wedding is not to take place for a year
and i wished to tell you of that   said prince andrew
 it is true that natasha is still young  but so long as that       it is unavoidable   said prince andrew with a sigh
 i will send her to you   said the countess  and left the room
 lord have mercy upon us   she repeated while seeking her daughter
sonya said that natasha was in her bedroom
natasha was sitting on the bed  pale and dry eyed  and was gazing at the icons and whispering something as she rapidly crossed herself
seeing her mother she jumped up and flew to her
 well  mamma   
well       go  go to him
he is asking for your hand   said the countess  coldly it seemed to natasha
 go  
go   said the mother  sadly and reproachfully  with a deep sigh  as her daughter ran away
natasha never remembered how she entered the drawing room
when she came in and saw him she paused
 is it possible that this stranger has now become everything to me   she asked herself  and immediately answered   yes  everything  he alone is now dearer to me than everything in the world   prince andrew came up to her with downcast eyes
 i have loved you from the very first moment i saw you
may i hope   he looked at her and was struck by the serious impassioned expression of her face
her face said   why ask  why doubt what you cannot but know  why speak  when words cannot express what one feels   she drew near to him and stopped
he took her hand and kissed it
 do you love me    yes  yes   natasha murmured as if in vexation
then she sighed loudly and  catching her breath more and more quickly  began to sob
 what is it  what's the matter    oh  i am so happy   she replied  smiled through her tears  bent over closer to him  paused for an instant as if asking herself whether she might  and then kissed him
prince andrew held her hands  looked into her eyes  and did not find in his heart his former love for her
something in him had suddenly changed  there was no longer the former poetic and mystic charm of desire  but there was pity for her feminine and childish weakness  fear at her devotion and trustfulness  and an oppressive yet joyful sense of the duty that now bound him to her forever
the present feeling  though not so bright and poetic as the former  was stronger and more serious
 did your mother tell you that it cannot be for a year   asked prince andrew  still looking into her eyes
 is it possible that i the 'chit of a girl ' as everybody called me   thought natasha  is it possible that i am now to be the wife and the equal of this strange  dear  clever man whom even my father looks up to  can it be true  can it be true that there can be no more playing with life  that now i am grown up  that on me now lies a responsibility for my every word and deed  yes  but what did he ask me    no   she replied  but she had not understood his question
 forgive me   he said
 but you are so young  and i have already been through so much in life
i am afraid for you  you do not yet know yourself   natasha listened with concentrated attention  trying but failing to take in the meaning of his words
 hard as this year which delays my happiness will be   continued prince andrew   it will give you time to be sure of yourself
i ask you to make me happy in a year  but you are free  our engagement shall remain a secret  and should you find that you do not love me  or should you come to love     said prince andrew with an unnatural smile
 why do you say that   natasha interrupted him
 you know that from the very day you first came to otradnoe i have loved you   she cried  quite convinced that she spoke the truth
 in a year you will learn to know yourself       a whole year   natasha repeated suddenly  only now realizing that the marriage was to be postponed for a year
 but why a year  why a year      prince andrew began to explain to her the reasons for this delay
natasha did not hear him
 and can't it be helped   she asked
prince andrew did not reply  but his face expressed the impossibility of altering that decision
 it's awful  oh  it's awful  awful   natasha suddenly cried  and again burst into sobs
 i shall die  waiting a year  it's impossible  it's awful   she looked into her lover's face and saw in it a look of commiseration and perplexity
 no  no  i'll do anything   she said  suddenly checking her tears
 i am so happy   the father and mother came into the room and gave the betrothed couple their blessing
from that day prince andrew began to frequent the rostovs' as natasha's affianced lover
no betrothal ceremony took place and natasha's engagement to bolkonski was not announced  prince andrew insisted on that
he said that as he was responsible for the delay he ought to bear the whole burden of it  that he had given his word and bound himself forever  but that he did not wish to bind natasha and gave her perfect freedom if after six months she felt that she did not love him she would have full right to reject him
naturally neither natasha nor her parents wished to hear of this  but prince andrew was firm
he came every day to the rostovs'  but did not behave to natasha as an affianced lover  he did not use the familiar thou  but said you to her  and kissed only her hand
after their engagement  quite different  intimate  and natural relations sprang up between them
it was as if they had not known each other till now
both liked to recall how they had regarded each other when as yet they were nothing to one another  they felt themselves now quite different beings  then they were artificial  now natural and sincere at first the family felt some constraint in intercourse with prince andrew  he seemed a man from another world  and for a long time natasha trained the family to get used to him  proudly assuring them all that he only appeared to be different  but was really just like all of them  and that she was not afraid of him and no one else ought to be
after a few days they grew accustomed to him  and without restraint in his presence pursued their usual way of life  in which he took his part
he could talk about rural economy with the count  fashions with the countess and natasha  and about albums and fancywork with sonya sometimes the household both among themselves and in his presence expressed their wonder at how it had all happened  and at the evident omens there had been of it  prince andrew's coming to otradnoe and their coming to petersburg  and the likeness between natasha and prince andrew which her nurse had noticed on his first visit  and andrew's encounter with nicholas in 1805  and many other incidents betokening that it had to be in the house that poetic dullness and quiet reigned which always accompanies the presence of a betrothed couple
often when all sitting together everyone kept silent
sometimes the others would get up and go away and the couple  left alone  still remained silent
they rarely spoke of their future life
prince andrew was afraid and ashamed to speak of it
natasha shared this as she did all his feelings  which she constantly divined
once she began questioning him about his son
prince andrew blushed  as he often did now natasha particularly liked it in him and said that his son would not live with them
 why not   asked natasha in a frightened tone
 i cannot take him away from his grandfather  and besides      how i should have loved him   said natasha  immediately guessing his thought   but i know you wish to avoid any pretext for finding fault with us   sometimes the old count would come up  kiss prince andrew  and ask his advice about petya's education or nicholas' service
the old countess sighed as she looked at them  sonya was always getting frightened lest she should be in the way and tried to find excuses for leaving them alone  even when they did not wish it
when prince andrew spoke  he could tell a story very well   natasha listened to him with pride  when she spoke she noticed with fear and joy that he gazed attentively and scrutinizingly at her
she asked herself in perplexity   what does he look for in me  he is trying to discover something by looking at me  what if what he seeks in me is not there   sometimes she fell into one of the mad  merry moods characteristic of her  and then she particularly loved to hear and see how prince andrew laughed
he seldom laughed  but when he did he abandoned himself entirely to his laughter  and after such a laugh she always felt nearer to him natasha would have been completely happy if the thought of the separation awaiting her and drawing near had not terrified her  just as the mere thought of it made him turn pale and cold
on the eve of his departure from petersburg prince andrew brought with him pierre  who had not been to the rostovs' once since the ball
pierre seemed disconcerted and embarrassed
he was talking to the countess  and natasha sat down beside a little chess table with sonya  thereby inviting prince andrew to come too
he did so
 you have known bezukhov a long time   he asked
 do you like him    yes  he's a dear  but very absurd   and as usual when speaking of pierre  she began to tell anecdotes of his absent mindedness  some of which had even been invented about him
 do you know i have entrusted him with our secret  i have known him from childhood
he has a heart of gold
i beg you  natalie   prince andrew said with sudden seriousness  i am going away and heaven knows what may happen
you may cease to  
all right  i know i am not to say that
only this  then  whatever may happen to you when i am not here      what can happen    whatever trouble may come   prince andrew continued   i beg you  mademoiselle sophie  whatever may happen  to turn to him alone for advice and help  he is a most absent minded and absurd fellow  but he has a heart of gold   neither her father  nor her mother  nor sonya  nor prince andrew himself could have foreseen how the separation from her lover would act on natasha flushed and agitated she went about the house all that day  dry eyed  occupied with most trivial matters as if not understanding what awaited her
she did not even cry when  on taking leave  he kissed her hand for the last time
 don't go   she said in a tone that made him wonder whether he really ought not to stay and which he remembered long afterwards
nor did she cry when he was gone  but for several days she sat in her room dry eyed  taking no interest in anything and only saying now and then   oh  why did he go away   but a fortnight after his departure  to the surprise of those around her  she recovered from her mental sickness just as suddenly and became her old self again  but with a change in her moral physiognomy  as a child gets up after a long illness with a changed expression of face
during that year after his son's departure  prince nicholas bolkonski's health and temper became much worse
he grew still more irritable  and it was princess mary who generally bore the brunt of his frequent fits of unprovoked anger
he seemed carefully to seek out her tender spots so as to torture her mentally as harshly as possible
princess mary had two passions and consequently two joys her nephew  little nicholas  and religion and these were the favorite subjects of the prince's attacks and ridicule
whatever was spoken of he would bring round to the superstitiousness of old maids  or the petting and spoiling of children
 you want to make him  little nicholas   into an old maid like yourself  a pity  prince andrew wants a son and not an old maid   he would say
or  turning to mademoiselle bourienne  he would ask her in princess mary's presence how she liked our village priests and icons and would joke about them
he continually hurt princess mary's feelings and tormented her  but it cost her no effort to forgive him
could he be to blame toward her  or could her father  whom she knew loved her in spite of it all  be unjust  and what is justice  the princess never thought of that proud word  justice   all the complex laws of man centered for her in one clear and simple law the law of love and selfsacrifice taught us by him who lovingly suffered for mankind though he himself was god what had she to do with the justice or injustice of other people  she had to endure and love  and that she did
during the winter prince andrew had come to bald hills and had been gay  gentle  and more affectionate than princess mary had known him for a long time past
she felt that something had happened to him  but he said nothing to her about his love
before he left he had a long talk with his father about something  and princess mary noticed that before his departure they were dissatisfied with one another
soon after prince andrew had gone  princess mary wrote to her friend julie karagina in petersburg  whom she had dreamed  as all girls dream  of marrying to her brother  and who was at that time in mourning for her own brother  killed in turkey
sorrow  it seems  is our common lot  my dear  tender friend julie your loss is so terrible that i can only explain it to myself as a special providence of god who  loving you  wishes to try you and your excellent mother
oh  my friend  religion  and religion alone  can i will not say comfort us but save us from despair
religion alone can explain to us what without its help man cannot comprehend  why  for what cause  kind and noble beings able to find happiness in life not merely harming no one but necessary to the happiness of others are called away to god  while cruel  useless  harmful persons  or such as are a burden to themselves and to others  are left living the first death i saw  and one i shall never forget that of my dear sister in law left that impression on me
just as you ask destiny why your splendid brother had to die  so i asked why that angel lise  who not only never wronged anyone  but in whose soul there were never any unkind thoughts  had to die
and what do you think  dear friend  five years have passed since then  and already i  with my petty understanding  begin to see clearly why she had to die  and in what way that death was but an expression of the infinite goodness of the creator  whose every action  though generally incomprehensible to us  is but a manifestation of his infinite love for his creatures
perhaps  i often think  she was too angelically innocent to have the strength to perform all a mother's duties
as a young wife she was irreproachable  perhaps she could not have been so as a mother
as it is  not only has she left us  and particularly prince andrew  with the purest regrets and memories  but probably she will there receive a place i dare not hope for myself
but not to speak of her alone  that early and terrible death has had the most beneficent influence on me and on my brother in spite of all our grief
then  at the moment of our loss  these thoughts could not occur to me  i should then have dismissed them with horror  but now they are very clear and certain
i write all this to you  dear friend  only to convince you of the gospel truth which has become for me a principle of life  not a single hair of our heads will fall without his will
and his will is governed only by infinite love for us  and so whatever befalls us is for our good
you ask whether we shall spend next winter in moscow
in spite of my wish to see you  i do not think so and do not want to do so
you will be surprised to hear that the reason for this is buonaparte  the case is this  my father's health is growing noticeably worse  he cannot stand any contradiction and is becoming irritable
this irritability is  as you know  chiefly directed to political questions
he cannot endure the notion that buonaparte is negotiating on equal terms with all the sovereigns of europe and particularly with our own  the grandson of the great catherine  as you know  i am quite indifferent to politics  but from my father's remarks and his talks with michael ivanovich i know all that goes on in the world and especially about the honors conferred on buonaparte  who only at bald hills in the whole world  it seems  is not accepted as a great man  still less as emperor of france and my father cannot stand this
it seems to me that it is chiefly because of his political views that my father is reluctant to speak of going to moscow  for he foresees the encounters that would result from his way of expressing his views regardless of anybody all the benefit he might derive from a course of treatment he would lose as a result of the disputes about buonaparte which would be inevitable
in any case it will be decided very shortly
our family life goes on in the old way except for my brother andrew's absence
he  as i wrote you before  has changed very much of late
after his sorrow he only this year quite recovered his spirits
he has again become as i used to know him when a child  kind  affectionate  with that heart of gold to which i know no equal
he has realized  it seems to me  that life is not over for him but together with this mental change he has grown physically much weaker
he has become thinner and more nervous
i am anxious about him and glad he is taking this trip abroad which the doctors recommended long ago
i hope it will cure him
you write that in petersburg he is spoken of as one of the most active  cultivated  and capable of the young men
forgive my vanity as a relation  but i never doubted it
the good he has done to everybody here  from his peasants up to the gentry  is incalculable
on his arrival in petersburg he received only his due
i always wonder at the way rumors fly from petersburg to moscow  especially such false ones as that you write about i mean the report of my brother's betrothal to the little rostova
i do not think my brother will ever marry again  and certainly not her  and this is why  first  i know that though he rarely speaks about the wife he has lost  the grief of that loss has gone too deep in his heart for him ever to decide to give her a successor and our little angel a stepmother
secondly because  as far as i know  that girl is not the kind of girl who could please prince andrew
i do not think he would choose her for a wife  and frankly i do not wish it
but i am running on too long and am at the end of my second sheet
good bye  my dear friend
may god keep you in his holy and mighty care
my dear friend  mademoiselle bourienne  sends you kisses
mary in the middle of the summer princess mary received an unexpected letter from prince andrew in switzerland in which he gave her strange and surprising news
he informed her of his engagement to natasha rostova
the whole letter breathed loving rapture for his betrothed and tender and confiding affection for his sister
he wrote that he had never loved as he did now and that only now did he understand and know what life was
he asked his sister to forgive him for not having told her of his resolve when he had last visited bald hills  though he had spoken of it to his father
he had not done so for fear princess mary should ask her father to give his consent  irritating him and having to bear the brunt of his displeasure without attaining her object
 besides   he wrote   the matter was not then so definitely settled as it is now
my father then insisted on a delay of a year and now already six months  half of that period  have passed  and my resolution is firmer than ever
if the doctors did not keep me here at the spas i should be back in russia  but as it is i have to postpone my return for three months
you know me and my relations with father
i want nothing from him
i have been and always shall be independent  but to go against his will and arouse his anger  now that he may perhaps remain with us such a short time  would destroy half my happiness
i am now writing to him about the same question  and beg you to choose a good moment to hand him the letter and to let me know how he looks at the whole matter and whether there is hope that he may consent to reduce the term by four months   after long hesitations  doubts  and prayers  princess mary gave the letter to her father
the next day the old prince said to her quietly   write and tell your brother to wait till i am dead   
it won't be long i shall soon set him free   the princess was about to reply  but her father would not let her speak and  raising his voice more and more  cried   marry  marry  my boy   
a good family   
clever people  eh  rich  eh  yes  a nice stepmother little nicholas will have  write and tell him that he may marry tomorrow if he likes
she will be little nicholas' stepmother and i'll marry bourienne   
ha  ha  ha  he mustn't be without a stepmother either  only one thing  no more women are wanted in my house let him marry and live by himself perhaps you will go and live with him too   he added  turning to princess mary
 go in heaven's name  go out into the frost  
the frost  
the frost   after this outburst the prince did not speak any more about the matter
but repressed vexation at his son's poor spirited behavior found expression in his treatment of his daughter
to his former pretexts for irony a fresh one was now added allusions to stepmothers and amiabilities to mademoiselle bourienne
 why shouldn't i marry her   he asked his daughter
 she'll make a splendid princess   and latterly  to her surprise and bewilderment  princess mary noticed that her father was really associating more and more with the frenchwoman
she wrote to prince andrew about the reception of his letter  but comforted him with hopes of reconciling their father to the idea
little nicholas and his education  her brother andrew  and religion were princess mary's joys and consolations  but besides that  since everyone must have personal hopes  princess mary in the profoundest depths of her heart had a hidden dream and hope that supplied the chief consolation of her life
this comforting dream and hope were given her by god's folk the half witted and other pilgrims who visited her without the prince's knowledge the longer she lived  the more experience and observation she had of life  the greater was her wonder at the short sightedness of men who seek enjoyment and happiness here on earth  toiling  suffering  struggling  and harming one another  to obtain that impossible  visionary  sinful happiness
prince andrew had loved his wife  she died  but that was not enough  he wanted to bind his happiness to another woman
her father objected to this because he wanted a more distinguished and wealthier match for andrew
and they all struggled and suffered and tormented one another and injured their souls  their eternal souls  for the attainment of benefits which endure but for an instant
not only do we know this ourselves  but christ  the son of god  came down to earth and told us that this life is but for a moment and is a probation  yet we cling to it and think to find happiness in it
 how is it that no one realizes this   thought princess mary
 no one except these despised god's folk who  wallet on back  come to me by the back door  afraid of being seen by the prince  not for fear of illusage by him but for fear of causing him to sin
to leave family  home  and all the cares of worldly welfare  in order without clinging to anything to wander in hempen rags from place to place under an assumed name  doing no one any harm but praying for all for those who drive one away as well as for those who protect one  higher than that life and truth there is no life or truth   there was one pilgrim  a quiet pockmarked little woman of fifty called theodosia  who for over thirty years had gone about barefoot and worn heavy chains
princess mary was particularly fond of her
once  when in a room with a lamp dimly lit before the icon theodosia was talking of her life  the thought that theodosia alone had found the true path of life suddenly came to princess mary with such force that she resolved to become a pilgrim herself
when theodosia had gone to sleep princess mary thought about this for a long time  and at last made up her mind that  strange as it might seem  she must go on a pilgrimage
she disclosed this thought to no one but to her confessor  father akinfi  the monk  and he approved of her intention
under guise of a present for the pilgrims  princess mary prepared a pilgrim's complete costume for herself  a coarse smock  bast shoes  a rough coat  and a black kerchief often  approaching the chest of drawers containing this secret treasure  princess mary paused  uncertain whether the time had not already come to put her project into execution
often  listening to the pilgrims' tales  she was so stimulated by their simple speech  mechanical to them but to her so full of deep meaning  that several times she was on the point of abandoning everything and running away from home in imagination she already pictured herself by theodosia's side  dressed in coarse rags  walking with a staff  a wallet on her back  along the dusty road  directing her wanderings from one saint's shrine to another  free from envy  earthly love  or desire  and reaching at last the place where there is no more sorrow or sighing  but eternal joy and bliss
 i shall come to a place and pray there  and before having time to get used to it or getting to love it  i shall go farther
i will go on till my legs fail  and i'll lie down and die somewhere  and shall at last reach that eternal  quiet haven  where there is neither sorrow nor sighing     thought princess mary
but afterwards  when she saw her father and especially little koko  nicholas   her resolve weakened
she wept quietly  and felt that she was a sinner who loved her father and little nephew more than god
the bible legend tells us that the absence of labor idleness was a condition of the first man's blessedness before the fall
fallen man has retained a love of idleness  but the curse weighs on the race not only because we have to seek our bread in the sweat of our brows  but because our moral nature is such that we cannot be both idle and at ease
an inner voice tells us we are in the wrong if we are idle
if man could find a state in which he felt that though idle he was fulfilling his duty  he would have found one of the conditions of man's primitive blessedness
and such a state of obligatory and irreproachable idleness is the lot of a whole class the military
the chief attraction of military service has consisted and will consist in this compulsory and irreproachable idleness
nicholas rostov experienced this blissful condition to the full when  after 1807  he continued to serve in the pavlograd regiment  in which he already commanded the squadron he had taken over from denisov
rostov had become a bluff  good natured fellow  whom his moscow acquaintances would have considered rather bad form  but who was liked and respected by his comrades  subordinates  and superiors  and was well contented with his life of late  in 1809  he found in letters from home more frequent complaints from his mother that their affairs were falling into greater and greater disorder  and that it was time for him to come back to gladden and comfort his old parents
reading these letters  nicholas felt a dread of their wanting to take him away from surroundings in which  protected from all the entanglements of life  he was living so calmly and quietly
he felt that sooner or later he would have to re enter that whirlpool of life  with its embarrassments and affairs to be straightened out  its accounts with stewards  quarrels  and intrigues  its ties  society  and with sonya's love and his promise to her
it was all dreadfully difficult and complicated  and he replied to his mother in cold  formal letters in french  beginning   my dear mamma   and ending   your obedient son   which said nothing of when he would return
in 1810 he received letters from his parents  in which they told him of natasha's engagement to bolkonski  and that the wedding would be in a year's time because the old prince made difficulties
this letter grieved and mortified nicholas
in the first place he was sorry that natasha  for whom he cared more than for anyone else in the family  should be lost to the home  and secondly  from his hussar point of view  he regretted not to have been there to show that fellow bolkonski that connection with him was no such great honor after all  and that if he loved natasha he might dispense with permission from his dotard father
for a moment he hesitated whether he should not apply for leave in order to see natasha before she was married  but then came the maneuvers  and considerations about sonya and about the confusion of their affairs  and nicholas again put it off
but in the spring of that year  he received a letter from his mother  written without his father's knowledge  and that letter persuaded him to return
she wrote that if he did not come and take matters in hand  their whole property would be sold by auction and they would all have to go begging
the count was so weak  and trusted mitenka so much  and was so good natured  that everybody took advantage of him and things were going from bad to worse
 for god's sake  i implore you  come at once if you do not wish to make me and the whole family wretched   wrote the countess this letter touched nicholas
he had that common sense of a matter of fact man which showed him what he ought to do
the right thing now was  if not to retire from the service  at any rate to go home on leave
why he had to go he did not know  but after his after dinner nap he gave orders to saddle mars  an extremely vicious gray stallion that had not been ridden for a long time  and when he returned with the horse all in a lather  he informed lavrushka  denisov's servant who had remained with him  and his comrades who turned up in the evening that he was applying for leave and was going home difficult and strange as it was for him to reflect that he would go away without having heard from the staff and this interested him extremely whether he was promoted to a captaincy or would receive the order of st
anne for the last maneuvers  strange as it was to think that he would go away without having sold his three roans to the polish count golukhovski  who was bargaining for the horses rostov had betted he would sell for two thousand rubles  incomprehensible as it seemed that the ball the hussars were giving in honor of the polish mademoiselle przazdziecka  out of rivalry to the uhlans who had given one in honor of their polish mademoiselle borzozowska  would take place without him he knew he must go away from this good  bright world to somewhere where everything was stupid and confused
a week later he obtained his leave
his hussar comrades not only those of his own regiment  but the whole brigade gave rostov a dinner to which the subscription was fifteen rubles a head  and at which there were two bands and two choirs of singers rostov danced the trepak with major basov  the tipsy officers tossed  embraced  and dropped rostov  the soldiers of the third squadron tossed him too  and shouted  hurrah   and then they put him in his sleigh and escorted him as far as the first post station
during the first half of the journey from kremenchug to kiev all rostov's thoughts  as is usual in such cases  were behind him  with the squadron  but when he had gone more than halfway he began to forget his three roans and dozhoyveyko  his quartermaster  and to wonder anxiously how things would be at otradnoe and what he would find there
thoughts of home grew stronger the nearer he approached it far stronger  as though this feeling of his was subject to the law by which the force of attraction is in inverse proportion to the square of the distance
at the last post station before otradnoe he gave the driver a three ruble tip  and on arriving he ran breathlessly  like a boy  up the steps of his home
after the rapture of meeting  and after that odd feeling of unsatisfied expectation the feeling that  everything is just the same  so why did i hurry   nicholas began to settle down in his old home world
his father and mother were much the same  only a little older
what was new in them was a certain uneasiness and occasional discord  which there used not to be  and which  as nicholas soon found out  was due to the bad state of their affairs
sonya was nearly twenty  she had stopped growing prettier and promised nothing more than she was already  but that was enough
she exhaled happiness and love from the time nicholas returned  and the faithful  unalterable love of this girl had a gladdening effect on him
petya and natasha surprised nicholas most
petya was a big handsome boy of thirteen  merry  witty  and mischievous  with a voice that was already breaking
as for natasha  for a long while nicholas wondered and laughed whenever he looked at her
 you're not the same at all   he said
 how  am i uglier    on the contrary  but what dignity  a princess   he whispered to her
 yes  yes  yes   cried natasha  joyfully
she told him about her romance with prince andrew and of his visit to otradnoe and showed him his last letter
 well  are you glad   natasha asked
 i am so tranquil and happy now    very glad   answered nicholas
 he is an excellent fellow   
and are you very much in love    how shall i put it   replied natasha
 i was in love with boris  with my teacher  and with denisov  but this is quite different
i feel at peace and settled
i know that no better man than he exists  and i am calm and contented now
not at all as before   nicholas expressed his disapproval of the postponement of the marriage for a year  but natasha attacked her brother with exasperation  proving to him that it could not be otherwise  and that it would be a bad thing to enter a family against the father's will  and that she herself wished it so
 you don't at all understand   she said
nicholas was silent and agreed with her
her brother often wondered as he looked at her
she did not seem at all like a girl in love and parted from her affianced husband
she was even tempered and calm and quite as cheerful as of old
this amazed nicholas and even made him regard bolkonski's courtship skeptically
he could not believe that her fate was sealed  especially as he had not seen her with prince andrew
it always seemed to him that there was something not quite right about this intended marriage
 why this delay  why no betrothal   he thought
once  when he had touched on this topic with his mother  he discovered  to his surprise and somewhat to his satisfaction  that in the depth of her soul she too had doubts about this marriage
 you see he writes   said she  showing her son a letter of prince andrew's  with that latent grudge a mother always has in regard to a daughter's future married happiness   he writes that he won't come before december
what can be keeping him  illness  probably  his health is very delicate
don't tell natasha
and don't attach importance to her being so bright  that's because she's living through the last days of her girlhood  but i know what she is like every time we receive a letter from him  however  god grant that everything turns out well    she always ended with these words    he is an excellent man   after reaching home nicholas was at first serious and even dull
he was worried by the impending necessity of interfering in the stupid business matters for which his mother had called him home
to throw off this burden as quickly as possible  on the third day after his arrival he went  angry and scowling and without answering questions as to where he was going  to mitenka's lodge and demanded an account of everything
but what an account of everything might be nicholas knew even less than the frightened and bewildered mitenka
the conversation and the examination of the accounts with mitenka did not last long
the village elder  a peasant delegate  and the village clerk  who were waiting in the passage  heard with fear and delight first the young count's voice roaring and snapping and rising louder and louder  and then words of abuse  dreadful words  ejaculated one after the other
 robber   
ungrateful wretch    i'll hack the dog to pieces  i'm not my father   
robbing us      and so on
then with no less fear and delight they saw how the young count  red in the face and with bloodshot eyes  dragged mitenka out by the scruff of the neck and applied his foot and knee to his behind with great agility at convenient moments between the words  shouting   be off  never let me see your face here again  you villain   mitenka flew headlong down the six steps and ran away into the shrubbery
 this shrubbery was a well known haven of refuge for culprits at otradnoe
mitenka himself  returning tipsy from the town  used to hide there  and many of the residents at otradnoe  hiding from mitenka  knew of its protective qualities   mitenka's wife and sisters in law thrust their heads and frightened faces out of the door of a room where a bright samovar was boiling and where the steward's high bedstead stood with its patchwork quilt the young count paid no heed to them  but  breathing hard  passed by with resolute strides and went into the house
the countess  who heard at once from the maids what had happened at the lodge  was calmed by the thought that now their affairs would certainly improve  but on the other hand felt anxious as to the effect this excitement might have on her son
she went several times to his door on tiptoe and listened  as he lighted one pipe after another
next day the old count called his son aside and  with an embarrassed smile  said to him   but you know  my dear boy  it's a pity you got excited  mitenka has told me all about it    i knew   thought nicholas   that i should never understand anything in this crazy world    you were angry that he had not entered those 700 rubles
but they were carried forward and you did not look at the other page    papa  he is a blackguard and a thief  i know he is  and what i have done  i have done  but  if you like  i won't speak to him again    no  my dear boy   the count  too  felt embarrassed
he knew he had mismanaged his wife's property and was to blame toward his children  but he did not know how to remedy it 
 no  i beg you to attend to the business
i am old
i      no  papa
forgive me if i have caused you unpleasantness
i understand it all less than you do    devil take all these peasants  and money matters  and carryings forward from page to page   he thought
 i used to understand what a 'corner' and the stakes at cards meant  but carrying forward to another page i don't understand at all   said he to himself  and after that he did not meddle in business affairs but once the countess called her son and informed him that she had a promissory note from anna mikhaylovna for two thousand rubles  and asked him what he thought of doing with it
 this   answered nicholas
 you say it rests with me
well  i don't like anna mikhaylovna and i don't like boris  but they were our friends and poor
well then  this   and he tore up the note  and by so doing caused the old countess to weep tears of joy
after that  young rostov took no further part in any business affairs  but devoted himself with passionate enthusiasm to what was to him a new pursuit the chase for which his father kept a large establishment the weather was already growing wintry and morning frosts congealed an earth saturated by autumn rains
the verdure had thickened and its bright green stood out sharply against the brownish strips of winter rye trodden down by the cattle  and against the pale yellow stubble of the spring buckwheat
the wooded ravines and the copses  which at the end of august had still been green islands amid black fields and stubble  had become golden and bright red islands amid the green winter rye
the hares had already half changed their summer coats  the fox cubs were beginning to scatter  and the young wolves were bigger than dogs
it was the best time of the year for the chase
the hounds of that ardent young sportsman rostov had not merely reached hard winter condition  but were so jaded that at a meeting of the huntsmen it was decided to give them a three days' rest and then  on the sixteenth of september  to go on a distant expedition  starting from the oak grove where there was an undisturbed litter of wolf cubs
all that day the hounds remained at home
it was frosty and the air was sharp  but toward evening the sky became overcast and it began to thaw
on the fifteenth  when young rostov  in his dressing gown  looked out of the window  he saw it was an unsurpassable morning for hunting  it was as if the sky were melting and sinking to the earth without any wind
the only motion in the air was that of the dripping  microscopic particles of drizzling mist
the bare twigs in the garden were hung with transparent drops which fell on the freshly fallen leaves
the earth in the kitchen garden looked wet and black and glistened like poppy seed and at a short distance merged into the dull  moist veil of mist
nicholas went out into the wet and muddy porch
there was a smell of decaying leaves and of dog
milka  a black spotted  broad haunched bitch with prominent black eyes  got up on seeing her master  stretched her hind legs  lay down like a hare  and then suddenly jumped up and licked him right on his nose and mustache another borzoi  a dog  catching sight of his master from the garden path  arched his back and  rushing headlong toward the porch with lifted tail  began rubbing himself against his legs  o hoy   came at that moment  that inimitable huntsman's call which unites the deepest bass with the shrillest tenor  and round the corner came daniel the head huntsman and head kennelman  a gray  wrinkled old man with hair cut straight over his forehead  ukrainian fashion  a long bent whip in his hand  and that look of independence and scorn of everything that is only seen in huntsmen
he doffed his circassian cap to his master and looked at him scornfully
this scorn was not offensive to his master
nicholas knew that this daniel  disdainful of everybody and who considered himself above them  was all the same his serf and huntsman  daniel   nicholas said timidly  conscious at the sight of the weather  the hounds  and the huntsman that he was being carried away by that irresistible passion for sport which makes a man forget all his previous resolutions  as a lover forgets in the presence of his mistress
 what orders  your excellency   said the huntsman in his deep bass  deep as a proto deacon's and hoarse with hallooing and two flashing black eyes gazed from under his brows at his master  who was silent
 can you resist it   those eyes seemed to be asking
 it's a good day  eh  for a hunt and a gallop  eh   asked nicholas  scratching milka behind the ears
daniel did not answer  but winked instead
 i sent uvarka at dawn to listen   his bass boomed out after a minute's pause
 he says she's moved them into the otradnoe enclosure
they were howling there    this meant that the she wolf  about whom they both knew  had moved with her cubs to the otradnoe copse  a small place a mile and a half from the house    we ought to go  don't you think so   said nicholas
 come to me with uvarka    as you please    then put off feeding them    yes  sir   five minutes later daniel and uvarka were standing in nicholas' big study
though daniel was not a big man  to see him in a room was like seeing a horse or a bear on the floor among the furniture and surroundings of human life
daniel himself felt this  and as usual stood just inside the door  trying to speak softly and not move  for fear of breaking something in the master's apartment  and he hastened to say all that was necessary so as to get from under that ceiling  out into the open under the sky once more having finished his inquiries and extorted from daniel an opinion that the hounds were fit  daniel himself wished to go hunting   nicholas ordered the horses to be saddled but just as daniel was about to go natasha came in with rapid steps  not having done up her hair or finished dressing and with her old nurse's big shawl wrapped round her
petya ran in at the same time
 you are going   asked natasha
 i knew you would  sonya said you wouldn't go  but i knew that today is the sort of day when you couldn't help going    yes  we are going   replied nicholas reluctantly  for today  as he intended to hunt seriously  he did not want to take natasha and petya
 we are going  but only wolf hunting  it would be dull for you    you know it is my greatest pleasure   said natasha
 it's not fair  you are going by yourself  are having the horses saddled and said nothing to us about it    'no barrier bars a russian's path' we'll go   shouted petya
 but you can't
mamma said you mustn't   said nicholas to natasha
 yes  i'll go
i shall certainly go   said natasha decisively
 daniel  tell them to saddle for us  and michael must come with my dogs   she added to the huntsman
it seemed to daniel irksome and improper to be in a room at all  but to have anything to do with a young lady seemed to him impossible
he cast down his eyes and hurried out as if it were none of his business  careful as he went not to inflict any accidental injury on the young lady
the old count  who had always kept up an enormous hunting establishment but had now handed it all completely over to his son's care  being in very good spirits on this fifteenth of september  prepared to go out with the others
in an hour's time the whole hunting party was at the porch
nicholas  with a stern and serious air which showed that now was no time for attending to trifles  went past natasha and petya who were trying to tell him something
he had a look at all the details of the hunt  sent a pack of hounds and huntsmen on ahead to find the quarry  mounted his chestnut donets  and whistling to his own leash of borzois  set off across the threshing ground to a field leading to the otradnoe wood
the old count's horse  a sorrel gelding called viflyanka  was led by the groom in attendance on him  while the count himself was to drive in a small trap straight to a spot reserved for him they were taking fifty four hounds  with six hunt attendants and whippers in
besides the family  there were eight borzoi kennelmen and more than forty borzois  so that  with the borzois on the leash belonging to members of the family  there were about a hundred and thirty dogs and twenty horsemen
each dog knew its master and its call
each man in the hunt knew his business  his place  what he had to do
as soon as they had passed the fence they all spread out evenly and quietly  without noise or talk  along the road and field leading to the otradnoe covert
the horses stepped over the field as over a thick carpet  now and then splashing into puddles as they crossed a road
the misty sky still seemed to descend evenly and imperceptibly toward the earth  the air was still  warm  and silent
occasionally the whistle of a huntsman  the snort of a horse  the crack of a whip  or the whine of a straggling hound could be heard
when they had gone a little less than a mile  five more riders with dogs appeared out of the mist  approaching the rostovs
in front rode a freshlooking  handsome old man with a large gray mustache
 good morning  uncle   said nicholas  when the old man drew near
 that's it
come on   
i was sure of it   began  uncle    he was a distant relative of the rostovs'  a man of small means  and their neighbor    i knew you wouldn't be able to resist it and it's a good thing you're going
that's it  come on    this was  uncle's  favorite expression    take the covert at once  for my girchik says the ilagins are at korniki with their hounds
that's it
come on   
they'll take the cubs from under your very nose    that's where i'm going
shall we join up our packs   asked nicholas
the hounds were joined into one pack  and  uncle  and nicholas rode on side by side
natasha  muffled up in shawls which did not hide her eager face and shining eyes  galloped up to them
she was followed by petya who always kept close to her  by michael  a huntsman  and by a groom appointed to look after her
petya  who was laughing  whipped and pulled at his horse
natasha sat easily and confidently on her black arabchik and reined him in without effort with a firm hand
 uncle  looked round disapprovingly at petya and natasha
he did not like to combine frivolity with the serious business of hunting
 good morning  uncle  we are going too   shouted petya
 good morning  good morning  but don't go overriding the hounds   said  uncle  sternly
 nicholas  what a fine dog trunila is  he knew me   said natasha  referring to her favorite hound
 in the first place  trunila is not a 'dog ' but a harrier   thought nicholas  and looked sternly at his sister  trying to make her feel the distance that ought to separate them at that moment
natasha understood it
 you mustn't think we'll be in anyone's way  uncle   she said
 we'll go to our places and won't budge    a good thing too  little countess   said  uncle    only mind you don't fall off your horse   he added   because that's it  come on  you've nothing to hold on to   the oasis of the otradnoe covert came in sight a few hundred yards off  the huntsmen were already nearing it
rostov  having finally settled with  uncle  where they should set on the hounds  and having shown natasha where she was to stand a spot where nothing could possibly run out went round above the ravine
 well  nephew  you're going for a big wolf   said  uncle    mind and don't let her slip    that's as may happen   answered rostov
 karay  here   he shouted  answering  uncle's  remark by this call to his borzoi
karay was a shaggy old dog with a hanging jowl  famous for having tackled a big wolf unaided
they all took up their places
the old count  knowing his son's ardor in the hunt  hurried so as not to be late  and the huntsmen had not yet reached their places when count ilya rostov  cheerful  flushed  and with quivering cheeks  drove up with his black horses over the winter rye to the place reserved for him  where a wolf might come out
having straightened his coat and fastened on his hunting knives and horn  he mounted his good  sleek  well fed  and comfortable horse  viflyanka  which was turning gray  like himself his horses and trap were sent home
count ilya rostov  though not at heart a keen sportsman  knew the rules of the hunt well  and rode to the bushy edge of the road where he was to stand  arranged his reins  settled himself in the saddle  and  feeling that he was ready  looked about with a smile beside him was simon chekmar  his personal attendant  an old horseman now somewhat stiff in the saddle
chekmar held in leash three formidable wolfhounds  who had  however  grown fat like their master and his horse
two wise old dogs lay down unleashed
some hundred paces farther along the edge of the wood stood mitka  the count's other groom  a daring horseman and keen rider to hounds
before the hunt  by old custom  the count had drunk a silver cupful of mulled brandy  taken a snack  and washed it down with half a bottle of his favorite bordeaux
he was somewhat flushed with the wine and the drive
his eyes were rather moist and glittered more than usual  and as he sat in his saddle  wrapped up in his fur coat  he looked like a child taken out for an outing
the thin  hollow cheeked chekmar  having got everything ready  kept glancing at his master with whom he had lived on the best of terms for thirty years  and understanding the mood he was in expected a pleasant chat a third person rode up circumspectly through the wood  it was plain that he had had a lesson  and stopped behind the count this person was a gray bearded old man in a woman's cloak  with a tall peaked cap on his head
he was the buffoon  who went by a woman's name  nastasya ivanovna
 well  nastasya ivanovna   whispered the count  winking at him
 if you scare away the beast  daniel'll give it you    i know a thing or two myself   said nastasya ivanovna
 hush   whispered the count and turned to simon
 have you seen the young countess   he asked
 where is she    with young count peter  by the zharov rank grass   answered simon  smiling
 though she's a lady  she's very fond of hunting    and you're surprised at the way she rides  simon  eh   said the count
 she's as good as many a man    of course  it's marvelous
so bold  so easy    and nicholas  where is he  by the lyadov upland  isn't he    yes  sir
he knows where to stand
he understands the matter so well that daniel and i are often quite astounded   said simon  well knowing what would please his master
 rides well  eh  and how well he looks on his horse  eh    a perfect picture  how he chased a fox out of the rank grass by the zavarzinsk thicket the other day  leaped a fearful place  what a sight when they rushed from the covert  
the horse worth a thousand rubles and the rider beyond all price  yes  one would have to search far to find another as smart    to search far     repeated the count  evidently sorry simon had not said more
 to search far   he said  turning back the skirt of his coat to get at his snuffbox
 the other day when he came out from mass in full uniform  michael sidorych     simon did not finish  for on the still air he had distinctly caught the music of the hunt with only two or three hounds giving tongue
he bent down his head and listened  shaking a warning finger at his master
 they are on the scent of the cubs     he whispered   straight to the lyadov uplands   the count  forgetting to smooth out the smile on his face  looked into the distance straight before him  down the narrow open space  holding the snuffbox in his hand but not taking any
after the cry of the hounds came the deep tones of the wolf call from daniel's hunting horn  the pack joined the first three hounds and they could be heard in full cry  with that peculiar lift in the note that indicates that they are after a wolf
the whippers in no longer set on the hounds  but changed to the cry of ulyulyu  and above the others rose daniel's voice  now a deep bass  now piercingly shrill
his voice seemed to fill the whole wood and carried far beyond out into the open field
after listening a few moments in silence  the count and his attendant convinced themselves that the hounds had separated into two packs  the sound of the larger pack  eagerly giving tongue  began to die away in the distance  the other pack rushed by the wood past the count  and it was with this that daniel's voice was heard calling ulyulyu the sounds of both packs mingled and broke apart again  but both were becoming more distant
simon sighed and stooped to straighten the leash a young borzoi had entangled  the count too sighed and  noticing the snuffbox in his hand  opened it and took a pinch
 back   cried simon to a borzoi that was pushing forward out of the wood
the count started and dropped the snuffbox
nastasya ivanovna dismounted to pick it up
the count and simon were looking at him
then  unexpectedly  as often happens  the sound of the hunt suddenly approached  as if the hounds in full cry and daniel ulyulyuing were just in front of them
the count turned and saw on his right mitka staring at him with eyes starting out of his head  raising his cap and pointing before him to the other side
 look out   he shouted  in a voice plainly showing that he had long fretted to utter that word  and letting the borzois slip he galloped toward the count
the count and simon galloped out of the wood and saw on their left a wolf which  softly swaying from side to side  was coming at a quiet lope farther to the left to the very place where they were standing
the angry borzois whined and getting free of the leash rushed past the horses' feet at the wolf
the wolf paused  turned its heavy forehead toward the dogs awkwardly  like a man suffering from the quinsy  and  still slightly swaying from side to side  gave a couple of leaps and with a swish of its tail disappeared into the skirt of the wood
at the same instant  with a cry like a wail  first one hound  then another  and then another  sprang helter skelter from the wood opposite and the whole pack rushed across the field toward the very spot where the wolf had disappeared
the hazel bushes parted behind the hounds and daniel's chestnut horse appeared  dark with sweat
on its long back sat daniel  hunched forward  capless  his disheveled gray hair hanging over his flushed  perspiring face
 ulyulyulyu  ulyulyu      he cried
when he caught sight of the count his eyes flashed lightning
 blast you   he shouted  holding up his whip threateningly at the count
 you've let the wolf go   
what sportsmen   and as if scorning to say more to the frightened and shamefaced count  he lashed the heaving flanks of his sweating chestnut gelding with all the anger the count had aroused and flew off after the hounds
the count  like a punished schoolboy  looked round  trying by a smile to win simon's sympathy for his plight
but simon was no longer there
he was galloping round by the bushes while the field was coming up on both sides  all trying to head the wolf  but it vanished into the wood before they could do so
nicholas rostov meanwhile remained at his post  waiting for the wolf
by the way the hunt approached and receded  by the cries of the dogs whose notes were familiar to him  by the way the voices of the huntsmen approached  receded  and rose  he realized what was happening at the copse
he knew that young and old wolves were there  that the hounds had separated into two packs  that somewhere a wolf was being chased  and that something had gone wrong
he expected the wolf to come his way any moment
he made thousands of different conjectures as to where and from what side the beast would come and how he would set upon it
hope alternated with despair
several times he addressed a prayer to god that the wolf should come his way
he prayed with that passionate and shamefaced feeling with which men pray at moments of great excitement arising from trivial causes
 what would it be to thee to do this for me   he said to god
 i know thou art great  and that it is a sin to ask this of thee  but for god's sake do let the old wolf come my way and let karay spring at it in sight of 'uncle' who is watching from over there and seize it by the throat in a death grip   a thousand times during that half hour rostov cast eager and restless glances over the edge of the wood  with the two scraggy oaks rising above the aspen undergrowth and the gully with its water worn side and  uncle's  cap just visible above the bush on his right
 no  i shan't have such luck   thought rostov   yet what wouldn't it be worth  it is not to be  everywhere  at cards and in war  i am always unlucky   memories of austerlitz and of dolokhov flashed rapidly and clearly through his mind
 only once in my life to get an old wolf  i want only that   thought he  straining eyes and ears and looking to the left and then to the right and listening to the slightest variation of note in the cries of the dogs
again he looked to the right and saw something running toward him across the deserted field
 no  it can't be   thought rostov  taking a deep breath  as a man does at the coming of something long hoped for
the height of happiness was reached and so simply  without warning  or noise  or display  that rostov could not believe his eyes and remained in doubt for over a second
the wolf ran forward and jumped heavily over a gully that lay in her path
she was an old animal with a gray back and big reddish belly
she ran without hurry  evidently feeling sure that no one saw her
rostov  holding his breath  looked round at the borzois
they stood or lay not seeing the wolf or understanding the situation
old karay had turned his head and was angrily searching for fleas  baring his yellow teeth and snapping at his hind legs
 ulyulyulyu   whispered rostov  pouting his lips
the borzois jumped up  jerking the rings of the leashes and pricking their ears
karay finished scratching his hindquarters and  cocking his ears  got up with quivering tail from which tufts of matted hair hung down
 shall i loose them or not   nicholas asked himself as the wolf approached him coming from the copse suddenly the wolf's whole physiognomy changed  she shuddered  seeing what she had probably never seen before  human eyes fixed upon her and turning her head a little toward rostov  she paused
 back or forward  eh  no matter  forward     the wolf seemed to say to herself  and she moved forward without again looking round and with a quiet  long  easy yet resolute lope
 ulyulyu   cried nicholas  in a voice not his own  and of its own accord his good horse darted headlong downhill  leaping over gullies to head off the wolf  and the borzois passed it  running faster still
nicholas did not hear his own cry nor feel that he was galloping  nor see the borzois  nor the ground over which he went  he saw only the wolf  who  increasing her speed  bounded on in the same direction along the hollow
the first to come into view was milka  with her black markings and powerful quarters  gaining upon the wolf
nearer and nearer  
now she was ahead of it  but the wolf turned its head to face her  and instead of putting on speed as she usually did milka suddenly raised her tail and stiffened her forelegs
 ulyulyulyulyu   shouted nicholas
the reddish lyubim rushed forward from behind milka  sprang impetuously at the wolf  and seized it by its hindquarters  but immediately jumped aside in terror
the wolf crouched  gnashed her teeth  and again rose and bounded forward  followed at the distance of a couple of feet by all the borzois  who did not get any closer to her
 she'll get away  no  it's impossible   thought nicholas  still shouting with a hoarse voice
 karay  ulyulyu      he shouted  looking round for the old borzoi who was now his only hope
karay  with all the strength age had left him  stretched himself to the utmost and  watching the wolf  galloped heavily aside to intercept it but the quickness of the wolf's lope and the borzoi's slower pace made it plain that karay had miscalculated nicholas could already see not far in front of him the wood where the wolf would certainly escape should she reach it
but  coming toward him  he saw hounds and a huntsman galloping almost straight at the wolf
there was still hope
a long  yellowish young borzoi  one nicholas did not know  from another leash  rushed impetuously at the wolf from in front and almost knocked her over
but the wolf jumped up more quickly than anyone could have expected and  gnashing her teeth  flew at the yellowish borzoi  which  with a piercing yelp  fell with its head on the ground  bleeding from a gash in its side
 karay  old fellow      wailed nicholas
thanks to the delay caused by this crossing of the wolf's path  the old dog with its felted hair hanging from its thigh was within five paces of it
as if aware of her danger  the wolf turned her eyes on karay  tucked her tail yet further between her legs  and increased her speed
but here nicholas only saw that something happened to karay the borzoi was suddenly on the wolf  and they rolled together down into a gully just in front of them
that instant  when nicholas saw the wolf struggling in the gully with the dogs  while from under them could be seen her gray hair and outstretched hind leg and her frightened choking head  with her ears laid back  karay was pinning her by the throat   was the happiest moment of his life with his hand on his saddlebow  he was ready to dismount and stab the wolf  when she suddenly thrust her head up from among that mass of dogs  and then her forepaws were on the edge of the gully
she clicked her teeth  karay no longer had her by the throat   leaped with a movement of her hind legs out of the gully  and having disengaged herself from the dogs  with tail tucked in again  went forward
karay  his hair bristling  and probably bruised or wounded  climbed with difficulty out of the gully
 oh my god  why   nicholas cried in despair
 uncle's  huntsman was galloping from the other side across the wolf's path and his borzois once more stopped the animal's advance
she was again hemmed in
nicholas and his attendant  with  uncle  and his huntsman  were all riding round the wolf  crying  ulyulyu   shouting and preparing to dismount each moment that the wolf crouched back  and starting forward again every time she shook herself and moved toward the wood where she would be safe
already  at the beginning of this chase  daniel  hearing the ulyulyuing  had rushed out from the wood
he saw karay seize the wolf  and checked his horse  supposing the affair to be over
but when he saw that the horsemen did not dismount and that the wolf shook herself and ran for safety  daniel set his chestnut galloping  not at the wolf but straight toward the wood  just as karay had run to cut the animal off
as a result of this  he galloped up to the wolf just when she had been stopped a second time by  uncle's  borzois
daniel galloped up silently  holding a naked dagger in his left hand and thrashing the laboring sides of his chestnut horse with his whip as if it were a flail
nicholas neither saw nor heard daniel until the chestnut  breathing heavily  panted past him  and he heard the fall of a body and saw daniel lying on the wolf's back among the dogs  trying to seize her by the ears
it was evident to the dogs  the hunters  and to the wolf herself that all was now over
the terrified wolf pressed back her ears and tried to rise  but the borzois stuck to her
daniel rose a little  took a step  and with his whole weight  as if lying down to rest  fell on the wolf  seizing her by the ears
nicholas was about to stab her  but daniel whispered   don't  we'll gag her   and  changing his position  set his foot on the wolf's neck
a stick was thrust between her jaws and she was fastened with a leash  as if bridled  her legs were bound together  and daniel rolled her over once or twice from side to side
with happy  exhausted faces  they laid the old wolf  alive  on a shying and snorting horse and  accompanied by the dogs yelping at her  took her to the place where they were all to meet
the hounds had killed two of the cubs and the borzois three
the huntsmen assembled with their booty and their stories  and all came to look at the wolf  which  with her broad browed head hanging down and the bitten stick between her jaws  gazed with great glassy eyes at this crowd of dogs and men surrounding her
when she was touched  she jerked her bound legs and looked wildly yet simply at everybody
old count rostov also rode up and touched the wolf
 oh  what a formidable one   said he
 a formidable one  eh   he asked daniel  who was standing near
 yes  your excellency   answered daniel  quickly doffing his cap
the count remembered the wolf he had let slip and his encounter with daniel
 ah  but you are a crusty fellow  friend   said the count
for sole reply daniel gave him a shy  childlike  meek  and amiable smile
the old count went home  and natasha and petya promised to return very soon  but as it was still early the hunt went farther
at midday they put the hounds into a ravine thickly overgrown with young trees
nicholas standing in a fallow field could see all his whips
facing him lay a field of winter rye  there his own huntsman stood alone in a hollow behind a hazel bush
the hounds had scarcely been loosed before nicholas heard one he knew  voltorn  giving tongue at intervals  other hounds joined in  now pausing and now again giving tongue
a moment later he heard a cry from the wooded ravine that a fox had been found  and the whole pack  joining together  rushed along the ravine toward the ryefield and away from nicholas
he saw the whips in their red caps galloping along the edge of the ravine  he even saw the hounds  and was expecting a fox to show itself at any moment on the ryefield opposite
the huntsman standing in the hollow moved and loosed his borzois  and nicholas saw a queer  short legged red fox with a fine brush going hard across the field
the borzois bore down on it   
now they drew close to the fox which began to dodge between the field in sharper and sharper curves  trailing its brush  when suddenly a strange white borzoi dashed in followed by a black one  and everything was in confusion  the borzois formed a star shaped figure  scarcely swaying their bodies and with tails turned away from the center of the group
two huntsmen galloped up to the dogs  one in a red cap  the other  a stranger  in a green coat
 what's this   thought nicholas
 where's that huntsman from  he is not 'uncle's' man   the huntsmen got the fox  but stayed there a long time without strapping it to the saddle
their horses  bridled and with high saddles  stood near them and there too the dogs were lying
the huntsmen waved their arms and did something to the fox then from that spot came the sound of a horn  with the signal agreed on in case of a fight
 that's ilagin's huntsman having a row with our ivan   said nicholas' groom
nicholas sent the man to call natasha and petya to him  and rode at a footpace to the place where the whips were getting the hounds together
several of the field galloped to the spot where the fight was going on
nicholas dismounted  and with natasha and petya  who had ridden up  stopped near the hounds  waiting to see how the matter would end
out of the bushes came the huntsman who had been fighting and rode toward his young master  with the fox tied to his crupper
while still at a distance he took off his cap and tried to speak respectfully  but he was pale and breathless and his face was angry
one of his eyes was black  but he probably was not even aware of it
 what has happened   asked nicholas
 a likely thing  killing a fox our dogs had hunted  and it was my gray bitch that caught it  go to law  indeed   
he snatches at the fox  i gave him one with the fox
here it is on my saddle  do you want a taste of this      said the huntsman  pointing to his dagger and probably imagining himself still speaking to his foe nicholas  not stopping to talk to the man  asked his sister and petya to wait for him and rode to the spot where the enemy's  ilagin's  hunting party was
the victorious huntsman rode off to join the field  and there  surrounded by inquiring sympathizers  recounted his exploits
the facts were that ilagin  with whom the rostovs had a quarrel and were at law  hunted over places that belonged by custom to the rostovs  and had now  as if purposely  sent his men to the very woods the rostovs were hunting and let his man snatch a fox their dogs had chased
nicholas  though he had never seen ilagin  with his usual absence of moderation in judgment  hated him cordially from reports of his arbitrariness and violence  and regarded him as his bitterest foe
he rode in angry agitation toward him  firmly grasping his whip and fully prepared to take the most resolute and desperate steps to punish his enemy
hardly had he passed an angle of the wood before a stout gentleman in a beaver cap came riding toward him on a handsome raven black horse  accompanied by two hunt servants
instead of an enemy  nicholas found in ilagin a stately and courteous gentleman who was particularly anxious to make the young count's acquaintance
having ridden up to nicholas  ilagin raised his beaver cap and said he much regretted what had occurred and would have the man punished who had allowed himself to seize a fox hunted by someone else's borzois he hoped to become better acquainted with the count and invited him to draw his covert
natasha  afraid that her brother would do something dreadful  had followed him in some excitement
seeing the enemies exchanging friendly greetings  she rode up to them
ilagin lifted his beaver cap still higher to natasha and said  with a pleasant smile  that the young countess resembled diana in her passion for the chase as well as in her beauty  of which he had heard much
to expiate his huntsman's offense  ilagin pressed the rostovs to come to an upland of his about a mile away which he usually kept for himself and which  he said  swarmed with hares nicholas agreed  and the hunt  now doubled  moved on
the way to iligin's upland was across the fields
the hunt servants fell into line
the masters rode together
 uncle   rostov  and ilagin kept stealthily glancing at one another's dogs  trying not to be observed by their companions and searching uneasily for rivals to their own borzois
rostov was particularly struck by the beauty of a small  pure bred  red spotted bitch on ilagin's leash  slender but with muscles like steel  a delicate muzzle  and prominent black eyes
he had heard of the swiftness of ilagin's borzois  and in that beautiful bitch saw a rival to his own milka
in the middle of a sober conversation begun by ilagin about the year's harvest  nicholas pointed to the red spotted bitch
 a fine little bitch  that   said he in a careless tone
 is she swift    that one  yes  she's a good dog  gets what she's after   answered ilagin indifferently  of the red spotted bitch erza  for which  a year before  he had given a neighbor three families of house serfs
 so in your parts  too  the harvest is nothing to boast of  count   he went on  continuing the conversation they had begun
and considering it polite to return the young count's compliment  ilagin looked at his borzois and picked out milka who attracted his attention by her breadth
 that black spotted one of yours is fine  well shaped   said he
 yes  she's fast enough   replied nicholas  and thought   if only a full grown hare would cross the field now i'd show you what sort of borzoi she is   and turning to his groom  he said he would give a ruble to anyone who found a hare
 i don't understand   continued ilagin   how some sportsmen can be so jealous about game and dogs
for myself  i can tell you  count  i enjoy riding in company such as this  
what could be better    he again raised his cap to natasha   but as for counting skins and what one takes  i don't care about that    of course not    or being upset because someone else's borzoi and not mine catches something
all i care about is to enjoy seeing the chase  is it not so  count  for i consider that      a tu   came the long drawn cry of one of the borzoi whippers in  who had halted
he stood on a knoll in the stubble  holding his whip aloft  and again repeated his long drawn cry   a tu    this call and the uplifted whip meant that he saw a sitting hare    ah  he has found one  i think   said ilagin carelessly
 yes  we must ride up   
shall we both course it   answered nicholas  seeing in erza and  uncle's  red rugay two rivals he had never yet had a chance of pitting against his own borzois
 and suppose they outdo my milka at once   he thought as he rode with  uncle  and ilagin toward the hare
 a full grown one   asked ilagin as he approached the whip who had sighted the hare and not without agitation he looked round and whistled to erza
 and you  michael nikanorovich   he said  addressing  uncle   the latter was riding with a sullen expression on his face
 how can i join in  why  you've given a village for each of your borzois  that's it  come on  yours are worth thousands
try yours against one another  you two  and i'll look on    rugay  hey  hey   he shouted
 rugayushka   he added  involuntarily by this diminutive expressing his affection and the hopes he placed on this red borzoi
natasha saw and felt the agitation the two elderly men and her brother were trying to conceal  and was herself excited by it
the huntsman stood halfway up the knoll holding up his whip and the gentlefolk rode up to him at a footpace  the hounds that were far off on the horizon turned away from the hare  and the whips  but not the gentlefolk  also moved away
all were moving slowly and sedately
 how is it pointing   asked nicholas  riding a hundred paces toward the whip who had sighted the hare
but before the whip could reply  the hare  scenting the frost coming next morning  was unable to rest and leaped up
the pack on leash rushed downhill in full cry after the hare  and from all sides the borzois that were not on leash darted after the hounds and the hare
all the hunt  who had been moving slowly  shouted   stop   calling in the hounds  while the borzoi whips  with a cry of  a tu   galloped across the field setting the borzois on the hare
the tranquil ilagin  nicholas  natasha  and  uncle  flew  reckless of where and how they went  seeing only the borzois and the hare and fearing only to lose sight even for an instant of the chase
the hare they had started was a strong and swift one
when he jumped up he did not run at once  but pricked his ears listening to the shouting and trampling that resounded from all sides at once
he took a dozen bounds  not very quickly  letting the borzois gain on him  and  finally having chosen his direction and realized his danger  laid back his ears and rushed off headlong
he had been lying in the stubble  but in front of him was the autumn sowing where the ground was soft
the two borzois of the huntsman who had sighted him  having been the nearest  were the first to see and pursue him  but they had not gone far before ilagin's red spotted erza passed them  got within a length  flew at the hare with terrible swiftness aiming at his scut  and  thinking she had seized him  rolled over like a ball
the hare arched his back and bounded off yet more swiftly
from behind erza rushed the broad haunched  black spotted milka and began rapidly gaining on the hare
 milashka  dear   rose nicholas' triumphant cry
it looked as if milka would immediately pounce on the hare  but she overtook him and flew past
the hare had squatted
again the beautiful erza reached him  but when close to the hare's scut paused as if measuring the distance  so as not to make a mistake this time but seize his hind leg
 erza  darling   ilagin wailed in a voice unlike his own
erza did not hearken to his appeal
at the very moment when she would have seized her prey  the hare moved and darted along the balk between the winter rye and the stubble
again erza and milka were abreast  running like a pair of carriage horses  and began to overtake the hare  but it was easier for the hare to run on the balk and the borzois did not overtake him so quickly
 rugay  rugayushka  that's it  come on   came a third voice just then  and  uncle's  red borzoi  straining and curving its back  caught up with the two foremost borzois  pushed ahead of them regardless of the terrible strain  put on speed close to the hare  knocked it off the balk onto the ryefield  again put on speed still more viciously  sinking to his knees in the muddy field  and all one could see was how  muddying his back  he rolled over with the hare
a ring of borzois surrounded him
a moment later everyone had drawn up round the crowd of dogs
only the delighted  uncle  dismounted  and cut off a pad  shaking the hare for the blood to drip off  and anxiously glancing round with restless eyes while his arms and legs twitched he spoke without himself knowing whom to or what about  that's it  come on  that's a dog   
there  it has beaten them all  the thousand ruble as well as the one ruble borzois
that's it  come on   said he  panting and looking wrathfully around as if he were abusing someone  as if they were all his enemies and had insulted him  and only now had he at last succeeded in justifying himself  there are your thousand ruble ones   
that's it  come on       rugay  here's a pad for you   he said  throwing down the hare's muddy pad
 you've deserved it  that's it  come on    she'd tired herself out  she'd run it down three times by herself   said nicholas  also not listening to anyone and regardless of whether he were heard or not
 but what is there in running across it like that   said ilagin's groom
 once she had missed it and turned it away  any mongrel could take it   ilagin was saying at the same time  breathless from his gallop and his excitement
at the same moment natasha  without drawing breath  screamed joyously  ecstatically  and so piercingly that it set everyone's ear tingling
by that shriek she expressed what the others expressed by all talking at once  and it was so strange that she must herself have been ashamed of so wild a cry and everyone else would have been amazed at it at any other time
 uncle  himself twisted up the hare  threw it neatly and smartly across his horse's back as if by that gesture he meant to rebuke everybody  and  with an air of not wishing to speak to anyone  mounted his bay and rode off the others all followed  dispirited and shamefaced  and only much later were they able to regain their former affectation of indifference
for a long time they continued to look at red rugay who  his arched back spattered with mud and clanking the ring of his leash  walked along just behind  uncle's  horse with the serene air of a conqueror
 well  i am like any other dog as long as it's not a question of coursing
but when it is  then look out   his appearance seemed to nicholas to be saying
when  much later   uncle  rode up to nicholas and began talking to him  he felt flattered that  after what had happened   uncle  deigned to speak to him
toward evening ilagin took leave of nicholas  who found that they were so far from home that he accepted  uncle's  offer that the hunting party should spend the night in his little village of mikhaylovna
 and if you put up at my house that will be better still
that's it  come on   said  uncle    you see it's damp weather  and you could rest  and the little countess could be driven home in a trap    uncle's  offer was accepted
a huntsman was sent to otradnoe for a trap  while nicholas rode with natasha and petya to  uncle's  house
some five male domestic serfs  big and little  rushed out to the front porch to meet their master
a score of women serfs  old and young  as well as children  popped out from the back entrance to have a look at the hunters who were arriving
the presence of natasha a woman  a lady  and on horseback  raised the curiosity of the serfs to such a degree that many of them came up to her  stared her in the face  and unabashed by her presence made remarks about her as though she were some prodigy on show and not a human being able to hear or understand what was said about her
 arinka  look  she sits sideways  there she sits and her skirt dangles   
see  she's got a little hunting horn    goodness gracious  see her knife       isn't she a tartar    how is it you didn't go head over heels   asked the boldest of all  addressing natasha directly
 uncle  dismounted at the porch of his little wooden house which stood in the midst of an overgrown garden and  after a glance at his retainers  shouted authoritatively that the superfluous ones should take themselves off and that all necessary preparations should be made to receive the guests and the visitors the serfs all dispersed
 uncle  lifted natasha off her horse and taking her hand led her up the rickety wooden steps of the porch
the house  with its bare  unplastered log walls  was not overclean it did not seem that those living in it aimed at keeping it spotless but neither was it noticeably neglected
in the entry there was a smell of fresh apples  and wolf and fox skins hung about
 uncle  led the visitors through the anteroom into a small hall with a folding table and red chairs  then into the drawing room with a round birchwood table and a sofa  and finally into his private room where there was a tattered sofa  a worn carpet  and portraits of suvorov  of the host's father and mother  and of himself in military uniform the study smelt strongly of tobacco and dogs
 uncle  asked his visitors to sit down and make themselves at home  and then went out of the room rugay  his back still muddy  came into the room and lay down on the sofa  cleaning himself with his tongue and teeth leading from the study was a passage in which a partition with ragged curtains could be seen
from behind this came women's laughter and whispers
natasha  nicholas  and petya took off their wraps and sat down on the sofa
petya  leaning on his elbow  fell asleep at once
natasha and nicholas were silent
their faces glowed  they were hungry and very cheerful
they looked at one another  now that the hunt was over and they were in the house  nicholas no longer considered it necessary to show his manly superiority over his sister   natasha gave him a wink  and neither refrained long from bursting into a peal of ringing laughter even before they had a pretext ready to account for it
after a while  uncle  came in  in a cossack coat  blue trousers  and small top boots
and natasha felt that this costume  the very one she had regarded with surprise and amusement at otradnoe  was just the right thing and not at all worse than a swallow tail or frock coat
 uncle  too was in high spirits and far from being offended by the brother's and sister's laughter  it could never enter his head that they might be laughing at his way of life  he himself joined in the merriment  that's right  young countess  that's it  come on  i never saw anyone like her   said he  offering nicholas a pipe with a long stem and  with a practiced motion of three fingers  taking down another that had been cut short
 she's ridden all day like a man  and is as fresh as ever   soon after  uncle's  reappearance the door was opened  evidently from the sound by a barefooted girl  and a stout  rosy  good looking woman of about forty  with a double chin and full red lips  entered carrying a large loaded tray
with hospitable dignity and cordiality in her glance and in every motion  she looked at the visitors and  with a pleasant smile  bowed respectfully
in spite of her exceptional stoutness  which caused her to protrude her chest and stomach and throw back her head  this woman  who was  uncle's  housekeeper  trod very lightly
she went to the table  set down the tray  and with her plump white hands deftly took from it the bottles and various hors d'oeuvres and dishes and arranged them on the table
when she had finished  she stepped aside and stopped at the door with a smile on her face
 here i am
i am she  now do you understand 'uncle'   her expression said to rostov
how could one help understanding  not only nicholas  but even natasha understood the meaning of his puckered brow and the happy complacent smile that slightly puckered his lips when anisya fedorovna entered
on the tray was a bottle of herb wine  different kinds of vodka  pickled mushrooms  rye cakes made with buttermilk  honey in the comb  still mead and sparkling mead  apples  nuts  raw and roasted   and nut and honey sweets afterwards she brought a freshly roasted chicken  ham  preserves made with honey  and preserves made with sugar
all this was the fruit of anisya fedorovna's housekeeping  gathered and prepared by her
the smell and taste of it all had a smack of anisya fedorovna herself  a savor of juiciness  cleanliness  whiteness  and pleasant smiles
 take this  little lady countess   she kept saying  as she offered natasha first one thing and then another
natasha ate of everything and thought she had never seen or eaten such buttermilk cakes  such aromatic jam  such honey and nut sweets  or such a chicken anywhere
anisya fedorovna left the room
after supper  over their cherry brandy  rostov and  uncle  talked of past and future hunts  of rugay and ilagin's dogs  while natasha sat upright on the sofa and listened with sparkling eyes
she tried several times to wake petya that he might eat something  but he only muttered incoherent words without waking up
natasha felt so lighthearted and happy in these novel surroundings that she only feared the trap would come for her too soon
after a casual pause  such as often occurs when receiving friends for the first time in one's own house   uncle   answering a thought that was in his visitors' minds  said   this  you see  is how i am finishing my days  
death will come
that's it  come on  nothing will remain
then why harm anyone    uncle's  face was very significant and even handsome as he said this
involuntarily rostov recalled all the good he had heard about him from his father and the neighbors
throughout the whole province  uncle  had the reputation of being the most honorable and disinterested of cranks
they called him in to decide family disputes  chose him as executor  confided secrets to him  elected him to be a justice and to other posts  but he always persistently refused public appointments  passing the autumn and spring in the fields on his bay gelding  sitting at home in winter  and lying in his overgrown garden in summer
 why don't you enter the service  uncle    i did once  but gave it up
i am not fit for it
that's it  come on  i can't make head or tail of it
that's for you i haven't brains enough
now  hunting is another matter that's it  come on  open the door  there   he shouted
 why have you shut it   the door at the end of the passage led to the huntsmen's room  as they called the room for the hunt servants
there was a rapid patter of bare feet  and an unseen hand opened the door into the huntsmen's room  from which came the clear sounds of a balalayka on which someone  who was evidently a master of the art  was playing
natasha had been listening to those strains for some time and now went out into the passage to hear better
 that's mitka  my coachman   
i have got him a good balalayka
i'm fond of it   said  uncle   it was the custom for mitka to play the balalayka in the huntsmen's room when  uncle  returned from the chase
 uncle  was fond of such music
 how good  really very good   said nicholas with some unintentional superciliousness  as if ashamed to confess that the sounds pleased him very much
 very good   said natasha reproachfully  noticing her brother's tone
 not 'very good' it's simply delicious   just as  uncle's  pickled mushrooms  honey  and cherry brandy had seemed to her the best in the world  so also that song  at that moment  seemed to her the acme of musical delight  more  please  more   cried natasha at the door as soon as the balalayka ceased
mitka tuned up afresh  and recommenced thrumming the balalayka to the air of my lady  with trills and variations
 uncle  sat listening  slightly smiling  with his head on one side
the air was repeated a hundred times
the balalayka was retuned several times and the same notes were thrummed again  but the listeners did not grow weary of it and wished to hear it again and again
anisya fedorovna came in and leaned her portly person against the doorpost
 you like listening   she said to natasha  with a smile extremely like  uncle's    that's a good player of ours   she added
 he doesn't play that part right   said  uncle  suddenly  with an energetic gesture
 here he ought to burst out that's it  come on  ought to burst out    do you play then   asked natasha
 uncle  did not answer  but smiled
 anisya  go and see if the strings of my guitar are all right
i haven't touched it for a long time
that's it come on  i've given it up   anisya fedorovna  with her light step  willingly went to fulfill her errand and brought back the guitar
without looking at anyone   uncle  blew the dust off it and  tapping the case with his bony fingers  tuned the guitar and settled himself in his armchair he took the guitar a little above the fingerboard  arching his left elbow with a somewhat theatrical gesture  and  with a wink at anisya fedorovna  struck a single chord  pure and sonorous  and then quietly  smoothly  and confidently began playing in very slow time  not my lady  but the well known song  came a maiden down the street
the tune  played with precision and in exact time  began to thrill in the hearts of nicholas and natasha  arousing in them the same kind of sober mirth as radiated from anisya fedorovna's whole being
anisya fedorovna flushed  and drawing her kerchief over her face went laughing out of the room
 uncle  continued to play correctly  carefully  with energetic firmness  looking with a changed and inspired expression at the spot where anisya fedorovna had just stood
something seemed to be laughing a little on one side of his face under his gray mustaches  especially as the song grew brisker and the time quicker and when  here and there  as he ran his fingers over the strings  something seemed to snap
 lovely  lovely  go on  uncle  go on   shouted natasha as soon as he had finished
she jumped up and hugged and kissed him
 nicholas  nicholas   she said  turning to her brother  as if asking him   what is it moves me so   nicholas too was greatly pleased by  uncle's  playing  and  uncle  played the piece over again
anisya fedorovna's smiling face reappeared in the doorway and behind hers other faces  
fetching water clear and sweet  stop  dear maiden  i entreat  played  uncle  once more  running his fingers skillfully over the strings  and then he stopped short and jerked his shoulders  go on  uncle dear   natasha wailed in an imploring tone as if her life depended on it
 uncle  rose  and it was as if there were two men in him  one of them smiled seriously at the merry fellow  while the merry fellow struck a naive and precise attitude preparatory to a folk dance
 now then  niece   he exclaimed  waving to natasha the hand that had just struck a chord
natasha threw off the shawl from her shoulders  ran forward to face  uncle   and setting her arms akimbo also made a motion with her shoulders and struck an attitude where  how  and when had this young countess  educated by an emigree french governess  imbibed from the russian air she breathed that spirit and obtained that manner which the pas de chale * would  one would have supposed  long ago have effaced  but the spirit and the movements were those inimitable and unteachable russian ones that  uncle  had expected of her
as soon as she had struck her pose  and smiled triumphantly  proudly  and with sly merriment  the fear that had at first seized nicholas and the others that she might not do the right thing was at an end  and they were already admiring her
* the french shawl dance
she did the right thing with such precision  such complete precision  that anisya fedorovna  who had at once handed her the handkerchief she needed for the dance  had tears in her eyes  though she laughed as she watched this slim  graceful countess  reared in silks and velvets and so different from herself  who yet was able to understand all that was in anisya and in anisya's father and mother and aunt  and in every russian man and woman
 well  little countess  that's it come on   cried  uncle   with a joyous laugh  having finished the dance
 well done  niece  now a fine young fellow must be found as husband for you
that's it come on    he's chosen already   said nicholas smiling
 oh   said  uncle  in surprise  looking inquiringly at natasha  who nodded her head with a happy smile
 and such a one   she said
but as soon as she had said it a new train of thoughts and feelings arose in her
 what did nicholas' smile mean when he said 'chosen already'  is he glad of it or not  it is as if he thought my bolkonski would not approve of or understand our gaiety
but he would understand it all
where is he now   she thought  and her face suddenly became serious
but this lasted only a second
 don't dare to think about it   she said to herself  and sat down again smilingly beside  uncle   begging him to play something more
 uncle  played another song and a valse  then after a pause he cleared his throat and sang his favorite hunting song  as 'twas growing dark last night fell the snow so soft and light  
 uncle  sang as peasants sing  with full and naive conviction that the whole meaning of a song lies in the words and that the tune comes of itself  and that apart from the words there is no tune  which exists only to give measure to the words
as a result of this the unconsidered tune  like the song of a bird  was extraordinarily good
natasha was in ecstasies over  uncle's  singing
she resolved to give up learning the harp and to play only the guitar
she asked  uncle  for his guitar and at once found the chords of the song
after nine o'clock two traps and three mounted men  who had been sent to look for them  arrived to fetch natasha and petya the count and countess did not know where they were and were very anxious  said one of the men
petya was carried out like a log and laid in the larger of the two traps
natasha and nicholas got into the other
 uncle  wrapped natasha up warmly and took leave of her with quite a new tenderness
he accompanied them on foot as far as the bridge that could not be crossed  so that they had to go round by the ford  and he sent huntsmen to ride in front with lanterns
 good bye  dear niece   his voice called out of the darkness not the voice natasha had known previously  but the one that had sung as 'twas growing dark last night
in the village through which they passed there were red lights and a cheerful smell of smoke
 what a darling uncle is   said natasha  when they had come out onto the highroad
 yes   returned nicholas
 you're not cold    no
i'm quite  quite all right
i feel so comfortable   answered natasha  almost perplexed by her feelings
they remained silent a long while
the night was dark and damp
they could not see the horses  but only heard them splashing through the unseen mud
what was passing in that receptive childlike soul that so eagerly caught and assimilated all the diverse impressions of life  how did they all find place in her  but she was very happy
as they were nearing home she suddenly struck up the air of as 'twas growing dark last night the tune of which she had all the way been trying to get and had at last caught
 got it   said nicholas
 what were you thinking about just now  nicholas   inquired natasha
they were fond of asking one another that question
 i   said nicholas  trying to remember
 well  you see  first i thought that rugay  the red hound  was like uncle  and that if he were a man he would always keep uncle near him  if not for his riding  then for his manner
what a good fellow uncle is  don't you think so   
well  and you    i  wait a bit  wait   
yes  first i thought that we are driving along and imagining that we are going home  but that heaven knows where we are really going in the darkness  and that we shall arrive and suddenly find that we are not in otradnoe  but in fairyland
and then i thought  
no  nothing else    i know  i expect you thought of him   said nicholas  smiling as natasha knew by the sound of his voice
 no   said natasha  though she had in reality been thinking about prince andrew at the same time as of the rest  and of how he would have liked  uncle    and then i was saying to myself all the way  'how well anisya carried herself  how well '  and nicholas heard her spontaneous  happy  ringing laughter
 and do you know   she suddenly said   i know that i shall never again be as happy and tranquil as i am now    rubbish  nonsense  humbug   exclaimed nicholas  and he thought   how charming this natasha of mine is  i have no other friend like her and never shall have
why should she marry  we might always drive about together    what a darling this nicholas of mine is   thought natasha
 ah  there are still lights in the drawing room   she said  pointing to the windows of the house that gleamed invitingly in the moist velvety darkness of the night
count ilya rostov had resigned the position of marshal of the nobility because it involved him in too much expense  but still his affairs did not improve
natasha and nicholas often noticed their parents conferring together anxiously and privately and heard suggestions of selling the fine ancestral rostov house and estate near moscow
it was not necessary to entertain so freely as when the count had been marshal  and life at otradnoe was quieter than in former years  but still the enormous house and its lodges were full of people and more than twenty sat down to table every day
these were all their own people who had settled down in the house almost as members of the family  or persons who were  it seemed  obliged to live in the count's house
such were dimmler the musician and his wife  vogel the dancing master and his family  belova  an old maiden lady  an inmate of the house  and many others such as petya's tutors  the girls' former governess  and other people who simply found it preferable and more advantageous to live in the count's house than at home
they had not as many visitors as before  but the old habits of life without which the count and countess could not conceive of existence remained unchanged
there was still the hunting establishment which nicholas had even enlarged  the same fifty horses and fifteen grooms in the stables  the same expensive presents and dinner parties to the whole district on name days  there were still the count's games of whist and boston  at which  spreading out his cards so that everybody could see them he let himself be plundered of hundreds of rubles every day by his neighbors  who looked upon an opportunity to play a rubber with count rostov as a most profitable source of income the count moved in his affairs as in a huge net  trying not to believe that he was entangled but becoming more and more so at every step  and feeling too feeble to break the meshes or to set to work carefully and patiently to disentangle them
the countess  with her loving heart  felt that her children were being ruined  that it was not the count's fault for he could not help being what he was that  though he tried to hide it  he himself suffered from the consciousness of his own and his children's ruin  and she tried to find means of remedying the position from her feminine point of view she could see only one solution  namely  for nicholas to marry a rich heiress
she felt this to be their last hope and that if nicholas refused the match she had found for him  she would have to abandon the hope of ever getting matters right
this match was with julie karagina  the daughter of excellent and virtuous parents  a girl the rostovs had known from childhood  and who had now become a wealthy heiress through the death of the last of her brothers
the countess had written direct to julie's mother in moscow suggesting a marriage between their children and had received a favorable answer from her
karagina had replied that for her part she was agreeable  and everything depend on her daughter's inclination
she invited nicholas to come to moscow
several times the countess  with tears in her eyes  told her son that now both her daughters were settled  her only wish was to see him married
she said she could lie down in her grave peacefully if that were accomplished
then she told him that she knew of a splendid girl and tried to discover what he thought about marriage
at other times she praised julie to him and advised him to go to moscow during the holidays to amuse himself nicholas guessed what his mother's remarks were leading to and during one of these conversations induced her to speak quite frankly
she told him that her only hope of getting their affairs disentangled now lay in his marrying julie karagina
 but  mamma  suppose i loved a girl who has no fortune  would you expect me to sacrifice my feelings and my honor for the sake of money   he asked his mother  not realizing the cruelty of his question and only wishing to show his noble mindedness
 no  you have not understood me   said his mother  not knowing how to justify herself
 you have not understood me  nikolenka
it is your happiness i wish for   she added  feeling that she was telling an untruth and was becoming entangled
she began to cry
 mamma  don't cry  only tell me that you wish it  and you know i will give my life  anything  to put you at ease   said nicholas
 i would sacrifice anything for you even my feelings   but the countess did not want the question put like that  she did not want a sacrifice from her son  she herself wished to make a sacrifice for him
 no  you have not understood me  don't let us talk about it   she replied  wiping away her tears
 maybe i do love a poor girl   said nicholas to himself  am i to sacrifice my feelings and my honor for money  i wonder how mamma could speak so to me
because sonya is poor i must not love her   he thought   must not respond to her faithful  devoted love  yet i should certainly be happier with her than with some doll like julie
i can always sacrifice my feelings for my family's welfare   he said to himself   but i can't coerce my feelings if i love sonya  that feeling is for me stronger and higher than all else   nicholas did not go to moscow  and the countess did not renew the conversation with him about marriage
she saw with sorrow  and sometimes with exasperation  symptoms of a growing attachment between her son and the portionless sonya though she blamed herself for it  she could not refrain from grumbling at and worrying sonya  often pulling her up without reason  addressing her stiffly as  my dear   and using the formal  you  instead of the intimate  thou  in speaking to her
the kindhearted countess was the more vexed with sonya because that poor  dark eyed niece of hers was so meek  so kind  so devotedly grateful to her benefactors  and so faithfully  unchangingly  and unselfishly in love with nicholas  that there were no grounds for finding fault with her
nicholas was spending the last of his leave at home
a fourth letter had come from prince andrew  from rome  in which he wrote that he would have been on his way back to russia long ago had not his wound unexpectedly reopened in the warm climate  which obliged him to defer his return till the beginning of the new year
natasha was still as much in love with her betrothed  found the same comfort in that love  and was still as ready to throw herself into all the pleasures of life as before  but at the end of the fourth month of their separation she began to have fits of depression which she could not master
she felt sorry for herself  sorry that she was being wasted all this time and of no use to anyone while she felt herself so capable of loving and being loved
things were not cheerful in the rostovs' home
christmas came and except for the ceremonial mass  the solemn and wearisome christmas congratulations from neighbors and servants  and the new dresses everyone put on  there were no special festivities  though the calm frost of twenty degrees reaumur  the dazzling sunshine by day  and the starlight of the winter nights seemed to call for some special celebration of the season
on the third day of christmas week  after the midday dinner  all the inmates of the house dispersed to various rooms it was the dullest time of the day
nicholas  who had been visiting some neighbors that morning  was asleep on the sitting room sofa
the old count was resting in his study
sonya sat in the drawing room at the round table  copying a design for embroidery
the countess was playing patience
nastasya ivanovna the buffoon sat with a sad face at the window with two old ladies
natasha came into the room  went up to sonya  glanced at what she was doing  and then went up to her mother and stood without speaking
 why are you wandering about like an outcast   asked her mother
 what do you want    him  
i want him  
now  this minute  i want him   said natasha  with glittering eyes and no sign of a smile
the countess lifted her head and looked attentively at her daughter
 don't look at me  mamma  don't look  i shall cry directly    sit down with me a little   said the countess
 mamma  i want him
why should i be wasted like this  mamma   her voice broke  tears gushed from her eyes  and she turned quickly to hide them and left the room
she passed into the sitting room  stood there thinking awhile  and then went into the maids' room
there an old maidservant was grumbling at a young girl who stood panting  having just run in through the cold from the serfs' quarters
 stop playing there's a time for everything   said the old woman
 let her alone  kondratevna   said natasha
 go  mavrushka  go   having released mavrushka  natasha crossed the dancing hall and went to the vestibule
there an old footman and two young ones were playing cards
they broke off and rose as she entered
 what can i do with them   thought natasha
 oh  nikita  please go  
where can i send him   
yes  go to the yard and fetch a fowl  please  a cock  and you  misha  bring me some oats    just a few oats   said misha  cheerfully and readily  go  go quickly   the old man urged him
 and you  theodore  get me a piece of chalk   on her way past the butler's pantry she told them to set a samovar  though it was not at all the time for tea
foka  the butler  was the most ill tempered person in the house
natasha liked to test her power over him
he distrusted the order and asked whether the samovar was really wanted
 oh dear  what a young lady   said foka  pretending to frown at natasha
no one in the house sent people about or gave them as much trouble as natasha did
she could not see people unconcernedly  but had to send them on some errand
she seemed to be trying whether any of them would get angry or sulky with her  but the serfs fulfilled no one's orders so readily as they did hers
 what can i do  where can i go   thought she  as she went slowly along the passage
 nastasya ivanovna  what sort of children shall i have   she asked the buffoon  who was coming toward her in a woman's jacket
 why  fleas  crickets  grasshoppers   answered the buffoon
 o lord  o lord  it's always the same  oh  where am i to go  what am i to do with myself   and tapping with her heels  she ran quickly upstairs to see vogel and his wife who lived on the upper story
two governesses were sitting with the vogels at a table  on which were plates of raisins  walnuts  and almonds
the governesses were discussing whether it was cheaper to live in moscow or odessa
natasha sat down  listened to their talk with a serious and thoughtful air  and then got up again
 the island of madagascar   she said   ma da gas car   she repeated  articulating each syllable distinctly  and  not replying to madame schoss who asked her what she was saying  she went out of the room
her brother petya was upstairs too  with the man in attendance on him he was preparing fireworks to let off that night
 petya  petya   she called to him
 carry me downstairs   petya ran up and offered her his back
she jumped on it  putting her arms round his neck  and he pranced along with her  no  don't  
the island of madagascar   she said  and jumping off his back she went downstairs
having as it were reviewed her kingdom  tested her power  and made sure that everyone was submissive  but that all the same it was dull  natasha betook herself to the ballroom  picked up her guitar  sat down in a dark corner behind out a passage she recalled from an opera she had heard in petersburg with prince andrew
what she drew from the guitar would have had no meaning for other listeners  but in her imagination a whole series of reminiscences streak of light escaping from the pantry door and listened to herself and pondered
she was in a mood for brooding on the past
sonya passed to the pantry with a glass in her hand
natasha glanced at her and at the crack in the pantry door  and it seemed to her that she remembered the light falling through that crack once before and sonya passing with a glass in her hand
 yes it was exactly the same   thought natasha
 sonya  what is this   she cried  twanging a thick string
 oh  you are there   said sonya with a start  and came near and listened
 i don't know
a storm   she ventured timidly  afraid of being wrong
 there  that's just how she started and just how she came up smiling timidly when all this happened before   thought natasha   and in just the same way i thought there was something lacking in her    no  it's the chorus from the water carrier  listen   and natasha sang the air of the chorus so that sonya should catch it
 where were you going   she asked
 to change the water in this glass
i am just finishing the design    you always find something to do  but i can't   said natasha
 and where's nicholas    asleep  i think    sonya  go and wake him   said natasha
 tell him i want him to come and sing   she sat awhile  wondering what the meaning of it all having happened before could be  and without solving this problem  or at all regretting not having done so  she again passed in fancy to the time when she was with him and he was looking at her with a lover's eyes
 oh  if only he would come quicker  i am so afraid it will never be  and  worst of all  i am growing old that's the thing  there won't then be in me what there is now
but perhaps he'll come today  will come immediately
perhaps he has come and is sitting in the drawing room
perhaps he came yesterday and i have forgotten it   she rose  put down the guitar  and went to the drawing room
all the domestic circle  tutors  governesses  and guests  were already at the tea table
the servants stood round the table but prince andrew was not there and life was going on as before
 ah  here she is   said the old count  when he saw natasha enter
 well  sit down by me   but natasha stayed by her mother and glanced round as if looking for something
 mamma   she muttered   give him to me  give him  mamma  quickly  quickly   and she again had difficulty in repressing her sobs
she sat down at the table and listened to the conversation between the elders and nicholas  who had also come to the table
 my god  my god  the same faces  the same talk  papa holding his cup and blowing in the same way   thought natasha  feeling with horror a sense of repulsion rising up in her for the whole household  because they were always the same
after tea  nicholas  sonya  and natasha went to the sitting room  to their favorite corner where their most intimate talks always began
 does it ever happen to you   said natasha to her brother  when they settled down in the sitting room   does it ever happen to you to feel as if there were nothing more to come nothing  that everything good is past  and to feel not exactly dull  but sad    i should think so   he replied
 i have felt like that when everything was all right and everyone was cheerful
the thought has come into my mind that i was already tired of it all  and that we must all die
once in the regiment i had not gone to some merrymaking where there was music  
and suddenly i felt so depressed      oh yes  i know  i know  i know   natasha interrupted him
 when i was quite little that used to be so with me
do you remember when i was punished once about some plums  you were all dancing  and i sat sobbing in the schoolroom  i shall never forget it  i felt sad and sorry for everyone  for myself  and for everyone and i was innocent that was the chief thing   said natasha
 do you remember    i remember   answered nicholas
 i remember that i came to you afterwards and wanted to comfort you  but do you know  i felt ashamed to
we were terribly absurd
i had a funny doll then and wanted to give it to you
do you remember    and do you remember   natasha asked with a pensive smile   how once  long  long ago  when we were quite little  uncle called us into the study that was in the old house and it was dark we went in and suddenly there stood      a negro   chimed in nicholas with a smile of delight
 of course i remember
even now i don't know whether there really was a negro  or if we only dreamed it or were told about him    he was gray  you remember  and had white teeth  and stood and looked at us      sonya  do you remember   asked nicholas
 yes  yes  i do remember something too   sonya answered timidly
 you know i have asked papa and mamma about that negro   said natasha   and they say there was no negro at all
but you see  you remember    of course i do  i remember his teeth as if i had just seen them    how strange it is  it's as if it were a dream  i like that    and do you remember how we rolled hard boiled eggs in the ballroom  and suddenly two old women began spinning round on the carpet  was that real or not  do you remember what fun it was    yes  and you remember how papa in his blue overcoat fired a gun in the porch   so they went through their memories  smiling with pleasure  not the sad memories of old age  but poetic  youthful ones those impressions of one's most distant past in which dreams and realities blend and they laughed with quiet enjoyment sonya  as always  did not quite keep pace with them  though they shared the same reminiscences
much that they remembered had slipped from her mind  and what she recalled did not arouse the same poetic feeling as they experienced
she simply enjoyed their pleasure and tried to fit in with it
she only really took part when they recalled sonya's first arrival
she told them how afraid she had been of nicholas because he had on a corded jacket and her nurse had told her that she  too  would be sewn up with cords
 and i remember their telling me that you had been born under a cabbage   said natasha   and i remember that i dared not disbelieve it then  but knew that it was not true  and i felt so uncomfortable   while they were talking a maid thrust her head in at the other door of the sitting room
 they have brought the cock  miss   she said in a whisper
 it isn't wanted  petya
tell them to take it away   replied natasha
in the middle of their talk in the sitting room  dimmler came in and went up to the harp that stood there in a corner
he took off its cloth covering  and the harp gave out a jarring sound
 mr dimmler  please play my favorite nocturne by field   came the old countess' voice from the drawing room
dimmler struck a chord and  turning to natasha  nicholas  and sonya  remarked   how quiet you young people are    yes  we're philosophizing   said natasha  glancing round for a moment and then continuing the conversation
they were now discussing dreams dimmler began to play  natasha went on tiptoe noiselessly to the table  took up a candle  carried it out  and returned  seating herself quietly in her former place
it was dark in the room especially where they were sitting on the sofa  but through the big windows the silvery light of the full moon fell on the floor
dimmler had finished the piece but still sat softly running his fingers over the strings  evidently uncertain whether to stop or to play something else
 do you know   said natasha in a whisper  moving closer to nicholas and sonya   that when one goes on and on recalling memories  one at last begins to remember what happened before one was in the world      that is metempsychosis   said sonya  who had always learned well  and remembered everything
 the egyptians believed that our souls have lived in animals  and will go back into animals again    no  i don't believe we ever were in animals   said natasha  still in a whisper though the music had ceased
 but i am certain that we were angels somewhere there  and have been here  and that is why we remember       may i join you   said dimmler who had come up quietly  and he sat down by them
 if we have been angels  why have we fallen lower   said nicholas
 no  that can't be    not lower  who said we were lower   
how do i know what i was before   natasha rejoined with conviction
 the soul is immortal well then  if i shall always live i must have lived before  lived for a whole eternity    yes  but it is hard for us to imagine eternity   remarked dimmler  who had joined the young folk with a mildly condescending smile but now spoke as quietly and seriously as they
 why is it hard to imagine eternity   said natasha
 it is now today  and it will be tomorrow  and always  and there was yesterday  and the day before      natasha  now it's your turn
sing me something   they heard the countess say
 why are you sitting there like conspirators    mamma  i don't at all want to   replied natasha  but all the same she rose
none of them  not even the middle aged dimmler  wanted to break off their conversation and quit that corner in the sitting room  but natasha got up and nicholas sat down at the clavichord
standing as usual in the middle of the hall and choosing the place where the resonance was best  natasha began to sing her mother's favorite song
she had said she did not want to sing  but it was long since she had sung  and long before she again sang  as she did that evening
the count  from his study where he was talking to mitenka  heard her and  like a schoolboy in a hurry to run out to play  blundered in his talk while giving orders to the steward  and at last stopped  while mitenka stood in front of him also listening and smiling
nicholas did not take his eyes off his sister and drew breath in time with her
sonya  as she listened  thought of the immense difference there was between herself and her friend  and how impossible it was for her to be anything like as bewitching as her cousin
the old countess sat with a blissful yet sad smile and with tears in her eyes  occasionally shaking her head
she thought of natasha and of her own youth  and of how there was something unnatural and dreadful in this impending marriage of natasha and prince andrew
dimmler  who had seated himself beside the countess  listened with closed eyes  ah  countess   he said at last   that's a european talent  she has nothing to learn what softness  tenderness  and strength       ah  how afraid i am for her  how afraid i am   said the countess  not realizing to whom she was speaking
her maternal instinct told her that natasha had too much of something  and that because of this she would not be happy
before natasha had finished singing  fourteen year old petya rushed in delightedly  to say that some mummers had arrived
natasha stopped abruptly
 idiot   she screamed at her brother and  running to a chair  threw herself on it  sobbing so violently that she could not stop for a long time
 it's nothing  mamma  really it's nothing  only petya startled me   she said  trying to smile  but her tears still flowed and sobs still choked her
the mummers  some of the house serfs  dressed up as bears  turks  innkeepers  and ladies frightening and funny bringing in with them the cold from outside and a feeling of gaiety  crowded  at first timidly  into the anteroom  then hiding behind one another they pushed into the ballroom where  shyly at first and then more and more merrily and heartily  they started singing  dancing  and playing christmas games
the countess  when she had identified them and laughed at their costumes  went into the drawing room
the count sat in the ballroom  smiling radiantly and applauding the players
the young people had disappeared
half an hour later there appeared among the other mummers in the ballroom an old lady in a hooped skirt this was nicholas
a turkish girl was petya
a clown was dimmler
an hussar was natasha  and a circassian was sonya with burnt cork mustache and eyebrows
after the condescending surprise  nonrecognition  and praise  from those who were not themselves dressed up  the young people decided that their costumes were so good that they ought to be shown elsewhere nicholas  who  as the roads were in splendid condition  wanted to take them all for a drive in his troyka  proposed to take with them about a dozen of the serf mummers and drive to  uncle's    no  why disturb the old fellow   said the countess
 besides  you wouldn't have room to turn round there
if you must go  go to the melyukovs'   melyukova was a widow  who  with her family and their tutors and governesses  lived three miles from the rostovs
 that's right  my dear   chimed in the old count  thoroughly aroused
 i'll dress up at once and go with them
i'll make pashette open her eyes   but the countess would not agree to his going  he had had a bad leg all these last days
it was decided that the count must not go  but that if louisa ivanovna  madame schoss  would go with them  the young ladies might go to the melyukovs'  sonya  generally so timid and shy  more urgently than anyone begging louisa ivanovna not to refuse
sonya's costume was the best of all
her mustache and eyebrows were extraordinarily becoming
everyone told her she looked very handsome  and she was in a spirited and energetic mood unusual with her
some inner voice told her that now or never her fate would be decided  and in her male attire she seemed quite a different person
louisa ivanovna consented to go  and in half an hour four troyka sleighs with large and small bells  their runners squeaking and whistling over the frozen snow  drove up to the porch
natasha was foremost in setting a merry holiday tone  which  passing from one to another  grew stronger and reached its climax when they all came out into the frost and got into the sleighs  talking  calling to one another  laughing  and shouting
two of the troykas were the usual household sleighs  the third was the old count's with a trotter from the orlov stud as shaft horse  the fourth was nicholas' own with a short shaggy black shaft horse
nicholas  in his old lady's dress over which he had belted his hussar overcoat  stood in the middle of the sleigh  reins in hand
it was so light that he could see the moonlight reflected from the metal harness disks and from the eyes of the horses  who looked round in alarm at the noisy party under the shadow of the porch roof
natasha  sonya  madame schoss  and two maids got into nicholas' sleigh  dimmler  his wife  and petya  into the old count's  and the rest of the mummers seated themselves in the other two sleighs  you go ahead  zakhar   shouted nicholas to his father's coachman  wishing for a chance to race past him
the old count's troyka  with dimmler and his party  started forward  squeaking on its runners as though freezing to the snow  its deep toned bell clanging
the side horses  pressing against the shafts of the middle horse  sank in the snow  which was dry and glittered like sugar  and threw it up
nicholas set off  following the first sleigh  behind him the others moved noisily  their runners squeaking
at first they drove at a steady trot along the narrow road
while they drove past the garden the shadows of the bare trees often fell across the road and hid the brilliant moonlight  but as soon as they were past the fence  the snowy plain bathed in moonlight and motionless spread out before them glittering like diamonds and dappled with bluish shadows
bang  bang  went the first sleigh over a cradle hole in the snow of the road  and each of the other sleighs jolted in the same way  and rudely breaking the frost bound stillness  the troykas began to speed along the road  one after the other
 a hare's track  a lot of tracks   rang out natasha's voice through the frostbound air
 how light it is  nicholas   came sonya's voice
nicholas glanced round at sonya  and bent down to see her face closer
quite a new  sweet face with black eyebrows and mustaches peeped up at him from her sable furs so close and yet so distant in the moonlight
 that used to be sonya   thought he  and looked at her closer and smiled
 what is it  nicholas    nothing   said he and turned again to the horses
when they came out onto the beaten highroad polished by sleigh runners and cut up by rough shod hoofs  the marks of which were visible in the moonlight the horses began to tug at the reins of their own accord and increased their pace
the near side horse  arching his head and breaking into a short canter  tugged at his traces
the shaft horse swayed from side to side  moving his ears as if asking   isn't it time to begin now   in front  already far ahead the deep bell of the sleigh ringing farther and farther off  the black horses driven by zakhar could be clearly seen against the white snow
from that sleigh one could hear the shouts  laughter  and voices of the mummers
 gee up  my darlings   shouted nicholas  pulling the reins to one side and flourishing the whip
it was only by the keener wind that met them and the jerks given by the side horses who pulled harder ever increasing their gallop that one noticed how fast the troyka was flying
nicholas looked back
with screams squeals  and waving of whips that caused even the shaft horses to gallop the other sleighs followed the shaft horse swung steadily beneath the bow over its head  with no thought of slackening pace and ready to put on speed when required
nicholas overtook the first sleigh
they were driving downhill and coming out upon a broad trodden track across a meadow  near a river
 where are we   thought he
 it's the kosoy meadow  i suppose
but no this is something new i've never seen before
this isn't the kosoy meadow nor the demkin hill  and heaven only knows what it is  it is something new and enchanted
well  whatever it may be     and shouting to his horses  he began to pass the first sleigh
zakhar held back his horses and turned his face  which was already covered with hoarfrost to his eyebrows
nicholas gave the horses the rein  and zakhar  stretching out his arms  clucked his tongue and let his horses go  now  look out  master   he cried faster still the two troykas flew side by side  and faster moved the feet of the galloping side horses
nicholas began to draw ahead
zakhar  while still keeping his arms extended  raised one hand with the reins  no you won't  master   he shouted
nicholas put all his horses to a gallop and passed zakhar
the horses showered the fine dry snow on the faces of those in the sleigh beside them sounded quick ringing bells and they caught confused glimpses of swiftly moving legs and the shadows of the troyka they were passing
the whistling sound of the runners on the snow and the voices of girls shrieking were heard from different sides
again checking his horses  nicholas looked around him
they were still surrounded by the magic plain bathed in moonlight and spangled with stars
 zakhar is shouting that i should turn to the left  but why to the left   thought nicholas
 are we getting to the melyukovs'  is this melyukovka  heaven only knows where we are going  and heaven knows what is happening to us  but it is very strange and pleasant whatever it is   and he looked round in the sleigh
 look  his mustache and eyelashes are all white   said one of the strange  pretty  unfamiliar people the one with fine eyebrows and mustache
 i think this used to be natasha   thought nicholas   and that was madame schoss  but perhaps it's not  and this circassian with the mustache i don't know  but i love her    aren't you cold   he asked
they did not answer but began to laugh
dimmler from the sleigh behind shouted something probably something funny but they could not make out what he said
 yes  yes   some voices answered  laughing
 but here was a fairy forest with black moving shadows  and a glitter of diamonds and a flight of marble steps and the silver roofs of fairy buildings and the shrill yells of some animals
and if this is really melyukovka  it is still stranger that we drove heaven knows where and have come to melyukovka   thought nicholas
it really was melyukovka  and maids and footmen with merry faces came running  out to the porch carrying candles
 who is it   asked someone in the porch
 the mummers from the count's
i know by the horses   replied some voices
pelageya danilovna melyukova  a broadly built  energetic woman wearing spectacles  sat in the drawing room in a loose dress  surrounded by her daughters whom she was trying to keep from feeling dull
they were quietly dropping melted wax into snow and looking at the shadows the wax figures would throw on the wall  when they heard the steps and voices of new arrivals in the vestibule
hussars  ladies  witches  clowns  and bears  after clearing their throats and wiping the hoarfrost from their faces in the vestibule  came into the ballroom where candles were hurriedly lighted
the clown dimmler and the lady  nicholas started a dance
surrounded by the screaming children the mummers  covering their faces and disguising their voices  bowed to their hostess and arranged themselves about the room  dear me  there's no recognizing them  and natasha  see whom she looks like  she really reminds me of somebody
but herr dimmler isn't he good  i didn't know him  and how he dances
dear me  there's a circassian
really  how becoming it is to dear sonya
and who is that  well  you have cheered us up  nikita and vanya clear away the tables  and we were sitting so quietly
ha  ha  ha   
the hussar  the hussar  just like a boy  and the legs   
i can't look at him     different voices were saying
natasha  the young melyukovs' favorite  disappeared with them into the back rooms where a cork and various dressing gowns and male garments were called for and received from the footman by bare girlish arms from behind the door ten minutes later  all the young melyukovs joined the mummers
pelageya danilovna  having given orders to clear the rooms for the visitors and arranged about refreshments for the gentry and the serfs  went about among the mummers without removing her spectacles  peering into their faces with a suppressed smile and failing to recognize any of them it was not merely dimmler and the rostovs she failed to recognize  she did not even recognize her own daughters  or her late husband's  dressing gowns and uniforms  which they had put on  and who is this   she asked her governess  peering into the face of her own daughter dressed up as a kazan tartar
 i suppose it is one of the rostovs  well  mr hussar  and what regiment do you serve in   she asked natasha
 here  hand some fruit jelly to the turk   she ordered the butler who was handing things round
 that's not forbidden by his law   sometimes  as she looked at the strange but amusing capers cut by the dancers  who having decided once for all that being disguised  no one would recognize them were not at all shy  pelageya danilovna hid her face in her handkerchief  and her whole stout body shook with irrepressible  kindly  elderly laughter
 my little sasha  look at sasha   she said
after russian country dances and chorus dances  pelageya danilovna made the serfs and gentry join in one large circle  a ring  a string  and a silver ruble were fetched and they all played games together in an hour  all the costumes were crumpled and disordered
the corked eyebrows and mustaches were smeared over the perspiring  flushed  and merry faces
pelageya danilovna began to recognize the mummers  admired their cleverly contrived costumes  and particularly how they suited the young ladies  and she thanked them all for having entertained her so well
the visitors were invited to supper in the drawing room  and the serfs had something served to them in the ballroom
 now to tell one's fortune in the empty bathhouse is frightening   said an old maid who lived with the melyukovs  during supper
 why   said the eldest melyukov girl
 you wouldn't go  it takes courage      i'll go   said sonya
 tell what happened to the young lady   said the second melyukov girl
 well   began the old maid   a young lady once went out  took a cock  laid the table for two  all properly  and sat down
after sitting a while  she suddenly hears someone coming  
a sleigh drives up with harness bells  she hears him coming  he comes in  just in the shape of a man  like an officer comes in and sits down to table with her    ah  ah   screamed natasha  rolling her eyes with horror
 yes  and how  
did he speak    yes  like a man
everything quite all right  and he began persuading her  and she should have kept him talking till cockcrow  but she got frightened  just got frightened and hid her face in her hands
then he caught her up
it was lucky the maids ran in just then      now  why frighten them   said pelageya danilovna
 mamma  you used to try your fate yourself     said her daughter
 and how does one do it in a barn   inquired sonya
 well  say you went to the barn now  and listened
it depends on what you hear  hammering and knocking that's bad  but a sound of shifting grain is good and one sometimes hears that  too    mamma  tell us what happened to you in the barn   pelageya danilovna smiled
 oh  i've forgotten     she replied
 but none of you would go    yes  i will  pelageya danilovna  let me  i'll go   said sonya
 well  why not  if you're not afraid    louisa ivanovna  may i   asked sonya
whether they were playing the ring and string game or the ruble game or talking as now  nicholas did not leave sonya's side  and gazed at her with quite new eyes
it seemed to him that it was only today  thanks to that burntcork mustache  that he had fully learned to know her
and really  that evening  sonya was brighter  more animated  and prettier than nicholas had ever seen her before
 so that's what she is like  what a fool i have been   he thought gazing at her sparkling eyes  and under the mustache a happy rapturous smile dimpled her cheeks  a smile he had never seen before
 i'm not afraid of anything   said sonya
 may i go at once   she got up
they told her where the barn was and how she should stand and listen  and they handed her a fur cloak
she threw this over her head and shoulders and glanced at nicholas
 what a darling that girl is   thought he
 and what have i been thinking of till now   sonya went out into the passage to go to the barn
nicholas went hastily to the front porch  saying he felt too hot
the crowd of people really had made the house stuffy
outside  there was the same cold stillness and the same moon  but even brighter than before
the light was so strong and the snow sparkled with so many stars that one did not wish to look up at the sky and the real stars were unnoticed
the sky was black and dreary  while the earth was gay
 i am a fool  a fool  what have i been waiting for   thought nicholas  and running out from the porch he went round the corner of the house and along the path that led to the back porch
he knew sonya would pass that way
halfway lay some snow covered piles of firewood and across and along them a network of shadows from the bare old lime trees fell on the snow and on the path
this path led to the barn
the log walls of the barn and its snow covered roof  that looked as if hewn out of some precious stone  sparkled in the moonlight
a tree in the garden snapped with the frost  and then all was again perfectly silent
his bosom seemed to inhale not air but the strength of eternal youth and gladness
from the back porch came the sound of feet descending the steps  the bottom step upon which snow had fallen gave a ringing creak and he heard the voice of an old maidservant saying   straight  straight  along the path  miss
only  don't look back    i am not afraid   answered sonya's voice  and along the path toward nicholas came the crunching  whistling sound of sonya's feet in her thin shoes
sonya came along  wrapped in her cloak
she was only a couple of paces away when she saw him  and to her too he was not the nicholas she had known and always slightly feared
he was in a woman's dress  with tousled hair and a happy smile new to sonya
she ran rapidly toward him
 quite different and yet the same   thought nicholas  looking at her face all lit up by the moonlight
he slipped his arms under the cloak that covered her head  embraced her  pressed her to him  and kissed her on the lips that wore a mustache and had a smell of burnt cork sonya kissed him full on the lips  and disengaging her little hands pressed them to his cheeks
 sonya   
nicholas    
was all they said
they ran to the barn and then back again  re entering  he by the front and she by the back porch
when they all drove back from pelageya danilovna's  natasha  who always saw and noticed everything  arranged that she and madame schoss should go back in the sleigh with dimmler  and sonya with nicholas and the maids
on the way back nicholas drove at a steady pace instead of racing and kept peering by that fantastic all transforming light into sonya's face and searching beneath the eyebrows and mustache for his former and his present sonya from whom he had resolved never to be parted again
he looked and recognizing in her both the old and the new sonya  and being reminded by the smell of burnt cork of the sensation of her kiss  inhaled the frosty air with a full breast and  looking at the ground flying beneath him and at the sparkling sky  felt himself again in fairyland  sonya  is it well with thee   he asked from time to time
 yes   she replied
 and with thee   when halfway home nicholas handed the reins to the coachman and ran for a moment to natasha's sleigh and stood on its wing
 natasha   he whispered in french   do you know i have made up my mind about sonya    have you told her   asked natasha  suddenly beaming all over with joy
 oh  how strange you are with that mustache and those eyebrows   
natasha  are you glad    i am so glad  so glad  i was beginning to be vexed with you
i did not tell you  but you have been treating her badly
what a heart she has  nicholas  i am horrid sometimes  but i was ashamed to be happy while sonya was not   continued natasha
 now i am so glad  well  run back to her    no  wait a bit   
oh  how funny you look   cried nicholas  peering into her face and finding in his sister too something new  unusual  and bewitchingly tender that he had not seen in her before
 natasha  it's magical  isn't it    yes   she replied
 you have done splendidly    had i seen her before as she is now   thought nicholas   i should long ago have asked her what to do and have done whatever she told me  and all would have been well    so you are glad and i have done right    oh  quite right  i had a quarrel with mamma some time ago about it
mamma said she was angling for you
how could she say such a thing  i nearly stormed at mamma
i will never let anyone say anything bad of sonya  for there is nothing but good in her    then it's all right   said nicholas  again scrutinizing the expression of his sister's face to see if she was in earnest
then he jumped down and  his boots scrunching the snow  ran back to his sleigh
the same happy  smiling circassian  with mustache and beaming eyes looking up from under a sable hood  was still sitting there  and that circassian was sonya  and that sonya was certainly his future happy and loving wife
when they reached home and had told their mother how they had spent the evening at the melyukovs'  the girls went to their bedroom
when they had undressed  but without washing off the cork mustaches  they sat a long time talking of their happiness
they talked of how they would live when they were married  how their husbands would be friends  and how happy they would be
on natasha's table stood two looking glasses which dunyasha had prepared beforehand
 only when will all that be  i am afraid never   
it would be too good   said natasha  rising and going to the looking glasses
 sit down  natasha  perhaps you'll see him   said sonya
natasha lit the candles  one on each side of one of the looking glasses  and sat down
 i see someone with a mustache   said natasha  seeing her own face
 you mustn't laugh  miss   said dunyasha
with sonya's help and the maid's  natasha got the glass she held into the right position opposite the other  her face assumed a serious expression and she sat silent
she sat a long time looking at the receding line of candles reflected in the glasses and expecting  from tales she had heard  to see a coffin  or him  prince andrew  in that last dim  indistinctly outlined square
but ready as she was to take the smallest speck for the image of a man or of a coffin  she saw nothing
she began blinking rapidly and moved away from the looking glasses
 why is it others see things and i don't   she said
 you sit down now  sonya
you absolutely must  tonight  do it for me   
today i feel so frightened   sonya sat down before the glasses  got the right position  and began looking
 now  miss sonya is sure to see something   whispered dunyasha   while you do nothing but laugh   sonya heard this and natasha's whisper   i know she will
she saw something last year   for about three minutes all were silent
 of course she will   whispered natasha  but did not finish  
suddenly sonya pushed away the glass she was holding and covered her eyes with her hand
 oh  natasha   she cried
 did you see  did you  what was it   exclaimed natasha  holding up the looking glass
sonya had not seen anything  she was just wanting to blink and to get up when she heard natasha say   of course she will   she did not wish to disappoint either dunyasha or natasha  but it was hard to sit still
she did not herself know how or why the exclamation escaped her when she covered her eyes
 you saw him   urged natasha  seizing her hand
 yes
wait a bit  
i  
saw him   sonya could not help saying  not yet knowing whom natasha meant by him  nicholas or prince andrew
 but why shouldn't i say i saw something  others do see  besides who can tell whether i saw anything or not   flashed through sonya's mind
 yes  i saw him   she said
 how  standing or lying    no  i saw  
at first there was nothing  then i saw him lying down    andrew lying  is he ill   asked natasha  her frightened eyes fixed on her friend
 no  on the contrary  on the contrary  his face was cheerful  and he turned to me   and when saying this she herself fancied she had really seen what she described
 well  and then  sonya       after that  i could not make out what there was  something blue and red      sonya  when will he come back  when shall i see him  o  god  how afraid i am for him and for myself and about everything      natasha began  and without replying to sonya's words of comfort she got into bed  and long after her candle was out lay open eyed and motionless  gazing at the moonlight through the frosty windowpanes
soon after the christmas holidays nicholas told his mother of his love for sonya and of his firm resolve to marry her
the countess  who had long noticed what was going on between them and was expecting this declaration  listened to him in silence and then told her son that he might marry whom he pleased  but that neither she nor his father would give their blessing to such a marriage
nicholas  for the first time  felt that his mother was displeased with him and that  despite her love for him  she would not give way
coldly  without looking at her son  she sent for her husband and  when he came  tried briefly and coldly to inform him of the facts  in her son's presence  but unable to restrain herself she burst into tears of vexation and left the room
the old count began irresolutely to admonish nicholas and beg him to abandon his purpose
nicholas replied that he could not go back on his word  and his father  sighing and evidently disconcerted  very soon became silent and went in to the countess
in all his encounters with his son  the count was always conscious of his own guilt toward him for having wasted the family fortune  and so he could not be angry with him for refusing to marry an heiress and choosing the dowerless sonya
on this occasion  he was only more vividly conscious of the fact that if his affairs had not been in disorder  no better wife for nicholas than sonya could have been wished for  and that no one but himself with his mitenka and his uncomfortable habits was to blame for the condition of the family finances the father and mother did not speak of the matter to their son again  but a few days later the countess sent for sonya and  with a cruelty neither of them expected  reproached her niece for trying to catch nicholas and for ingratitude
sonya listened silently with downcast eyes to the countess' cruel words  without understanding what was required of her
she was ready to sacrifice everything for her benefactors
self sacrifice was her most cherished idea but in this case she could not see what she ought to sacrifice  or for whom
she could not help loving the countess and the whole rostov family  but neither could she help loving nicholas and knowing that his happiness depended on that love
she was silent and sad and did not reply
nicholas felt the situation to be intolerable and went to have an explanation with his mother
he first implored her to forgive him and sonya and consent to their marriage  then he threatened that if she molested sonya he would at once marry her secretly
the countess  with a coldness her son had never seen in her before  replied that he was of age  that prince andrew was marrying without his father's consent  and he could do the same  but that she would never receive that intriguer as her daughter
exploding at the word intriguer  nicholas  raising his voice  told his mother he had never expected her to try to force him to sell his feelings  but if that were so  he would say for the last time   
but he had no time to utter the decisive word which the expression of his face caused his mother to await with terror  and which would perhaps have forever remained a cruel memory to them both
he had not time to say it  for natasha  with a pale and set face  entered the room from the door at which she had been listening
 nicholas  you are talking nonsense  be quiet  be quiet  be quiet  i tell you      she almost screamed  so as to drown his voice
 mamma darling  it's not at all so  
my poor  sweet darling   she said to her mother  who conscious that they had been on the brink of a rupture gazed at her son with terror  but in the obstinacy and excitement of the conflict could not and would not give way
 nicholas  i'll explain to you
go away  listen  mamma darling   said natasha
her words were incoherent  but they attained the purpose at which she was aiming
the countess  sobbing heavily  hid her face on her daughter's breast  while nicholas rose  clutching his head  and left the room
natasha set to work to effect a reconciliation  and so far succeeded that nicholas received a promise from his mother that sonya should not be troubled  while he on his side promised not to undertake anything without his parents' knowledge
firmly resolved  after putting his affairs in order in the regiment  to retire from the army and return and marry sonya  nicholas  serious  sorrowful  and at variance with his parents  but  as it seemed to him  passionately in love  left at the beginning of january to rejoin his regiment
after nicholas had gone things in the rostov household were more depressing than ever  and the countess fell ill from mental agitation
sonya was unhappy at the separation from nicholas and still more so on account of the hostile tone the countess could not help adopting toward her
the count was more perturbed than ever by the condition of his affairs  which called for some decisive action
their town house and estate near moscow had inevitably to be sold  and for this they had to go to moscow
but the countess' health obliged them to delay their departure from day to day
natasha  who had borne the first period of separation from her betrothed lightly and even cheerfully  now grew more agitated and impatient every day
the thought that her best days  which she would have employed in loving him  were being vainly wasted  with no advantage to anyone  tormented her incessantly
his letters for the most part irritated her
it hurt her to think that while she lived only in the thought of him  he was living a real life  seeing new places and new people that interested him
the more interesting his letters were the more vexed she felt
her letters to him  far from giving her any comfort  seemed to her a wearisome and artificial obligation
she could not write  because she could not conceive the possibility of expressing sincerely in a letter even a thousandth part of what she expressed by voice  smile  and glance
she wrote to him formal  monotonous  and dry letters  to which she attached no importance herself  and in the rough copies of which the countess corrected her mistakes in spelling
there was still no improvement in the countess' health  but it was impossible to defer the journey to moscow any longer
natasha's trousseau had to be ordered and the house sold
moreover  prince andrew was expected in moscow  where old prince bolkonski was spending the winter  and natasha felt sure he had already arrived
so the countess remained in the country  and the count  taking sonya and natasha with him  went to moscow at the end of january
