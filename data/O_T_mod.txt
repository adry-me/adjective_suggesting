treats of the place where oliver twist was born and of the circumstances attending his birth among other public buildings in a certain town  which for many reasons it will be prudent to refrain from mentioning  and to which i will assign no fictitious name  there is one anciently common to most towns  great or small  to wit  a workhouse  and in this workhouse was born  on a day and date which i need not trouble myself to repeat  inasmuch as it can be of no possible consequence to the reader  for a long time after it was ushered into this world of sorrow and trouble  by the parish surgeon  it remained a matter of considerable doubt whether the child would survive to bear any name at all  in which case it is somewhat more than probable that these memoirs would never have appeared  or  if they had  that being comprised within a couple of pages  they would have possessed the inestimable merit of being the most concise and faithful specimen of biography  extant in the literature of any age or country although i am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a workhouse  is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance that can possibly befall a human being  i do mean to say that in this particular instance  it was the best thing for oliver twist that could by possibility have occurred the fact is  that there was considerable difficulty in inducing oliver to take upon himself the office of respiration —a troublesome practice  but one which custom has rendered necessary to our easy existence  and for some time he lay gasping on a little flock mattress  rather unequally poised between this world and the next  the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter now  if  during this brief period  oliver had been surrounded by careful grandmothers  anxious aunts  experienced nurses  and doctors of profound wisdom  he would most inevitably and indubitably have been killed in no time
there being nobody by  however  but a pauper old woman  who was rendered rather misty by an unwonted allowance of beer  and a parish surgeon who did such matters by contract  oliver and nature fought out the point between them
the result was  that  after a few struggles  oliver breathed  sneezed  and proceeded to advertise to the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been imposed upon the parish  by set    oliver twist ting up as loud a cry as could reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been possessed of that very useful appendage  a voice  for a much longer space of time than three minutes and a quarter
as oliver gave this first proof of the free and proper action of his lungs  the patchwork coverlet which was carelessly flung over the iron bedstead  rustled  the pale face of a young woman was raised feebly from the pillow  and a faint voice imperfectly articulated the words   let me see the child  and die   the surgeon had been sitting with his face turned towards the fire  giving the palms of his hands a warm and a rub alternately as the young woman spoke  he rose  and advancing to the bed s head  said  with more kindness than might have been expected of him   oh  you must not talk about dying yet    lor bless her dear heart  no   interposed the nurse  hastily depositing in her pocket a green glass bottle  the contents of which she had been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction
 lor bless her dear heart  when she has lived as long as i have  sir  and had thirteen children of her own  and all on  em dead except two  and them in the wurkus with me  she ll know better than to take on in that way  bless her dear heart  think what it is to be a mother  there s a dear young lamb do   apparently this consolatory perspective of a mother s prospects failed in producing its due effect
the patient shook her head  and stretched out her hand towards the child the surgeon deposited it in her arms she imprinted her cold white lips passionately on its forehead  passed her hands over her face  gazed wildly round  shuddered  fell back—and died
they chafed her breast  hands  and temples  but the blood had stopped forever
they talked of hope and comfort
they had been strangers too long
 it s all over  mrs thingummy   said the surgeon at last  ah  poor dear  so it is   said the nurse  picking up the cork of the green bottle  which had fallen out on the pillow  as she stooped to take up the child
 poor dear    you needn t mind sending up to me  if the child cries  nurse   said the surgeon  putting on his gloves with great deliberation
 it s very likely it will be troublesome
give it a little gruel if it is   he put on his hat  and  pausing by the bedside on his way to the door  added   she was a good looking girl  too  where did she come from    she was brought here last night   replied the old woman   by the overseer s order
she was found lying in the street
she had walked some distance  for her shoes were worn to pieces  but where she came from  or where she was going to  nobody knows   the surgeon leaned over the body  and raised the left hand
 the old story   he said  shaking his head   no wedding ring  i see
ah  good night   the medical gentleman walked away to dinner  and the nurse  having once more applied herself to the green bottle  sat down on a low chair before the fire  and proceeded to dress the infant
  oliver twist what an excellent example of the power of dress  young oliver twist was  wrapped in the blanket which had hitherto formed his only covering  he might have been the child of a nobleman or a beggar  it would have been hard for the haughtiest stranger to have assigned him his proper station in society
but now that he was enveloped in the old calico robes which had grown yellow in the same service  he was badged and ticketed  and fell into his place at once— a parish child—the orphan of a workhouse—the humble  half starved drudge—to be cuffed and buffeted through the world—despised by all  and pitied by none
oliver cried lustily
if he could have known that he was an orphan  left to the tender mercies of church wardens and overseers  perhaps he would have cried the louder
treats of oliver twist s growth  education  and board for the next eight or ten months  oliver was the victim of a systematic course of treachery and deception
he was brought up by hand
the hungry and destitute situation of the infant orphan was duly reported by the workhouse authorities to the parish authorities
the parish authorities inquired with dignity of the workhouse authorities  whether there was no female then domiciled in  the house  who was in a situation to impart to oliver twist  the consolation and nourishment of which he stood in need
the workhouse authorities replied with humility  that there was not
upon this  the parish authorities magnanimously and humanely resolved  that oliver should be  farmed   or  in other words  that he should be dispatched to a branchworkhouse some three miles off  where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders against the poor laws  rolled about the floor all day  without the inconvenience of too much   oliver twist food or too much clothing  under the parental superintendence of an elderly female  who received the culprits at and for the consideration of sevenpence halfpenny per small head per week
sevenpence halfpenny s worth per week is a good round diet for a child  a great deal may be got for sevenpence halfpenny  quite enough to overload its stomach  and make it uncomfortable
the elderly female was a woman of wisdom and experience  she knew what was good for children  and she had a very accurate perception of what was good for herself
so  she appropriated the greater part of the weekly stipend to her own use  and consigned the rising parochial generation to even a shorter allowance than was originally provided for them
thereby finding in the lowest depth a deeper still  and proving herself a very great experimental philosopher
everybody knows the story of another experimental philosopher who had a great theory about a horse being able to live without eating  and who demonstrated it so well  that he had got his own horse down to a straw a day  and would unquestionably have rendered him a very spirited and rampacious animal on nothing at all  if he had not died  four and twenty hours before he was to have had his first comfortable bait of air
unfortunately for  the experimenal philosophy of the female to whose protecting care oliver twist was delivered over  a similar result usually attended the operation of her system  for at the very moment when the child had contrived to exist upon the smallest possible portion of the weakest possible food  it did perversely happen in eight and a half cases out of ten  either that it sickened from want and cold  or fell into the fire from neglect  or got half smothered by accident  in any one of which cases  the miserable little being was usually summoned into another world  and there gathered to the fathers it had never known in this
occasionally  when there was some more than usually interesting inquest upon a parish child who had been overlooked in turning up a bedstead  or inadvertently scalded to death when there happened to be a washing—though the latter accident was very scarce  anything approaching to a washing being of rare occurance in the farm—the jury would take it into their heads to ask troublesome questions  or the parishioners would rebelliously affix their signatures to a remonstrance
but these impertinences were speedily checked by the evidence of the surgeon  and the testimony of the beadle  the former of whom had always opened the body and found nothing inside (which was very probable indeed)  and the latter of whom invariably swore whatever the parish wanted  which was very self devotional
besides  the board made periodical pilgrimages to the farm  and always sent the beadle the day before  to say they were going
the children were neat and clean to behold  when they went  and what more would the people have  it cannot be expected that this system of farming would produce any very extraordinary or luxuriant crop
oliver twist s ninth birthday found him a pale thin child  somewhat diminutive in stature  and decidely small in circumference
but nature or inheritance had implanted a good sturdy spirit in oliver s breast
it had had plenty of room to 10 oliver twist expand  thanks to the spare diet of the establishment  and perhaps to this circumstance may be attributed his having any ninth birth day at all be this as it may  however  it was his ninth birthday  and he was keeping it in the coal cellar with a select party of two other young gentleman  who  after participating with him in a sound thrashing  had been locked up for atrociously presuming to be hungry  when mrs mann  the good lady of the house  was unexpectedly startled by the apparition of mr bumble  the beadle  striving to undo the wicket of the garden gate  goodness gracious  is that you  mr bumble  sir   said mrs mann  thrusting her head out of the window in wellaffected ecstasies of joy  (susan  take oliver and them two brats upstairs  and wash  em directly )—my heart alive  mr bumble  how glad i am to see you  sure ly   now  mr bumble was a fat man  and a choleric  so  instead of responding to this open hearted salutation in a kindred spirit  he gave the little wicket a tremendous shake  and then bestowed upon it a kick which could have emanated from no leg but a beadle s
 lor  only think   said mrs mann  running out —for the three boys had been removed by this time — only think of that  that i should have forgotten that the gate was bolted on the inside  on account of them dear children  walk in sir  walk in  pray  mr bumble  do  sir   although this invitation was accompanied with a curtsey that might have softened the heart of a church warden  it by no means mollified the beadle  do you think this respectful or proper conduct  mrs mann   inquired mr bumble  grasping his cane   to keep the parish officers a waiting at your garden gate  when they come here upon porochial business with the porochial orphans  are you aweer  mrs mann  that you are  as i may say  a porochial delegate  and a stipendiary    i m sure mr bumble  that i was only a telling one or two of the dear children as is so fond of you  that it was you a coming   replied mrs mann with great humility mr bumble had a great idea of his oratorical powers and his importance he had displayed the one  and vindicated the other he relaxed
 well  well  mrs mann   he replied in a calmer tone   it may be as you say  it may be lead the way in  mrs mann  for i come on business  and have something to say   mrs mann ushered the beadle into a small parlour with a brick floor  placed a seat for him  and officiously deposited his cocked hat and can on the table before him mr bumble wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his walk had engendered  glanced complacently at the cocked hat  and smiled yes  he smiled
beadles are but men  and mr bumble smiled
 now don t you be offended at what i m a going to say   observed mrs mann  with captivating sweetness  you ve had a long walk  you know  or i wouldn t mention it
now  will you take a little drop of somethink  mr bumble    not a drop
nor a drop   said mr bumble  waving his right hand in a dignified  but placid manner
 i think you will   said mrs mann  who had noticed the tone of the refusal  and the gesture that had accompanied 12 oliver twist it  just a leetle drop  with a little cold water  and a lump of sugar   mr bumble coughed
 now  just a leetle drop   said mrs mann persuasively  what is it   inquired the beadle
 why  it s what i m obliged to keep a little of in the house  to put into the blessed infants  daffy  when they ain t well  mr bumble   replied mrs mann as she opened a corner cupboard  and took down a bottle and glass  it s gin
i ll not deceive you  mr b
it s gin    do you give the children daffy  mrs mann   inquired bumble  following with this eyes the interesting process of mixing  ah  bless  em  that i do  dear as it is   replied the nurse
 i couldn t see  em suffer before my very eyes  you know sir    no   said mr bumble approvingly   no  you could not
you are a humane woman  mrs mann   (here she set down the glass )  i shall take a early opportunity of mentioning it to the board  mrs mann   (he drew it towards him )  you feel as a mother  mrs mann   (he stirred the gin and water )  i—i drink your health with cheerfulness  mrs mann   and he swallowed half of it  and now about business   said the beadle  taking out a leathern pocket book  the child that was half baptized oliver twist  is nine year old to day    bless him   interposed mrs mann  inflaming her left eye with the corner of her apron  and notwithstanding a offered reward of ten pound  which was afterwards increased to twenty pound notwithstanding the most superlative  and  i may say  supernat ral exertions on the part of this parish   said bumble   we have never been able to discover who is his father  or what was his mother s settlement  name  or con—dition   mrs mann raised her hands in astonishment  but added  after a moment s reflection   how comes he to have any name at all  then   the beadle drew himself up with great pride  and said   i inwented it    you  mr bumble    i  mrs mann we name our fondlings in alphabetical order the last was a s —swubble  i named him this was a t —twist  i named him the next one comes will be unwin  and the next vilkins
i have got names ready made to the end of the alphabet  and all the way through it again  when we come to z    why  you re quite a literary character  sir   said mrs mann  well  well   said the beadle  evidently gratified with the compliment   perhaps i may be
perhaps i may be  mrs mann   he finished the gin and water  and added   oliver being now too old to remain here  the board have determined to have him back into the house i have come out myself to take him there
so let me see him at once    i ll fetch him directly   said mrs mann  leaving the room for that purpose oliver  having had by this time as much of the outer coat of dirt which encrusted his face and hands  removed  as could be scrubbed off in one washing  was led into the room by his benevolent protectress 14 oliver twist  make a bow to the gentleman  oliver   said mrs mann oliver made a bow  which was divided between the beadle on the chair  and the cocked hat on the table
 will you go along with me  oliver   said mr bumble  in a majestic voice
oliver was about to say that he would go along with anybody with great readiness  when  glancing upward  he caught sight of mrs mann  who had got behind the beadle s chair  and was shaking her fist at him with a furious countenance he took the hint at once  for the fist had been too often impressed upon his body not to be deeply impressed upon his recollection
 will she go with me   inquired poor oliver
 no  she can t   replied mr bumble
 but she ll come and see you sometimes   this was no very great consolation to the child
young as he was  however  he had sense enough to make a feint of feeling great regret at going away
it was no very difficult matter for the boy to call tears into his eyes
hunger and recent ill usage are great assistants if you want to cry  and oliver cried very naturally indeed
mrs mann gave him a thousand embraces  and what oliver wanted a great deal more  a piece of bread and butter  less he should seem too hungry when he got to the workhouse with the slice of bread in his hand  and the little brown cloth parish cap on his head  oliver was then led away by mr bumble from the wretched home where one kind word or look had never lighted the gloom of his infant years and yet he burst into an agony of childish grief  as the cottage gate closed after him
wretched as were the little companions in misery he was leaving behind  they were the only friends he had ever known  and a sense of his loneliness in the great wide world  sank into the child s heart for the first time mr bumble walked on with long strides  little oliver  firmly grasping his gold laced cuff  trotted beside him  inquiring at the end of every quarter of a mile whether they were  nearly there   to these interrogations mr bumble returned very brief and snappish replies  for the temporary blandness which gin and water awakens in some bosoms had by this time evaporated  and he was once again a beadle oliver had not been within the walls of the workhouse a quarter of an hour  and had scarcely completed the demolition of a second slice of bread  when mr bumble  who had handed him over to the care of an old woman  returned  and  telling him it was a board night  informed him that the board had said he was to appear before it forthwith
not having a very clearly defined notion of what a live board was  oliver was rather astounded by this intelligence  and was not quite certain whether he ought to laugh or cry
he had no time to think about the matter  however  for mr bumble gave him a tap on the head  with his cane  to wake him up  and another on the back to make him lively  and bidding him to follow  conducted him into a large whitewashed room  where eight or ten fat gentlemen were sitting round a table
at the top of the table  seated in an arm chair rather higher than the rest  was a particularly fat gentleman with a very round  red face
16 oliver twist  bow to the board   said bumble
oliver brushed away two or three tears that were lingering in his eyes  and seeing no board but the table  fortunately bowed to that
 what s your name  boy   said the gentleman in the high chair
oliver was frightened at the sight of so many gentlemen  which made him tremble  and the beadle gave him another tap behind  which made him cry
these two causes made him answer in a very low and hesitating voice  whereupon a gentleman in a white waistcoat said he was a fool
which was a capital way of raising his spirits  and putting him quite at his ease
 boy   said the gentleman in the high chair   listen to me
you know you re an orphan  i suppose    what s that  sir   inquired poor oliver
 the boy is a fool—i thought he was   said the gentleman in the white waistcoat
 hush   said the gentleman who had spoken first
 you know you ve got no father or mother  and that you were brought up by the parish  don t you    yes  sir   replied oliver  weeping bitterly
 what are you crying for   inquired the gentleman in the white waistcoat
and to be sure it was very extraordinary
what could the boy be crying for   i hope you say your prayers every night   said another gentleman in a gruff voice   and pray for the people who feed you  and take care of you—like a christian    yes  sir   stammered the boy
the gentleman who spoke last was unconsciously right
it would have been very like a christian  and a marvellously good christian too  if oliver had prayed for the people who fed and took care of him
but he hadn t  because nobody had taught him
 well  you have come here to be educated  and taught a useful trade   said the red faced gentleman in the high chair
 so you ll begin to pick oakum to morrow morning at six o clock   added the surly one in the white waistcoat
for the combination of both these blessings in the one simple process of picking oakum  oliver bowed low by the direction of the beadle  and was then hurried away to a large ward  where  on a rough  hard bed  he sobbed himself to sleep what a novel illustration of the tender laws of england  they let the paupers go to sleep  poor oliver  he little thought  as he lay sleeping in happy unconsciousness of all around him  that the board had that very day arrived at a decision which would exercise the most material influence over all his future fortunes
but they had
and this was it  the members of this board were very sage  deep  philosophical men  and when they came to turn their attention to the workhouse  they found out at once  what ordinary folks would nver have discovered—the poor people liked it  it was a regular place of public entertainment for the poorer classes  a tavern where there was nothing to pay  a public breakfast  dinner  tea  and supper all the year round  a brick and mortar elysium  where it was all play and no work
 oho   said the board  looking very knowing   we are the fellows to set this to rights  we ll stop it all  in no time   so  18 oliver twist they established the rule  that all poor people should have the alternative (for they would compel nobody  not they)  of being starved by a gradual process in the house  or by a quick one out of it
with this view  they contracted with the water works to lay on an unlimited supply of water  and with a corn factor to supply periodically small quantities of oatmeal  and issued three meals of thin gruel a day  with an onion twice a week  and half a roll of sundays
they made a great many other wise and humane regulations  having reference to the ladies  which it is not necessary to repeat  kindly undertook to divorce poor married people  in consequence of the great expense of a suit in doctors  commons  and  instead of compelling a man to support his family  as they had theretofore done  took his family away from him  and made him a bachelor  there is no saying how many applicants for relief  under these last two heads  might have started up in all classes of society  if it had not been coupled with the workhouse  but the board were long headed men  and had provided for this difficulty
the relief was inseparable from the workhouse and the gruel  and that frightened people
for the first six months after oliver twist was removed  the system was in full operation
it was rather expensive at first  in consequence of the increase in the undertaker s bill  and the necessity of taking in the clothes of all the paupers  which fluttered loosely on their wasted  shrunken forms  after a week or two s gruel but the number of workhouse inmates got thin as well as the paupers  and the board were in ecstasies
the room in which the boys were fed  was a large stone hall  with a copper at one end  out of which the master  dressed in an apron for the purpose  and assisted by one or two women  ladled the gruel at mealtimes
of this festive composition each boy had one porringer  and no more—except on occasions of great public rejoicing  when he had two ounces and a quarter of bread besides
the bowls never wanted washing
the boys polished them with their spoons till they shone again  and when they had performed this operation (which never took very long  the spoons being nearly as large as the bowls)  they would sit staring at the copper  with such eager eyes  as if they could have devoured the very bricks of which it was composed  employing themselves  meanwhile  in sucking their fingers most assiduously  with the view of catching up any stray splashes of gruel that might have been cast thereon boys have generally excellent appetites
oliver twist and his companions suffered the tortures of slow starvation for three months  at last they got so voracious and wild with hunger  that one boy  who was tall for his age  and hadn t been used to that sort of thing (for his father had kept a small cook shop)  hinted darkly to his companions  that unless he had another basin of gruel per diem  he was afraid he might some night happen to eat the boy who slept next him  who happened to be a weakly youth of tender age
he had a wild  hungry eye  and they implicitly believed him
a council was held  lots were cast who should walk up to the master after supper that evening  and ask for more  and it fell to oliver twist
20 oliver twist the evening arrived  the boys took their places
the master  in his cook s uniform  stationed himself at the copper  his pauper assistants ranged themselves behind him  the gruel was served out  and a long grace was said over the short commons the gruel disappeared  the boys whispered each other  and winked at oliver  while his next neighbours nudged him
child as he was  he was desperate with hunger  and reckless with misery
he rose from the table  and advancing to the master  basin and spoon in hand  said  somewhat alarmed at his own temerity   please  sir  i want some more   the master was a fat  healthy man  but he turned very pale
he gazed in stupified astonishment on the small rebel for some seconds  and then clung for support to the copper
the assistants were paralysed with wonder  the boys with fear
 what   said the master at length  in a faint voice
 please  sir   replied oliver   i want some more   the master aimed a blow at oliver s head with the ladle  pinioned him in his arm  and shrieked aloud for the beadle
the board were sitting in solemn conclave  when mr bumble rushed into the room in great excitement  and addressing the gentleman in the high chair  said   mr limbkins  i beg your pardon  sir  oliver twist has asked for more   there was a general start
horror was depicted on every countenance
 for more   said mr limbkins
 compose yourself  bumble  and answer me distinctly
do i understand that he asked for more  after he had eaten the supper allotted by the dietary    he did  sir   replied bumble
 that boy will be hung   said the gentleman in the white waistcoat
 i know that boy will be hung   nobody controverted the prophetic gentleman s opinion
an animated discussion took place
oliver was ordered into instant confinement  and a bill was next morning pasted on the outside of the gate  offering a reward of five pounds to anybody who would take oliver twist off the hands of the parish
in other words  five pounds and oliver twist were offered to any man or woman who wanted an apprentice to any trade  business  or calling
 i never was more convinced of anything in my life   said the gentleman in the white waistcoat  as he knocked at the gate and read the bill next morning   i never was more convinced of anything in my life  than i am that that boy will come to be hung   as i purpose to show in the sequel whether the white waistcoated gentleman was right or not  i should perhaps mar the interest of this narrative (supposing it to possess any at all)  if i ventured to hint just yet  whether the life of oliver twist had this violent termination or no
22 oliver twist relates how oliver twist was very near getting a place which would not have been a sinecure for a week after the commission of the impious and profane offence of asking for more  oliver remained a close prisoner in the dark and solitary room to which he had been consigned by the wisdom and mercy of the board
it appears  at first sight not unreasonable to suppose  that  if he had entertained a becoming feeling of respect for the prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat  he would have established that sage individual s prophetic character  once and for ever  by tying one end of his pocket handkerchief to a hook in the wall  and attaching himself to the other to the performance of this feat  however  there was one obstacle  namely  that pocket handkerchiefs being decided articles of luxury  had been  for all future times and ages  removed from the noses of paupers by the express order of the board  in council assembled  solemnly given and pronounced under their hands and seals
there was a still greater obstacle in oliver s youth and childishness
he only cried bitterly all day  and  when the long  dismal night came on  spread his little hands before his eyes to shut out the darkness  and crouching in the corner  tried to sleep  ever and anon waking with a start and tremble  and drawing himself closer and closer to the wall  as if to feel even its cold hard surface were a protection in the gloom and loneliness which surrounded him let it not be supposed by the enemies of  the system   that  during the period of his solitary incarceration  oliver was denied the benefit of exercise  the pleasure of society  or the advantages of religious consolation
as for exercise  it was nice cold weather  and he was allowed to perform his ablutions every morning under the pump  in a stone yard  in the presence of mr bumble  who prevented his catching cold  and caused a tingling sensation to pervade his frame  by repeated applications of the cane
as for society  he was carried every other day into the hall where the boys dined  and there sociably flogged as a public warning and example
and so for from being denied the advantages of religious consolation  he was kicked into the same apartment every evening at prayer time  and there permitted to listen to  and console his mind with  a general supplication of the boys  containing a special clause  therein inserted by authority of the board  in which they entreated to be made 24 oliver twist good  virtuous  contented  and obedient  and to be guarded from the sins and vices of oliver twist  whom the supplication distinctly set forth to be under the exclusive patronage and protection of the powers of wickedness  and an article direct from the manufactory of the very devil himself it chanced one morning  while oliver s affairs were in this auspicious and confortable state  that mr gamfield  chimney sweep  went his way down the high street  deeply cogitating in his mind his ways and means of paying certain arrears of rent  for which his landlord had become rather pressing
mr gamfield s most sanguine estimate of his finances could not raise them within full five pounds of the desired amount  and  in a species of arthimetical desperation  he was alternately cudgelling his brains and his donkey  when passing the workhouse  his eyes encountered the bill on the gate
 wo—o   said mr gamfield to the donkey
the donkey was in a state of profound abstraction  wondering  probably  whether he was destined to be regaled with a cabbage stalk or two when he had disposed of the two sacks of soot with which the little cart was laden  so  without noticing the word of command  he jogged onward
mr gamfield growled a fierce imprecation on the donkey generally  but more particularly on his eyes  and  running after him  bestowed a blow on his head  which would inevitably have beaten in any skull but a donkey s
then  catching hold of the bridle  he gave his jaw a sharp wrench  by way of gentle reminder that he was not his own master  and by these means turned him round
he then gave him another blow on the head  just to stun him till he came back again
having completed these arrangements  he walked up to the gate  to read the bill
the gentleman with the white waistcoat was standing at the gate with his hands behind him  after having delivered himself of some profound sentiments in the board room having witnessed the little dispute between mr gamfield and the donkey  he smiled joyously when that person came up to read the bill  for he saw at once that mr gamfield was exactly the sort of master oliver twist wanted
mr gamfield smiled  too  as he perused the document  for five pounds was just the sum he had been wishing for  and  as to the boy with which it was encumbered  mr gamfield  knowing what the dietary of the workhouse was  well knew he would be a nice small pattern  just the very thing for register stoves
so  he spelt the bill through again  from beginning to end  and then  touching his fur cap in token of humility  accosted the gentleman in the white waistcoat
 this here boy  sir  wot the parish wants to  prentis   said mr gamfield
 ay  my man   said the gentleman in the white waistcoat  with a condescending smile
 what of him    if the parish vould like him to learn a right pleasant trade  in a good  spectable chimbley sweepin  bisness   said mr gamfield   i wants a  prentis  and i am ready to take him    walk in   said the gentleman in the white waistcoat
mr gamfield having lingered behind  to give the donkey another blow on the head  and another wrench of the jaw  as a 26 oliver twist caution not to run away in his absence  followed the gentleman with the white waistcoat into the room where oliver had first seen him
 it s a nasty trade   said mr limbkins  when gamfield had again stated his wish
 young boys have been smothered in chimneys before now   said another gentleman
 that s acause they damped the straw afore they lit it in the chimbley to make  em come down again   said gamfield   that s all smoke  and no blaze  vereas smoke ain t o  no use at all in making a boy come down  for it only sinds him to sleep  and that s wot he likes
boys is wery obstinit  and wery lazy  gen l men  and there s nothink like a good hot blaze to make  em come down vith a run
it s humane too  gen l men  acause  even if they ve stuck in the chimbley  roasting their feet makes  em struggle to hextricate theirselves   the gentleman in the white waistcoat appeared very much amused by this explanation  but his mirth was speedily checked by a look from mr limbkins
the board then procedded to converse among themselves for a few minutes  but in so low a tone  that the words  saving of expenditure    looked well in the accounts    have a printed report published   were alone audible these only chanced to be heard  indeed  or account of their being very frequently repeated with great emphasis
at length the whispering ceased  and the members of the board  having resumed their seats and their solemnity  mr limbkins said   we have considered your proposition  and we don t approve of it    not at all   said the gentleman in the white waistcoat
 decidedly not   added the other members
as mr gamfield did happen to labour under the slight imputation of having bruised three or four boys to death already  it occurred to him that the board had  perhaps  in some unaccountable freak  taken it into their heads that this extraneous circumstance ought to influence their proceedings it was very unlike their general mode of doing business  if they had  but still  as he had no particular wish to revive the rumour  he twisted his cap in his hands  and walked slowly from the table
 so you won t let me have him  gen l men   said mr gamfield  pausing near the door
 no   replied mr limbkins   at least  as it s a nasty business  we think you ought to take something less than the premium we offered   mr gamfield s countenance brightened  as  with a quick step  he returned to the table  and said   what ll you give  gen l men  come  don t be too hard on a poor man
what ll you give    i should say  three pound ten was plenty   said mr limbkins
 ten shillings too much   said the gentleman in the white waistcoat
 come   said gamfield   say four pound  gen l men
say four pound  and you ve got rid of him for good and all
there    three pound ten   repeated mr limbkins  firmly
28 oliver twist  come  i ll split the diff erence  gen l men  urged gamfield
 three pound fifteen    not a farthing more   was the firm reply of mr limbkins
 you re desperate hard upon me  gen l men  said gamfield  wavering
 pooh  pooh  nonsense   said the gentleman in the white waistcoat
 he d be cheap with nothing at all  as a premium
take him  you silly fellow  he s just the boy for you
he wants the stick  now and then  it ll do him good  and his board needn t come very expensive  for he hasn t been overfed since he was born
ha  ha  ha   mr gamfield gave an arch look at the faces round the table  and  observing a smile on all of them  gradually broke into a smile himself the bargain was made
mr bumble  was at once instructed that oliver twist and his indentures were to be conveyed before the magistrate  for signature and approval  that very afternoon
in pursuance of this determination  little oliver  to his excessive astonishment  was released from bondage  and ordered to put himself into a clean shirt he had hardly achieved this very unusual gymnastic performance  when mr bumble brought him  with his own hands  a basin of gruel  and the holiday allowance of two ounces and a quarter of bread
at this tremendous sight  oliver began to cry very piteously  thinking  not unaturally  that the board must have determined to kill him for some useful purpose  or they never would have begun to fatten him up in that way
 don t make your eyes red  oliver  but eat your food and be thankful   said mr bumble  in a tone of impressive pomposity
 you re a going to be made a  prentice of  oliver    a prentice  sir   said the child  trembling
 yes  oliver   said mr bumble
 the kind and blessed gentleman which is so amny parents to you  oliver  when you have none of your own  are a going to  prentice you  and to set you up in life  and make a man of you  although the expense to the parish is three pound ten —three pound ten  oliver —seventy shillins—one hundred and forty sixpences —and all for a naughty orphan which noboday can t love   as mr bumble paused to take breath  after delivering this address in an awful voice  the tears rolled down the poor child s face  and he sobbed bitterly
 come   said mr bumble  somewhat less pompously  for it was gratifying to his feelings to observe the effect his eloquence had produced   come  oliver  wipe your eyes with the cuffs of your jacket  and don t cry into your gruel  that s a very foolish action  oliver   it certainly was  for there was quite enough water in it already
on their way to the magistrate  mr bumble instructed oliver that all he would have to do  would be to look very happy  and say  when the gentleman asked him if he wanted to be apprenticed  that he should like it very much indeed  both of which injunctions oliver promised to obey  the rather as mr bumble threw in a gentle hint  that if he failed in either particular  there was no telling what would be done to him
when they arrived at the office  he was shut up in a 30 oliver twist little room by himself  and admonished by mr bumble to stay there  until he came back to fetch him there the boy remained  with a palpitating heart  for half an hour at the expiration of which time mr bumble thrust in his head  unadorned with the cocked hat  and said aloud   now  oliver  my dear  come to the gentleman   as mr bumble said this  he put on a grim and threatening look  and added  in a low voice   mind what i told you  you young rascal   oliver stared innocently in mr bumble s face at this somewhat contradictory style of address  but that gentleman prevented his offering any remark thereupon  by leading him at once into an adjoining room  the door of which was open
it was a large room  with a great window
behind a desk  sat two old gentleman with powdered heads  one of whom was reading the newspaper  while the other was perusing  with the aid of a pair of tortoise shell spectacles  a small piece of parchment which lay before him
mr limbkins was standing in front of the desk on one side  and mr gamfield  with a partially washed face  on the other  while two or three bluff looking men  in top boots  were lounging about
the old gentleman with the spectacles gradually dozed off  over the little bit of parchment  and there was a short pause  after oliver had been stationed by mr bumble in front of the desk
 this is the boy  your worship   said mr bumble
the old gentleman who was reading the newspaper raised his head for a moment  and pulled the other old gentleman by the sleeve  whereupon  the last mentioned old gentleman woke up
 oh  is this the boy   said the old gentleman
 this is him  sir   replied mr bumble
 bow to the magistrate  my dear   oliver roused himself  and made his best obeisance he had been wondering  with his eyes fixed on the magistrates  powder  whether all boards were born with that white stuff on their heads  and were boards from thenceforth on that account
 well   said the old gentleman   i suppose he s fond of chimney sweeping    he doats on it  your worship   replied bumble  giving oliver a sly pinch  to intimate that he had better not say he didn t
 and he will be a sweep  will he   inquired the old gentleman
 if we was to bind him to any other trade to morrow  he d run away simultaneous  your worship   replied bumble
 and this man that s to be his master—you  sir—you ll treat him well  and feed him  and do all that sort of thing  will you   said the old gentleman
 when i says i will  i means i will   replied mr gamfield doggedly
 you re a rough speaker  my friend  but you look an honest  open hearted man   said the old gentleman  turning his spectacles in the direction of the candidate for oliver s premium  whose villainous countenance was a regular stamped 32 oliver twist receipt for cruelty
but the magistrate was half blind and half childish  so he couldn t reasonably be expected to discern what other people did
 i hope i am  sir   said mr gamfield  with an ugly leer
 i have no doubt you are  my friend   replied the old gentleman  fixing his spectacles more firmly on his nose  and looking about him for the inkstand
it was the critical moment of oliver s fate
if the inkstand had been where the old gentleman though it was  he would have dipped his pen into it  and signed the indentures  and oliver would have been straightway hurried off
but  as it chanced to be immediately under his nose  it followed  as a matter of course  that he looked all over his desk for it  without finding it  and happening in the course of his search to look straight before him  his gaze encountered the pale and terrified face of oliver twist  who  despite all the admonitory looks and pinches of bumble  was regarding the repulsive countenance of his future master  with a mingled expression of horror and fear  too palpable to be mistaken  even by a half blind magistrate
the old gentleman stopped  laid down his pen  and looked from oliver to mr limbkins  who attempted to take snuff with a cheerful and unconcerned aspect
 my boy   said the old gentleman   you look pale and alarmed
what is the matter    stand a little away from him  beadle   said the other magistrate  laying aside the paper  and leaning forward with an expression of interest
 now  boy  tell us what s the matter  don t be afraid   oliver fell on his knees  and clasping his hands together  prayed that they would order him back to the dark room— that they would starve him—beat him—kill him if they pleased—rather than send him away with that dreadful man
 well   said mr bumble  raising his hands and eyes with most impressive solemnite
 well  of all the artful and designing orphans that ever i see  oliver  you are one of the most bare facedest    hold your tongue  beadle   said the second old gentleman  when mr bumble had given vent to this compound adjective
 i beg your worship s pardon   said mr bumble  incredulous of having heard aright
 did your worship speak to me    yes
hold your tongue   mr bumble was stupefied with astonishment
a beadle ordered to hold his tongue  a moral revolution  the old gentleman in the tortoise shell spectacles looked at his companion  he nodded significantly
 we refuse to sanction these indentures   said the old gentleman  tossing aside the piece of parchment as he spoke
 i hope   stammered mr limbkins   i hope the magistrates will not form the opinion that the authorities have been guilty of any improper conduct  on the unsupported testimony of a child    the magistrates are not called upon to pronounce any opinion on the matter   said the second old gentleman 34 oliver twist sharply
 take the boy back to the workhouse  and treat him kindly
he seems to want it   that same evening  the gentleman in the white waistcoat most positively and decidedly affirmed  not only that oliver would be hung  but that he would be drawn and quartered into the bargain mr bumble shook his head with gloomy mystery  and said he wished he might come to good  whereunto mr gamfield replied  that he wished he might come to him  which  although he agreed with the beadle in most matters  would seem to be a wish of a totaly opposite description
the next morning  the public were once informed that oliver twist was again to let  and that five pounds would be paid to anybody who would take possession of him
oliver  being offered another place  makes his first entry into public life i n great families  when an advantageous place cannot be obtained  either in possession  reversion  remainder  or expectancy  for the young man who is growing up  it is a very general custom to send him to sea
the board  in imitation of so wise and salutary an example  took counsel together on the expediency of shipping off oliver twist  in some small trading vessel bound to a good unhealthy port
this suggested itself as the very best thing that could possibly be done with him  the probability being  that the skipper would flog him to death  in a playful mood  some day after dinner  or would knock his brains out with an iron bar  both pastimes being  as is pretty generally known  very favourite and common recreations among gentleman of that class
the more the case presented itself to the board  in this 36 oliver twist point of view  the more manifold the advantages of the step appeared  so  they came to the conclusion that the only way of providing for oliver effectually  was to send him to sea without delay
mr bumble had been despatched to make various preliminary inquiries  with the view of finding out some captain or other who wanted a cabin boy without any friends  and was returning to the workhouse to communicate the result of his mission  when he encountered at the gate  no less a person than mr sowerberry  the parochial undertaker
mr sowerberry was a tall gaunt  large jointed man  attired in a suit of threadbare black  with darned cotton stockings of the same colour  and shoes to answer
his features were not naturally intended to wear a smiling aspect  but he was in general rather given to professional jocosity
his step was elastic  and his face betokened inward pleasantry  as he advanced to mr bumble  and shook him cordially by the hand
 i have taken the measure of the two women that died last night  mr bumble   said the undertaker
 you ll make your fortune  mr sowerberry   said the beadle  as he thrust his thumb and forefinger into the proferred snuff box of the undertaker  which was an ingenious little model of a patent coffin
 i say you ll make your fortune  mr sowerberry   repeated mr bumble  tapping the undertaker on the shoulder  in a friendly manner  with his cane
 think so   said the undertaker in a tone which half admitted and half disputed the probability of the event
 the prices allowed by the board are very small  mr bumble    so are the coffins   replied the beadle  with precisely as near an approach to a laugh as a great official ought to indulge in
mr sowerberry was much tickled at this  as of course he ought to be  and laughed a long time without cessation
 well  well  mr bumble   he said at length   there s no denying that  since the new system of feeding has come in  the coffins are something narrower and more shallow than they used to be  but we must have some profit  mr bumble
wellseasoned timber is an expensive article  sir  and all the iron handles come  by canal  from birmingham    well  well   said mr bumble   every trade has its drawbacks
a fair profit is  of course  allowable    of course  of course   replied the undertaker   and if i don t get a profit upon this or that particular article  why  i make it up in the long run  you see—he  he  he    just so   said mr bumble
 though i must say   continued the undertaker  resuming the current of observations which the beadle had interrupted   though i must say  mr bumble  that i have to contend against one very great disadvantage  which is  that all the stout people go off the quickest
the people who have been better off  and have paid rates for many years  are the first to sink when they come into the house  and let me tell you  mr bumble  that three or four inches over one s calculation makes a great hole in one s profits  especially when one has a family to provide for  sir   as mr sowerberry said this  with the becoming indignation of an ill used man  and as mr bumble felt that it rather 38 oliver twist tended to convey a reflection on the honour of the parish  the latter gentleman thought it advisable to change the subject
oliver twist being uppermost in his mind  he made him his theme
 by the bye   said mr bumble   you don t know anybody who wants a boy  do you  a porochial  prentis  who is at present a dead weight  a millstone  as i may say  round the porochial throat  liberal terms  mr sowerberry  liberal terms   as mr bumble spoke  he raised his cane to the bill above him  and gave three distinct raps upon the words  five pounds   which were printed thereon in roman capitals of gigantic size  gadso   said the undertaker  taking mr bumble by the gilt edged lappel of his official coat   that s just the very thing i wanted to speak to you about you know—dear me  what a very elegant button this is  mr bumble  i never noticed it before    yes  i think it rather pretty   said the beadle  glancing proudly downwards at the large brass buttons which embellished his coat
 the die is the same as the porochial seal—the good samaritan healing the sick and bruised man
the board presented it to me on newyear s morning  mr sowerberry
i put it on  i remember  for the first time  to attend the inquest on that reduced tradesman  who died in a doorway at midnight    i recollect   said the undertaker
 the jury brought it in   died from exposure to the cold  and want of the common necessaries of life   didn t they   mr bumble nodded
 and they made it a special verdict  i think   said the undertaker   by adding some words to the effect  that if the relieving officer had—   tush  foolery   interposed the beadle
 if the board attended to all the nonsense that ignorant jurymen talk  they d have enough to do    very true   said the undertaker   they would indeed    juries   said mr bumble  grasping his cane tightly  as was his wont when working into a passion   juries is ineddicated  vulgar  grovelling wretches    so they are   said the undertaker  they haven t no more philosophy nor political economy about  em than that   said the beadle  snapping his fingers contemptuously
 no more they have   acquiesced the undertaker
 i despise  em   said the beadle  growing very red in the face
 so do i   rejoined the undertaker
 and i only wish we d a jury of the independent sort  in the house for a week or two   said the beadle   the rules and regulations of the board would soon bring their spirit down for  em    let  em alone for that   replied the undertaker
so saying  he smiled  approvingly  to calm the rising wrath of the indignant parish officer
mr bumble lifted off his cocked hat  took a handkerchief from the inside of the crown  wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his rage had engendered  fixed the cocked hat on again  and  turning to the undertaker  said 40 oliver twist in a calmer voice   well  what about the boy    oh   replied the undertaker  why  you know  mr bumble  i pay a good deal towards the poor s rates    hem   said mr bumble
 well    well   replied the undertaker   i was thinking that if i pay so much towards  em  i ve a right to get as much out of  em as i can  mr bumble  and so—i think i ll take the boy myself   mr bumble grasped the undertaker by the arm  and led him into the building
mr sowerberry was closeted with the board for five minutes  and it was arranged that oliver should go to him that evening  upon liking —a phrase which means  in the case of a parish apprentice  that if the master find  upon a short trial  that he can get enough work out of a boy without putting too much food into him  he shall have him for a term of years  to do what he likes with
when little oliver was taken before  the gentlemen  that evening  and informed that he was to go  that night  as general house lad to a coffin maker s  and that if he complained of his situation  or ever came back to the parish again  he would be sent to sea  there to be drowned  or knocked on the head  as the case might be  he evinced so little emotion  that they by common consent pronounced him a hardened young rascal  and orered mr bumble to remove him forthwith
now  although it was very natural that the board  of all people in the world  should feel in a great state of virtuous astonishment and horror at the smallest tokens of want of feeling on the part of anybody  they were rather out  in this particular instance
the simple fact was  that oliver  instead of possessing too little feeling  possessed rather too much  and was in a fair way of being reduced  for life  to a state of brutal stupidity and sullenness by the ill usage he had received
he heard the news of his destination  in perfect silence  and  having had his luggage put into his hand—which was not very difficult to carry  inasmuch as it was all comprised within the limits of a brown paper parcel  about half a foot square by three inches deep—he pulled his cap over his eyes  and once more attaching himself to mr bumble s coat cuff  was led away by that dignitary to a new scene of suffering for some time  mr bumble drew oliver along  without notice or remark  for the beadle carried his head very erect  as a beadle always should  and  it being a windy day  little oliver was completely enshrouded by the skirts of mr bumble s coat as they blew open  and disclosed to great advantage his flapped waistcoat and drab plush knee breeches
as they drew near to their destination  however  mr bumble thought it expedient to look down  and see that the boy was in good order for inspection by his new master  which he accordingly did  with a fit and becoming air of gracious patronage
 oliver   said mr bumble
 yes  sir   replied oliver  in a low  tremulous voice
 pull that cap off your eyes  and hold up your head  sir   although oliver did as he was desired  at once  and passed the back of his unoccupied hand briskly across his 42 oliver twist eyes  he left a tear in them when he looked up at his conductor
as mr bumble gazed sternly upon him  it rolled down his cheek
it was followed by another  and another
the child made a strong effort  but it was an unsuccessful one
withdrawing his other hand from mr bumble s he covered his face with both  and wept until the tears sprung out from between his chin and bony fingers
 well   exclaimed mr bumble  stopping short  and darting at his little charge a look of intense malignity
 well  of all the ungratefullest  and worst disposed boys as ever i see  oliver  you are the—   no  no  sir   sobbed oliver  clinging to the hand which held the well known cane   no  no  sir  i will be good indeed  indeed  indeed i will  sir  i am a very little boy  sir  and it is so—so—   so what   inquired mr bumble in amazement
 so lonely  sir  so very lonely   cried the child
 everybody hates me
oh  sir  don t  don t pray be cross to me   the child beat his hand upon his heart  and looked in his companion s face  with tears of real agony
mr bumble regarded oliver s piteous and helpless look  with some astonishment  for a few seconds  hemmed three or four times in a husky manner  and after muttering something about  that troublesome cough   bade oliver dry his eyes and be a good boy
then once more taking his hand  he walked on with him in silence
the undertaker  who had just putup the shutters of his shop  was making some entries in his day book by the light of a most appropriate dismal candle  when mr bumble entered
 aha   said the undertaker  looking up from the book  and pausing in the middle of a word   is that you  bumble    no one else  mr sowerberry   replied the beadle
 here  i ve brought the boy   oliver made a bow
 oh  that s the boy  is it   said the undertaker  raising the candle above his head  to get a better view of oliver
 mrs sowerberry  will you have the goodness to come here a moment  my dear   mrs sowerberry emerged from a little room behind the shop  and presented the form of a short  then  squeezed up woman  with a vixenish countenance  my dear   said mr sowerberry  deferentially   this is the boy from the workhouse that i told you of   oliver bowed again  dear me   said the undertaker s wife   he s very small    why  he is rather small   replied mr bumble  looking at oliver as if it were his fault that he was no bigger   he is small
there s no denying it
but he ll grow  mrs sowerberry—he ll grow    ah  i dare say he will   replied the lady pettishly   on our victuals and our drink i see no saving in parish children  not i  for they always cost more to keep  than they re worth
however  men always think they know best
there  get downstairs  little bag o  bones   with this  the undertaker s wife opened a side door  and pushed oliver down a steep flight of stairs into a stone cell  damp and dark  forming the ante room to the coal cellar  and denominated  kitchen   wherein sat a slatternly girl  in shoes down at heel  and blue 44 oliver twist worsted stockings very much out of repair
 here  charlotte   said mr sowerberry  who had followed oliver down   give this boy some of the cold bits that were put by for trip
he hasn t come home since the morning  so he may go without  em
i dare say the boy isn t too dainty to eat  em—are you  boy   oliver  whose eyes had glistened at the mention of meat  and who was trembling with eagerness to devour it  replied in the negative  and a plateful of coarse broken victuals was set before him
i wish some well fed philosopher  whose meat and drink turn to gall within him  whose blood is ice  whose heart is iron  could have seen oliver twist clutching at the dainty viands that the dog had neglected
i wish he could have witnessed the horrible avidity with which oliver tore the bits asunder with all the ferocity of famine
there is only one thing i should like better  and that would be to see the philosopher making the same sort of meal himself  with the same relish  well   said the undertaker s wife  when oliver had finished his supper  which she had regarded in silent horror  and with fearful auguries of his future appetite   have you done   there being nothing eatable within his reach  oliver replied in the affirmative
 then come with me   said mrs sowerberry  taking up a dim and dirty lamp  and leading the way upstairs   your bed s under the counter you don t mind sleeping among the coffins  i suppose  but it doesn t much matter whether you do or don t  for you can t sleep anywhere else
come  don t keep me here all night   oliver lingered no longer  but meekly followed his new mistress
46 oliver twist oliver mingles with new associates
going to a funeral for the first time  he forms an unfavourable notion of his master s business oliver  being left to himself in the undertaker s shop  set the lamp down on a workman s bench  and gazed timidly about him with a feeling of awe and dread  which many people a good deal older than he will be at no loss to understand an unfinished coffin on black tressels  which stood in the middle of the shop  looked so gloomy and death like that a cold tremble came over him  every time his eyes wandered in the direction of the dismal object  from which he almost expected to see some frightful form slowly rear its head  to drive him mad with terror
against the wall were ranged  in regular array  a long row of elm boards cut in the same shape  looking in the dim light  like high shouldered ghosts with their hands in their breeches pockets
coffin plates  elm chips  bright headed nails  and shreds of black cloth  lay scattered on the floor  and the wall behind the counter was ornamented with a lively representation of two mutes in very stiff neckcloths  on duty at a large private door  with a hearse drawn by four black steeds  approaching in the distance
the shop was close and hot
the atmosphere seemed tainted with the smell of coffins
the recess beneath the counter in which his flock mattress was thrust  looked like a grave
nor were these the only dismal feelings which depressed oliver
he was alone in a strange place  and we all know how chilled and desolate the best of us will sometimes feel in such a situation
the boy had no friends to care for  or to care for him
the regret of no recent separation was fresh in his mind  the absence of no loved and well remembered face sank heavily into his heart
but his heart was heavy  notwithstanding  and he wished  as he crept into his narrow bed  that that were his coffin  and that he could be lain in a calm and lasting sleep in the churchyard ground  with the tall grass waving gently above his head  and the sound of the old deep bell to soothe him in his sleep
oliver was awakened in the morning  by a loud kicking at the outside of the shop door  which  before he could huddle on his clothes  was repeated  in an angry and impetuous manner  about twenty five times
when he began to undo 48 oliver twist the chain  the legs desisted  and a voice began
 open the door  will yer   cried the voice which belonged to the legs which had kicked at the door
 i will  directly  sir   replied oliver  undoing the chain  and turning the key
 i suppose yer the new boy  ain t yer   said the voice through the key hole
 yes  sir   replied oliver
 how old are yer   inquired the voice
 ten  sir   replied oliver
 then i ll whop yer when i get in   said the voice   you just see if i don t  that s all  my work us brat   and having made this obliging promise  the voice began to whistle
oliver had been too often subjected to the process to which the very expressive monosyllable just recorded bears reference  to entertain the smallest doubt that the owner of the voice  whoever he might be  would redeem his pledge  most honourably
he drew back the bolts with a trembling hand  and opened the door
for a second or two  oliver glanced up the street  and down the street  and over the way  impressed with the belief that the unknown  who had addressed him through the key hole  had walked a few paces off  to warm himself  for nobody did he see but a big charity boy  sitting on a post in front of the house  eating a slice of bread and butter  which he cut into wedges  the size of his mouth  with a clasp knife  and then consumed with great dexterity  i beg your pardon  sir   said oliver at length  seeing that no other visitor made his appearance   did you knock    i kicked   replied the charity boy
 did you want a coffin  sir   inquired oliver  innocently
at this  the charity boy looked monstrous fierce  and said that oliver would want one before long  if he cut jokes with his superiors in that way
 yer don t know who i am  i suppose  work us   said the charity boy  in continuation  descending from the top of the post  meanwhile  with edifying gravity
 no  sir   rejoined oliver
 i m mister noah claypole   said the charity boy   and you re under me
take down the shutters  yer idle young ruffian   with this  mr claypole administered a kick to oliver  and entered the shop with a dignified air  which did him great credit
it is difficult for a large headed  small eyed youth  of lumbering make and heavy countenance  to look dignified under any circumstances  but it is more especially so  when superadded to these personal attractions are a red nose and yellow smalls oliver  having taken down the shutters  and broken a pane of glass in his effort to stagger away beneath the weight of the first one to a small court at the side of the house in which they were kept during the day  was graciously assisted by noah  who having consoled him with the assurance that  he d catch it   condescended to help him
mr sowerberry came down soon after
shortly afterwards  mrs sowerberry appeared oliver having  caught it   in fulfilment of noah s prediction  followed that young gentleman down the stairs to breakfast
 come near the fire  noah   said charlotte
 i saved a nice 50 oliver twist little bit of bacon for you from master s breakfast
oliver  shut that door at mister noah s back  and take them bits that i ve put out on the cover of the bread pan
there s your tea  take it away to that box  and drink it there  and make haste  for they ll want you to mind the shop
d ye hear    d ye hear  work us   said noah claypole
 lor  noah   said charlotte   what a rum creature you are  why don t you let the boy alone    let him alone   said noah
 why everybody lets him alone enough  for the matter of that
neither his father nor his mother will ever interfere with him
all his relations let him have his own way pretty well
eh  charlotte  he  he  he    oh  you queer soul   said charlotte  bursting into a hearty laugh  in which she was joined by noah  after which they both looked scornfully at poor oliver twist  as he sat shivering on the box in the coldest corner of the room  and ate the stale pieces which had been specially reserved for him
noah was a charity boy  but not a workhouse orphan
no chance child was he  for he could trace his genealogy all the way back to his parents  who lived hard by  his mother being a washerwoman  and his father a drunken soldier  discharged with a wooden leg  and a diurnal pension of twopence halfpenny and an unstateable fraction
the shop boys in the neighbourhood had long been in the habit of branding noah in the public streets  with the ignominious epithets of  leathers    charity   and the like  and noah had bourne them without reply
but  now that fortune had cast in his way a nameless orphan  at whom even the meanest could point the finger of scorn  he retorted on him with interest
this affords charming food for contemplation
it shows us what a beautiful thing human nature may be made to be  and how impartially the same amiable qualities are developed in the finest lord and the dirtiest charity boy
oliver had been sojourning at the undertaker s some three weeks or a month
mr and mrs sowerberry—the shop being shut up—were taking their supper in the little back parlour  when mr sowerberry  after several deferential glances at his wife  said   my dear—  he was going to say more  but  mrs sowerberry looking up  with a peculiarly unpropitious aspect  he stopped short  well   said mrs sowerberry  sharply  nothing  my dear  nothing   said mr sowerberry  ugh  you brute   said mrs sowerberry  not at all  my dear   said mr sowerberry humbly
 i thought you didn t want to hear  my dear
i was only going to say—   oh  don t tell me what you were going to say   interposed mrs sowerberry  i am nobody  don t consult me  pray
i don t want to intrude upon your secrets   as mrs sowerberry said this  she gave an hysterical laugh  which threatened violent consequences  but  my dear   said sowerberry   i want to ask your advice    no  no  don t ask mine   replied mrs sowerberry  in an 52 oliver twist affecting manner   ask somebody else s   here  there was another hysterical laugh  which frightened mr sowerberry very much this is a very common and much approved matrimonial course of treatment  which is often very effective it at once reduced mr sowerberry to begging  as a special favour  to be allowed to say what mrs sowerberry was most curious to hear after a short duration  the permission was most graciously conceded
 it s only about young twist  my dear   said mr sowerberry
 a very good looking boy  that  my dear    he need be  for he eats enough   observed the lady
 there s an expression of melancholy in his face  my dear   resumed mr sowerberry   which is very interesting
he would make a delightful mute  my love   mrs sowerberry looked up with an expression of considerable wonderment mr sowerberry remarked it and  without allowing time for any observation on the good lady s part  proceeded
 i don t mean a regular mute to attend grown up people  my dear  but only for children s practice
it would be very new to have a mute in proportion  my dear
you may depend upon it  it would have a superb effect   mrs sowerberry  who had a good deal of taste in the undertaking way  was much struck by the novelty of this idea  but  as it would have been compromising her dignity to have said so  under existing circumstances  she merely inquired  with much sharpness  why such an obvious suggestion had not presented itself to her husband s mind before  mr sowerberry rightly construed this  as an acquiescence in his proposition  it was speedily determined  therefore  that oliver should be at once initiated into the mysteries of the trade  and  with this view  that he should accompany his master on the very next occasion of his services being required the occasion was not long in coming half an hour after breakfast next morning  mr bumble entered the shop  and supporting his cane against the counter  drew forth his large leathern pocket book  from which he selected a small scrap of paper  which he handed over to sowerberry
 aha   said the undertaker  glancing over it with a lively countenance   an order for a coffin  eh    for a coffin first  and a porochial funeral afterwards   replied mr bumble  fastening the strap of the leathern pocket book  which  like himself  was very corpulent  bayton   said the undertaker  looking from the scrap of paper to mr bumble
 i never heard the name before   bumble shook his head  as he replied   obstinate people  mr sowerberry  very obstinate
proud  too  i m afraid  sir    proud  eh   exclaimed mr sowerberry with a sneer
 come  that s too much    oh  it s sickening   replied the beadle
 antimonial  mr sowerberry    so it is   asquiesced the undertaker
 we only heard of the family the night before last   said the beadle   and we shouldn t have known anything about them  then  only a woman who lodges in the same house made an application to the porochial committee for them to send the porochial surgeon to see a woman as was very 54 oliver twist bad
he had gone out to dinner  but his  prentice (which is a very clever lad) sent  em some medicine in a blacking bottle  offhand    ah  there s promptness   said the undertaker
 promptness  indeed   replied the beadle
 but what s the consequence  what s the ungrateful behaviour of these rebels  sir  why  the husband sends back word that the medicine won t suit his wife s complaint  and so she shan t take it—says she shan t take it  sir  good  strong  wholesome medicine  as was given with great success to two irish labourers and a coal heaver  ony a week before—sent  em for nothing  with a blackin  bottle in —and he sends back word that she shan t take it  sir   as the atrocity presented itself to mr bumble s mind in full force  he struck the counter sharply with his cane  and became flushed with indignation
 well   said the undertaker   i ne—ver—did—   never did  sir   ejaculated the beadle
 no  nor nobody never did  but now she s dead  we ve got to bury her  and that s the direction  and the sooner it s done  the better   thus saying  mr bumble put on his cocked hat wrong side first  in a fever of parochial excietment  and flounced out of the shop
 why  he was so angry  oliver  that he forgot even to ask after you   said mr sowerberry  looking after the beadle as he strode down the street
 yes  sir   replied oliver  who had carefully kept himself out of sight  during the interview  and who was shaking from head to foot at the mere recollection of the sound of mr bumble s voice he needn t haven taken the trouble to shrink from mr bumble s glance  however  for that functionary  on whom the prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat had made a very strong impression  thought that now the undertaker had got oliver upon trial the subject was better avoided  until such time as he should be firmly bound for seven years  and all danger of his being returned upon the hands of the parish should be thus effectually and legally overcome
 well   said mr sowerberry  taking up his hat
 the sooner this job is done  the better
noah  look after the shop
oliver  put on your cap  and come with me   oliver obeyed  and followed his master on his professional mission
they walked on  for some time  through the most crowded and densely inhabited part of the town  and then  striking down a narrow street more dirty and miserable than any they had yet passed through  paused to look for the house which was the object of their search
the houses on either side were high and large  but very old  and tenanted by people of the poorest class  as their neglected appearance would have sufficiently dentoed  without the concurrent testimony afforded by the squalid looks of the few men and women who  with folded arms and bodies half doubled  occasionally skulked along a great many of the tenements had shop fronts  but these were fast closed  and mouldering away  only the upper rooms being inhabited some houses which had become insecure from age and decay  were prevented from falling into the street  by huge beams of wood 56 oliver twist reared against the walls  and firmly planted in the road  but even these crazy dens seemed to have been selected as the nightly haunts of some houseless wretches  for many of the rough boards which supplied the place of door and window  were wrenched from their positions  to afford an aperture wide enough for the passage of a human body the kennel was stagnant and filthy the very rats  which here and there lay putrefying in its rottenness  were hideous with famine
there was neither knocker nor bell handle at the open door where oliver and his master stopped  so  groping his way cautiously through the dark passage  and bidding oliver keep close to him and not be afraid the undertaker mounted to the top of the first flight of stairs
stumbling against a door on the landing  he rapped at it with his knuckles
it was opened by a young girl of thirteen or fourteen
the undertaker at once saw enough of what the room contained  to know it was the apartment to which he had been directed
he stepped in  oliver followed him
there was no fire in the room  but a man was crouching  mechanically  over the empty stove
an old woman  too  had drawn a low stool to the cold hearth  and was sitting beside him
there were some ragged children in another corner  and in a small recess  opposite the door  there lay upon the ground  something covered with an old blanket
oliver shuddered as he cast his eyes toward the place  and crept involuntarily closer to his master  for though it was covered up  the boy felt that it was a corpse
the man s face was thin and very pale  his hair and beard were grizzly  his eyes were blookshot
the old woman s face was wrinkled  her two remaining teeth protruded over her under lip  and her eyes were bright and piercing
oliver was afriad to look at either her or the man
they seemed so like the rats he had seen outside
 nobody shall go near her   said the man  starting fiercely up  as the undertaker approached the recess
 keep back  damn you  keep back  if you ve a life to lose    nonsense  my good man   said the undertaker  who was pretty well used to misery in all its shapes
 nonsense    i tell you   said the man  clenching his hands  and stamping furiously on the floor — i tell you i won t have her put into the ground
she couldn t rest there
the worms would worry her—not eat her—she is so worn away   the undertaker offered no reply to this raving  but producing a tape from his pocket  knelt down for a moment by the side of the body  ah   said the man  bursting into tears  and sinking on his knees at the feet of the dead woman   kneel down  kneel down —kneel round her  every one of you  and mark my words  i say she was starved to death
i never knew how bad she was  till the fever came upon her  and then her bones were starting through the skin
there was neither fire nor candle  she died in the dark—in the dark  she couldn t even see her children s faces  though we heard her gasping out their names
i begged for her in the streets  and they sent me to prison
when i came back  she was dying  and all the blood in my heart has dried up  for they starved her to death
i swear it before the god that saw it  they starved her   he twined his hands in his hair  and  with a loud scream  rolled 58 oliver twist grovelling upon the floor  his eyes fixed  and the foam covering his lips
the terrified children cried bitterly  but the old woman  who had hitherto remained as quiet as if she had been wholly deaf to all that passed  menaced them into silence
having unloosened the cravat of the man who still remained extended on the ground  she tottered towards the undertaker
 she was my daughter   said the old woman  nodding her head in the direction of the corpse  and speaking with an idiotic leer  more ghastly than even the presence of death in such a place
 lord  lord  well  it is strange that i who gave birth to her  and was a woman then  should be alive and merry now  and she lying ther  so cold and stiff  lord  lord —to think of it  it s as good as a play—as good as a play   as the wretched creature mumbled and chuckled in her hideous merriment  the undertaker turned to go away  stop  stop   said the old woman in a loud whisper
 will she be buried to morrow  or next day  or to night  i laid her out  and i must walk  you know
send me a large cloak  a good warm one  for it is bitter cold
we should have cake and wine  too  before we go  never mind  send some bread— only a loaf of bread and a cup of water
shall we have some bread  dear   she said eagerly  catching at the undertaker s coat  as he once more moved towards the door
 yes  yes   said the undertaker  of course
anything you like   he disengaged himself from the old woman s grasp  and  drawing oliver after him  hurried away the next day  (the family having been meanwhile relieved with a half quartern loaf and a piece of cheese  left with them by mr bumble himself ) oliver and his master returned to the miserable abode  where mr bumble had already arrived  accompanied by four men from the workhouse  who were to act as bearers an old black cloak had been thrown over the rags of the old woman and the man  and the bare coffin having been screwed down  was hoisted on the shoulders of the bearers  and carried into the street
 now  you must put your best leg foremost  old lady   whispered sowerberry in the old woman s ear   we are rather late  and it won t do  to keep the clergyman waiting
move on  my men —as quick as you like   thus directed  the bearers trotted on under their light burden  and the two mourners kept as near them  as they could
mr bumble and sowerberry walked at a good smart pace in front  and oliver  whose legs were not so long as his master s  ran by the side
there was not so great a necessity for hurrying as mr sowerberry had anticipated  however  for when they reached the obscure corner of the churchyard in which the nettles grew  and where the parish graves were made  the clergyman had not arrived  and the clerk  who was sitting by the vestry room fire  seemed to think it by no means improbable that it might be an hour or so  before he came
so  they put the bier on the brink of the grave  and the two mourners waited patiently in the damp clay  with a cold rain drizzling down  while the ragged boys whom the spectacle had attracted into the churchyard played a noisy game 60 oliver twist at hide and seek among the tombstones  or varied their amusements by jumping backwards and forwards over the coffin
mr sowerberry and bumble  being personal friends of the clerk  sat by the fire with him  and read the paper
at length  after a lapse of something more than an hour  mr bumble  and sowerberry  and the clerk  were seen running towards the grave
immediately afterwards  the clergyman appeared  putting on his surplice as he came along
mr bumble then thrashed a boy or two  to keep up appearances  and the reverend gentleman  having read as much of the burial service as could be compressed into four minutes  gave his surplice to the clerk  and walked away again
 now  bill   said sowerberry to the grave digger
 fill up   it was no very difficult task  for the grave was so full  that the uppermost coffin was within a few feet of the surface
the grave digger shovelled in the earth  stamped it loosely down with his feet  shouldered his spade  and walked off  followed by the boys  who murmured very loud complaints at the fun being over so soon
 come  my good fellow   said bumble  tapping the man on the back
 they want to shut up the yard   the man who had never once moved  since he had taken his station by the grave side  started  raised his head  stared at the person who had addressed him  walked forward for a few paces  and fell down in a swoon
the crazy old woman was too much occupied in bewailing the loss of her cloak (which the undertaker had taken off)  to pay him any attention  so they threw a can of cold water over him  and when he came to  saw him safely out of the churchyard  locked the gate  and departed on their different ways
 well  oliver   said sowerberry  as they walked home   how do you like it    pretty well  thank you  sir  replied oliver  with considerable hesitation
 not very much  sir    ah  you ll get used to it in time  oliver   said sowerberry
 nothing when you are used to it  my boy   oliver wondered  in his own mind  whether it had taken a very long time to get mr sowerberry used to it
but he thought it better not to ask the question  and walked back to the shop  thinking over all he had seen and heard
62 oliver twist oliver  being goaded by the taunts of noah  rouses into action  and rather astonishes him the month s trial over  oliver was formally apprenticed
it was a nice sickly season just at this time
in commercial phrase  coffins were looking up  and  in the course of a few weeks  oliver acquired a great deal of experience
the success of mr sowerberry s ingenious speculation  exceeded even his most sanguine hopes
the oldest inhabitants recollected no period at which measles had been so prevalent  or so fatal to infant existence  and many were the mournful processions which little oliver headed  in a hat band reaching down to his knees  to the indescribable admiration and emotion of all the mothers in the town
as oliver accompanied his master in most of his adult expeditions too  in order that he might acquire that equanimity of demeanour and full command of nerve which was essential to a finished undertaker  he had many opportunities of observing the beautiful resignation and fortitude with which some strong minded people bear their trials and losses
for instance  when sowerberry had an order for the burial of some rich old lady or gentleman  who was surrounded by a great number of nephews and nieces  who had been perfectly inconsolable during the previous illness  and whose grief had been wholly irrepressible even on the most public occasions  they would be as happy among themselves as need be—quite cheerful and contented—conversing together with as much freedom and gaiety  as if nothing whatever had happened to disturb them husbands  too  bore the loss of their wives with the most heroic calmness
wives  again  put on weeds for their husbands  as if  so far from grieving in the garb of sorrow  they had made up their minds to render it as becoming and attractive as possible
it was observable  too  that ladies and gentlemen who were in passions of anguish during the ceremony of interment  recovered almost as soon as they reached home  and became quite composed before the tea drinking was over
all this was very pleasant and improving to see  and oliver beheld it with great admiration
that oliver twist was moved to resignation by the example of these good people  i cannot  although i am his biographer  undertake to affirm with any degree of confidence  but i can most distinctly say  that for many months he continued meekly to submit to the domination and illtreatment of noah claypole  who used him far worse than before  now that his jealousy was roused by seeing the new 64 oliver twist boy promoted to the black stick and hatband  while he  the old one  remained stationary in the muffin cap and leathers
charlotte treated him ill  because noah did  and mrs sowerberry was his decided enemy  because mr sowerberry was disposed to be his friend  so  between these three on one side  and a glut of funerals on the other  oliver was not altogether as comfortable as the hungry pig was  when he was shut up  by mistake  in the grain department of a brewery and now  i come to a very important passage in oliver s history  for i have to record an act  slight and unimportant perhaps in appearance  but which indirectly produced a material change in all his future prospects and proceedings
one day  oliver and noah had descended into the kitchen at the usual dinner hour  to banquet upon a small joint of mutton—a pound and a half of the worst end of the neck— when charlotte being called out of the way  there ensued a brief interval of time  which noah claypole  being hungry and vicious  considered he could not possibly devote to a worthier purpose than aggravating and tantalising young oliver twist
intent upon this innocent amusement  noah put his feet on the table cloth  and pulled oliver s hair  and twitched his ears  and expressed his opinion that he was a  sneak   and furthermore announced his intention of coming to see him hanged  whenever that desirable event should take place  and entered upon various topics of petty annoyance  like a malicious and ill conditioned charity boy as he was
but  making oliver cry  noah attempted to be more facetious still  and in his attempt  did what many sometimes do to this day  when they want to be funny
he got rather personal
 work us   said noah   how s your mother    she s dead   replied oliver   don t you say anything about her to me   oliver s colour rose as he said this  he breathed quickly  and there was a curious working of the mouth and nostrils  which mr claypole thought must be the immediate precursor of a violent fit of crying
under this impression he returned to the charge
 what did she die of  work us   said noah
 of a broken heart  some of our old nurses told me   replied oliver  more as if he were talking to himself  than answering noah  i think i know what it must be to die of that    tol de rol lol lol  right fol lairy  work us   said noah  as a tear rolled down oliver s cheek
 what s set you a snivelling now    not you   replied oliver  sharply
 there  that s enough
don t say anything more to me about her  you d better not    better not   exclaimed noah
 well  better not  work us  don t be impudent
your mother  too  she was a nice  un she was
oh  lor   and here  noah nodded his head expressively  and curled up as much of his small red nose as muscular action could collect together  for the occasion
 yer know  work us   continued noah  emboldened by oliver s silence  and speaking in a jeering tone of affected 66 oliver twist pity  of all tones the most annoying   yer know  work us  it can t be helped now  and of course yer couldn t help it then  and i am very sorry for it  and i m sure we all are  and pity yer very much
but yer must know  work us  yer mother was a regular right down bad  un    what did you say   inquired oliver  looking up very quickly
 a regular right down bad  un  work us   replied noah  coolly
 and it s a great deal better  work us  that she died when she did  or else she d have been hard labouring in bridewell  or transported  or hung  which is more likely than either  isn t it   crimson with fury  oliver started up  overthrew the chair and table  seized noah by the throat  shook him  in the violence of his rage  till his teeth chattered in his head  and collecting his whole force into one heavy blow  felled him to the ground a minute ago  the boy had looked the quiet child  mild  dejected creature that harsh treatment had made him
but his spirit was roused at last  the cruel insult to his dead mother had set his blood on fire
his breast heaved  his attitude was erect  his eye bright and vivid  his whole person changed  as he stood glaring over the cowardly tormentor who now lay crouching at his feet  and defied him with an energy he had never known before
 he ll murder me   blubbered noah
 charlotte  missis  here s the new boy a murdering of me  help  help  oliver s gone mad  char—lotte   noah s shouts were responded to  by a loud scream from charlotte  and a louder from mrs sowerberry  the former of whom rushed into the kitchen by a side door  while the latter paused on the staircase till she was quite certain that it was consistent with the preservation of human life  to come further down  oh  you little wretch   screamed charlotte  seizing oliver with her utmost force  which was about equal to that of a moderately strong man in particularly good training  oh  you little un grate ful  mur de rous  hor rid villain   and between every syllable  charlotte gave oliver a blow with all her might  accompanying it with a scream  for the benefit of society
charlotte s fist was by no means a light one  but  lest it should not be effectual in calming oliver s wrath  mrs sowerberry plunged into the kitchen  and assisted to hold him with one hand  while she scratched his face with the other in this favourable position of affairs  noah rose from the ground  and pommelled him behind
this was rather too violent exercise to last long
when they were all wearied out  and could tear and beat no longer  they dragged oliver  struggling and shouting  but nothing daunted  into the dust cellar  and there locked him up
this being done  mrs sowerberry sunk into a chair  and burst into tears  bless her  she s going off   said charlotte
 a glass of water  noah  dear
make haste    oh  charlotte   said mrs sowerberry  speaking as well as she could  through a deficiency of breath  and a sufficiency of cold water  which noah had poured over her head 68 oliver twist and shoulders  oh  charlotte  what a mercy we have not all been murdered in our beds    ah  mercy indeed  ma am   was the reply
i only hope this ll teach master not to have any more of these dreadful creatures  that are born to be murderers and robbers from their very cradle
poor noah  he was all but killed  ma am  when i come in    poor fellow   said mrs sowerberry  looking piteously on the charity boy noah  whose top waistcoat button might have been somewhere on a level with the crown of oliver s head  rubbed his eyes with the inside of his wrists while this commiseration was bestowed upon him  and performed some affecting tears and sniffs
 what s to be done   exclaimed mrs sowerberry  your master s not at home  there s not a man in the house  and he ll kick that door down in ten minutes   oliver s vigorous plunges against the bit of timber in question  rendered this occurance highly probable
 dear  dear  i don t know  ma am   said charlotte   unless we send for the police officers    or the millingtary   suggested mr claypole
 no  no   said mrs sowerberry  bethinking herself of oliver s old friend  run to mr bumble  noah  and tell him to come here directly  and not to lose a minute  never mind your cap  make haste  you can hold a knife to that black eye  as you run along
it ll keep the swelling down   noah stopped to make no reply  but started off at his fullest speed  and very much it astonished the people who were out walking  to see a charity boy tearing through the streets pell mell  with no cap on his head  and a clasp knife at his eye
70 oliver twist oliver continues refractory noah claypole ran along the streets at his swiftest pace  and paused not once for breath  until he reached the workhouse gate
having rested here  for a minute or so  to collect a good burst of sobs and an imposing show of tears and terror  he knocked loudly at the wicket  and presented such a rueful face to the aged pauper who opened it  that even he  who saw nothing but rueful faces about him at the best of times  started back in astonishment
 why  what s the matter with the boy   said the old pauper
 mr bumble  mr bumble   cried noah  wit well affected dismay  and in tones so loud and agitated  that they not only caught the ear of mr bumble himself  who happened to be hard by  but alarmed him so much that he rushed into the yard without his cocked hat  —which is a very curious and remarkable circumstance  as showing that even a beadle  acted upon a sudden and powerful impulse  may be afflicted with a momentary visitation of loss of self possession  and forgetfulness of personal dignity  oh  mr bumble  sir   said noah   oliver  sir  —oliver has—   what  what   interposed mr bumble  with a gleam of pleasure in his metallic eyes
 not run away  he hasn t run away  has he  noah    no  sir  no
not run away  sir  but he s turned wicious   replied noah
 he tried to murder me  sir  and then he tried to murder charlotte  and then missis
oh  what dreadful pain it is  such agony  please  sir   and here  noah writhed and twisted his body into an extensive variety of eel like positions  thereby giving mr bumble to understand that  from the violent and sanguinary onset of oliver twist  he had sustained severe internal injury and damage  from which he was at that moment suffering the acutest torture
when noah saw that the intelligence he communicated perfectly paralysed mr bumble  he imparted additional effect thereunto  by bewailing his dreadful wounds ten times louder than before  and when he observed a gentleman in a white waistcoat crossing the yard  he was more tragic in his lamentations than ever  rightly conceiving it highly expedient to attract the notice  and rouse the indignation  of the gentleman aforesaid
the gentleman s notice was very soon attracted  for he had not walked three paces  when he turned angrily round  and inquired what that young cur was howling for  and why mr bumble did not favour him with something which would render the series of vocular exclamations so desig  72 oliver twist nated  an involuntary process   it s a poor boy from the free school  sir   replied mr bumble   who has been nearly murdered—all but murdered  sir  —by young twist    by jove   exclaimed the gentleman in the white waistcoat  stopping short
 i knew it  i felt a strange presentiment from the very first  that that audacious young savage would come to be hung    he has likewise attempted  sir  to murder the female servant   said mr bumble  with a face of ashy paleness
 and his missis   interposed mr claypole
 and his master  too  i think you said  noah   added mr bumble
 no  he s out  or he would have murdered him   replied noah
 he said he wanted to    ah  said he wanted to  did he  my boy   inquired the gentleman in the white waistcoat
 yes  sir   replied noah
 and please  sir  missis wants to know whether mr bumble can spare time to step up there  directly  and flog him—  cause master s out    certainly  my boy  certainly   said the gentleman in the white waistcoat  smiling benignly  and patting noah s head  which was about three inches higher than his own
 you re a good boy—a very good boy
here s a penny for you
bumble  just step up to sowerberry s with your cane  and seed what s best to be done
don t spare him  bumble    no  i will not  sir   replied the beadle
and the cocked hat and cane having been  by this time  adjusted to their owner s satisfaction  mr bumble and noah claypole betook themselves with all speed to the undertaker s shop here the position of affairs had not at all improved
sowerberry had not yet returned  and oliver continued to kick  with undiminished vigour  at the cellar door
the accounts of his ferocity as related by mrs sowerberry and charlotte  were of so startling a nature  that mr bumble judged it prudent to parley  before opening the door with this view he gave a kick at the outside  by way of prelude  and  then  applying his mouth to the keyhole  said  in a deep and impressive tone   oliver    come  you let me out   replied oliver  from the inside
 do you know this here voice  oliver   said mr bumble
 yes   replied oliver
 ain t you afraid of it  sir  ain t you a trembling while i speak  sir   said mr bumble
 no   replied oliver  boldly
an answer so different from the one he had expected to elicit  and was in the habit of receiving  staggered mr bumble not a little
he stepped back from the keyhole  drew himself up to his full height  and looked from one to another of the three bystanders  in mute astonishment  oh  you know  mr bumble  he must be mad   said mrs sowerberry  no boy in half his senses could venture to speak so to you    it s not madness  ma am   replied mr bumble  after a few moments of deep meditation
 it s meat    what   exclaimed mrs sowerberry 74 oliver twist  meat  ma am  meat   replied bumble  with stern emphasis
 you ve over fed him  ma am
you ve raised a artificial soul and spirit in him  ma am unbecoming a person of his condition  as the board  mrs sowerberry  who are practical philosophers  will tell you what have paupers to do with soul or spirit  it s quite enough that we let  em have live bodies
if you had kept the boy on gruel  ma am  this would never have happened    dear  dear   ejaculated mrs sowerberry  piously raising her eyes to the kitchen ceiling   this comes of being liberal   the liberality of mrs sowerberry to oliver  had consisted of a profuse bestowal upon him of all the dirty odds and ends which nobody else would eat  so there was a great deal of meekness and self devotion in her voluntarily remaining under mr bumble s heavy accusation of which  to do her justice  she was wholly innocent  in thought  word  or deed  ah   said mr bumble  when the lady brought her eyes down to earth again   the only thing that can be done now  that i know of  is to leave him in the cellar for a day or so  till he s a little starved down  and then to take him out  and keep him on gruel all through the apprenticeship
he comes of a bad family
excitable natures  mrs sowerberry  both the nurse and doctor said  that that mother of his made her way here  against difficulties and pain that would have killed any well disposed woman  weeks before   at this point of mr bumble s discourse  oliver  just hearing enough to know that some allusion was being made to his mother  recommenced kicking  with a violence that rendered every other sound inaudible sowerberry returned at this juncture
oliver s offence having been explained to him  with such exaggerations as the ladies thought best calculated to rouse his ire  he unlocked the cellar door in a twinkling  and dragged his rebellious apprentice out  by the collar
oliver s clothes had been torn in the beating he had received  his face was bruised and scratched  and his hair scattered over his forehead
the angry flush had not disappeared  however  and when he was pulled out of his prison  he scowled boldly on noah  and looked quite undismayed
 now  you are a nice young fellow  ain t you   said sowerberry  giving oliver a shake  and a box on the ear
 he called my mother names   replied oliver
 well  and what if he did  you little ungrateful wretch   said mrs sowerberry  she deserved what he said  and worse    she didn t  said oliver  she did   said mrs sowerberry  it s a lie   said oliver
mrs sowerberry burst into a flood of tears this flood of tears left mr sowerberry no alternative
if he had hesitated for one instant to punish oliver most severely  it must be quite clear to every experienced reader that he would have been  according to all precedents in disputes of matrimony established  a brute  an unnatural husband  an insulting creature  a base imitation of a man  and various other agreeable characters too numerous for recital within as his power went—it was not very extensive—kindly dis  76 oliver twist posed towards the boy  perhaps  because it was his interest to be so  perhaps  because his wife disliked him
the flood of tears  however  left him no resource  so he at once gave him a drubbing  which satisfied even mrs sowerberry herself  and rendered mr bumble s subsequent application of the parochial cane  rather unnecessary for the rest of the day  he was shut up in the back kitchen  in company with a pump and a slice of bread  and at night  mrs sowerberry  after making various remarks outside the door  by no means complimentary to the memory of his mother  looked into the room  and  amidst the jeers and pointings of noah and charlotte  ordered him upstairs to his dismal bed it was not until he was left alone in the silence and stillness of the gloomy workshop of the undertaker  that oliver gave way to the feelings which the day s treatment may be supposed likely to have awakened in a mere child
he had listened to their taunts with a look of contempt  he had borne the lash without a cry  for he felt that pride swelling in his heart which would have kept down a shriek to the last  though they had roasted him alive
but now  when there were none to see or hear him  he fell upon his knees on the floor  and  hiding his face in his hands  wept such tears as  god send for the credit of our nature  few so young may ever have cause to pour out before him  for a long time  oliver remained motionless in this attitude
the candle was burning low in the socket when he rose to his feet
having gazed cautiously round him  and listened intently  he gently undid the fastenings of the door  and looked abroad
it was a cold  dark night
the stars seemed  to the boy s eyes  farther from the earth than he had ever seen them before  there was no wind  and the sombre shadows thrown by the trees upon the ground  looked sepulchral and deathlike  from being so still
he softly reclosed the door
having availed himself of the expiring light of the candle to tie up in a handkerchief the few articles of wearing apparel he had  sat himself down upon a bench  to wait for morning with the first ray of light that struggled through the crevices in the shutters  oliver arose  and again unbarred the door
one timid look around—one moment s pause of hesitation—he had closed it behind him  and was in the open street
he looked to the right and to the left  uncertain whither to fly
he remembered to have seen the waggons  as they went out  toiling up the hill
he took the same route  and arriving at a footpath across the fields  which he knew  after some distance  led out again into the road  struck into it  and walked quickly on
along this same footpath  oliver well remembered he had trotted beside mr bumble  when he first carried him to the workhouse from the farm
his way lay directly in front of the cottage
his heart beat quickly when he bethought himself of this  and he half resolved to turn back he had come a long way though  and should lose a great deal of time by doing so
besides  it was so early that there was very little fear of his being seen  so he walked on
he reached the house
there was no appearance of its in  78 oliver twist mates stirring at that early hour
oliver stopped  and peeped into the garden
a child was weeding one of the little beds  as he stopped  he raised his pale face and disclosed the features of one of his former companions
oliver felt glad to see him  before he went  for  though younger than himself  he had been his little friend and playmate they had been beaten  and starved  and shut up together  many and many a time
 hush  dick   said oliver  as the boy ran to the gate  and thrust his thin arm between the rails to greet him
 is any one up    nobody but me   replied the child
 you musn t say you saw me  dick   said oliver
 i am running away
they beat and ill use me  dick  and i am going to seek my fortune  some long way off
i don t know where
how pale you are    i heard the doctor tell them i was dying   replied the child with a faint smile
 i am very glad to see you  dear  but don t stop  don t stop    yes  yes  i will  to say good b ye to you   replied oliver
 i shall see you again  dick
i know i shall  you will be well and happy    i hope so   replied the child
 after i am dead  but not before
i know the doctor must be right  oliver  because i dream so much of heaven  and angels  and kind faces that i never see when i am awake
kiss me   said the child  climbing up the low gate  and flinging his little arms round oliver s neck  good b ye  dear  god bless you   the blessing was from a young child s lips  but it was the first that oliver had ever heard invoked upon his head  and through the struggles and sufferings  and troubles and changes  of his after life  he never once forgot it
80 oliver twist oliver walks to london
he encounters on the road a strange sort of young gentleman oliver reached the stile at which the by path terminated  and once more gained the high road
it was eight o clock now
though he was nearly five miles away from the town  he ran  and hid behind the hedges  by turns  till noon  fearing that he might be pursued and overtaken
then he sat down to rest by the side of the milestone  and began to think  for the first time  where he had better go and try to live
the stone by which he was seated  bore  in large characters  an intimation that it was just seventy miles from that spot to london
the name awakened a new train of ideas in the boy s mind
london —that great place —nobody—not even mr bumble—could ever find him there  he had often heard the old men in the workhouse  too  say that no lad of spirit need want in london  and that there were ways of living in that vast city  which those who had been bred up in country parts had no idea of
it was the very place for a homeless boy  who must die in the streets unless some one helped him
as these things passed through his thoughts  he jumped upon his feet  and again walked forward
he had diminished the distance between himself and london by full four miles more  before he recollected how much he must undergo ere he could hope to reach his place of destination as this consideration forced itself upon him  he slackened his pace a little  and meditated upon his means of getting there
he had a crust of bread  a coarse shirt  and two pairs of stockings  in his bundle
he had a penny too— a gift of sowerberry s after some funeral in which he had acquitted himself more than ordinarily well—in his pocket  a clean shirt   thought oliver   is a very comfortable thing  and so are two pairs of darned stockings  and so is a penny  but they small helps to a sixty five miles  walk in winter time   but oliver s thoughts  like those of most other people  although they were extremely ready and active to point out his difficulties  were wholly at a loss to suggest any feasible mode of surmounting them  so  after a good deal of thinking to no particular purpose  he changed his little bundle over to the other shoulder  and trudged on
oliver walked twenty miles that day  and all that time tasted nothing but the crust of dry bread  and a few draughts 82 oliver twist of water  which he begged at the cottage doors by the roadside
when the night came  he turned into a meadow  and  creeping close under a hay rick  determined to lie there  till morning
he felt frightened at first  for the wind moaned dismally over the empty fields  and he was cold and hungry  and more alone than he had ever felt before
being very tired with his walk  however  he soon fell asleep and forgot his troubles
he felt cold and stiff  when he got up next morning  and so hungry that he was obliged to exchange the penny for a small loaf  in the very first village through which he passed
he had walked no more than twelve miles  when night closed in again
his feet were sore  and his legs so weak that they trembled beneath him
another night passed in the bleak damp air  made him worse  when he set forward on his journey next morning he could hardly crawl along
he waited at the bottom of a steep hill till a stage coach came up  and then begged of the outside passengers  but there were very few who took any notice of him  and even those told him to wait till they got to the top of the hill  and then let them see how far he could run for a halfpenny
poor oliver tried to keep up with the coach a little way  but was unable to do it  by reason of his fatigue and sore feet
when the outsides saw this  they put their halfpence back into their pockets again  declaring that he was an idle young dog  and didn t deserve anything  and the coach rattled away and left only a cloud of dust behind
in some villages  large painted boards were fixed up  warning all persons who begged within the district  that they would be sent to jail
this frightened oliver very much  and made him glad to get out of those villages with all possible expedition
in others  he would stand about the inn yards  and look mournfully at every one who passed  a proceeding which generally terminated in the landlady s ordering one of the post boys who were lounging about  to drive that strange boy out of the place  for she was sure he had come to steal something
if he begged at a farmer s house  ten to one but they threatened to set the dog on him  and when he showed his nose in a shop  they talked about the beadle— which brought oliver s heart into his mouth —very often the only thing he had there  for many hours together
in fact  if it had not been for a good hearted turnpikeman  and a benevolent old lady  oliver s troubles would have been shortened by the very same process which had put an end to his mother s  in other words  he would most assuredly have fallen dead upon the king s highway
but the turnpike man gave him a meal of bread and cheese  and the old lady  who had a shipwrecked grandson wandering barefoot in some distant part of the earth  took pity upon the poor orphan  and gave him what little she could afford— and more—with such kind and gently words  and such tears of sympathy and compassion  that they sank deeper into oliver s soul  than all the sufferings he had ever undergone
early on the seventh morning after he had left his native place  oliver limped slowly into the little town of barnet
the window shutters were closed  the street was empty  not a soul had awakened to the business of the day
the sun was rising in all its splendid beauty  but the light only served to 84 oliver twist show the boy his own lonesomeness and desolation  as he sat  with bleeding feet and covered with dust  upon a doorstep
by degrees  the shutters were opened  the window blinds were drawn up  and people began passing to and fro
some few stopped to gaze at oliver for a moment or two  or turned round to stare at him as they hurried by  but none relieved him  or troubled themselves to inquire how he came there he had no heart to beg
and there he sat
he had been crouching on the step for some time  wondering at the great number of public houses (every other house in barnet was a tavern  large or small)  gazing listlessly at the coaches as they passed through  and thinking how strange it seemed that they could do  with ease  in a few hours  what it had taken him a whole week of courage and determination beyond his years to accomplish  when he was roused by observing that a boy  who had passed him carelessly some minutes before  had returned  and was now surveying him most earnestly from the opposite side of the way
he took little heed of this at first  but the boy remained in the same attitude of close observation so long  that oliver raised his head  and returned his steady look
upon this  the boy crossed over  and walking close up to oliver  said  hullo  my covey  what s the row   the boy who addressed this inquiry to the young wayfarer  was about his own age  but one of the queerest looking boys that oliver had even seen
he was a snub nosed  flatbrowed  common faced boy enough  and as dirty a juvenile as one would wish to see  but he had about him all the airs and manners of a man
he was short of his age  with rather bow legs  and little  sharp  ugly eyes
his hat was stuck on the top of his head so lightly  that it threatened to fall off every moment—and would have done so  very often  if the wearer had not had a knack of every now and then giving his head a sudden twitch  which brought it back to its old place again
he wore a man s coat  which reached nearly to his heels
he had turned the cuffs back  half way up his arm  to get his hands out of the sleeves  apparently with the ultimated view of thrusting them into the pockets of his corduroy trousers  for there he kept them
he was  altogether  as roystering and swaggering a young gentleman as ever stood four feet six  or something less  in the bluchers
 hullo  my covey  what s the row   said this strange young gentleman to oliver
 i am very hungry and tired   replied oliver  the tears standing in his eyes as he spoke
 i have walked a long way
i have been walking these seven days    walking for sivin days   said the young gentleman
 oh  i see
beak s order  eh  but   he added  noticing oliver s look of surprise   i suppose you don t know what a beak is  my flash com pan i on   oliver mildly replied  that he had always heard a bird s mouth described by the term in question
 my eyes  how green   exclaimed the young gentleman
 why  a beak s a madgst rate  and when you walk by a beak s order  it s not straight forerd  but always agoing up  and niver a coming down agin
was you never on the mill    what mill   inquired oliver
86 oliver twist  what mill  why  the mill—the mill as takes up so little room that it ll work inside a stone jug  and always goes better when the wind s low with people  than when it s high  acos then they can t get workmen
but come   said the young gentleman   you want grub  and you shall have it
i m at lowwater mark myself—only one bob and a magpie  but  as far as it goes  i ll fork out and stump
up with you on your pins
there  now then  morrice   assisting oliver to rise  the young gentleman took him to an adjacent chandler s shop  where he purchased a sufficiency of ready dressed ham and a half quartern loaf  or  as he himself expressed it   a fourpenny bran   the ham being kept clean and preserved from dust  by the ingenious expedient of making a hole in the loaf by pulling out a portion of the crumb  and stuffing it therein taking the bread under his arm  the young gentlman turned into a small public house  and led the way to a tap room in the rear of the premises
here  a pot of beer was brought in  by direction of the mysterious youth  and oliver  falling to  at his new friend s bidding  made a long and hearty meal  during the progress of which the strange boy eyed him from time to time with great attention
 going to london   said the strange boy  when oliver had at length concluded
 yes    got any lodgings    no    money    no   the strange boy whistled  and put his arms into his pockets  as far as the big coat sleeves would let them go  do you live in london   inquired oliver
 yes
i do  when i m at home   replied the boy
 i suppose you want some place to sleep in to night  don t you    i do  indeed   answered oliver
 i have not slept under a roof since i left the country    don t fret your eyelids on that score   said the young gentleman
 i ve got to be in london to night  and i know a  spectable old gentleman as lives there  wot ll give you lodgings for nothink  and never ask for the change—that is  if any genelman he knows interduces you
and don t he know me  oh  no  not in the least  by no means
certainly not   the young gentelman smiled  as if to intimate that the latter fragments of discourse were playfully ironical  and finished the beer as he did so
this unexpected offer of shelter was too tempting to be resisted  especially as it was immediately followed up  by the assurance that the old gentleman referred to  would doubtless provide oliver with a comfortable place  without loss of time
this led to a more friendly and confidential dialogue  from which oliver discovered that his friend s name was jack dawkins  and that he was a peculiar pet and protege of the elderly gentleman before mentioned
mr dawkin s appearance did not say a vast deal in favour of the comforts which his patron s interest obtained for those whom he took under his protection  but  as he had 88 oliver twist a rather flightly and dissolute mode of conversing  and furthermore avowed that among his intimate friends he was better known by the sobriquet of  the artful dodger   oliver concluded that  being of a dissipated and careless turn  the moral precepts of his benefactor had hitherto been thrown away upon him
under this impression  he secretly resolved to cultivate the good opinion of the old gentleman as quickly as possible  and  if he found the dodger incorrigible  as he more than half suspected he should  to decline the honour of his farther acquaintance
as john dawkins objected to their entering london before nightfall  it was nearly eleven o clock when they reached the turnpike at islington
they crossed from the angel into st
john s road  struck down the small street which terminates at sadler s wells theatre  through exmouth street and coppice row  down the little court by the side of the workhouse  across the classic ground which once bore the name of hockley in the hole  thence into little saffron hill  and so into saffron hill the great  along which the dodger scudded at a rapid pace  directing oliver to follow close at his heels
although oliver had enough to occupy his attention in keeping sight of his leader  he could not help bestowing a few hasty glances on either side of the way  as he passed along
a dirtier or more wretched place he had never seen the street was very narrow and muddy  and the air was impregnated with filthy odours
there were a good many small shops  but the only stock in trade appeared to be heaps of children  who  even at that time of night  were crawling in and out at the doors  or screaming from the inside
the sole places that seemed to prosper amid the general blight of the place  were the public houses  and in them  the lowest orders of irish were wrangling with might and main
covered ways and yards  which here and there diverged from the main street  disclosed little knots of houses  where drunken men and women were positively wallowing in filth  and from several of the door ways  great ill looking fellows were cautiously emerging  bound  to all appearance  on no very well disposed or harmless errands
oliver was just considering whether he hadn t better run away  when they reached the bottom of the hill
his conductor  catching him by the arm  pushed open the door of a house near field lane  and drawing him into the passage  closed it behind them
 now  then   cried a voice from below  in reply to a whistle from the dodger
 plummy and slam   was the reply
this seemed to be some watchword or signal that all was right  for the light of a feeble candle gleamed on the wall at the remote end of the passage  and a man s face peeped out  from where a balustrade of the old kitchen staircase had been broken away
 there s two on you   said the man  thrusting the candle farther out  and shielding his eyes with his hand
 who s the t other one    a new pal   replied jack dawkins  pulling oliver forward
90 oliver twist  where did he come from    greenland
is fagin upstairs    yes  he s a sortin  the wipes
up with you   the candle was drawn back  and the face disappeared
oliver  groping his way with one hand  and having the other firmly grasped by his companion  ascended with much difficulty the dark and broken stairs  which his conductor mounted with an ease and expedition that showed he was well acquainted with them
he threw open the door of a back room  and drew oliver in after him
the walls and ceiling of the room were perfectly black with age and dirt
there was a deal table before the fire  upon which were a candle  stuck in a ginger beer bottle  two or three pewter pots  a loaf and butter  and a plate
in a frying pan  which was on the fire  and which was secured to the mantelshelf by a string  some sausages were cooking  and standing over them  with a toasting fork in his hand  was a very old shrivelled jew  whose villainous looking and repulsive face was obscured by a quantity of matted red hair
he was dressed in a greasy flannel gown  with his throat bare  and seemed to be dividing his attention between the frying pan and the clothes horse  over which a great number of silk handkerchiefsl were hanging
several rough beds made of old sacks  were huddled side by side on the floor
seated round the table were four or five boys  none older than the dodger  smoking long clay pipes  and drinking spirits with the air of middle aged men
these all crowded about their associate as he whispered a few words to the jew  and then turned round and grinned at oliver
so did the jew himself  toasting fork in hand  this is him  fagin   said jack dawkins   my friend oliver twist   the jew grinned  and  making a low obeisance to oliver  took him by the hand  and hoped he should have the honour of his intimate acquaintance
upon this  the young gentleman with the pipes came round him  and shook both his hands very hard—especially the one in which he held his little bundle
one young gentleman was very anxious to hang up his cap for him  and another was so obliging as to put his hands in his pockets  in order that  as he was very tired  he might not have the trouble of emptying them  himself  when he went to bed these civilities would probably be extended much farther  but for a liberal exercise of the jew s toasting fork on the heads and shoulders of the affectionate youths who offered them
 we are very glad to see you  oliver  very   said the jew
 dodger  take off the sausages  and draw a tub near the fire for oliver
ah  you re a staring at the pocket handkerchiefs  eh  my dear
there are a good many of  em  ain t there  we ve just looked  em out  ready for the wash  that s all  oliver  that s all
ha  ha  ha   the latter part of this speech  was hailed by a boisterous shout from all the hopeful pupils of the merry old gentleman
in the midst of which they went to supper
oliver ate his share  and the jew then mixed him a glass of hot gin and water  telling him he must drink it off directly  because another gentleman wanted the tumbler
92 oliver twist oliver did as he was desired
immediately afterwards he felt himself gently lifted on to one of the sacks  and then he sunk into a deep sleep containing further particulars concerning the pleasant old gentleman  and his hopeful pupils i t was late next morning when oliver awoke  from a sound  long sleep
there was no other person in the room but the old jew  who was boiling some coffee in a saucepan for breakfast  and whistling softly to himself as he stirred it round and round  with an iron spoon he would stop every now and then to listen when there was the least noise below  and when he had satistified himself  he would go on whistling and stirring again  as before although oliver had roused himself from sleep  he was not thoroughly awake there is a drowsy state  between 94 oliver twist sleeping and waking  when you dream more in five minutes with your eyes half open  and yourself half conscious of everything that is passing around you  than you would in five nights with your eyes fast closed  and your senses wrapt in perfect unconsciousness
at such time  a mortal knows just enough of what his mind is doing  to form some glimmering conception of its mighty powers  its bounding from earth and spurning time and space  when freed from the restraint of its corporeal associate
oliver was precisely in this condition
he saw the jew with his half closed eyes  heard his low whistling  and recognised the sound of the spoon grating against the saucepan s sides  and yet the self same senses were mentally engaged  at the same time  in busy action with almost everybody he had ever known
when the coffee was done  the jew drew the saucepan to the hob
standing  then in an irresolute attitude for a few minutes  as if he did not well know how to employ himself  he turned round and looked at oliver  and called him by his name he did not answer  and was to all appearances asleep
after satisfiying himself upon this head  the jew stepped gently to the door  which he fastened he then drew forth  as it seemed to oliver  from some trap in the floor  a small box  which he placed carefully on the table
his eyes glistened as he raised the lid  and looked in
dragging an old chair to the table  he sat down  and took from it a magnificent gold watch  sparkling with jewels
 aha   said the jew  shrugging up his shoulders  and distorting every feature with a hideous grin
 clever dogs  clever dogs  staunch to the last  never told the old parson where they were
never poached upon old fagin  and why should they  it wouldn t have loosened the knot  or kept the drop up  a minute longer
no  no  no  fine fellows  fine fellows   with these  and other muttered reflections of the like nature  the jew once more deposited the watch in its place of safety
at least half a dozen more were severally drawn forth from the same box  and surveyed with equal pleasure  besides rings  brooches  bracelet  and other articles of jewellery  of such magnificent materials  and costly workmanship  that oliver had no idea  even of their names
having replaced these trinkets  the jew took out another  so small that it lay in the palm of his hand
there seemed to be some very minute inscription on it  for the jew laid it flat upon the table  and shading it with his hand  pored over it  long and earnestly
at length he put it down  as if despairing of success  and  leaning back in his chair  muttered   what a fine thing capital punishment is  dead men never repent  dead men never bring awkward stories to light
ah  it s a fine thing for the trade  five of  em strung up in a row  and none left to play booty  or turn white livered   as the jew uttered these words  his bright dark eyes  which had been staring vacantly before him  fell on oliver s face  the boy s eyes were fixed on his in mute curiousity  and although the recognition was only for an instant—for the briefest space of time that can possibly be conceived—it was enough to show the old man that he had been observed
96 oliver twist he closed the lid of the box with a loud crash  and  laying his hand on a bread knife which was on the table  started furiously up
he trembled very much though  for  even in his terror  oliver could see that the knife quivered in the air
 what s that   said the jew
 what do you watch me for  why are you awake  what have you seen  speak out  boy  quick—quick  for your life
 i wasn t able to sleep any longer  sir   replied oliver  meekly
 i am very sorry if i have disturbed you  sir    you were not awake an hour ago   said the jew  scowling fiercely on the boy
 no  no  indeed   replied oliver
 are you sure   cried the jew  with a still fiercer look than before  and a threatening attitude
 upon my word i was not  sir   replied oliver  earnestly
 i was not  indeed  sir    tush  tush  my dear   said the jew  abruptly resuming his old manner  and playing with the knife a little  before he laid it down  as if to induce the belief that he had caught it up  in mere sport
 of course i know that  my dear
i only tried to frighten you
you re a brave boy
ha  ha  you re a brave boy  oliver   the jew rubbed his hands with a chuckle  but glanced uneasily at the box  notwithstanding
 did you see any of these pretty things  my dear   said the jew  laying his hand upon it after a short pause
 yes  sir   replied oliver
 ah   said the jew  turning rather pale
 they—they re mine  oliver  my little property
all i have to live upon  in my old age
the folks call me a miser  my dear
only a miser  that s all   oliver thought the old gentleman must be a decided miser to live in such a dirty place  with so many watches  but  thinking that perhaps his fondness for the dodger and the other boys  cost him a good deal of money  he only cast a deferential look at the jew  and asked if he might get up
 certainly  my dear  certainly   replied the old gentleman
 stay
there s a pitcher of water in the corner by the door
bring it here  and i ll give you a basin to wash in  my dear   oliver got up  walked across the room  and stooped for an instant to raise the pitcher
when he turned his head  the box was gone
he had scarcely washed himself  and made everything tidy  by emptying the basin out of the window  agreeably to the jew s directions  when the dodger returned  accompanied by a very sprightly young friend  whom oliver had seen smoking on the previous night  and who was now formally introduced to him as charley bates the four sat down  to breakfast  on the coffee  and some hot rolls and ham which the dodger had brought home in the crown of his hat
 well   said the jew  glancing slyly at oliver  and addressing himself to the dodger   i hope you ve been at work this morning  my dears    hard   replied the dodger  as nails   added charley bates
 good boys  good boys   said the jew
 what have you got  dodger    a couple of pocket books   replied that young gentlman
98 oliver twist  lined   inquired the jew  with eagerness
 pretty well   replied the dodger  producing two pocketbooks  one green  and the other red
 not so heavy as they might be   said the jew  after looking at the insides carefully   but very neat and nicely made
ingenious workman  ain t he  oliver    very indeed  sir   said oliver
at which mr charles bates laughed uproariously  very much to the amazement of oliver  who saw nothing to laugh at  in anything that had passed
 and what have you got  my dear   said fagin to charley bates
 wipes   replied master bates  at the same time producing four pocket handkerchiefs
 well   said the jew  inspecting them closely   they re very good ones  very
you haven t marked them well  though  charley  so the marks shall be picked out with a needle  and we ll teach oliver how to do it
shall us  oliver  eh  ha  ha  ha    if you please  sir   said oliver
 you d like to be able to make pocket handkerchiefs as easy as charley bates  wouldn t you  my dear   said the jew
 very much  indeed  if you ll teach me  sir   replied oliver
master bates saw something so exquisitely ludicrous in this reply  that he burst into another laugh  which laugh  meeting the coffee he was drinking  and carrying it down some wrong channel  very nearly terminated in his premature suffocation
 he is so jolly green   said charley when he recovered  as an apology to the company for his unpolite behaviour
the dodger said nothing  but he smoothed oliver s hair over his eyes  and said he d know better  by and by  upon which the old gentleman  observing oliver s colour mounting  changed the subject by asking whether there had been much of a crowd at the execution that morning  this made him wonder more and more  for it was plain from the replies of the two boys that they had both been there  and oliver naturally wondered how they could possibly have found time to be so very industrious
when the breakfast was cleared away  the merry old gentlman and the two boys played at a very curious and uncommon game  which was performed in this way
the merry old gentleman  placing a snuff box in one pocket of his trousers  a note case in the other  and a watch in his waistcoat pocket  with a guard chain round his neck  and sticking a mock diamond pin in his shirt  buttoned his coat tight round him  and putting his spectacle case and handkerchief in his pockets  trotted up and down the room with a stick  in imitation of the manner in which old gentlmen walk about the streets any hour in the day
sometimes he stopped at the fire place  and sometimes at the door  making believe that he was staring with all his might into shop windows
at such times  he would look constantly round him  for fear of thieves  and would keep slapping all his pockets in turn  to see that he hadn t lost anything  in such a very funny and natural manner  that oliver laughed till the tears ran down his face
all this time  the two boys followed him 100 oliver twist closely about  getting out of his sight  so nimbly  every time he turned round  that it was impossible to follow their motions
at last  the dodger trod upon his toes  or ran upon his boot accidently  while charley bates stumbled up against him behind  and in that one moment they took from him  with the most extraordinary rapidity  snuff box  note case  watch guard  chain  shirt pin  pocket handkerchief  even the spectacle case
if the old gentlman felt a hand in any one of his pockets  he cried out where it was  and then the game began all over again
when this game had been played a great many times  a couple of young ladies called to see the young gentleman  one of whom was named bet  and the other nancy
they wore a good deal of hair  not very neatly turned up behind  and were rather untidy about the shoes and stockings
they were not exactly pretty  perhaps  but they had a great deal of colour in their faces  and looked quite stout and hearty
being remarkably free and agreeable in their manners  oliver thought them very nice girls indeed
as there is no doubt they were
the visitors stopped a long time
spirits were produced  in consequence of one of the young ladies complaining of a coldness in her inside  and the conversation took a very convivial and improving turn
at length  charley bates expressed his opinion that it was time to pad the hoof
this  it occurred to oliver  must be french for going out  for directly afterwards  the dodger  and charley  and the two young ladies  went away together  having been kindly furnished by the amiable old jew with money to spend
 there  my dear   said fagin
 that s a pleasant life  isn t it  they have gone out for the day    have they done work  sir   inquired oliver
 yes   said the jew   that is  unless they should unexpectedly come across any  when they are out  and they won t neglect it  if they do  my dear  depend upon it
make  em your models  my dear
make  em your models   tapping the fire shovel on the hearth to add force to his words   do everything they bid you  and take their advice in all matters—especially the dodger s  my dear
he ll be a great man himself  and will make you one too  if you take pattern by him —is my handkerchief hanging out of my pocket  my dear   said the jew  stopping short  yes  sir   said oliver
 see if you can take it out  without my feeling it  as you saw them do  when we were at play this morning   oliver held up the bottom of the pocket with one hand  as he had seen the dodger hold it  and drew the handkerchief lighty out of it with the other
 is it gone   cried the jew
 here it is  sir   said oliver  showing it in his hand
 you re a clever boy  my dear   said the playful old gentleman  patting oliver on the head approvingly
 i never saw a sharper lad
here s a shilling for you
if you go on  in this way  you ll be the greatest man of the time
and now come here  and i ll show you how to take the marks out of the handkerchiefs   102 oliver twist oliver wondered what picking the old gentleman s pocket in play  had to do with his chances of being a great man
but  thinking that the jew  being so much his senior  must know best  he followed him quietly to the table  and was soon deeply involved in his new study
oliver becomes better acquainted with the characters of his new associates  and purchases experience at a high price
being a short  but very in this history for many days  oliver remained in the jew s room  picking the marks out of the pocket handkerchief  (of which a great number were brought home ) and sometimes taking part in the game already described  which the two boys 104 oliver twist and the jew played  regularly  every morning
at length  he began to languish for fresh air  and took many occasions of earnestly entreating the old gentleman to allow him to go out to work with his two companions
oliver was rendered the more anxious to be actively employed  by what he had seen of the stern morality of the old gentleman s character
whenever the dodger or charley bates came home at night  empty handed  he would expatiate with great vehemence on the misery of idle and lazy habits  and would enforce upon them the necessity of an active life  by sending them supperless to bed
on one occasion  indeed  he even went so far as to knock them both down a flight of stairs  but this was carrying out his virtuous precepts to an unusual extent
at length  one morning  oliver obtained the permission he had so eagerly sought
there had been no handkerchiefs to work upon  for two or three days  and the dinners had been rather meagre
perhaps these were reasons for the old gentleman s giving his assent  but  whether they were or no  he told oliver he might go  and placed him under the joint guardianship of charley bates  and his friend the dodger
the three boys sallied out  the dodger with his coatsleeves tucked up  and his hat cocked  as usual  master bates sauntering along with his hands in his pockets  and oliver between them  wondering where they were going  and what branch of manufacture he would be instructed in  first
the pace at which they went  was such a very lazy  ill looking saunter  that oliver soon began to think his companions were going to deceive the old gentleman  by not going to work at all
the dodger had a vicious propensity  too  of pulling the caps from the heads of small boys and tossing them down areas  while charley bates exhibited some very loose notions concerning the rights of property  by pilfering divers apples and onions from the stalls at the kennel sides  and thrusting them into pockets which were so surprisingly capacious  that they seemed to undermine his whole suit of clothes in every direction
these things looked so bad  that oliver was on the point of declaring his intention of seeking his way back  in the best way he could  when his thoughts were suddenly directed into another channel  by a very mysterious change of behaviour on the part of the dodger
they were just emerging from a narrow court not far from the open square in clerkenwell  which is yet called  by some strange perversion of terms   the green   when the dodger made a sudden stop  and  laying his finger on his lip  drew his companions back again  with the greatest caution and circumspection  what s the matter   demanded oliver
 hush   replied the dodger
 do you see that old cove at the book stall    the old gentleman over the way   said oliver
 yes  i see him    he ll do   said the doger
 a prime plant   observed master charley bates
oliver looked from one to the other  with the greatest surprise  but he was not permitted to make any inquiries  for the two boys walked stealthily across the road  and slunk close behind the old gentleman towards whom his at  106 oliver twist tention had been directed
oliver walked a few paces after them  and  not knowing whether to advance or retire  stood looking on in silent amazement
the old gentleman was a very respectable looking personage  with a powdered head and gold spectacles
he was dressed in a bottle green coat with a black velvet collar  wore white trousers  and carried a smart bamboo cane under his arm
he had taken up a book from the stall  and there he stood  reading away  as hard as if he were in his elbow chair  in his own study
it is very possible that he fancied himself there  indeed  for it was plain  from his abstraction  that he saw not the book stall  nor the street  nor the boys  nor  in short  anything but the book itself  which he was reading straight through  turning over the leaf when he got to the bottom of a page  beginning at the top line of the next one  and going regularly on  with the greatest interest and eagerness what was oliver s horror and alarm as he stood a few paces off  looking on with his eyelids as wide open as they would possibly go  to see the dodger plunge his hand into the old gentleman s pocket  and draw from thence a handkerchief  to see him hand the same to charley bates  and finally to behold them  both running away round the corner at full speed  in an instant the whole mystery of the hankerchiefs  and the watches  and the jewels  and the jew  rushed upon the boy s mind
he stood  for a moment  with the blood so tingling through all his veins from terror  that he felt as if he were in a burning fire  then  confused and frightened  he took to his heels  and  not knowing what he did  made off as fast as he could lay his feet to the ground
this was all done in a minute s space
in the very instant when oliver began to run  the old gentleman  putting his hand to his pocket  and missing his handkerchief  turned sharp round
seeing the boy scudding away at such a rapid pace  he very naturally concluded him to be the depredator  and shouting  stop thief   with all his might  made off after him  book in hand
but the old gentleman was not the only person who raised the hue and cry
the dodger and master bates  unwilling to attract public attention by running down the open street  had merely retured into the very first doorway round the corner
they no sooner heard the cry  and saw oliver running  than  guessing exactly how the matter stood  they issued forth with great promptitude  and  shouting  stop thief   too  joined in the pursuit like good citizens
although oliver had been brought up by philosophers  he was not theoretically acquainted with the beautiful axiom that self preservation is the first law of nature
if he had been  perhaps he would have been prepared for this
not being prepared  however  it alarmed him the more  so away he went like the wind  with the old gentleman and the two boys roaring and shouting behind him
 stop thief  stop thief   there is a magic in the sound
the tradesman leaves his counter  and the car man his waggon  the butcher throws down his tray  the baker his basket  the milkman his pail  the errand boy his parcels  108 oliver twist the school boy his marbles  the paviour his pickaxe  the child his battledore
away they run  pell mell  helter skelter  slap dash  tearing  yelling  screaming  knocking down the passengers as they turn the corners  rousing up the dogs  and astonishing the fowls  and streets  squares  and courts  re echo with the sound
 stop thief  stop thief   the cry is taken up by a hundred voices  and the crowd accumulate at every turning
away they fly  splashing through the mud  and rattling along the pavements  up go the windows  out run the people  onward bear the mob  a whole audience desert punch in the very thickest of the plot  and  joining the rushing throng  swell the shout  and lend fresh vigour to the cry   stop thief  stop thief    stop thief  stop thief   there is a passion for hunting something deeply implanted in the human breast
one wretched breathless child  panting with exhaustion  terror in his looks  agaony in his eyes  large drops of perspiration streaming down his face  strains every nerve to make head upon his pursuers  and as they follow on his track  and gain upon him every instant  they hail his decreasing strength with joy  stop thief   ay  stop him for god s sake  were it only in mercy  stopped at last  a clever blow
he is down upon the pavement  and the crowd eagerly gather round him  each new comer  jostling and struggling with the others to catch a glimpse
 stand aside    give him a little air    nonsense  he don t deserve it    where s the gentleman    here his is  coming down the street    make room there for the gentleman    is this the boy  sir    yes   oliver lay  covered with mud and dust  and bleeding from the mouth  looking wildly round upon the heap of faces that surrounded him  when the old gentleman was officiously dragged and pushed into the circle by the foremost of the pursuers
 yes   said the gentleman   i am afraid it is the boy    afraid   murmured the crowd
 that s a good  un    poor fellow   said the gentleman   he has hurt himself    i did that  sir   said a great lubberly fellow  stepping forward   and preciously i cut my knuckle agin  his mouth i stopped him  sir   the follow touched his hat with a grin  expecting something for his pains  but  the old gentleman  eyeing him with an expression of dislike  look anxiously round  as if he contemplated running away himself  which it is very possible he might have attempted to do  and thus have afforded another chase  had not a police officer (who is generally the last person to arrive in such cases) at that moment made his way through the crowd  and seized oliver by the collar  come  get up   said the man  roughly
 it wasn t me indeed  sir
indeed  indeed  it was two other boys   said oliver  clasping his hands passionately  and looking round
 they are here somewhere    oh no  they ain t   said the officer
he meant this to be ironical  but it was true besides  for the dodger and charley bates had filed off down the first convenient court they came to
 come  get up   110 oliver twist  don t hurt him   said the old gentleman  compassionately
 oh no  i won t hurt him   replied the officer  tearing his jacket half off his back  in proof thereof
 come  i know you  it won t do
will you stand upon your legs  you young devil   oliver  who could hardly stand  made a shift to raise himself on his feet  and was at once lugged along the streets by the jacket collar  at a rapid pace the gentleman walked on with them by the officer s side  and as many of the crowd as could achieve the feat  got a little ahead  and stared back at oliver from time to time
the boys shouted in triumph  and on they went
treats of mr fang the police magistrate  and furnishes a slight specimen of his mode of administering justice the offence had been committed within the district  and indeed in the immediate neighborhood of  a very notorious metropolitan police office
the crowd had only the satisfaction of accompanying oliver through two or three streets  and down a place called mutton hill  when he was led beneath a low archway  and up a dirty court  into this dispensary of summary justice  by the back way
it was a small paved yard into which they turned  and here they encountered a stout man with a bunch of whiskers on his face  and a bunch of keys in his hand
 what s the matter now   said the man carelessly
 a young fogle hunter   replied the man who had oliver 112 oliver twist in charge
 are you the party that s been robbed  sir   inquired the man with the keys
 yes  i am   replied the old gentleman   but i am not sure that this boy actually took the handkerchief
i—i would rather not press the case    must go before the magistrate now  sir   replied the man
 his worship will be disengaged in half a minute
now  young gallows   this was an invitation for oliver to enter through a door which he unlocked as he spoke  and which led into a stone cell
here he was searched  and nothing being found upon him  locked up
this cell was in shape and size something like an area cellar  only not so light
it was most intolably dirty  for it was monday morning  and it had been tenanted by six drunken people  who had been locked up  elsewhere  since saturday night
but this is little
in our station houses  men and women are every night confined on the most trivial charges—the word is worth noting—in dungeons  compared with which  those in newgate  occupied by the most atrocious felons  tried  found guilty  and under sentence of death  are palaces
let any one who doubts this  compare the two
the old gentleman looked almost as rueful as oliver when the key grated in the lock
he turned with a sigh to the book  which had been the innocent cause of all this disturbance
 there is something in that boy s face   said the old gentleman to himself as he walked slowly away  tapping his chin with the cover of the book  in a thoughtful manner   something that touches and interests me can he be innocent  he looked like—bye the bye   exclaimed the old gentleman  halting very abruptly  and staring up into the sky   bless my soul —where have i seen something like that look before   after musing for some minutes  the old gentleman walked  with the same meditative face  into a back anteroom opening from the yard  and there  retiring into a corner  called up before his mind s eye a vast amphitheatre of faces over which a dusky curtain had hung for many years
 no   said the old gentleman  shaking his head   it must be imagination
he wandered over them again
he had called them into view  and it was not easy to replace the shroud that had so long concealed them
there were the faces of friends  and foes  and of many that had been almost strangers peering intrusively from the crowd  there were the faces of young and blooming girls that were now old women  there were faces that the grave had changed and closed upon  but which the mind  superior to its power  still dressed in their old freshness and beauty  calling back the lustre of the eyes  the brightness of the smile  the beaming of the soul through its mask of clay  and whispering of beauty beyond the tomb  changed but to be heightened  and taken from earth only to be set up as a light  to shed a soft and gentle glow upon the path to heaven
but the old gentleman could recall no one countenance of which oliver s features bore a trace
so  he heaved a sigh 114 oliver twist over the recollections he awakened  and being  happily for himself  an absent old gentleman  buried them again in the pages of the musty book he was roused by a touch on the shoulder  and a request from the man with the keys to follow him into the office
he closed his book hastily  and was at once ushered into the imposing presence of the renowned mr fang
the office was a front parlour  with a panelled wall
mr fang sat behind a bar  at the upper end  and on one side the door was a sort of wooden pen in which poor little oliver was already deposited  trembling very much at the awfulness of the scene
mr fang was a lean  long backed  stiff necked  middlesized man  with no great quantity of hair  and what he had  growing on the back and sides of his head
his face was stern  and much flushed
if he were really not in the habit of drinking rather more than was exactly good for him  he might have brought action against his countenance for libel  and have recovered heavy damages
the old gentleman bowed respectfully  and advancing to the magistrate s desk  said suiting the action to the word   that is my name and address  sir   he then withdrew a pace or two  and  with another polite and gentlemanly inclination of the head  waited to be questioned
now  it so happened that mr fang was at that moment perusing a leading article in a newspaper of the morning  adverting to some recent decision of his  and commending him  for the three hundred and fiftieth time  to the special and particular notice of the secretary of state for the home department
he was out of temper  and he looked up with an angry scowl
 who are you   said mr fang
the old gentleman pointed  with some surprise  to his card
 officer   said mr fang  tossing the card contemptuously away with the newspaper
 who is this fellow    my name  sir   said the old gentleman  speaking like a gentleman   my name  sir  is brownlow
permit me to inquire the name of the magistrate who offers a gratuitous and unprovoked insult to a respectable person  under the protection of the bench   saying this  mr brownlow looked around the office as if in search of some person who would afford him the required information
 officer   said mr fang  throwing the paper on one side   what s this fellow charged with    he s not charged at all  your worship   replied the officer
 he appears against this boy  your worship   his worshp knew this perfectly well  but it was a good annoyance  and a safe one
 appears against the boy  does he   said mr fang  surveying mr brownlow contemptuously from head to foot
 swear him    before i am sworn  i must beg to say one word   said mr brownlow   and that is  that i really never  without actual experience  could have believed—   hold your tongue  sir   said mr fang  peremptorily
 i will not  sir   replied the old gentleman
 hold your tongue this instant  or i ll have you turned 116 oliver twist out of the office   said mr fang
 you re an insolent impertinent fellow
how dare you bully a magistrate    what   exclaimed the old gentleman  reddening
 swear this person   said fang to the clerk
 i ll not hear another word
swear him   mr brownlow s indignaton was greatly roused  but reflecting perhaps  that he might only injure the boy by giving vent to it  he suppressed his feelings and submitted to be sworn at once
 now   said fang   what s the charge against this boy  what have you got to say  sir    i was standing at a bookstall—  mr brownlow began
 hold your tongue  sir   said mr fang
 policeman  where s the policeman  here  swear this policeman
now  policeman  what is this   the policeman  with becoming humility  related how he had taken the charge  how he had searched oliver  and found nothing on his person  and how that was all he knew about it
 are there any witnesses   inquired mr fang
 none  your worship   replied the policeman
mr fang sat silent for some minutes  and then  turning round to the prosecutor  said in a towering passion
 do you mean to state what your complaint against this boy is  man  or do you not  you have been sworn
now  if you stand there  refusing to give evidence  i ll punish you for disrespect to the bench  i will  by—  by what  or by whom  nobody knows  for the clerk and jailor coughed very loud  just at the right moment  and the former dropped a heavy book upon the floor  thus preventing the word from being heard—accidently  of course
with many interruptions  and repeated insults  mr brownlow contrived to state his case  observing that  in the surprise of the moment  he had run after the boy because he had saw him running away  and expressing his hope that  if the magistrate should believe him  although not actually the thief  to be connected with the thieves  he would deal as leniently with him as justice would allow
 he has been hurt already   said the old gentleman in conclusion
 and i fear   he added  with great energy  looking towards the bar   i really fear that he is ill    oh  yes  i dare say   said mr fang  with a sneer
 come  none of your tricks here  you young vagabond  they won t do
what s your name   oliver tried to reply but his tongue failed him
he was deadly pale  and the whole place seemed turning round and round
 what s your name  you hardened scoundrel   demanded mr fang
 officer  what s his name   this was addressed to a bluff old fellow  in a striped waistcoat  who was standing by the bar
he bent over oliver  and repeated the inquiry  but finding him really incapable of understanding the question  and knowing that his not replying would only infuriate the magistrate the more  and add to the severity of his sentence  he hazarded a guess
 he says his name s tom white  your worship   said the kind hearted thief taker
118 oliver twist  oh  he won t speak out  won t he   said fang
 very well  very well
where does he live    where he can  your worship   replied the officer  again pretending to receive oliver s answer
 has he any parents   inquired mr fang
 he says they died in his infancy  your worship   replied the officer  hazarding the usual reply
at this point of the inquiry  oliver raised his head  and  looking round with imploring eyes  murmured a feeble prayer for a draught of water
 stuff and nonsense   said mr fang   don t try to make a fool of me    i think he really is ill  your worship   remonstrated the officer
 i know better   said mr fang
 take care of him  officer   said the old gentleman  raising his hands instinctively   he ll fall down    stand away  officer   cried fang   let him  if he likes   oliver availed himself of the kind permission  and fell to the floor in a fainting fit the men in the office looked at each other  but no one dared to stir
 i knew he was shamming   said fang  as if this were incontestable proof of the fact
 let him lie there  he ll soon be tired of that    how do you propose to deal with the case  sir   inquired the clerk in a low voice
 summarily   replied mr fang
 he stands committed for three months—hard labour of course
clear the office   the door was opened for this purpose  and a couple of men were preparing to carry the insensible boy to his cell  when an elderly man of decent but poor appearance  clad in an old suit of black  rushed hastily into the office  and advanced towards the bench
 stop  stop  don t take him away  for heaven s sake stop a moment   cried the new comer  breathless with haste
although the presiding genii in such an office as this  exercise a summary and arbitrary power over the liberties  the good name  the character  almost the lives  of her majesty s subjects  expecially of the poorer class  and although  within such walls  enough fantastic tricks are daily played to make the angels blind with weeping  they are closed to the public  save through the medium of the daily press (footnote  or were virtually  then ) mr fang was consequently not a little indignant to see an unbidden guest enter in such irreverent disorder
 what is this  who is this  turn this man out
clear the office   cried mr fang
 i will speak   cried the man   i will not be turned out
i saw it all
i keep the book stall
i demand to be sworn
i will not be put down
mr fang  you must hear me
you must not refuse  sir   the man was right
his manner was determined  and the matter was growing rather too serious to be hushed up
 swear the man   growled mr fang
with a very ill grace
 now  man  what have you got to say    this   said the man   i saw three boys  two others and the prisoner here  loitering on the opposite side of the way  when this gentleman was reading
the robbery was com  120 oliver twist mitted by another boy
i saw it done  and i saw that this boy was perfectly amazed and stupified by it   having by this time recovered a little breath  the worthy book stall keeper proceeded to relate  in a more coherent manner the exact circumstances of the robbery  why didn t you come here before   said fang  after a pause
 i hadn t a soul to mind the shop   replied the man
 everybody who could have helped me  had joined in the pursuit
i could get nobody till five minutes ago  and i ve run here all the way    the prosecutor was reading  was he   inquired fang  after another pause
 yes   replied the man
 the very book he has in his hand    oh  that book  eh   said fang
 is it paid for    no  it is not   replied the man  with a smile
 dear me  i forgot all about it   exclaimed the absent old gentleman  innocently
 a nice person to prefer a charge against a poor boy   said fang  with a comical effort to look humane
 i consider  sir  that you have obtained possession of that book  under very suspicious and disreputable circumstances  and you may think yourself very fortunate that the owner of the property declines to prosecute let this be a lesson to you  my man  or the law will overtake you yet
the boy is discharged
clear the office    d—n me   cried the old gentleman  bursting out with the rage he had kept down so long   d—n me  i ll—   clear the office   said the magistrate
 officers  do you hear  clear the office   the mandate was obeyed  and the indignant mr brownlow was conveyed out  with the book in one hand  and the bamboo cane in the other  in a perfect phrenzy of rage and defiance
he reached the yard  and his passion vanished in a moment
little oliver twist lay on his back on the pavement  with his shirt unbuttoned  and his temples bathed with water  his face a deadly white  and a cold tremble convulsing his whole frame
 poor boy  poor boy   said mr brownlow  bending over him
 call a coach  somebody  pray
directly   a coach was obtained  and oliver having been carefully laid on the seat  the old gentleman got in and sat himself on the other  may i accompany you   said the book stall keeper  looking in
 bless me  yes  my dear sir   said mr brownlow quickly
 i forgot you
dear  dear  i have this unhappy book still  jump in
poor fellow  there s no time to lose   the book stall keeper got into the coach  and away they drove
122 oliver twist in which oliver is taken better care of than he ever was before
and in which the narrative reverts to the merry old gentleman and his youthful friends
the coach rattled away  over nearly the same ground as that which oliver had traversed when he first entered london in company with the dodger  and  turning a different way when it reached the angel at islington  stopped at length before a neat house  in a quiet shady street near pentonville
here  a bed was prepared  without loss of time  in which mr brownlow saw his young charge carefully and comfortably deposited  and here  he was tended with a kindness and solicitude that knew no bounds
but  for many days  oliver remained insensible to all the goodness of his new friends
the sun rose and sank  and rose and sank again  and many times after that  and still the boy lay stretched on his uneasy bed  dwindling away beneath the dry and wasting heat of fever the worm does not work more surely on the dead body  than does this slow creeping fire upon the living frame
weak  and thin  and pallid  he awoke at last from what seemed to have been a long and troubled dream
feebly raising himself in the bed  with his head resting on his trembling arm  he looked anxiously around  what room is this  where have i been brought to   said oliver
 this is not the place i went to sleep in   he uttered these words in a feeble voice  being very faint and weak  but they were overheard at once
the curtain at the bed s head was hastily drawn back  and a motherly old lady  very neatly and precisely dressed  rose as she undrew it  from an arm chair close by  in which she had been sitting at needle work
 hush  my dear   said the old lady softly
 you must be very quiet  or you will be ill again  and you have been very bad —as bad as bad could be  pretty nigh
lie down again  there s a dear   with those words  the old lady very gently placed oliver s head upon the pillow  and  smoothing back his hair from his forehead  looked so kindly and loving in his face  that he could not help placing his little withered 124 oliver twist hand in hers  and drawing it round his neck
 save us   said the old lady  with tears in her eyes
 what a grateful little dear it is
pretty creetur  what would his mother feel if she had sat by him as i have  and could see him now    perhaps she does see me   whispered oliver  folding his hands together   perhaps she has sat by me
i almost feel as if she had    that was the fever  my dear   said the old lady mildly
 i suppose it was   replied oliver   because heaven is a long way off  and they are too happy there  to come down to the bedside of a poor boy
but if she knew i was ill  she must have pitied me  even there  for she was very ill herself before she died
she can t know anything about me though   added oliver after a moment s silence
 if she had seen me hurt  it would have made here sorrowful  and her face has always looked sweet and happy  when i have dreamed of her   the old lady made no reply to this  but wiping her eyes first  and her spectacles  which lay on the counterpane  afterwards  as if they were part and parcel of those features  brought some cool stuff for oliver to drink  and then  patting him on the cheek  told him he must lie very quiet  or he would be ill again
so  oliver kept very still  partly because he was anxious to obey the kind old lady in all things  and partly  to tell the truth  because he was completely exhausted with what he had already said
he soon fell into a gentle doze  from which he was awakened by the light of a candle  which  being brought near the bed  showed him a gentleman with a very large and loud ticking gold watch in his hand  who felt his pulse  and said he was a great deal better
 you are a great deal better  are you not  my dear   said the gentleman
 yes  thank you  sir   replied oliver
 yes  i know you are   said the gentleman   you re hungry too  an t you    no  sir   answered oliver
 hem   said the gentleman
 no  i know you re not
he is not hungry  mrs bedwin   said the gentleman  looking very wise the old lady made a respectful inclination of the head  which seemed to say that she thought the doctor was a very clever man
the doctor appeared much of the same opinion himself  you feel sleepy  don t you  my dear   said the doctor
 no  sir   replied oliver
 no   said the doctor  with a very shrewd and satisfied look
 you re not sleepy
nor thirsty
are you    yes  sir  rather thirsty   answered oliver
 just as i expected  mrs bedwin   said the doctor  it s very natural that he should be thirsty
you may give him a little tea  ma am  and some dry toast without any butter
don t keep him too warm  ma am  but be careful that you don t let him be too cold  will you have the goodness   the old lady dropped a curtsey
the doctor  after tasting the cool stuff  and expressing a qualified approval of it  hurried away  his boots creaking in a very important and wealthy manner as he went downstairs
126 oliver twist oliver dozed off again  soon after this  when he awoke  it was nearly twelve o clock
the old lady tenderly bade him good night shortly afterwards  and left him in charge of a fat old woman who had just come  bringing with her  in a little bundle  a small prayer book and a large nightcap
putting the latter on her head and the former on the table  the old woman  after telling oliver that she had come to sit up with him  drew her chair close to the fire and went off into a series of short naps  chequered at frequent intervals with sundry tumblings forward  and divers moans and chokings
these  however  had no worse effect than causing her to rub her nose very hard  and then fall asleep again
and thus the night crept slowly on
oliver lay awake for some time  counting the little circles of light which the reflection of the rushlight shade threw upon the ceiling  or tracing with his languid eyes the intricate pattern of the paper on the wall
the darkness and the deep stillness of the room were very solemn  as they brought into the boy s mind the thought that death had been hovering there  for many days and nights  and might yet fill it with the gloom and dread of his awful presence  he turned his face upon the pillow  and fervently prayed to heaven
gradually  he fell into that deep tranquil sleep which ease from recent suffering alone imparts  that calm and peaceful rest which it is pain to wake from
who  if this were death  would be roused again to all the struggles and turmoils of life  to all its cares for the present  its anxieties for the future  more than all  its weary recollections of the past  it had been bright day  for hours  when oliver opened his eyes  he felt cheerful and happy
the crisis of the disease was safely past
he belonged to the world again
in three days  time he was able to sit in an easy chair  well propped up with pillows  and  as he was still too weak to walk  mrs bedwin had him carried downstairs into the little housekeeper s room  which belonged to her having him set  here  by the fire side  the good old lady sat herself down too  and  being in a state of considerable delight at seeing him so much better  forthwith began to cry most violently
 never mind me  my dear   said the old lady   i m only having a regular good cry
there  it s all over now  and i m quite comfortable    you re very  very kind to me  ma am   said oliver
 well  never you mind that  my dear   said the old lady   that s got nothing to do with your broth  and it s full time you had it  for the doctor says mr brownlow may come in to see you this morning  and we must get up our best looks  because the better we look  the more he ll be pleased   and with this  the old lady applied herself to warming up  in a little saucepan  a basin full of broth  strong enough  oliver thought  to furnish an ample dinner  when reduced to the regulation strength  for three hundred and fifty paupers  at the lowest computation
 are you fond of pictures  dear   inquired the old lady  seeing that oliver had fixed his eyes  most intently  on a portrait which hung against the wall  just opposite his chair
 i don t quite know  ma am   said oliver  without taking his eyes from the canvas   i have seen so few that i hardly 128 oliver twist know
what a beautiful  mild face that lady s is    ah   said the old lady   painters always make ladies out prettier than they are  or they wouldn t get any custom  child
the man that invented the machine for taking likenesses might have known that would never succeed  it s a deal too honest
a deal   said the old lady  laughing very heartily at her own acuteness
 is—is that a likeness  ma am   said oliver
 yes   said the old lady  looking up for a moment from the broth   that s a portrait    whose  ma am   asked oliver
 why  really  my dear  i don t know   answered the old lady in a good humoured manner
 it s not a likeness of anybody that you or i know  i expect
it seems to strike your fancy  dear    it is so pretty   replied oliver  why  sure you re not afraid of it   said the old lady  observing in great surprise  the look of awe with which the child regarded the painting
 oh no  no   returned oliver quickly   but the eyes look so sorrowful  and where i sit  they seem fixed upon me
it makes my heart beat   added oliver in a low voice   as if it was alive  and wanted to speak to me  but couldn t    lord save us   exclaimed the old lady  starting   don t talk in that way  child
you re weak and nervous after your illness
let me wheel your chair round to the other side  and then you won t see it
there   said the old lady  suiting the action to the word   you don t see it now  at all events   oliver did see it in his mind s eye as distinctly as if he had not altered his position  but he thought it better not to worry the kind old lady  so he smiled gently when she looked at him  and mrs bedwin  satisfied that he felt more comfortable  salted and broke bits of toasted bread into the broth  with all the bustle befitting so solemn a preparation oliver got through it with extraordinary expedition
he had scarcely swallowed the last spoonful  when there came a soft rap at the door
 come in   said the old lady  and in walked mr brownlow
now  the old gentleman came in as brisk as need be  but  he had no sooner raised his spectacles on his forehead  and thrust his hands behind the skirts of his dressing gown to take a good long look at oliver  than his countenance underwent a very great variety of odd contortions
oliver looked very worn and shadowy from sickness  and made an ineffectual attempt to stand up  out of respect to his benefactor  which terminated in his sinking back into the chair again  and the fact is  if the truth must be told  that mr brownlow s heart  being large enough for any six ordinary old gentlemen of humane disposition  forced a supply of tears into his eyes  by some hydraulic process which we are not sufficiently philosophical to be in a condition to explain
 poor boy  poor boy   said mr brownlow  clearing his throat
 i m rather hoarse this morning  mrs bedwin i m afraid i have caught cold    i hope not  sir   said mrs bedwin  everything you have had  has been well aired  sir    i don t know  bedwin
i don t know   said mr brownlow  130 oliver twist  i rather think i had a damp napkin at dinner time yesterday  but never mind that
how do you feel  my dear    very happy  sir   replied oliver
 and very grateful indeed  sir  for your goodness to me    good by   said mr brownlow  stoutly
 have you given him any nourishment  bedwin  any slops  eh    he has just had a basin of beautiful strong broth  sir   replied mrs bedwin  drawing herself up slightly  and laying strong emphasis on the last word  to intimate that between slops  and broth will compounded  there existed no affinity or connection whatsoever  ugh   said mr brownlow  with a slight shudder   a couple of glasses of port wine would have done him a great deal more good
wouldn t they  tom white  eh    my name is oliver  sir   replied the little invalid  with a look of great astonishment
 oliver   said mr brownlow   oliver what  oliver white  eh    no  sir  twist  oliver twist    queer name   said the old gentleman
 what made you tell the magistrate your name was white    i never told him so  sir   returned oliver in amazement
this sounded so like a falsehood  that the old gentleman looked somewhat sternly in oliver s face
it was impossible to doubt him  there was truth in every one of its thin and sharpened lineaments
 some mistake   said mr brownlow
but  although his motive for looking steadily at oliver no longer existed  the old idea of the resemblance between his features and some familiar face came upon him so strongly  that he could not withdraw his gaze
 i hope you are not angry with me  sir   said oliver  raising his eyes beseechingly
 no  no   replied the old gentleman
 why  what s this  bedwin  look there   as he spoke  he pointed hastily to the picture over oliver s head  and then to the boy s face
there was its living copy
the eyes  the head  the mouth  every feature was the same
the expression was  for the instant  so precisely alike  that the minutest line seemed copied with startling accuracy  oliver knew not the cause of this sudden exclamation  for  not being strong enough to bear the start it gave him  he fainted away
a weakness on his part  which affords the narrative an opportunity of relieving the reader from suspense  in behalf of the two young pupils of the merry old gentleman  and of recording— that when the dodger  and his accomplished friend master bates  joined in the hue and cry which was raised at oliver s heels  in consequence of their executing an illegal conveyance of mr brownlow s personal property  as has been already described  they were actuated by a very laudable and becoming regard for themselves  and forasmuch as the freedom of the subject and the liberty of the individual are among the first and proudest boasts of a true hearted englishman  so  i need hardly beg the reader to observe  that this action should tend to exalt them in the opinion of all public and patriotic men  in almost as great a degree as 132 oliver twist this strong proof of their anxiety for their own preservation and safety goes to corroborate and confirm the little code of laws which certain profound and sound judging philosophers have laid down as the main springs of all nature s deeds and actions  the said philosophers very wisely reducing the good lady s proceedings to matters of maxim and theory  and  by a very neat and pretty compliment to her exalted wisdom and understanding  putting entirely out of sight any considerations of heart  or generous impulse and feeling for  these are matters totally beneath a female who is acknowledged by universal admission to be far above the numerous little foibles and weaknesses of her sex
if i wanted any further proof of the strictly philosophical nature of the conduct of these young gentlemen in their very delicate predicament  i should at once find it in the fact (also recorded in a foregoing part of this narrative)  of their quitting the pursuit  when the general attention was fixed upon oliver  and making immediately for their home by the shortest possible cut
although i do not mean to assert that it is usually the practice of renowned and learned sages  to shorten the road to any great conclusion (their course indeed being rather to lengthen the distance  by various circumlocations and discursive staggerings  like unto those in which drunken men under the pressure of a too mighty flow of ideas  are prone to indulge)  still  i do mean to say  and do say distinctly  that it is the invariable practice of many mighty philosophers  in carrying out their theories  to evince great wisdom and foresight in providing against every possible contingency which can be supposed at all likely to affect themselves thus  to do a great right  you may do a little wrong  and you may take any means which the end to be attained  will justify  the amount of the right  or the amount of the wrong  or indeed the distinction between the two  being left entirely to the philosopher concerned  to be settled and determined by his clear  comprehensive  and impartial view of his own particular case
it was not until the two boys had scoured  with great rapidity  through a most intricate maze of narrow streets and courts  that they ventured to halt beneath a low and dark archway
having remained silent here  just long enough to recover breath to speak  master bates uttered an exclamation of amusement and delight  and  bursting into an uncontrollable fit of laughter  flung himself upon a doorstep  and rolled thereon in a transport of mirth  what s the matter   inquired the dodger
 ha  ha  ha   roared charley bates
 hold your noise   remonstrated the dodger  looking cautiously round
 do you want to be grabbed  stupid    i can t help it   said charley   i can t help it  to see him splitting away at that pace  and cutting round the corners  and knocking up again  the posts  and starting on again as if he was made of iron as well as them  and me with the wipe in my pocket  singing out arter him—oh  my eye   the vivid imagination of master bates presented the scene before him in too strong colours
as he arrived at this apostrophe  he again rolled upon the door step  and laughed louder than before
 what ll fagin say   inquired the dodger  taking advan  134 oliver twist tage of the next interval of breathlessness on the part of his friend to propound the question
 what   repeated charley bates
 ah  what   said the dodger
 why  what should he say   inquired charley  stopping rather suddenly in his merriment  for the dodger s manner was impressive
 what should he say   mr dawkins whistled for a couple of minutes  then  taking off his hat  scratched his head  and nodded thrice
 what do you mean   said charley
 toor rul lol loo  gammon and spinnage  the frog he wouldn t  and high cockolorum   said the dodger  with a slight sneer on his intellectual countenance
this was explanatory  but not satisfactory
master bates felt it so  and again said   what do you mean   the dodger made no reply  but putting his hat on again  and gathering the skirts of his long tailed coat under his arm  thrust his tongue into his cheek  slapped the bridge of his nose some half dozen times in a familiar but expressive manner  and turning on his heel  slunk down the court
master bates followed  with a thoughtful countenance
the noise of footsteps on the creaking stairs  a few minutes after the occurrence of this conversation  roused the merry old gentleman as he sat over the fire with a saveloy and a small loaf in his hand  a pocket knife in his right  and a pewter pot on the trivet
there was a rascally smile on his white face as he turned round  and looking sharply out from under his thick red eyebrows  bent his ear towards the door  and listened
 why  how s this   muttered the jew  changing countenance   only two of  em  where s the third  they can t have got into trouble
hark   the footsteps approached nearer  they reached the landing
the door was slowly opened  and the dodger and charley bates entered  closing it behind them
136 oliver twist some new acquaintances are introduced to the intelligent reader  connected with whom various pleasant matters are related  appertaining to this history  where s oliver   said the jew  rising with a menacing look
 where s the boy   the young thieves eyed their preceptor as if they were alarmed at his violence  and looked uneasily at each other
but they made no reply
 what s become of the boy   said the jew  seizing the dodger tightly by the collar  and threatening him with horrid imprecations
 speak out  or i ll throttle you   mr fagin looked so very much in earnest  that charley bates  who deemed it prudent in all cases to be on the safe side  and who conceived it by no means improbable that it might be his turn to be throttled second  dropped upon his knees  and raised a loud  well sustained  and continuous roar—something between a mad bull and a speaking trumpet
 will you speak   thundered the jew  shaking the dodger so much that his keeping in the big coat at all  seemed perfectly miraculous
 why  the traps have got him  and that s all about it   said the dodger  sullenly
 come  let go o  me  will you   and  swinging himself  at one jerk  clean out of the big coat  which he left in the jew s hands  the dodger snatched up the toasting fork  and made a pass at the merry old gentleman s waistcoat  which  if it had taken effect  would have let a little more merriment out  than could have been easily replaced the jew stepped back in this emergency  with more agility than could have been anticipated in a man of his apparent decrepitude  and  seizing up the pot  prepared to hurl it at his assailant s head
but charley bates  at this moment  calling his attention by a perfectly terrific howl  he suddenly altered its destination  and flung it full at that young gentleman
 why  what the blazes is in the wind now   growled a deep 138 oliver twist voice
 who pitched that  ere at me  it s well it s the beer  and not the pot  as hit me  or i d have settled somebody
i might have know d  as nobody but an infernal  rich  plundering  thundering old jew could afford to throw away any drink but water—and not that  unless he done the river company every quarter
wot s it all about  fagin  d—me  if my neckhandkercher an t lined with beer  come in  you sneaking warmint  wot are you stopping outside for  as if you was ashamed of your master  come in   the man who growled out these words  was a stoutlybuilt fellow of about five and thirty  in a black velveteen coat  very soiled drab breeches  lace up half boots  and grey cotton stockings which inclosed a bulky pair of legs  with large swelling calves —the kind of legs  which in such costume  always look in an unfinished and incomplete state without a set of fetters to garnish them
he had a brown hat on his head  and a dirty belcher handkerchief round his neck  with the long frayed ends of which he smeared the beer from his face as he spoke
he disclosed  when he had done so  a broad heavy countenance with a beard of three days  growth  and two scowling eyes  one of which displayed various parti coloured symptoms of having been recently damaged by a blow  come in  d ye hear   growled this engaging ruffian
a white shaggy dog  with his face scratched and torn in twenty different places  skulked into the room
 why didn t you come in afore   said the man
 you re getting too proud to own me afore company  are you  lie down   this command was accompanied with a kick  which sent the animal to the other end of the room
he appeared well used to it  however  for he coiled himself up in a corner very quietly  without uttering a sound  and winking his very illlooking eyes twenty times in a minute  appeared to occupy himself in taking a survey of the apartment  what are you up to  ill treating the boys  you covetous  avaricious  in sa ti a ble old fence   said the man  seating himself deliberately  i wonder they don t murder you  i would if i was them
if i d been your  prentice  i d have done it long ago  and—no  i couldn t have sold you afterwards  for you re fit for nothing but keeping as a curiousity of ugliness in a glass bottle  and i suppose they don t blow glass bottles large enough    hush  hush  mr sikes   said the jew  trembling   don t speak so loud    none of your mistering   replied the ruffian   you always mean mischief when you come that
you know my name  out with it  i shan t disgrace it when the time comes    well  well  then—bill sikes   said the jew  with abject humility
 you seem out of humour  bill    perhaps i am   replied sikes   i should think you was rather out of sorts too  unless you mean as little harm when you throw pewter pots about  as you do when you blab and—   are you mad   said the jew  catching the man by the sleeve  and pointing towards the boys
mr sikes contented himself with tying an imaginary knot under his left ear  and jerking his head over on the right shoulder  a piece of dumb show which the jew ap  140 oliver twist peared to understand perfectly he then  in cant terms  with which his whole conversation was plentifully besprinkled  but which would be quite unintelligible if they were recorded here  demanded a glass of liquor  and mind you don t poison it   said mr sikes  laying his hat upon the table
this was said in jest  but if the speaker could have seen the evil leer with which the jew bit his pale lip as he turned round to the cupboard  he might have thought the caution not wholly unnecessary  or the wish (at all events) to improve upon the distiller s ingenuity not very far from the old gentleman s merry heart
after swallowing two of three glasses of spirits  mr sikes condescended to take some notice of the young gentlemen  which gracious act led to a conversation  in which the cause and manner of oliver s capture were circumstantially detailed  with such alterations and improvements on the truth  as to the dodger appeared most advisable under the circumstances  i m afraid   said the jew   that he may say something which will get us into trouble    that s very likely   returned sikes with a malicious grin
 you re blowed upon  fagin    and i m afraid  you see  added the jew  speaking as if he had not noticed the interruption  and regarding the other closely as he did so — i m afraid that  if the game was up with us  it might be up with a good many more  and that it would come out rather worse for you than it would for me  my dear   the man started  and turned round upon the jew
but the old gentleman s shoulders were shrugged up to his ears  and his eyes were vacantly staring on the opposite wall
there was a long pause
every member of the respectable coterie appeared plunged in his own reflections  not excepting the dog  who by a certain malicious licking of his lips seemed to be meditating an attack upon the legs of the first gentleman or lady he might encounter in the streets when he went out
 somebody must find out wot s been done at the office   said mr sikes in a much lower tone than he had taken since he came in
the jew nodded assent
 if he hasn t peached  and is committed  there s no fear till he comes out again   said mr sikes   and then he must be taken care on
you must get hold of him somehow   again the jew nodded
the prudence of this line of action  indeed  was obvious  but  unfortunately  there was one very strong objection to its being adopted
this was  that the dodger  and charley bates  and fagin  and mr william sikes  happened  one and all  to entertain a violent and deeply rooted antipathy to going near a police office on any ground or pretext whatever
how long they might have sat and looked at each other  in a state of uncertainty not the most pleasant of its kind  it is difficult to guess
it is not necessary to make any guesses on the subject  however  for the sudden entrance of the two young ladies whom oliver had seen on a former occasion  142 oliver twist caused the conversation to flow afresh
 the very thing   said the jew
 bet will go  won t you  my dear    wheres   inquired the young lady
 only just up to the office  my dear   said the jew coaxingly
it is due to the young lady to say that she did not positively affirm that she would not  but that she merely expressed an emphatic and earnest desire to be  blessed  if she would  a polite and delicate evasion of the request  which shows the young lady to have been possessed of that natural good breeding which cannot bear to inflict upon a fellow creature  the pain of a direct and pointed refusal
the jew s countenance fell
he turned from this young lady  who was gaily  not to say gorgeously attired  in a red gown  green boots  and yellow curl papers  to the other female
 nancy  my dear   said the jew in a soothing manner   what do you say    that it won t do  so it s no use a trying it on  fagin   replied nancy
 what do you mean by that   said mr sikes  looking up in a surly manner
 what i say  bill   replied the lady collectedly
 why  you re just the very person for it   reasoned mr sikes   nobody about here knows anything of you    and as i don t want  em to  neither   replied nancy in the same composed manner   it s rather more no than yes with me  bill    she ll go  fagin   said sikes
 no  she won t  fagin   said nancy
 yes  she will  fagin   said sikes
and mr sikes was right
by dint of alternate threats  promises  and bribes  the lady in question was ultimately prevailed upon to undertake the commission
she was not  indeed  withheld by the same considerations as her agreeable friend  for  having recently removed into the neighborhood of field lane from the remote but genteel suburb of ratcliffe  she was not under the same apprehension of being recognised by any of her numerous acquaintance
accordingly  with a clean white apron tied over her gown  and her curl papers tucked up under a straw bonnet —both articles of dress being provided from the jew s inexhaustible stock —miss nancy prepared to issue forth on her errand
 stop a minute  my dear   said the jew  producing  a little covered basket
 carry that in one hand
it looks more respectable  my dear    give her a door key to carry in her t other one  fagin   said sikes   it looks real and genivine like    yes  yes  my dear  so it does   said the jew  hanging a large street door key on the forefinger of the young lady s right hand
 there  very good  very good indeed  my dear   said the jew  rubbing his hands
 oh  my brother  my poor  dear  sweet  innocent little brother   exclaimed nancy  bursting into tears  and wringing the little basket and the street door key in an agony of distress
 what has become of him  where have they taken 144 oliver twist him to  oh  do have pity  and tell me what s been done with the dear boy  gentlemen  do  gentlemen  if you please  gentlemen   having uttered those words in a most lamentable and heart broken tone  to the immeasurable delight of her hearers  miss nancy paused  winked to the company  nodded smilingly round  and disappeared
 ah  she s a clever girl  my dears   said the jew  turning round to his young friends  and shaking his head gravely  as if in mute admonition to them to follow the bright example they had just beheld
 she s a honour to her sex   said mr sikes  filling his glass  and smiting the table with his enormous fist
 here s her health  and wishing they was all like her   while these  and many other encomiums  were being passed on the accomplished nancy  that young lady made the best of her way to the police office  whither  notwithstanding a little natural timidity consequent upon walking through the streets alone and unprotected  she arrived in perfect safety shortly afterwards entering by the back way  she tapped softly with the key at one of the cell doors  and listened
there was no sound within  so she coughed and listened again
still there was no reply  so she spoke
 nolly  dear   murmured nancy in a gentle voice   nolly   there was nobody inside but a miserable shoeless criminal  who had been taken up for playing the flute  and who  the offence against society having been clearly proved  had been very properly committed by mr fang to the house of correction for one month  with the appropriate and amusing remark that since he had so much breath to spare  it would be more wholesomely expended on the treadmill than in a musical instrument
he made no answer  being occupied mentally bewailing the loss of the flute  which had been confiscated for the use of the county  so nancy passed on to the next cell  and knocked there
 well   cried a faint and feeble voice
 is there a little boy here   inquired nancy  with a preliminary sob
 no   replied the voice   god forbid   this was a vagrant of sixty five  who was going to prison for not playing the flute  or  in other words  for begging in the streets  and doing nothing for his livelihood
in the next cell was another man  who was going to the same prison for hawking tin saucepans without license  thereby doing something for his living  in defiance of the stamp office
but  as neither of these criminals answered to the name of oliver  or knew anything about him  nancy made straight up to the bluff officer in the striped waistcoat  and with the most piteous wailings and lamentations  rendered more piteous by a prompt and efficient use of the street door key and the little basket  demanded her own dear brother
 i haven t got him  my dear   said the old man
 where is he   screamed nancy  in a distracted manner
 why  the gentleman s got him   replied the officer
 what gentleman  oh  gracious heavens  what gentleman   exclaimed nancy
146 oliver twist in reply to this incoherent questioning  the old man informed the deeply affected sister that oliver had been taken ill in the office  and discharged in consequence of a witness having proved the robbery to have been committed by another boy  not in custody  and that the prosecutor had carried him away  in an insensible condition  to his own residence  of and concerning which  all the informant knew was  that it was somewhere in pentonville  he having heard that word mentioned in the directions to the coachman
in a dreadful state of doubt and uncertainty  the agonised young woman staggered to the gate  and then  exchanging her faltering walk for a swift run  returned by the most devious and complicated route she could think of  to the domicile of the jew
mr bill sikes no sooner heard the account of the expedition delivered  than he very hastily called up the white dog  and  putting on his hat  expeditiously departed  without devoting any time to the formality of wishing the company good morning
 we must know where he is  my dears  he must be found   said the jew greatly excited
 charley  do nothing but skulk about  till you bring home some news of him  nancy  my dear  i must have him found
i trust to you  my dear —to you and the artful for everything  stay  stay   added the jew  unlocking a drawer with a shaking hand   there s money  my dears
i shall shut up this shop to night
you ll know where to find me  don t stop here a minute
not an instant  my dears   with these words  he pushed them from the room  and carefully double locking and barring the door behind them  drew from its place of concealment the box which he had unintentionally disclosed to oliver
then  he hastily proceeded to dispose the watches and jewellery beneath his clothing
a rap at the door startled him in this occupation
 who s there   he cried in a shrill tone
 me   replied the voice of the dodger  through the keyhole
 what now   cried the jew impatiently
 is he to be kidnapped to the other ken  nancy says   inquired the dodger
 yes   replied the jew   wherever she lays hands on him
find him  find him out  that s all
i shall know what to do next  never fear   the boy murmured a reply of intelligence  and hurried downstairs after his companions
 he has not peached so far   said the jew as he pursued his occupation
 if he means to blab us among his new friends  we may stop his mouth yet   148 oliver twist comprising further particulars of oliver s stay at mr brownlow s  with the remarkable prediction which one mr grimwig uttered concerning him  when he went out on an errand oliver soon recovering from the fainting fit into which mr brownlow s abrupt exclamation had thrown him  the subject of the picture was carefully avoided  both by the old gentleman and mrs bedwin  in the conversation that ensued  which indeed bore no reference to oliver s history or prospects  but was confined to such topics as might amuse without exciting him he was still too weak to get up to breakfast  but  when he came down into the housekeeper s room next day  his first act was to cast an eager glance at the wall  in the hope of again looking on the face of the beautiful lady
his expectations were disappointed  however  for the picture had been removed
 ah   said the housekeeper  watching the direction of oliver s eyes
 it is gone  you see    i see it is ma am   replied oliver
 why have they taken it away    it has been taken down  child  because mr brownlow said  that as it seemed to worry you  perhaps it might prevent your getting well  you know   rejoined the old lady
 oh  no  indeed
it didn t worry me  ma am   said oliver
 i liked to see it
i quite loved it    well  well   said the old lady  good humouredly   you get well as fast as ever you can  dear  and it shall be hung up again
there  i promise you that  now  let us talk about something else   this was all the information oliver could obtain about the picture at that time
as the old lady had been so kind to him in his illness  he endeavoured to think no more of the subject just then  so he listened attentively to a great many stories she told him  about an amiable and handsome daughter of hers  who was married to an amiable and handsome man  and lived in the country  and about a son  who was clerk to a merchant in the west indies  and who was  150 oliver twist also  such a good young man  and wrote such dutiful letters home four times a year  that it brought the tears into her eyes to talk about them
when the old lady had expatiated  a long time  on the excellences of her children  and the merits of her kind good husband besides  who had been dead and gone  poor dear soul  just six and twenty years  it was time to have tea
after tea she began to teach oliver cribbage  which he learnt as quickly as she could teach  and at which game they played  with great interest and gravity  until it was time for the invalid to have some warm wine and water  with a slice of dry toast  and then to go cosily to bed
they were happy days  those of oliver s recovery
everything was so quiet  and neat  and orderly  everybody so kind and gentle  that after the noise and turbulence in the midst of which he had always lived  it seemed like heaven itself
he was no sooner strong enough to put his clothes on  properly  than mr brownlow caused a complete new suit  and a new cap  and a new pair of shoes  to be provided for him
as oliver was told that he might do what he liked with the old clothes  he gave them to a servant who had been very kind to him  and asked her to sell them to a jew  and keep the money for herself
this she very readily did  and  as oliver looked out of the parlour window  and saw the jew roll them up in his bag and walk away  he felt quite delighted to think that they were safely gone  and that there was now no possible danger of his ever being able to wear them again
they were sad rags  to tell the truth  and oliver had never had a new suit before
one evening  about a week after the affair of the picture  as he was sitting talking to mrs bedwin  there came a message down from mr brownlow  that if oliver twist felt pretty well  he should like to see him in his study  and talk to him a little while  bless us  and save us  wash your hands  and let me part your hair nicely for you  child   said mrs bedwin  dear heart alive  if we had known he would have asked for you  we would have put you a clean collar on  and made you as smart as sixpence   oliver did as the old lady bade him  and  although she lamented grievously  meanwhile  that there was not even time to crimp the little frill that bordered his shirt collar  he looked so delicate and handsome  despite that important personal advantage  that she went so far as to say  looking at him with great complacency from head to foot  that she really didn t think it would have been possible  on the longest notice  to have made much difference in him for the better
thus encouraged  oliver tapped at the study door
on mr brownlow calling to him to come in  he found himself in a little back room  quite full of books  with a window  looking into some pleasant little gardens there was a table drawn up before the window  at which mr brownlow was seated reading
when he saw oliver  he pushed the book away from him  and told him to come near the table  and sit down
oliver complied  marvelling where the people could be found to read such a great number of books as seemed to be written to make the world wiser
which is still a marvel to more experienced people than oliver twist  every day of their lives
152 oliver twist  there are a good many books  are there not  my boy   said mr brownlow  observing the curiosity with which oliver surveyed the shelves that reached from the floor to the ceiling
 a great number  sir   replied oliver
 i never saw so many    you shall read them  if you behave well   said the old gentleman kindly   and you will like that  better than looking at the outsides —that is  some cases  because there are books of which the backs and covers are by far the best parts    i suppose they are those heavy ones  sir   said oliver  pointing to some large quartos  with a good deal of gilding about the binding
 not always those   said the old gentleman  patting oliver on the head  and smiling as he did so   there are other equally heavy ones  though of a much smaller size
how should you like to grow up a clever man  and write books  eh    i think i would rather read them  sir   replied oliver
 what  wouldn t you like to be a book writer   said the old gentleman
oliver considered a little while  and at last said  he should think it would be a much better thing to be a book seller  upon which the old gentleman laughed heartily  and declared he had said a very good thing
which oliver felt glad to have done  though he by no means knew what it was
 well  well   said the old gentleman  composing his features
 don t be afraid  we won t make an author of you  while there s an honest trade to be learnt  or brick making to turn to    thank you  sir   said oliver
at the earnest manner of his reply  the old gentleman laughed again  and said something about a curious instinct  which oliver  not understanding  paid no very great attention to
 now   said mr brownlow  speaking if possible in a kinder  but at the same time in a much more serious manner  than oliver had ever known him assume yet   i want you to pay great attention  my boy  to what i am going to say
i shall talk to you without any reserve  because i am sure you are well able to understand me  as many older persons would be    oh  don t tell you are going to send me away  sir  pray   exclaimed oliver  alarmed at the serious tone of the old gentleman s commencement   don t turn me out of doors to wander in the streets again
let me stay here  and be a servant
don t send me back to the wretched place i came from have mercy upon a poor boy  sir    my dear child   said the old gentleman  moved by the warmth of oliver s sudden appeal   you need not be afraid of my deserting you  unless you give me cause    i never  never will  sir   interposed oliver
 i hope not   rejoined the old gentleman
 i do not think you ever will
i have been deceived  before  in the objects whom i have endeavoured to benefit  but i feel strongly disposed to trust you  nevertheless  and i am more interested in your behalf than i can well account for  even to myself
the persons on whom i have bestowed my dearest love  lie deep in their graves  but  although the happiness and delight of my life lie buried there too  i have not made a coffin 154 oliver twist of my heart  and sealed it up  forever  on my best affections
deep affliction has but strengthened and refined them   as the old gentleman said this in a low voice  more to himself than to his companion  and as he remained silent for a short time afterwards  oliver sat quite still  well  well   said the old gentleman at length  in a more cheerful tone   i only say this  because you have a young heart  and knowing that i have suffered great pain and sorrow  you will be more careful  perhaps  not to wound me again
you say you are an orphan  without a friend in the world  all the inquiries i have been able to make  confirm the statement
let me hear your story  where you come from  who brought you up  and how you got into the company in which i found you
speak the truth  and you shall not be friendless while i live   oliver s sobs checked his utterance for some minutes  when he was on the point of beginning to relate how he had been brought up at the farm  and carried to the workhouse by mr bumble  a peculiarly impatient little double knock was heard at the street door  and the servant  running upstairs  announced mr grimwig
 is he coming up   inquired mr brownlow
 yes  sir   replied the servant
 he asked if there were any muffins in the house  and  when i told him yes  he said he had come to tea   mr brownlow smiled  and  turning to oliver  said that mr grimwig was an old friend of his  and he must not mind his being a little rough in his manners  for he was a worthy creature at bottom  as he had reason to know
 shall i go downstairs  sir   inquired oliver
 no   replied mr brownlow   i would rather you remained here   at this moment  there walked into the room  supporting himself by a thick stick  a stout old gentleman  rather lame in one leg  who was dressed in a blue coat  striped waistcoat  nankeen breeches and gaiters  and a broad brimmed white hat  with the sides turned up with green a very smallplaited shirt frill stuck out from his waistcoat  and a very long steel watch chain  with nothing but a key at the end  dangled loosely below it
the ends of his white neckerchief were twisted into a ball about the size of an orange  the variety of shapes into which his countenance was twisted  defy description
he had a manner of screwing his head on one side when he spoke  and of looking out of the corners of his eyes at the same time  which irresistibly reminded the beholder of a parrot
in this attitude  he fixed himself  the moment he made his appearance  and  holding out a small piece of orange peel at arm s length  exclaimed  in a growling  discontented voice  look here  do you see this  isn t it a most wonderful and extraordinary thing that i can t call at a man s house but i find a piece of this poor surgeon s friend on the staircase  i ve been lamed with orange peel once  and i know orangepeel will be my death  or i ll be content to eat my own head  sir   this was the handsome offer with which mr grimwig backed and confirmed nearly every assertion he made  and it was the more singular in his case  because  even admit  156 oliver twist ting for the sake of argument  the possibility of scientific improvements being brought to that pass which will enable a gentleman to eat his own head in the event of his being so disposed  mr grimwig s head was such a particularly large one  that the most sanguine man alive could hardly entertain a hope of being able to get through it at a sitting—to put entirely out of the question  a very thick coating of powder
 i ll eat my head  sir   repeated mr grimwig  striking his stick upon the ground
 hallo  what s that   looking at oliver  and retreating a pace or two
 this is young oliver twist  whom we were speaking about   said mr brownlow
oliver bowed
 you don t mean to say that s the boy who had the fever  i hope   said mr grimwig  recoiling a little more
 wait a minute  don t speak  stop—  continued mr grimwig  abruptly  losing all dread of the fever in his triumph at the discovery   that s the boy who had the orange  if that s not the boy  sir  who had the orange  and threw this bit of peel upon the staircase  i ll eat my head  and his too    no  no  he has not had one   said mr brownlow  laughing
 come  put down your hat  and speak to my young friend    i feel strongly on this subject  sir   said the irritable old gentleman  drawing off his gloves
 there s always more or less orange peel on the pavement in our street  and i know it s put there by the surgeon s boy at the corner
a young woman stumbled over a bit last night  and fell against my garden railings  directly she got up i saw her look towards his infernal red lamp with the pantomime light
 don t go to him   i called out of the window   he s an assassin  a mantrap   so he is
if he is not—  here the irascible old gentleman gave a great knock on the ground with his stick  which was always understood  by his friends  to imply the customary offer  whenever it was not expressed in words
then  still keeping his stick in his hand  he sat down  and  opening a double eye glass  which he wore attached to a broad black riband  took a view of oliver  who  seeing that he was the object of inspection  coloured  and bowed again
 that s the boy  is it   said mr grimwig  at length
 that s the boy   replied mr brownlow
 how are you  boy   said mr grimwig
 a great deal better  thank you  sir   replied oliver
mr brownlow  seeming to apprehend that his singular friend was about to say something disagreeable  asked oliver to step downstairs and tell mrs bedwin they were ready for tea  which  as he did not half like the visitor s manner  he was very happy to do  he is a nice looking boy  is he not   inquired mr brownlow
 i don t know   replied mr grimwig  pettishly
 don t know    no
i don t know
i never see any difference in boys
i only knew two sort of boys
mealy boys  and beef faced boys    and which is oliver    mealy
i know a friend who has a beef faced boy  a fine boy  they call him  with a round head  and red cheeks  and glaring eyes  a horrid boy  with a body and limbs that appear to be swelling out of the seams of his blue clothes  with 158 oliver twist the voice of a pilot  and the appetite of a wolf i know him  the wretch    come   said mr brownlow   these are not the characteristics of young oliver twist  so he needn t excite your wrath    they are not   replied mr grimwig  he may have worse   here  mr brownlow coughed impatiently  which appeared to afford mr grimwig the most exquisite delight
 he may have worse  i say   repeated mr grimwig
 where does he come from  who is he  what is he  he has had a fever
what of that  fevers are not peculiar to good peope  are they  bad people have fevers sometimes  haven t they  eh  i knew a man who was hung in jamaica for murdering his master
he had had a fever six times  he wasn t recommended to mercy on that account
pooh  nonsense   now  the fact was  that in the inmost recesses of his own heart  mr grimwig was strongly disposed to admit that oliver s appearance and manner were unusually prepossessing  but he had a strong appetite for contradiction  sharpened on this occasion by the finding of the orangepeel  and  inwardly determining that no man should dictate to him whether a boy was well looking or not  he had resolved  from the first  to oppose his friend
when mr brownlow admitted that on no one point of inquiry could he yet return a satisfactory answer  and that he had postponed any investigation into oliver s previous history until he thought the boy was strong enough to hear it  mr grimwig chuckled maliciously
and he demanded  with a sneer  whether the housekeeper was in the habit of counting the plate at night  because if she didn t find a table spoon or two missing some sunshiny morning  why  he would be content to—and so forth
all this  mr brownlow  although himself somewhat of an impetuous gentleman  knowing his friend s peculiarities  bore with great good humour  as mr grimwig  at tea  was graciously pleased to express his entire approval of the muffins  matters went on very smoothly  and oliver  who made one of the party  began to feel more at his ease than he had yet done in the fierce old gentleman s presence  and when are you going to hear at full  true  and particular account of the life and adventures of oliver twist   asked grimwig of mr brownlow  at the conclusion of the meal  looking sideways at oliver  as he resumed his subject
 to morrow morning   replied mr brownlow
 i would rather he was alone with me at the time
come up to me tomorrow morning at ten o clock  my dear    yes  sir   replied oliver
he answered with some hesitation  because he was confused by mr grimwig s looking so hard at him
 i ll tell you what   whispered that gentleman to mr brownlow   he won t come up to you to morrow morning
i saw him hesitate
he is deceiving you  my good friend    i ll swear he is not   replied mr brownlow  warmly
 if he is not   said mr grimwig   i ll—  and down went the stick
 i ll answer for that boy s truth with my life   said mr brownlow  knocking the table
160 oliver twist  and i for his falsehood with my head   rejoined mr grimwig  knocking the table also
 we shall see   said mr brownlow  checking his rising anger
 we will   replied mr grimwig  with a provoking smile   we will   as fate would have it  mrs bedwin chanced to bring in  at this moment  a small parcel of books  which mr brownlow had that morning purchased of the identical bookstallkeeper  who has already figured in this history  having laid them on the table  she prepared to leave the room  stop the boy  mrs bedwin   said mr brownlow   there is something to go back    he has gone  sir   replied mrs bedwin  call after him   said mr brownlow   it s particular he is a poor man  and they are not paid for
there are some books to be taken back  too   the street door was opened
oliver ran one way  and the girl ran another  and mrs bedwin stood on the step and screamed for the boy  but there was no boy in sight oliver and the girl returned  in a breathless state  to report that there were no tidings of him
 dear me  i am very sorry for that   exclaimed mr brownlow   i particularly wished those books to be returned to night    send oliver with them   said mr grimwig  with an ironical smile   he will be sure to deliver them safely  you know    yes  do let me take them  if you please  sir   said oliver
 i ll run all the way  sir   the old gentleman was just going to say that oliver should not go out on any account  when a most malicious cough from mr grimwig determined him that he should  and that  by his prompt discharge of the commission  he should prove to him the injustice of his suspicions  on this head at least  at once
 you shall go  my dear   said the old gentleman
 the books are on a chair by my table
fetch them down   oliver  delighted to be of use  brought down the books under his arm in a great bustle  and waited  cap in hand  to hear what message he was to take  you are to say   said mr brownlow  glancing steadily at grimwig   you are to say that you have brought those books back  and that you have come to pay the four pound ten i owe him
this is a five pound note  so you will have to bring me back  ten shillings change    i won t be ten minutes  sir   said oliver  eagerly
having buttoned up the bank note in his jacket pocket  and placed the books carefully under his arm  he made a respectful bow  and left the room
mrs bedwin followed him to the street door  giving him many directions about the nearest way  and the name of the bookseller  and the name of the street  all of which oliver said he clearly understood having superadded many injunctions to be sure and not take cold  the old lady at length permitted him to depart
 bless his sweet face   said the old lady  looking after him
 i can t bear  somehow  to let him go out of my sight   at this moment  oliver looked gaily round  and nodded before he turned the corner
the old lady smilingly returned 162 oliver twist his salutation  and  closing the door  went back  to her own room
 let me see  he ll be back in twenty minutes  at the longest   said mr brownlow  pulling out his watch  and placing it on the table
 it will be dark by that time    oh  you really expect him to come back  do you   inquired mr grimwig
 don t you   asked mr brownlow  smiling
the spirit of contradiction was strong in mr grimwig s breast  at the moment  and it was rendered stronger by his friend s confident smile
 no   he said  smiting the table with his fist   i do not
the boy has a new suit of clothes on his back  a set of valuable books under his arm  and a five pound note in his pocket
he ll join his old friends the thieves  and laugh at you
if ever that boy returns to this house  sir  i ll eat my head   with these words he drew his chair closer to the table  and there the two friends sat  in silent expectation  with the watch between them
it is worthy of remark  as illustrating the importance we attach to our own judgments  and the pride with which we put forth our most rash and hasty conclusions  that  although mr grimwig was not by any means a bad hearted man  and though he would have been unfeignedly sorry to see his respected friend duped and deceived  he really did most earnestly and strongly hope at that moment  that oliver twist might not come back
it grew so dark  that the figures on the dial plate were scarcely discernible  but there the two old gentlemen continued to sit  in silence  with the watch between them
164 oliver twist showing how very fond of oliver twist  the merry old jew and miss nancy were i n the obscure parlour of a low public house  in the filthiest part of little saffron hill  a dark and gloomy den  where a flaring gas light burnt all day in the winter time  and where no ray of sun ever shone in the summer  there sat  brooding over a little pewter measure and a small glass  strongly impregnated with the smell of liquor  a man in a velveteen coat  drab shorts  half boots and stockings  whom even by that dim light no experienced agent of the police would have hesitated to recognise as mr william sikes
at his feet  sat a white coated  red eyed dog  who occupied himself  alternately  in winking at his master with both eyes at the same time  and in licking a large  fresh cut on one side of his mouth  which appeared to be the result of some recent conflict  keep quiet  you warmint  keep quiet   said mr sikes  suddenly breaking silence
whether his meditations were so intense as to be disturbed by the dog s winking  or whether his feelings were so wrought upon by his reflections that they required all the relief derivable from kicking an unoffending animal to allay them  is matter for argument and consideration
whatever was the cause  the effect was a kick and a curse  bestowed upon the dog simultaneously
dogs are not generally apt to revenge injuries inflicted upon them by their masters  but mr sikes s dog  having faults of temper in common with his owner  and labouring  perhaps  at this moment  under a powerful sense of injury  made no more ado but at once fixed his teeth in one of the half boots
having given in a hearty shake  he retired  growling  under a form  just escaping the pewter measure which mr sikes levelled at his head
 you would  would you   said sikes  seizing the poker in one hand  and deliberately opening with the other a large clasp knife  which he drew from his pocket
 come here  you born devil  come here  d ye hear   the dog no doubt heard  because mr sikes spoke in the very harshest key of a very harsh voice  but  appearing to entertain some unaccountable objection to having his throat cut  he remained where he was  and growled more fiercely than before  at the same time grasping the end of the poker between his teeth  and biting at it like a wild beast
this resistance only infuriated mr sikes the more  who  dropping on his knees  began to assail the animal most furiously
the dog jumped from right to left  and from left to 166 oliver twist right  snapping  growling  and barking  the man thrust and swore  and struck and blasphemed  and the struggle was reaching a most critical point for one or other  when  the door suddenly opening  the dog darted out  leaving bill sikes with the poker and the clasp knife in his hands
there must always be two parties to a quarrel  says the old adage
mr sikes  being disappointed of the dog s participation  at once transferred his share in the quarrel to the new comer
 what the devil do you come in between me and my dog for   said sikes  with a fierce gesture
 i didn t know  my dear  i didn t know   replied fagin  humbly  for the jew was the new comer
 didn t know  you white livered thief   growled sikes
 couldn t you hear the noise    not a sound of it  as i m a living man  bill   replied the jew
 oh no  you hear nothing  you don t   retorted sikes with a fierce sneer
 sneaking in and out  so as nobody hears how you come or go  i wish you had been the dog  fagin  half a minute ago    why   inquired the jew with a forced smile
 cause the government  as cares for the lives of such men as you  as haven t half the pluck of curs  lets a man kill a dog how he likes   replied sikes  shutting up the knife with a very expressive look   that s why   the jew rubbed his hands  and  sitting down at the table  affected to laugh at the pleasantry of his friend
he was obviously very ill at ease  however
 grin away   said sikes  replacing the poker  and surveying him with savage contempt   grin away
you ll never have the laugh at me  though  unless it s behind a nightcap
i ve got the upper hand over you  fagin  and  d—me  i ll keep it
there  if i go  you go  so take care of me    well  well  my dear   said the jew   i know all that  we— we—have a mutual interest  bill —a mutual interest    humph   said sikes  as if he though the interest lay rather more on the jew s side than on his
 well  what have you got to say to me    it s all passed safe through the melting pot   replied fagin   and this is your share
it s rather more than it ought to be  my dear  but as i know you ll do me a good turn another time  and—   stow that gammon   interposed the robber  impatiently
 where is it  hand over    yes  yes  bill  give me time  give me time   replied the jew  soothingly
 here it is  all safe   as he spoke  he drew forth an old cotton handkerchief from his breast  and untying a large knot in one corner  produced a small brown paper packet
sikes  snatching it from him  hastily opened it  and proceeded to count the sovereigns it contained
 this is all  is it   inquired sikes
 all   replied the jew
 you haven t opened the parcel and swallowed one or two as you come along  have you   inquired sikes  suspiciously
 don t put on an injured look at the question  you ve done it many a time
jerk the tinkler   these words  in plain english  conveyed an injunction to 168 oliver twist ring the bell
it was answered by another jew  younger than fagin  but nearly as vile and repulsive in appearance
bill sikes merely pointed to the empty measure
the jew  perfectly understanding the hint  retired to fill it  previously exchanging a remarkable look with fagin  who raised his eyes for an instant  as if in expectation of it  and shook his head in reply  so slightly that the action would have been almost imperceptible to an observant third person
it was lost upon sikes  who was stooping at the moment to tie the bootlace which the dog had torn
possibly  if he had observed the brief interchange of signals  he might have thought that it boded no good to him
 is anybody here  barney   inquired fagin  speaking  now that that sikes was looking on  without raising his eyes from the ground
 dot a shoul   replied barney  whose words  whether they came from the heart or not  made their way through the nose
 nobody   inquired fagin  in a tone of surprise  which perhaps might mean that barney was at liberty to tell the truth
 dobody but biss dadsy   replied barney
 nancy   exclaimed sikes
 where  strike me blind  if i don t honour that  ere girl  for her native talents    she s bid havid a plate of boiled beef id the bar   replied barney
 send her here   said sikes  pouring out a glass of liquor
 send her here   barney looked timidly at fagin  as if for permission  the jew reamining silent  and not lifting his eyes from the ground  he retired  and presently returned  ushering in nancy  who was decorated with the bonnet  apron  basket  and street door key  complete
 you are on the scent  are you  nancy   inquired sikes  proffering the glass
 yes  i am  bill   replied the young lady  disposing of its contents   and tired enough of it i am  too
the young brat s been ill and confined to the crib  and—   ah  nancy  dear   said fagin  looking up
now  whether a peculiar contraction of the jew s red eyebrows  and a half closing of his deeply set eyes  warned miss nancy that she was disposed to be too communicative  is not a matter of much importance
the fact is all we need care for here  and the fact is  that she suddenly checked herself  and with several gracious smiles upon mr sikes  turned the conversation to other matters
in about ten minutes  time  mr fagin was seized with a fit of coughing  upon which nancy pulled her shawl over her shoulders  and declared it was time to go
mr sikes  finding that he was walking a short part of her way himself  expressed his intention of accompanying her  they went away together  followed  at a little distant  by the dog  who slunk out of a back yard as soon as his master was out of sight the jew thrust his head out of the room door when sikes had left it  looked after him as we walked up the dark passage  shook his clenched fist  muttered a deep curse  and then  with a horrible grin  reseated himself at the table  where he was soon deeply absorbed in the interesting pages 170 oliver twist of the hue and cry meanwhile  oliver twist  little dreaming that he was within so very short a distance of the merry old gentleman  was on his way to the book stall
when he got into clerkenwell  he accidently turned down a by street which was not exactly in his way  but not discovering his mistake until he had got half way down it  and knowing it must lead in the right direction  he did not think it worth while to turn back  and so marched on  as quickly as he could  with the books under his arm
he was walking along  thinking how happy and contented he ought to feel  and how much he would give for only one look at poor little dick  who  starved and beaten  might be weeping bitterly at that very moment  when he was startled by a young woman screaming out very loud
 oh  my dear brother   and he had hardly looked up  to see what the matter was  when he was stopped by having a pair of arms thrown tight round his neck  don t   cried oliver  struggling
 let go of me
who is it  what are you stopping me for   the only reply to this  was a great number of loud lamentations from the young woman who had embraced him  and who had a little basket and a street door key in her hand
 oh my gracious   said the young woman   i have found him  oh  oliver  oliver  oh you naughty boy  to make me suffer such distress on your account  come home  dear  come
oh  i ve found him
thank gracious goodness heavins  i ve found him   with these incoherent exclamations  the young woman burst into another fit of crying  and got so dreadfully hysterical  that a couple of women who came up at the moment asked a butcher s boy with a shiny head of hair anointed with suet  who was also looking on  whether he didn t think he had better run for the doctor
to which  the butcher s boy  who appeared of a lounging  not to say indolent disposition  replied  that he thought not
 oh  no  no  never mind   said the young woman  grasping oliver s hand   i m better now
come home directly  you cruel boy  come    oh  ma am   replied the young woman   he ran away  near a month ago  from his parents  who are hard working and respectable people  and went and joined a set of thieves and bad characters  and almost broke his mother s heart    young wretch   said one woman  go home  do  you little brute   said the other
 i am not   replied oliver  greatly alarmed
 i don t know her
i haven t any sister  or father and mother either
i m an orphan  i live at pentonville    only hear him  how he braves it out   cried the young woman
 why  it s nancy   exclaimed oliver  who now saw her face for the first time  and started back  in irrepressible astonishment
 you see he knows me   cried nancy  appealing to the bystanders
 he can t help himself make him come home  there s good people  or he ll kill his dear mother and father  and break my heart    what the devil s this   said a man  bursting out of a beershop  with a white dog at his heels   young oliver  come 172 oliver twist home to your poor mother  you young dog  come home directly    i don t belong to them
i don t know them
help  help  cried oliver  struggling in the man s powerful grasp
 help   repeated the man
 yes  i ll help you  you young rascal  what books are these  you ve been a stealing  em  have you  give  em here   with these words  the man tore the volumes from his grasp  and struck him on the head
 that s right   cried a looker on  from a garret window
 that s the only way of bringing him to his senses    to be sure   cried a sleepy faced carpenter  casting an approving look at the garret window
 it ll do him good   said the two women
 and he shall have it  too   rejoined the man  administering another blow  and seizing oliver by the collar
 come on  you young villain  here  bull s eye  mind him  boy  mind him   weak with recent illness  stupified by the blows and the suddenness of the attack  terrified by the fierce growling of the dog  and the brutality of the man  overpowered by the conviction of the bystanders that he really was the hardened little wretch he was described to be  what could one poor child do  darkness had set in  it was a low neighborhood  no help was near  resistance was useless in another moment he was dragged into a labyrinth of dark narrow courts  and was forced along them at a pace which rendered the few cries he dared to give utterance to  unintelligible
it was of little moment  indeed  whether they were intelligible or no  for there was nobody to care for them  had they been ever so plain
the gas lamps were lighted  mrs bedwin was waiting anxiously at the open door  the servant had run up the street twenty times to see if there were any traces of oliver  and still the two old gentlemen sat  perseveringly  in the dark parlour  with the watch between them 174 oliver twist relates what became of oliver twist  after he had been claimed by nancy the narrow streets and courts  at length  terminated in a large open space  scattered about which  were pens for beasts  and other indications of a cattle market
sikes slackened his pace when they reached this spot  the girl being quite unable to support any longer  the rapid rate at which they had hitherto walked
turning to oliver  he roughly commanded him to take hold of nancy s hand
 do you hear   growled sikes  as oliver hesitated  and looked round
they were in a dark corner  quite out of the track of passengers
oliver saw  but too plainly  that resistance would be of no avail
he held out his hand  which nancy clasped tight in hers
 give me the other   said sikes  seizing oliver s unoccupied hand
 here  bull s eye   the dog looked up  and growled
 see here  boy   said sikes  putting his other hand to oliver s throat   if he speaks ever so soft a word  hold him  d ye mind   the dog growled again  and licking his lips  eyed oliver as if he were anxious to attach himself to his windpipe without delay  he s as willing as a christian  strike me blind if he isn t   said sikes  regarding the animal with a kind of grim and ferocious approval
 now  you know what you ve got to expect  master  so call away as quick as you like  the dog will soon stop that game
get on  young un   bull s eye wagged his tail in acknowledgment of this unusually endearing form of speech  and  giving vent to another admonitory growl for the benefit of oliver  led the way onward
it was smithfield that they were crossing  although it might have been grosvenor square  for anything oliver knew to the contrary
the night was dark and foggy
the lights in the shops could scarecely struggle through the heavy mist  which thickened every moment and shrouded the streets and houses in gloom  rendering the strange place still stranger in oliver s eyes  and making his uncertainty the more dismal and depressing
they had hurried on a few paces  when a deep churchbell struck the hour
with its first stroke  his two conductors stopped  and turned their heads in the direction whence 176 oliver twist the sound proceeded
 eight o  clock  bill   said nancy  when the bell ceased
 what s the good of telling me that  i can hear it  can t i   replied sikes
 i wonder whether they can hear it   said nancy
 of course they can   replied sikes
 it was bartlemy time when i was shopped  and there warn t a penny trumpet in the fair  as i couldn t hear the squeaking on
arter i was locked up for the night  the row and din outside made the thundering old jail so silent  that i could almost have beat my brains out against the iron plates of the door    poor fellow   said nancy  who still had her face turned towards the quarter in which the bell had sounded
 oh  bill  such fine young chaps as them    yes  that s all you women think of   answered sikes
 fine young chaps  well  they re as good as dead  so it don t much matter   with this consolation  mr sikes appeared to repress a rising tendency to jealousy  and  clasping oliver s wrist more firmly  told him to step out again
 wait a minute   said the girl   i wouldn t hurry by  if it was you that was coming out to be hung  the next time eight o clock struck  bill
i d walk round and round the place till i dropped  if the snow was on the ground  and i hadn t a shawl to cover me    and what good would that do   inquired the unsentimental mr sikes
 unless you could pitch over a file and twenty yards of good stout rope  you might as well be walking fifty mile off  or not walking at all  for all the good it would do me
come on  and don t stand preaching there   the girl burst into a laugh  drew her shawl more closely round her  and they walked away
but oliver felt her hand tremble  and  looking up in her face as they passed a gaslamp  saw that it had turned a deadly white
they walked on  by little frequented and dirty ways  for a full half hour  meeting very few people  and those appearing from their looks to hold much the same position in society as mr sikes himself at length they turned into a very filthy narrow street  nearly full of old clothes shops  the dog running forward  as if conscious that there was no further occasion for his keeping on guard  stopped before the door of a shop that was closed and apparently untenanted  the house was in a ruinous condition  and on the door was nailed a board  intimating that it was to let  which looked as if it had hung there for many years
 all right   cried sikes  glancing cautiously about
nancy stooped below the shutters  and oliver heard the sound of a bell
they crossed to the opposite side of the street  and stood for a few moments under a lamp
a noise  as if a sash window were gently raised  was heard  and soon afterwards the door softly opened
mr sikes then seized the terrified boy by the collar with very little ceremony  and all three were quickly inside the house
the passage was perfectly dark
they waited  while the person who had let them in  chained and barred the door
 anybody here   inquired sikes
 no   replied a voice  which oliver thought he had heard before
178 oliver twist  is the old  un here   asked the robber
 yes   replied the voice   and precious down in the mouth he has been
won t he be glad to see you  oh  no   the style of this reply  as well as the voice which delivered it  seemed familiar to oliver s ears  but it was impossible to distinguish even the form of the speaker in the darkness
 let s have a glim   said sikes   or we shall go breaking our necks  or treading on the dog
look after your legs if you do    stand still a moment  and i ll get you one   replied the voice
the receding footsteps of the speaker were heard  and  in another minute  the form of mr john dawkins  otherwise the artful dodger  appeared
he bore in his right hand a tallow candle stuck in the end of a cleft stick
the young gentleman did not stop to bestow any other mark of recognition upon oliver than a humourous grin  but  turning away  beckoned the visitors to follow him down a flight of stairs
they crossed an empty kitchen  and  opening the door of a low earthy smelling room  which seemed to have been built in a small back yard  were received with a shout of laughter
 oh  my wig  my wig   cried master charles bates  from whose lungs the laughter had proceeded   here he is  oh  cry  here he is  oh  fagin  look at him  fagin  do look at him  i can t bear it  it is such a jolly game  i cant  bear it
hold me  somebody  while i laugh it out   with this irrepressible ebullition of mirth  master bates laid himself flat on the floor  and kicked convulsively for five minutes  in an ectasy of facetious joy then jumping to his feet  he snatched the cleft stick from the dodger  and  advancing to oliver  viewed him round and round  while the jew  taking off his nightcap  made a great number of low bows to the bewildered boy
the artful  meantime  who was of a rather saturnine disposition  and seldom gave way to merriment when it interfered with business  rifled oliver s pockets with steady assiduity
 look at his togs  fagin   said charley  putting the light so close to his new jacket as nearly to set him on fire
 look at his togs  superfine cloth  and the heavy swell cut  oh  my eye  what a game  and his books  too  nothing but a gentleman  fagin    delighted to see you looking so well  my dear   said the jew  bowing with mock humility
 the artful shall give you another suit  my dear  for fear you should spoil that sunday one
why didn t you write  my dear  and say you were coming  we d have got something warm for supper   at his  master bates roared again  so loud  that fagin himself relaxed  and even the dodger smiled  but as the artful drew forth the five pound note at that instant  it is doubtful whether the sally of the discovery awakened his merriment  hallo  what s that   inquired sikes  stepping forward as the jew seized the note
 that s mine  fagin    no  no  my dear   said the jew
 mine  bill  mine
you shall have the books    if that ain t mine   said bill sikes  putting on his hat with a determined air   mine and nancy s that is  i ll take the boy back again   180 oliver twist the jew started
oliver started too  though from a very different cause  for he hoped that the dispute might really end in his being taken back
 come  hand over  will you   said sikes
 this is hardly fair  bill  hardly fair  is it  nancy   inquired the jew
 fair  or not fair   retorted sikes   hand over  i tell you  do you think nancy and me has got nothing else to do with our precious time but to spend it in scouting arter  and kidnapping  every young boy as gets grabbed through you  give it here  you avaricious old skeleton  give it here   with this gentle remonstrance  mr sikes plucked the note from between the jew s finger and thumb  and looking the old man coolly in the face  folded it up small  and tied it in his neckerchief
 that s for our share of the trouble   said sikes   and not half enough  neither
you may keep the books  if you re fond of reading
if you ain t  sell  em    they re very pretty   said charley bates  who  with sundry grimaces  had been affecting to read one of the volumes in question   beautiful writing  isn t is  oliver   at sight of the dismayed look with which oliver regarded his tormentors  master bates  who was blessed with a lively sense of the ludicrous  fell into another ectasy  more boisterous than the first
 they belong to the old gentleman   said oliver  wringing his hands   to the good  kind  old gentleman who took me into his house  and had me nursed  when i was near dying of the fever
oh  pray send them back  send him back the books and money
keep me here all my life long  but pray  pray send them back
he ll think i stole them  the old lady  all of them who were so kind to me  will think i stole them
oh  do have mercy upon me  and send them back   with these words  which were uttered with all the energy of passionate grief  oliver fell upon his knees at the jew s feet  and beat his hands together  in perfect desperation
 the boy s right   remarked fagin  looking covertly round  and knitting his shaggy eyebrows into a hard knot
 you re right  oliver  you re right  they will think you have stolen  em
ha  ha   chuckled the jew  rubbing his hands   it couldn t have happened better  if we had chosen our time    of course it couldn t   replied sikes   i know d that  directly i see him coming through clerkenwell  with the books under his arm
it s all right enough
they re softhearted psalm singers  or they wouldn t have taken him in at all  and they ll ask no questions after him  fear they should be obliged to prosecute  and so get him lagged
he s safe enough   oliver had looked from one to the other  while these words were being spoken  as if he were bewildered  and could scarecely understand what passed  but when bill sikes concluded  he jumped suddenly to his feet  and tore wildly from the room  uttering shrieks for help  which made the bare old house echo to the roof
 keep back the dog  bill   cried nancy  springing before the door  and closing it  as the jew and his two pupils darted out in pursuit
 keep back the dog  he ll tear the boy to pieces   182 oliver twist  serve him right   cried sikes  struggling to disengage himself from the girl s grasp  stand off from me  or i ll split your head against the wall    i don t care for that  bill  i don t care for that   screamed the girl  struggling violently with the man   the child shan t be torn down by the dog  unless you kill me first    shan t he   said sikes  setting his teeth
 i ll soon do that  if you don t keep off   the housebreaker flung the girl from him to the further end of the room  just as the jew and the two boys returned  dragging oliver among them
 what s the matter here   said fagin  looking round
 the girl s gone mad  i think   replied sikes  savagely
 no  she hasn t   said nancy  pale and breathless from the scuffle   no  she hasn t  fagin  don t think it    then keep quiet  will you   said the jew  with a threatening look
 no  i won t do that  neither   replied nancy  speaking very loud
 come  what do you think of that   mr fagin was sufficiently well acquainted with the manners and customs of that particular species of humanity to which nancy belonged  to feel tolerably certain that it would be rather unsafe to prolong any conversation with her  at present with the view of diverting the attention of the company  he turned to oliver
 so you wanted to get away  my dear  did you   said the jew  taking up a jagged and knotted club which law in a corner of the fireplace   eh   oliver made no reply
but he watched the jew s motions  and breathed quickly
 wanted to get assistance  called for the police  did you   sneered the jew  catching the boy by the arm
 we ll cure you of that  my young master   the jew inflicted a smart blow on oliver s shoulders with the club  and was raising it for a second  when the girl  rushing forward  wrested it from his hand
she flung it into the fire  with a force that brought some of the glowing coals whirling out into the room
 i won t stand by and see it done  fagin   cried the girl
 you ve got the boy  and what more would you have —let him be—let him be—or i shall put that mark on some of you  that will bring me to the gallows before my time   the girl stamped her foot violently on the floor as she vented this threat  and with her lips compressed  and her hands clenched  looked alternately at the jew and the other robber  her face quite colourless from the passion of rage into which she had gradually worked herself
 why  nancy   said the jew  in a soothing tone  after a pause  during which he and mr sikes had stared at one another in a disconcerted manner   you —you re more clever than ever to night
ha  ha  my dear  you are acting beautifully    am i   said the girl
 take care i don t overdo it
you will be the worse for it  fagin  if i do  and so i tell you in good time to keep clear of me   there is something about a roused woman  especially if she add to all her other strong passions  the fierce impulses of recklessness and despair  which few men like to provoke
184 oliver twist the jew saw that it would be hopeless to affect any further mistake regarding the reality of miss nancy s rage  and  shrinking involuntarily back a few paces  cast a glance  half imploring and half cowardly  at sikes  as if to hint that he was the fittest person to pursue the dialogue
mr sikes  thus mutely appealed to  and possibly feeling his personal pride and influence interested in the immediate reduction of miss nancy to reason  gave utterance to about a couple of score of curses and threats  the rapid production of which reflected great credit on the fertility of his invention
as they produced no visible effect on the object against whom they were discharged  however  he resorted to more tangible arguments
 what do you mean by this   said sikes  backing the inquiry with a very common imprecation concerning the most beautiful of human features  which  if it were heard above  only once out of every fifty thousand times that it is uttered below  would render blindness as common a disorder as measles   what do you mean by it  burn my body  do you know who you are  and what you are    oh  yes  i know all about it   replied the girl  laughing hysterically  and shaking her head from side to side  with a poor assumption of indifference
 well  then  keep quiet   rejoined sikes  with a growl like that he was accustomed to use when addressing his dog   or i ll quiet you for a good long time to come   the girl laughed again  even less composedly than before  and  darting a hasty look at sikes  turned her face aside  and bit her lip till the blood came
 you re a nice one   added sikes  as he surveyed her with a contemptuous air   to take up the humane and gen—teel side  a pretty subject for the child  as you call him  to make a friend of    god almighty help me  i am   cried the girl passionately   and i wish i had been struck dead in the street  or had changed places with them we passed so near to night  before i had lent a hand in bringing him here
he s a thief  a liar  a devil  all that s bad  from this night forth
isn t that enough for the old wretch  without blows    come  come  sikes   said the jew appealing to him in a remonstratory tone  and motioning towards the boys  who were eagerly attentive to all that passed   we must have civil words  civil words  bill    civil words   cried the girl  whose passion was frightful to see  civil words  you villain  yes  you deserve  em from me
i thieved for you when i was a child not half as old as this   pointing to oliver
 i have been in the same trade  and in the same service  for twelve years since
don t you know it  speak out  don t you know it    well  well   replied the jew  with an attempt at pacification   and  if you have  it s your living    aye  it is   returned the girl  not speaking  but pouring out the words in one continuous and vehement scream
 it is my living  and the cold  wet  dirty streets are my home  and you re the wretch that drove me to them long ago  and that ll keep me there  day and night  day and night  till i die    i shall do you a mischief   interposed the jew  goaded 186 oliver twist by these reproaches   a mischief worse than that  if you say much more   the girl said nothing more  but  tearing her hair and dress in a transport of passion  made such a rush at the jew as would probably have left signal marks of her revenge upon him  had not her wrists been seized by sikes at the right moment  upon which  she made a few ineffectual struggles  and fainted  she s all right now   said sikes  laying her down in a corner
 she s uncommon strong in the arms  when she s up in this way   the jew wiped his forehead  and smiled  as if it were a relief to have the disturbance over  but neither he  nor sikes  nor the dog  nor the boys  seemed to consider it in any other light than a common occurance incidental to business  it s the worst of having to do with women   said the jew  replacing his club   but they re clever  and we can t get on  in our line  without  em
charley  show oliver to bed    i suppose he d better not wear his best clothes tomorrow  fagin  had he   inquired charley bates
 certainly not   replied the jew  reciprocating the grin with which charley put the question
master bates  apparently much delighted with his commission  took the cleft stick  and led oliver into an adjacent kitchen  where there were two or three of the beds on which he had slept before  and here  with many uncontrollable bursts of laughter  he produced the identical old suit of clothes which oliver had so much congratulated himself upon leaving off at mr brownlow s  and the accidental display of which  to fagin  by the jew who purchased them  had been the very first clue received  of his whereabout  put off the smart ones   said charley   and i ll give  em to fagin to take care of
what fun it is   poor oliver unwillingly complied
master bates rolling up the new clothes under his arm  departed from the room  leaving oliver in the dark  and locking the door behind him
the noise of charley s laughter  and the voice of miss betsy  who opportunely arrived to throw water over her friend  and perform other feminine offices for the promotion of her recovery  might have kept many people awake under more happy circumstances than those in which oliver was placed but he was sick and weary  and he soon fell sound asleep
188 oliver twist oliver s destiny continuing unpropitious  brings a great man to london to injure his reputation i t is the custom on the stage  in all good murderous melodramas  to present the tragic and the comic scenes  in as regular alternation  as the layers of red and white in a side of streaky bacon
the hero sinks upon his straw bed  weighed down by fetters and misfortunes  in the next scene  his faithful but unconscious squire regales the audience with a comic song
we behold  with throbbing bosoms  the heroine in the grasp of a proud and ruthless baron  her virtue and her life alike in danger  drawing forth her dagger to preserve the one at the cost of the other  and just as our expectations are wrought up to the highest pitch  a whistle is heard  and we are straightway transported to the great hall of the castle  where a grey headed seneschal sings a funny chorus with a funnier body of vassals  who are free of all sorts of places  from church vaults to palaces  and roam about in company  carolling perpetually such changes appear absurd  but they are not so unnatural as they would seem at first sight
the transitions in real life from well spread boards to death beds  and from mourning weeds to holiday garments  are not a whit less startling  only  there  we are busy actors  instead of passive lookers on  which makes a vast difference
the actors in the mimic life of the theatre  are blind to violent transitions and abrupt impulses of passion or feeling  which  presented before the eyes of mere spectators  are at once condemned as outrageous and preposterous
as sudden shiftings of the scene  and rapid changes of time and place  are not only sanctioned in books by long usage  but are by many considered as the great art of authorship  an author s skill in his craft being  by such critics  chiefly estimated with relation to the dilemmas in which he introduction to the present one may perhaps be deemed unnecessary
if so  let it be considered a delicate intimation on the part of the historian that he is going back to the town in which oliver twist was born  the reader taking it for granted that there are good and substantial reasons for making the journey  or he would not be invited to proceed upon such an expedition
190 oliver twist mr bumble emerged at early morning from the workhouse gate  and walked with portly carriage and commanding steps  up the high street
he was in the full bloom and pride of beadlehood  his cocked hat and coat were dazzling in the morning sun  he clutched his cane with the vigorous tenacity of health and power
mr bumble always carried his head high  but this morning it was higher than usual
there was an abstraction in his eye  an elevation in his air  which might have warned an observant stranger that thoughts were passing in the beadle s mind  too great for utterance
mr bumble stopped not to converse with the small shopkeepers and others who spoke to him  deferentially  as he passed along
he merely returned their salutations with a wave of his hand  and relaxed not in his dignified pace  until he reached the farm where mrs mann tended the infant paupers with parochial care  drat that beadle   said mrs mann  hearing the wellknown shaking at the garden gate  if it isn t him at this time in the morning  lauk  mr bumble  only think of its being you  well  dear me  it is a pleasure  this is  come into the parlour  sir  please   the first sentence was addressed to susan  and the exclamations of delight were uttered to mr bumble  as the good lady unlocked the garden gate  and showed him  with great attention and respect  into the house
 mrs mann   said mr bumble  not sitting upon  or dropping himself into a seat  as any common jackanapes would  but letting himself gradually and slowly down into a chair   mrs mann  ma am  good morning    well  and good morning to you  sir   replied mrs mann  with many smiles   and hoping you find yourself well  sir    so so  mrs mann   replied the beadle  a porochial life is not a bed of roses  mrs mann    ah  that it isn t indeed  mr bumble   rejoined the lady and all the infant paupers might have chorussed the rejoinder with great propriety  if they had heard it  a porochial life  ma am   continued mr bumble  striking the table with his cane   is a life of worrit  and vexation  and hardihood  but all public characters  as i may say  must suffer prosecution   mrs mann  not very well knowing what the beadle meant  raised her hands with a look of sympathy  and sighed  ah  you may well sigh  mrs mann   said the beadle finding she had done right  mrs mann sighed again  evidently to the satisfaction of the public character  who  repressing a complacent smile by looking sternly at his cocked hat  said   mrs mann  i am going to london    lauk  mr bumble   cried mrs mann  starting back  to london  ma am   resumed the inflexible beadle   by coach i and two paupers  mrs mann  a legal action is a coming on  about a settlement  and the board has appointed me—me  mrs mann—to dispose to the matter before the quarter sessions at clerkinwell and i very much question   added mr bumble  drawing himself up   whether the clerkinwell sessions will not find themselves in the wrong box before they have done with 192 oliver twist me    oh  you mustn t be too hard upon them  sir   said mrs mann  coaxingly  the clerkinwell sessions have brought it upon themselves  ma am   replied mr bumble   and if the clerkinwell sessions find that they come off rather worse than they expected  the clerkinwell sessions have only themselves to thank   there was so much determination and depth of purpose about the menacing manner in which mr bumble delivered himself of these words  that mrs mann appeared quite awed by them at length she said   you re going by coach  sir  i thought it was always usual to send them paupers in carts    that s when they re ill  mrs mann   said the beadle  we put the sick paupers into open carts in the rainy weather  to prevent their taking cold    oh   said mrs mann  the opposition coach contracts for these two  and takes them cheap   said mr bumble  they are both in a very low state  and we find it would come two pound cheaper to move  em than to bury  em—that is  if we can throw  em upon another parish  which i think we shall be able to do  if they don t die upon the road to spite us ha  ha  ha   when mr bumble had laughed a little while  his eyes again encountered the cocked hat  and he became grave  we are forgetting business  ma am   said the beadle   here is your porochial stipend for the month   mr bumble produced some silver money rolled up in paper  from his pocket book  and requested a receipt  which mrs mann wrote  it s very much blotted  sir   said the farmer of infants   but it s formal enough  i dare say thank you  mr bumble  sir  i am very much obliged to you  i m sure   mr bumble nodded  blandly  in acknowledgment of mrs mann s curtsey  and inquired how the children were  bless their dear little hearts   said mrs mann with emotion   they re as well as can be  the dears  of course  except the two that died last week and little dick    isn t that boy no better   inquired mr bumble mrs mann shook her head  he s a ill conditioned  wicious  bad disposed porochial child that   said mr bumble angrily  where is he    i ll bring him to you in one minute  sir   replied mrs mann  here  you dick   after some calling  dick was discovered having had his face put under the pump  and dried upon mrs mann s gown  he was led into the awful presence of mr bumble  the beadle the child was pale and thin  his cheeks were sunken  and his eyes large and bright the scanty parish dress  the livery of his misery  hung loosely on his feeble body  and his young limbs had wasted away  like those of an old man such was the little being who stood trembling beneath mr bumble s glance  not daring to lift his eyes from the floor  and dreading even to hear the beadle s voice
 can t you look at the gentleman  you obstinate boy   said mrs mann 194 oliver twist the child meekly raised his eyes  and encountered those of mr bumble
 what s the matter with you  porochial dick   inquired mr bumble  with well timed jocularity
 nothing  sir   replied the child faintly
 i should think not   said mrs mann  who had of course laughed very much at mr bumble s humour  you want for nothing  i m sure    i should like—  faltered the child
 hey day   interposed mr mann   i suppose you re going to say that you do want for something  now  why  you little wretch—   stop  mrs mann  stop   said the beadle  raising his hand with a show of authority  like what  sir  eh    i should like   said the child   to leave my dear love to poor oliver twist  and to let him know how often i have sat by myself and cried to think of his wandering about in the dark nights with nobody to help him and i should like to tell him   said the child pressing his small hands together  and speaking with great fervour   that i was glad to die when i was very young  for  perhaps  if i had lived to be a man  and had grown old  my little sister who is in heaven  might forget me  or be unlike me  and it would be so much happier if we were both children there together   mr bumble surveyed the little speaker  from head to foot  with indescribable astonishment  and  turning to his companion  said   they re all in one story  mrs mann that out dacious oliver had demogalized them all    i couldn t have believed it  sir  said mrs mann  holding up her hands  and looking malignantly at dick  i never see such a hardened little wretch    take him away  ma am   said mr bumble imperiously  this must be stated to the board  mrs mann  i hope the gentleman will understand that it isn t my fault  sir   said mrs mann  whimpering pathetically  they shall understand that  ma am  they shall be acquainted with the true state of the case   said mr bumble  there  take him away  i can t bear the sight on him   dick was immediately taken away  and locked up in the coal cellar
mr bumble shortly afterwards took himself off  to prepare for his journey at six o clock next morning  mr bumble  having exchanged his cocked hat for a round one  and encased his person in a blue great coat with a cape to it  took his place on the outside of the coach  accompanied by the criminals whose settlement was disputed  with whom  in due course of time  he arrived in london
he experienced no other crosses on the way  than those which originated in the perverse behaviour of the two paupers  who persisted in shivering  and complaining of the cold  in a manner which  mr bumble declared  caused his teeth to chatter in his head  and made him feel quite uncomfortable  although he had a great coat on
having disposed of these evil minded persons for the night  mr bumble sat himself down in the house at which the coach stopped  and took a temperate dinner of steaks  oyster sauce  and porter putting a glass of hot gin and water on the chimney piece  he drew his chair to the fire  and  196 oliver twist with sundry moral reflections on the too prevalent sin of discontent and complaining  composed himself to read the paper the very first paragraph upon which mr bumble s eye rested  was the following advertisement
 five guineas reward  whereas a young boy  named oliver twist  absconded  or was enticed  on thursday evening last  from his home  at pentonville  and has not since been heard of
the above reward will be paid to any person who will give such information as will lead to the discovery of the said oliver twist  or tend to throw any light upon his previous history  in which the advertiser is  for many reasons  warmly interested   and then followed a full description of oliver s dress  person  appearance  and disappearance  with the name and address of mr brownlow at full length
mr bumble opened his eyes  read the advertisement  slowly and carefully  three several times  and in something more than five minutes was on his way to pentonville  having actually  in his excitement  left the glass of hot ginand water  untasted
 is mr brownlow at home   inquired mr bumble of the girl who opened the door
to this inquiry the girl returned the not uncommon  but rather evasive reply of  i don t know  where do you come from   mr bumble no sooner uttered oliver s name  in explanation of his errand  than mrs bedwin  who had been listening at the parlour door  hastened into the passage in a breathless state  come in  come in   said the old lady   i knew we should hear of him
poor dear  i knew we should  i was certain of it
bless his heart  i said so all along   having heard this  the worthy old lady hurried back into the parlour again  and seating herself on a sofa  burst into tears
the girl  who was not quite so susceptible  had run upstairs meanwhile  and now returned with a request that mr bumble would follow her immediately  which he did
he was shown into the little back study  where sat mr brownlow and his friend mr grimwig  with decanters and glasses before them
the latter gentleman at once burst into the exclamation   a beadle
a parish beadle  or i ll eat my head    pray don t interrupt just now   said mr brownlow
 take a seat  will you   mr bumble sat himself down  quite confounded by the oddity of mr grimwig s manner mr brownlow moved the lamp  so as to obtain an uninterrupted view of the beadle s countenance  and said  with a little impatience   now  sir  you come in consequence of having seen the advertisement    yes  sir   said mr bumble
 and you are a beadle  are you not   inquired mr grimwig
 i am a porochial beadle  gentlemen   rejoined mr bumble proudly
 of course   observed mr grimwig aside to his friend   i 198 oliver twist knew he was
a beadle all over   mr brownlow gently shook his head to impose silence on his friend  and resumed   do you know where this poor boy is now    no more than nobody   replied mr bumble
 well  what do you know of him   inquired the old gentleman
 speak out  my friend  if you have anything to say
what do you know of him    you don t happen to know any good of him  do you   said mr grimwig  caustically  after an attentive perusal of mr bumble s features
mr bumble  catching at the inquiry very quickly  shook his head with portentous solemnity
 you see   said mr grimwig  looking triumphantly at mr brownlow
mr brownlow looked apprehensively at mr bumble s pursed up countenance  and requested him to communicate what he knew regarding oliver  in as few words as possible
mr bumble put down his hat  unbuttoned his coat  folded his arms  inclined his head in a retrospective manner  and  after a few moments  reflection  commenced his story it would be tedious if given in the beadle s words  occupying  as it did  some twenty minutes in the telling  but the sum and substance of it was  that oliver was a foundling  born of low and vicious parents
that he had  from his birth  displayed no better qualities than treachery  ingratitude  and malice
that he had terminated his brief career in the place of his birth  by making a sanguinary and cowardly attack on an unoffending lad  and running away in the night time from his master s house
in proof of his really being the person he represented himself  mr bumble laid upon the table the papers he had brought to town folding his arms again  he then awaited mr brownlow s observations  i fear it is all too true   said the old gentleman sorrowfully  after looking over the papers
 this is not much for your intelligence  but i would gladly have given you treble the money  if it had been favourable to the boy   it is not improbable that if mr bumble had been possessed of this information at an earlier period of the interview  he might have imparted a very different colouring to his little history
it was too late to do it now  however  so he shook his head gravely  and  pocketing the five guineas  withdrew
mr brownlow paced the room to and fro for some minutes  evidently so much disturbed by the beadle s tale  that even mr grimwig forbore to vex him further
at length he stopped  and rang the bell violently
 mrs bedwin   said mr brownlow  when the housekeeper appeared   that boy  oliver  is an imposter    it can t be  sir it cannot be   said the old lady energetically
 i tell you he is   retorted the old gentleman
 what do you mean by can t be  we have just heard a full account of him from his birth  and he has been a thorough paced little villain  all his life    i never will believe it  sir   replied the old lady  firmly
200 oliver twist  never    you old women never believe anything but quack doctors  and lying story books   growled mr grimwig
 i knew it all along
why didn t you take my advise in the beginning  you would if he hadn t had a fever  i suppose  eh  he was interesting  wasn t he  interesting  bah   and mr grimwig poked the fire with a flourish
 he was a dear  grateful  gentle child  sir   retorted mrs bedwin  indignantly  i know what children are  sir  and have done these forty years  and people who can t say the same  shouldn t say anything about them
that s my opinion   this was a hard hit at mr grimwig  who was a bachelor
as it extorted nothing from that gentleman but a smile  the old lady tossed her head  and smoothed down her apron preparatory to another speech  when she was stopped by mr brownlow
 silence   said the old gentleman  feigning an anger he was far from feeling
 never let me hear the boy s name again
i rang to tell you that
never
never  on any pretence  mind  you may leave the room  mrs bedwin remember  i am in earnest   there were sad hearts at mr brownlow s that night
oliver s heart sank within him  when he thought of his good friends  it was well for him that he could not know what they had heard  or it might have broken outright
how oliver passed his time in the improving society of his reputable friends about noon next day  when the dodger and master bates had gone out to pursue their customary avocations  mr fagin took the opportunity of reading oliver a long lecture on the crying sin of ingratitude  of which he clearly demonstrated he had been guilty  to no ordinary extent  in wilfully absenting himself from the society of his anxious friends  and  still more  in endeavouring to escape from them after so much trouble and expense had been incurred in his recovery mr fagin laid great stress on the fact of his having taken oliver in  and cherished him  when  without his timely aid  he might have perished with hunger  and he related the dismal and affecting history of a young lad whom  in his philanthropy  he had succoured under parallel circumstances  but who  proving unworthy of his confidence 202 oliver twist and evincing a desire to communicate with the police  had unfortunately come to be hanged at the old bailey one morning mr fagin did not seek to conceal his share in the catastrophe  but lamented with tears in his eyes that the wrong headed and treacherous behaviour of the young person in question  had rendered it necessary that he should become the victim of certain evidence for the crown  which  if it were not precisely true  was indispensably necessary for the safety of him (mr fagin) and a few select friends
mr fagin concluded by drawing a rather disagreeable picture of the discomforts of hanging  and  with great friendliness and politeness of manner  expressed his anxious hopes that he might never be obliged to submit oliver twist to that unpleasant operation
little oliver s blood ran cold  as he listened to the jew s words  and imperfectly comprehended the dark threats conveyed in them
that it was possible even for justice itself to confound the innocent with the guilty when they were in accidental companionship  he knew already  and that deeply laid plans for the destruction of inconveniently knowing or over communicative persons  had been really devised and carried out by the jew on more occasions than one  he thought by no means unlikely  when he recollected the general nature of the altercations between that gentleman and mr sikes  which seemed to bear reference to some foregone conspiracy of the kind
as he glanced timidly up  and met the jew s searching look  he felt that his pale face and trembling limbs were neither unnoticed nor unrelished by that wary old gentleman
the jew  smiling hideously  patted oliver on the head  and said  that if he kept himself quiet  and applied himself to business  he saw they would be very good friends yet then  taking his hat  and covering himself with an old patched great coat  he went out  and locked the room door behind him and so oliver remained all that day  and for the greater part of many subsequent days  seeing nobody  between early morning and midnight  and left during the long hours to commune with his own thoughts
which  never failing to revert to his kind friends  and the opinion they must long ago have formed of him  were sad indeed
after the lapse of a week or so  the jew left the room door unlocked  and he was at liberty to wander about the house
it was a very dirty place
the rooms upstairs had great high wooden chimney pieces and large doors  with panelled walls and cornices to the ceiling  which  although they were black with neglect and dust  were ornamented in various ways from all of these tokens oliver concluded that a long time ago  before the old jew was born  it had belonged to better people  and had perhaps been quite gay and handsome  dismal and dreary as it looked now
spiders had built their webs in the angles of the walls and ceilings  and sometimes  when oliver walked softly into a room  the mice would scamper across the floor  and run back terrified to their holes
with these exceptions  there was neither sight nor sound of any living thing  and often  when it grew dark  and he was tired of wandering from room to room  he would crouch in the corner of the 204 oliver twist passage by the street door  to be as near living people as he could  and would remain there  listening and counting the hours  until the jew or the boys returned
in all the rooms  the mouldering shutters were fast closed  the bars which held them were screwed tight into the wood  the only light which was admitted  stealing its way through round holes at the top  which made the rooms more gloomy  and filled them with strange shadows there was a back garret window with rusty bars outside  which had no shutter  and out of this  oliver often gazed with a melancholy face for hours together  but nothing was to be descried from it but a confused and crowded mass of housetops  blackened chimneys  and gable ends
sometimes  indeed  a grizzly head might be seen  peering over the parapet wall of a distant house  but it was quickly withdrawn again  and as the window of oliver s observatory was nailed down  and dimmed with the rain and smoke of years  it was as much as he could do to make out the forms of the different objects beyond  without making any attempt to be seen or heard —which he had as much chance of being  as if he had lived inside the ball of st paul s cathedral
one afternoon  the dodger and master bates being engaged out that evening  the first named young gentleman took it into his head to evince some anxiety regarding the decoration of his person (to do him justice  this was by no means an habitual weakness with him)  and  with this end and aim  he condescendingly commanded oliver to assist him in his toilet  straightway
oliver was but too glad to make himself useful  too happy to have some faces  however bad  to look upon  too desirous to conciliate those about him when he could honestly do so  to throw any objection in the way of this proposal so he at once expressed his readiness  and  kneeling on the floor  while the dodger sat upon the table so that he could take his foot in his laps  he applied himself to a process which mr dawkins designated as  japanning his trotter cases   the phrase  rendered into plain english  signifieth  cleaning his boots whether it was the sense of freedom and independence which a rational animal may be supposed to feel when he sits on a table in an easy attitude smoking a pipe  swinging one leg carelessly to and fro  and having his boots cleaned all the time  without even the past trouble of having taken them off  or the prospective misery of putting them on  to disturb his reflections  or whether it was the goodness of the tobacco that soothed the feelings of the dodger  or the mildness of the beer that mollified his thoughts  he was evidently tinctured  for the nonce  with a spice of romance and enthusiasm  foreign to his general nature
he looked down on oliver  with a thoughtful countenance  for a brief space  and then  raising his head  and heaving a gentle sign  said  half in abstraction  and half to master bates   what a pity it is he isn t a prig    ah   said master charles bates   he don t know what s good for him   the dodger sighed again  and resumed his pipe  as did charley bates
they both smoked  for some seconds  in silence
206 oliver twist  i suppose you don t even know what a prig is   said the dodger mournfully
 i think i know that   replied oliver  looking up
 it s a the—  you re one  are you not   inquired oliver  checking himself  i am   replied the doger
 i d scorn to be anything else   mr dawkins gave his hat a ferocious cock  after delivering this sentiment  and looked at master bates  as if to denote that he would feel obliged by his saying anything to the contrary
 i am   repeated the dodger
 so s charley
so s fagin
so s sikes
so s nancy
so s bet
so we all are  down to the dog
and he s the downiest one of the lot    and the least given to peaching   added charley bates
 he wouldn t so much as bark in a witness box  for fear of committing himself  no  not if you tied him up in one  and left him there without wittles for a fortnight   said the dodger  not a bit of it   observed charley
 he s a rum dog
don t he look fierce at any strange cove that laughs or sings when he s in company   pursued the dodger
 won t he growl at all  when he hears a fiddle playing  and don t he hate other dogs as ain t of his breed  oh  no    he s an out and out christian   said charley
this was merely intended as a tribute to the animal s abilities  but it was an appropriate remark in another sense  if master bates had only known it  for there are a good many ladies and gentlemen  claiming to be out and out christians  between whom  and mr sikes  dog  there exist strong and singular points of resemblance
 well  well   said the dodger  recurring to the point from which they had strayed  with that mindfulness of his profession which influenced all his proceedings
 this hasn t go anything to do with young green here    no more it has   said charley
 why don t you put yourself under fagin  oliver    and make your fortun  out of hand   added the dodger  with a grin
 and so be able to retire on your property  and do the genteel  as i mean to  in the very next leap year but four that ever comes  and the forty second tuesday in trinity week   said charley bates
 i don t like it   rejoined oliver  timidly   i wish they would let me go
i—i—would rather go    and fagin would rather not   rejoined charley
oliver knew this too well  but thinking it might be dangerous to express his feelings more openly  he only sighed  and went on with his boot cleaning
 go   exclaimed the dodger
 why  where s your spirit   don t you take any pride out of yourself  would you go and be dependent on your friends    oh  blow that   said master bates  drawing two or three silk handkerchiefs from his pocket  and tossing them into a cupboard   that s too mean  that is    i couldn t do it   said the dodger  with an air of haughty disgust
 you can leave your friends  though   said oliver with a 208 oliver twist half smile   and let them be punished for what you did    that   rejoined the dodger  with a wave of his pipe   that was all out of consideration for fagin   cause the traps know that we work together  and he might have got into trouble if we hadn t made our lucky  that was the move  wasn t it  charley   master bates nodded assent  and would have spoken  but the recollection of oliver s flight came so suddenly upon him  that the smoke he was inhaling got entagled with a laugh  and went up into his head  and down into his throat  and brought on a fit of coughing and stamping  about five minutes long
 look here   said the dodger  drawing forth a handful of shillings and halfpence
 here s a jolly life  what s the odds where it comes from  here  catch hold  there s plenty more where they were took from
you won t  won t you  oh  you precious flat    it s naughty  ain t it  oliver   inquired charley bates
 he ll come to be scragged  won t he    i don t know what that means   replied oliver
 something in this way  old feller   said charly
as he said it  master bates caught up an end of his neckerchief  and  holding it erect in the air  dropped his head on his shoulder  and jerked a curious sound through his teeth  thereby indicating  by a lively pantomimic representation  that scragging and hanging were one and the same thing
 that s what it means   said charley
 look how he stares  jack  i never did see such prime company as that  ere boy  he ll be the death of me  i know he will   master charley bates  having laughed heartily again  resumed his pipe with tears in his eyes
 you ve been brought up bad   said the dodger  surveying his boots with much satisfaction when oliver had polished them
 fagin will make something of you  though  or you ll be the first he ever had that turned out unprofitable
you d better begin at once  for you ll come to the trade long before you think of it  and you re only losing time  oliver   master bates backed this advice with sundry moral admonitions of his own  which  being exhausted  he and his friend mr dawkins launched into a glowing description of the numerous pleasures incidental to the life they led  interspersed with a variety of hints to oliver that the best thing he could do  would be to secure fagin s favour without more delay  by the means which they themselves had employed to gain it  and always put this in your pipe  nolly   said the dodger  as the jew was heard unlocking the door above   if you don t take fogels and tickers—   what s the good of talking in that way   interposed master bates   he don t know what you mean    if you don t take pocket handkechers and watches   said the dodger  reducing his conversation to the level of oliver s capacity   some other cove will  so that the coves that lose  em will be all the worse  and you ll be all the worse  too  and nobody half a ha p orth the better  except the chaps wot gets them—and you ve just as good a right to them as they have   210 oliver twist  to be sure  to be sure   said the jew  who had entered unseen by oliver
 it all lies in a nutshell my dear  in a nutshell  take the dodger s word for it
ha  ha  ha  he understands the catechism of his trade   the old man rubbed his hands gleefully together  as he corroborated the dodger s reasoning in these terms  and chuckled with delight at his pupil s proficiency the conversation proceeded no farther at this time  for the jew had returned home accompanied by miss betsy  and a gentleman whom oliver had never seen before  but who was accosted by the dodger as tom chitling  and who  having lingered on the stairs to exchange a few gallantries with the lady  now made his appearance
mr chitling was older in years than the dodger  having perhaps numbered eighteen winters  but there was a degree of deference in his deportment towards that young gentleman which seemed to indicate that he felt himself conscious of a slight inferiority in point of genius and professional aquirements he had small twinkling eyes  and a pockmarked face  wore a fur cap  a dark corduroy jacket  greasy fustian trousers  and an apron
his wardrobe was  in truth  rather out of repair  but he excused himself to the company by stating that his  time  was only out an hour before  and that  in consequence of having worn the regimentals for six weeks past  he had not been able to bestow any attention on his private clothes mr chitling added  with strong marks of irritation  that the new way of fumigating clothes up yonder was infernal unconstitutional  for it burnt holes in them  and there was no remedy against the county
the same remark he considered to apply to the regulation mode of cutting the hair  which he held to be decidedly unlawful
mr chitling wound up his observations by stating that he had not touched a drop of anything for forty two moral long hard working days  and that he  wished he might be busted if he warn t as dry as a lime basket    where do you think the gentleman has come from  oliver   inquired the jew  with a grin  as the other boys put a bottle of spirits on the table
 i—i—don t know  sir   replied oliver
 who s that   inquired tom chitling  casting a contemptuous look at oliver
 a young friend of mine  my dear   replied the jew
 he s in luck  then   said the young man  with a meaning look at fagin
 never mind where i came from  young  un  you ll find your way there  soon enough  i ll bet a crown   at this sally  the boys laughed
after some more jokes on the same subject  they exchanged a few short whispers with fagin  and withdrew
after some words apart between the last comer and fagin  they drew their chairs towards the fire  and the jew  telling oliver to come and sit by him  led the conversation to the topics most calculated to interest his hearers
these were  the great advantages of the trade  the proficiency of the dodger  the amiability of charley bates  and the liberality of the jew himself at length these subjects displayed signs of being thoroughly exhausted  and mr chitling did the same  for the house of correction becomes fatiguing after a week or two
miss betsy accordingly withdrew  and left 212 oliver twist the party to their repose
from this day  oliver was seldom left alone  but was placed in almost constant communication with the two boys  who played the old game with the jew every day  whether for their own improvement or oliver s  mr fagin best knew
at other times the old man would tell them stories of robberies he had committed in his younger days  mixed up with so much that was droll and curious  that oliver could not help laughing heartily  and showing that he was amused in spite of all his better feelings
in short  the wily old jew had the boy in his toils
having prepared his mind  by solitude and gloom  to prefer any society to the companionship of his own sad thoughts in such a dreary place  he was now slowly instilling into his soul the poison which he hoped would blacken it  and change its hue for ever
in which a notable plan is discussed and determined on i t was a chill  damp  windy night  when the jew  buttoning his great coat tight round his shrivelled body  and pulling the collar up over his ears so as completely to obscure the lower part of his face  emerged from his den
he paused on the step as the door was locked and chained behind him  and having listened while the boys made all secure  and until their retreating footsteps were no longer audible  slunk down the street as quickly as he could
the house to which oliver had been conveyed  was in the neighborhood of whitechapel
the jew stopped for an instant at the corner of the street  and  glancing suspiciously round  crossed the road  and struck off in the direction of the spitalfields
the mud lay thick upon the stones  and a black mist hung over the streets  the rain fell sluggishly down  and everything felt cold and clammy to the touch
it seemed just the 214 oliver twist night when it befitted such a being as the jew to be abroad
as he glided stealthily along  creeping beneath the shelter of the walls and doorways  the hideous old man seemed like some loathsome reptile  engendered in the slime and darkness through which he moved  crawling forth  by night  in search of some rich offal for a meal
he kept on his course  through many winding and narrow ways  until he reached bethnal green  then  turning suddenly off to the left  he soon became involved in a maze of the mean and dirty streets which abound in that close and densely populated quarter
the jew was evidently too familiar with the ground he traversed to be at all bewildered  either by the darkness of the night  or the intricacies of the way
he hurried through several alleys and streets  and at length turned into one  lighted only by a single lamp at the farther end
at the door of a house in this street  he knocked  having exchanged a few muttered words with the person who opened it  he walked upstairs
a dog growled as he touched the handle of a room door  and a man s voice demanded who was there
 only me  bill  only me  my dear   said the jew looking in
 bring in your body then   said sikes
 lie down  you stupid brute  don t you know the devil when he s got a greatcoat on   apparently  the dog had been somewhat deceived by mr fagin s outer garment  for as the jew unbuttoned it  and threw it over the back of a chair  he retired to the corner from which he had risen  wagging his tail as he went  to show that he was as well satisfied as it was in his nature to be
 well   said sikes
 well  my dear   replied the jew — ah  nancy   the latter recognition was uttered with just enough of embarrassment to imply a doubt of its reception  for mr fagin and his young friend had not met  since she had interfered in behalf of oliver
all doubts upon the subject  if he had any  were speedily removed by the young lady s behaviour
she took her feet off the fender  pushed back her chair  and bade fagin draw up his  without saying more about it  for it was a cold night  and no mistake
 it is cold  nancy dear   said the jew  as he warmed his skinny hands over the fire
 it seems to go right through one   added the old man  touching his side  it must be a piercer  if it finds its way through your heart   said mr sikes
 give him something to drink  nancy
burn my body  make haste  it s enough to turn a man ill  to see his lean old carcase shivering in that way  like a ugly ghost just rose from the grave   nancy quickly brought a bottle from a cupboard  in which there were many  which  to judge from the diversity of their appearance  were filled with several kinds of liquids
sikes pouring out a glass of brandy  bade the jew drink it off
 quite enough  quite  thankye  bill   replied the jew  putting down the glass after just setting his lips to it
 what  you re afraid of our getting the better of you  are 216 oliver twist you   inquired sikes  fixing his eyes on the jew
 ugh   with a hoarse grunt of contempt  mr sikes seized the glass  and threw the remainder of its contents into the ashes  as a preparatory ceremony to filling it again for himself  which he did at once the jew glanced round the room  as his companion tossed down the second glassful  not in curiousity  for he had seen it often before  but in a restless and suspicious manner habitual to him
it was a meanly furnished apartment  with nothing but the contents of the closet to induce the belief that its occupier was anything but a working man  and with no more suspicious articles displayed to view than two or three heavy bludgeons which stood in a corner  and a  life preserver  that hung over the chimney piece
 there   said sikes  smacking his lips
 now i m ready    for business   inquired the jew
 for business   replied sikes   so say what you ve got to say    about the crib at chertsey  bill   said the jew  drawing his chair forward  and speaking in a very low voice
 yes
wot about it   inquired sikes
 ah  you know what i mean  my dear   said the jew
 he knows what i mean  nancy  don t he    no  he don t   sneered mr sikes
 or he won t  and that s the same thing
speak out  and call things by their right names  don t sit there  winking and blinking  and talking to me in hints  as if you warn t the very first that thought about the robbery
wot d ye mean    hush  bill  hush   said the jew  who had in vain attempted to stop this burst of indignation   somebody will hear us  my dear
somebody will hear us    let  em hear   said sikes   i don t care   but as mr sikes did care  on reflection  he dropped his voice as he said the words  and grew calmer
 there  there   said the jew  coaxingly
 it was only my caution  nothing more
now  my dear  about that crib at chertsey  when is it to be done  bill  eh  when is it to be done  such plate  my dear  such plate   said the jew  rubbing his hands  and elevating his eyebrows in a rapture of anticipation
 not at all   replied sikes coldly
 not to be done at all   echoed the jew  leaning back in his chair
 no  not at all   rejoined sikes
 at least it can t be a put up job  as we expected    then it hasn t been properly gone about   said the jew  turning pale with anger
 don t tell me    but i will tell you   retorted sikes
 who are you that s not to be told  i tell you that toby crackit has been hanging about the place for a fortnight  and he can t get one of the servants in line    do you mean to tell me  bill   said the jew  softening as the other grew heated   that neither of the two men in the house can be got over    yes  i do mean to tell you so   replied sikes
 the old lady has had  em these twenty years  and if you were to give  em five hundred pound  they wouldn t be in it    but do you mean to say  my dear   remonstrated the jew  218 oliver twist  that the women can t be got over    not a bit of it   replied sikes
 not by flash toby crackit   said the jew incredulously
 think what women are  bill    no  not even by flash toby crackit   replied sikes
 he says he s worn sham whiskers  and a canary waistcoat  the whole blessed time he s been loitering down there  and it s all of no use    he should have tried mustachios and a pair of military trousers  my dear   said the jew
 so he did   rejoined sikes   and they warn t of no more use than the other plant   the jew looked blank at this information
after ruminating for some minutes with his chin sunk on his breast  he raised his head and said  with a deep sigh  that if flash toby crackit reported aright  he feared the game was up
 and yet   said the old man  dropping his hands on his knees   it s a sad thing  my dear  to lose so much when we had set our hearts upon it    so it is   said mr sikes
 worse luck   a long silence ensued  during which the jew was plunged in deep thought  with his face wrinkled into an expression of villainy perfectly demoniacal
sikes eyed him furtively from time to time
nancy  apparently fearful of irritating the housebreaker  sat with her eyes fixed upon the fire  as if she had been deaf to all that passed
 fagin   said sikes  abruptly breaking the stillness that prevailed   is it worth fifty shiners extra  if it s safely done from the outside    yes   said the jew  as suddenly rousing himself  is it a bargain   inquired sikes
 yes  my dear  yes   rejoined the jew  his eyes glistening  and every muscle in his face working  with the excitement that the inquiry had awakened
 then   said sikes  thrusting aside the jew s hand  with some disdain   let it come off as soon as you like
toby and me were over the garden wall the night afore last  sounding the panels of the door and shutters
the crib s barred up at night like a jail  but there s one part we can crack  safe and softly    which is that  bill   asked the jew eagerly
 why   whispered sikes   as you cross the lawn—   yes   said the jew  bending his head forward  with his eyes almost starting out of it
 umph   cried sikes  stopping short  as the girl  scarcely moving her head  looked suddenly round  and pointed for an instant to the jew s face
 never mind which part it is
you can t do it without me  i know  but it s best to be on the safe side when one deals with you    as you like  my dear  as you like  replied the jew
 is there no help wanted  but yours and toby s    none   said sikes
 cept a centre bit and a boy
the first we ve both got  the second you must find us    a boy   exclaimed the jew
 oh  then it s a panel  eh    never mind wot it is   replied sikes
 i want a boy  and he musn t be a big  un
lord   said mr sikes  reflectively   if i d only got that young boy of ned  the chimbley sweeper s  he kept him small on purpose  and let him out by the job
220 oliver twist but the father gets lagged  and then the juvenile delinquent society comes  and takes the boy away from a trade where he was arning money  teaches him to read and write  and in time makes a  prentice of him
and so they go on   said mr sikes  his wrath rising with the recollection of his wrongs   so they go on  and  if they d got money enough (which it s a providence they haven t ) we shouldn t have half a dozen boys left in the whole trade  in a year or two    no more we should   acquiesed the jew  who had been considering during this speech  and had only caught the last sentence
 bill    what now   inquired sikes
the jew nodded his head towards nancy  who was still gazing at the fire  and intimated  by a sign  that he would have her told to leave the room
sikes shrugged his shoulders impatiently  as if he thought the precaution unnecessary  but complied  nevertheless  by requesting miss nancy to fetch him a jug of beer  you don t want any beer   said nancy  folding her arms  and retaining her seat very composedly  i tell you i do   replied sikes
 nonsense   rejoined the girl coolly   go on  fagin
i know what he s going to say  bill  he needn t mind me   the jew still hesitated
sikes looked from one to the other in some surprise
 why  you don t mind the old girl  do you  fagin   he asked at length
 you ve known her long enough to trust her  or the devil s in it
she ain t one to blab
are you nancy    i should think not   replied the young lady  drawing her chair up to the table  and putting her elbows upon it
 no  no  my dear  i know you re not   said the jew   but—  and again the old man paused
 but wot   inquired sikes
 i didn t know whether she mightn t p r aps be out of sorts  you know  my dear  as she was the other night   replied the jew
at this confession  miss nancy burst into a loud laugh  and  swallowing a glass of brandy  shook her head with an air of defiance  and burst into sundry exclamations of  keep the game a going    never say die   and the like
these seemed to have the effect of re assuring both gentlemen  for the jew nodded his head with a satisfied air  and resumed his seat  as did mr sikes likewise
 now  fagin   said nancy with a laugh
 tell bill at once  about oliver    ha  you re a clever one  my dear  the sharpest girl i ever saw   said the jew  patting her on the neck
 it was about oliver i was going to speak  sure enough
ha  ha  ha    what about him   demanded sikes
 he s the boy for you  my dear   replied the jew in a hoarse whisper  laying his finger on the side of his nose  and grinning frightfully
 he   exclaimed
sikes
 have him  bill   said nancy
 i would  if i was in your place
he mayn t be so much up  as any of the others  but that s not what you want  if he s only to open a door for you
depend upon it he s a safe one  bill    i know he is   rejoined fagin
 he s been in good training 222 oliver twist these last few weeks  and it s time he began to work for his bread
besides  the others are all too big    well  he is just the size i want   said mr sikes  ruminating
 and will do everything you want  bill  my dear   interposed the jew   he can t help himself that is  if you frighten him enough    frighten him   echoed sikes
 it ll be no sham frightening  mind you
if there s anything queer about him when we once get into the work  in for a penny  in for a pound
you won t see him alive again  fagin
think of that  before you send him
mark my words   said the robber  poising a crowbar  which he had drawn from under the bedstead
 i ve thought of it all   said the jew with energy
 i ve—i ve had my eye upon him  my dears  close—close
once let him feel that he is one of us  once fill his mind with the idea that he has been a thief  and he s ours  ours for his life
oho  it couldn t have come about better  the old man crossed his arms upon his breast  and  drawing his head and shoulders into a heap  literally hugged himself for joy  ours   said sikes
 yours  you mean    perhaps i do  my dear   said the jew  with a shrill chuckle
 mine  if you like  bill    and wot   said sikes  scowling fiercely on his agreeable friend   wot makes you take so much pains about one chalkfaced kid  when you know there are fifty boys snoozing about common garden every night  as you might pick and choose from    because they re of no use to me  my dear   replied the jew  with some confusion   not worth the taking
their looks convict  em when they get into trouble  and i lose  em all
with this boy  properly managed  my dears  i could do what i couldn t with twenty of them
besides   said the jew  recovering his self possession   he has us now if he could only give us leg bail again  and he must be in the same boat with us
never mind how he came there  it s quite enough for my power over him that he was in a robbery  that s all i want
now  how much better this is  than being obliged to put the poor leetle boy out of the way—which would be dangerous  and we should lose by it besides    when is it to be done   asked nancy  stopping some turbulent exclamation on the part of mr sikes  expressive of the disgust with which he received fagin s affectation of humanity
 ah  to be sure   said the jew   when is it to be done  bill    i planned with toby  the night arter to morrow   rejoined sikes in a surly voice   if he heerd nothing from me to the contrairy    good   said the jew   there s no moon    no   rejoined sikes
 it s all arranged about bringing off the swag  is it   asked the jew
sikes nodded
 and about—   oh  ah  it s all planned   rejoined sikes  interrupting him
 never mind particulars
you d better bring the boy here to morrow night
i shall get off the stone an hour arter daybreak
then you hold your tongue  and keep the melting  224 oliver twist pot ready  and that s all you ll have to do   after some discussion  in which all three took an active part  it was decided that nancy should repair to the jew s next evening when the night had set in  and bring oliver away with her  fagin craftily observing  that  if he evinced any disinclination to the task  he would be more willing to accompany the girl who had so recently interfered in his behalf  than anybody else
it was also solemnly arranged that poor oliver should  for the purposes of the contemplated expedition  be unreservedly consigned to the care and custody of mr william sikes  and further  that the said sikes should deal with him as he thought fit  and should not be held responsible by the jew for any mischance or evil that might be necessary to visit him  it being understood that  to render the compact in this respect binding  any representations made by mr sikes on his return should be required to be confirmed and corroborated  in all important particulars  by the testimony of flash toby crackit
these preliminaries adjusted  mr sikes proceeded to drink brandy at a furious rate  and to flourish the crowbar in an alarming manner  yelling forth  at the same time  most unmusical snatches of song  mingled with wild execrations
at length  in a fit of professional enthusiasm  he insisted upon producing his box of housebreaking tools  which he had no sooner stumbled in with  and opened for the purpose of explaining the nature and properties of the various implements it contained  and the peculiar beauties of their construction  than he fell over the box upon the floor  and went to sleep where he fell
 good night  nancy   said the jew  muffling himself up as before  good night   their eyes met  and the jew scrutinised her  narrowly
there was no flinching about the girl
she was as true and earnest in the matter as toby crackit himself could be the jew again bade her good night  and  bestowing a sly kick upon the prostrate form of mr sikes while her back was turned  groped downstairs
 always the way   muttered the jew to himself as he turned homeward  the worst of these women is  that a very little thing serves to call up some long forgotten feeling  and  the best of them is  that it never lasts
ha  ha  the man against the child  for a bag of gold   beguiling the time with these pleasant reflections  mr fagin wended his way  through mud and mire  to his gloomy abode  where the dodger was sitting up  impatiently awaiting his return
 is oliver a bed  i want to speak to him   was his first remark as they descended the stairs
 hours ago   replied the dodger  throwing open a door
 here he is   the boy was lying  fast asleep  on a rude bed upon the floor  so pale with anxiety  and sadness  and the closeness of his prison  that he looked like death  not death as it shows in shroud and coffin  but in the guise it wears when life has just departed  when a young and gentle spirit has  but an instant  fled to heaven  and the gross air of the world has not had time to breathe upon the changing dust it hallowed
226 oliver twist  not now   said the jew  turning softly away
 to morrow
to morrow   wherein olver is delivered over to mr william sikes when oliver awoke in the morning  he was a good deal surprised to find that a new pair of shoes  with strong thick soles  had been placed at his bedside  and that his old shoes had been removed
at first  he was pleased with the discovery  hoping that it might be the forerunner of his release  but such thoughts were quickly dispelled  on his sitting down to breakfast along with the jew  who told him  in a tone and manner which increased his alarm  that he was to be taken to the residence of bill sikes that night
 to—to—stop there  sir   asked oliver  anxiously
 no  no  my dear
not to stop there   replied the jew
 we shouldn t like to lose you
don t be afraid  oliver  you shall come back to us again
ha  ha  ha  we won t be so cruel as to send you away  my dear
oh no  no   the old man  who was stooping over the fire toasting a piece of bread  looked round as he bantered oliver thus  228 oliver twist and chuckled as if to show that he knew he would still be very glad to get away if he could
 i suppose   said the jew  fixing his eyes on oliver   you want to know what you re going to bill s for— eh  my dear   oliver coloured  involuntarily  to find that the old thief had been reading his thoughts  but boldly said  yes  he did want to know
 why  do you think   inquired fagin  parrying the question
 indeed i don t know  sir   replied oliver
 bah   said the jew  turning away with a disappointed countenance from a close perusal of the boy s face
 wait till bill tells you  then   the jew seemed much vexed by oliver s not expressing any greater curiosity on the subject  but the truth is  that  although oliver felt very anxious  he was too much confused by the earnest cunning of fagin s looks  and his own speculations  to make any further inquiries just then
he had no other opportunity  for the jew remained very surly and silent till night  when he prepared to go abroad
 you may burn a candle   said the jew  putting one upon the table
 and here s a book for you to read  till they come to fetch you good night    good night   replied oliver  softly
the jew walked to the door  looking over his shoulder at the boy as he went
suddenly stopping  he called him by his name
oliver looked up  the jew  pointing to the candle  motioned him to light it
he did so  and  as he placed the candlestick upon the table  saw that the jew was gazing fixedly at him  with lowering and contracted brows  from the dark end of the room
 take heed  oliver  take heed   said the old man  shaking his right hand before him in a warning manner
 he s a rough man  and thinks nothing of blood when his own is up
w hatever falls out  say nothing  and do what he bids you
mind   placing a strong emphasis on the last word  he suffered his features gradually to resolve themselves into a ghastly grin  and  nodding his head  left the room oliver leaned his head upon his hand when the old man disappeared  and pondered  with a trembling heart  on the words he had just heard
the more he thought of the jew s admonition  the more he was at a loss to divine its real purpose and meaning
he could think of no bad object to be attained by sending him to sikes  which would not be equally well answered by his remaining with fagin  and after meditating for a long time  concluded that he had been selected to perform some ordinary menial offices for the housebreaker  until another boy  better suited for his purpose could be engaged
he was too well accustomed to suffering  and had suffered too much where he was  to bewail the prospect of change very severely
he remained lost in thought for some minutes  and then  with a heavy sigh  snuffed the candle  and  taking up the book which the jew had left with him  began to read
he turned over the leaves
carelessly at first  but  lighting on a passage which attracted his attention  he soon 230 oliver twist became intent upon the volume
it was a history of the lives and trials of great criminals  and the pages were soiled and thumbed with use
here  he read of dreadful crimes that made the blood run cold  of secret murders that had been committed by the lonely wayside  of bodies hidden from the eye of man in deep pits and wells  which would not keep them down  deep as they were  but had yielded them up at last  after many years  and so maddened the murderers with the sight  that in their horror they had confessed their guilt  and yelled for the gibbet to end their agony
here  too  he read of men who  lying in their beds at dead of night  had been tempted (so they said) and led on  by their own bad thoughts  to such dreadful bloodshed as it made the flesh creep  and the limbs quail  to think of
the terrible descriptions were so real and vivid  that the sallow pages seemed to turn red with gore  and the words upon them  to be sounded in his ears  as if they were whispered  in hollow murmers  by the spirits of the dead
in a paroxysm of fear  the boy closed the book  and thrust it from him
then  falling upon his knees  he prayed heaven to spare him from such deeds  and rather to will that he should die at once  than be reserved for crimes  so fearful and appaling
by degrees  he grew more calm  and besought  in a low and broken voice  that he might be rescued from his present dangers  and that if any aid were to be raised up for a poor outcast boy who had never known the love of friends or kindred  it might come to him now  when  desolate and deserted  he stood alone in the midst of wickedness and guilt
he had concluded his prayer  but still remained with his head buried in his hands  when a rustling noise aroused him
 what s that   he cried  starting up  and catching sight of a figure standing by the door
 who s there    me
only me   replied a tremulous voice
oliver raised the candle above his head  and looked towards the door
it was nancy
 put down the light   said the girl  turning away her head
 it hurts my eyes   oliver saw that she was very pale  and gently inquired if she were ill
the girl threw herself into a chair  with her back towards him  and wrung her hands  but made no reply
 god forgive me   she cried after a while   i never thought of this    has anything happened   asked oliver
 can i help you  i will if i can
i will  indeed   she rocked herself to and fro  caught her throat  and  uttering a gurgling sound  gasped for breath
 nancy   cried oliver   what is it   the girl beat her hands upon her knees  and her feet upon the ground  and  suddenly stopping  drew her shawl close round her  and shivered with cold
oliver stirred the fire
drawing her chair close to it  she sat there  for a little time  without speaking  but at length she raised her head  and looked round
 i don t know what comes over me sometimes   said she  affecting to busy herself in arranging her dress   it s this damp dirty room  i think
now  nolly  dear  are you ready   232 oliver twist  am i to go with you   asked oliver
 yes
i have come from bill   replied the girl
 you are to go with me    what for   asked oliver  recoiling
 what for   echoed the girl  raising her eyes  and averting them again  the moment they encountered the boy s face
 oh  for no harm    i don t believe it   said oliver  who had watched her closely
 have it your own way   rejoined the girl  affecting to laugh
 for no good  then   oliver could see that he had some power over the girl s better feelings  and  for an instant  thought of appealing to her compassion for his helpless state
but  then  the thought darted across his mind that it was barely eleven o clock  and that many people were still in the streets  of whom surely some might be found to give credence to his tale
as the reflection occured to him  he stepped forward  and said  somewhat hastily  that he was ready
neither his brief consideration  nor its purport  was lost on his companion
she eyed him narrowly  while he spoke  and cast upon him a look of intelligence which sufficiently showed that she guessed what had been passing in his thoughts
 hush   said the girl  stooping over him  and pointing to the door as she looked cautiously round
 you can t help yourself
i have tried hard for you  but all to no purpose
you are hedged round and round
if ever you are to get loose from here  this is not the time   struck by the energy of her manner  oliver looked up in her face with great surprise
she seemed to speak the truth  her countenance was white and agitated  and she trembled with very earnestness
 i have saved you from being ill used once  and i will again  and i do now   continued the girl aloud   for those who would have fetched you  if i had not  would have been far more rough than me i have promised for your being quiet and silent  if you are not  you will only do harm to yourself and me too  and perhaps be my death
see here  i have borne all this for you already  as true as god sees me show it   she pointed  hastily  to some livid bruises on her neck and arms  and continued  with great rapidity   remember this  and don t let me suffer more for you  just now if i could help you  i would  but i have not the power
they don t mean to harm you  whatever they make you do  is no fault of yours
hush  every word from you is a blow for me
give me your hand
make haste  your hand  she caught the hand which oliver instinctively placed in hers  and  blowing out the light  drew him after her up the stairs
the door was opened  quickly  by some one shrouded in the darkness  and was as quickly closed  when they had passed out
a hackney cabriolet was in waiting  with the same vehemence which she had exhibited in addressing oliver  the girl pulled him in with her  and drew the curtains close
the driver wanted no directions  but lashed his horse into full speed  without the delay of an instant
the girl still held oliver fast by the hand  and continued 234 oliver twist to pour into his ear  the warnings and assurances she had already imparted
all was so quick and hurried  that he had scarcely time to recollect where he was  or how he came there  when to carriage stopped at the house to which the jew s steps had been directed on the previous evening
for one brief moment  oliver cast a hurried glance along the empty street  and a cry for help hung upon his lips
but the girl s voice was in his ear  beseeching him in such tones of agony to remember her  that he had not the heart to utter it
while he hesitated  the opportunity was gone  he was already in the house  and the door was shut
 this way   said the girl  releasing her hold for the first time
 bill    hallo   replied sikes  appearing at the head of the stairs  with a candle
 oh  that s the time of day
come on   this was a very strong expression of approbation  an uncommonly hearty welcome  from a person of mr sikes  temperament
nancy  appearing much gratified thereby  saluted him cordially
 bull s eye s gone home with tom   observed sikes  as he lighted them up
 he d have been in the way    that s right   rejoined nancy
 so you ve got the kid   said sikes when they had all reached the room  closing the door as he spoke
 yes  here he is   replied nancy
 did he come quiet   inquired sikes
 like a lamb   rejoined nancy
 i m glad to hear it   said sikes  looking grimly at oliver   for the sake of his young carcase  as would otherways have suffered for it
come here  young  un  and let me read you a lectur   which is as well got over at once   thus addressing his new pupil  mr sikes pulled off oliver s cap and threw it into a corner  and then  taking him by the shoulder  sat himself down by the table  and stood the boy in front of him  now  first  do you know wot this is   inquired sikes  taking up a pocket pistol which lay on the table
oliver replied in the affirmative
 well  then  look here   continued sikes
 this is powder  that  ere s a bullet  and this is a little bit of a old hat for waddin    oliver murmured his comprehension of the different bodies referred to  and mr sikes proceeded to load the pistol  with great nicety and deliberation
 now it s loaded   said mr sikes  when he had finished
 yes  i see it is  sir   replied oliver
 well   said the robber  grasping oliver s wrist  and putting the barrel so close to his temple that they touched  at which moment the boy could not repress a start   if you speak a word when you re out o  doors with me  except when i speak to you  that loading will be in your head without notice
so  if you do make up your mind to speak without leave  say your prayers first   having bestowed a scowl upon the object of this warning  to increase its effect  mr sikes continued
 as near as i know  there isn t anybody as would be asking very partickler arter you  if you was disposed of  so i 236 oliver twist needn t take this devil and all of trouble to explain matters to you  if it warn t for you own good
d ye hear me    the short and the long of what you mean   said nancy  speaking very emphatically  and slightly frowning at oliver as if to bespeak his serious attention to her words   is  that if you re crossed by him in this job you have on hand  you ll prevent his ever telling tales afterwards  by shooting him through the head  and will take your chance of swinging for it  as you do for a great many other things in the way of business  every month of your life    that s it   observed mr sikes  approvingly   women can always put things in fewest words — except when it s blowing up  and then they lengthens it out
and now that he s thoroughly up to it  let s have some supper  and get a snooze before starting   in pursuance of this request  nancy quickly laid the cloth  disappearing for a few minutes  she presently returned with a pot of porter and a dish of sheep s heads  which gave occasion to several pleasant witticisms on the part of mr sikes  founded upon the singular coincidence of  jemmies  being a can name  common to them  and also to an ingenious implement much used in his profession indeed  the worthy gentleman  stimulated perhaps by the immediate prospect of being on active service  was in great spirits and good humour  in proof whereof  it may be here remarked  that he humourously drank all the beer at a draught  and did not utter  on a rough calculation  more than four score oaths during the whole progress of the meal
supper being ended—it may be easily conceived that oliver had no great appetite for it—mr sikes disposed of a couple of glasses of spirits and water  and threw himself on the bed  ordering nancy  with many imprecations in case of failure  to call him at five precisely oliver stretched himself in his clothes  by command of the same authority  on a mattress upon the floor  and the girl  mending the fire  sat before it  in readiness to rouse them at the appointed time for a long time oliver lay awake  thinking it not impossible that nancy might seek that opportunity of whispering some further advice  but the girl sat brooding over the fire  without moving  save now and then to trim the light weary with watching and anxiety  he at length fell asleep
when he awoke  the table was covered with tea things  and sikes was thrusting various articles into the pockets of his great coat  which hung over the back of a chair
nancy was busily engaged in preparing breakfast
it was not yet daylight  for the candle was still burning  and it was quite dark outside
a sharp rain  too  was beating against the window panes  and the sky looked black and cloudy
 now  then   growled sikes  as oliver started up   halfpast five  look sharp  or you ll get no breakfast  for it s late as it is   oliver was not long in making his toilet  having taken some breakfast  he replied to a surly inquiry from sikes  by saying that he was quite ready
nancy  scarcely looking at the boy  threw him a handkerchief to tie round his throat  sikes gave him a large rough cape to button over his shoulders
thus attired  he gave his hand to the robber  who  merely pausing to show him 238 oliver twist with a menacing gesture that he had that same pistol in a side pocket of his great coat  clasped it firmly in his  and  exchanging a farewell with nancy  led him away
oliver turned  for an instant  when they reached the door  in the hope of meeting a look from the girl
but she had resumed her old seat in front of the fire  and sat  perfectly motionless before it
the expedition i t was a cheerless morning when they got into the street  blowing and raining hard  and the clouds looking dull and stormy
the night had been very wet  large pools of water had collected in the road  and the kennels were overflowing
there was a faint glimmering of the coming day in the sky  but it rather aggrevated than relieved the gloom of the scene  the sombre light only serving to pale that which the street lamps afforded  without shedding any warmer or brighter tints upon the wet house tops  and dreary streets
there appeared to be nobody stirring in that quarter of the town  the windows of the houses were all closely shut  and the streets through which they passed  were noiseless and empty
by the time they had turned into the bethnal green road  the day had fairly begun to break
many of the lamps were already extinguished  a few country waggons were slowly toiling on  towards london  now and then  a stage coach  covered with mud  rattled briskly by  the driver bestowing  as he passed  and admonitory lash upon the heavy waggoner who  by keeping on the wrong side of the road  had 240 oliver twist endangered his arriving at the office  a quarter of a minute after his time
the public houses  with gas lights burning inside  were already open
by degrees  other shops began to be unclosed  and a few scattered people were met with
then  came straggling groups of labourers going to their work  then  men and women with fish baskets on their heads  donkey carts laden with vegetables  chaise carts filled with live stock or whole carcasses of meat  milk women with pails  an unbroken concourse of people  trudging out with various supplies to the eastern suburbs of the town
as they approached the city  the noise and traffic gradually increased  when they threaded the streets between shoreditch and smithfield  it had swelled into a roar of sound and bustle
it was as light as it was likely to be  till night came on again  and the busy morning of half the london population had begun
turning down sun street and crown street  and crossing finsbury square  mr sikes struck  by way of chiswell street  into barbican  thence into long lane  and so into smithfield  from which latter place arose a tumult of discordant sounds that filled oliver twist with amazement
it was market morning
the ground was covered  nearly ankle deep  with filth and mire  a thick steam  perpetually rising from the reeking bodies of the cattle  and mingling with the fog  which seemd to rest upon the chimney tops  hung heavily above
all the pens in the centre of the large area  and as many temporary pens as could be crowded into the vacant space  were filled with sheep  tied up to posts by the gutter side were long lines of beasts and oxen  three or four deep
countrymen  butchers  drovers  hawkers  boys  thieves  idlers  and vagabonds of every low grade  were mingled together in a mass  the whistling of drovers  the barking dogs  the bellowing and plunging of the oxen  the bleating of sheep  the grunting and squeaking of pigs  the cries of hawkers  the shouts  oaths  and quarrelling on all sides  the ringing of bells and roar of voices  that issued from every public house  the crowding  pushing  driving  beating  whooping and yelling  the hideous and discordant dim that resounded from every corner of the market  and the unwashed  unshaven  squalid  and dirty figues constantly running to and fro  and bursting in and out of the throng  rendered it a stunning and bewildering scene  which quite confounded the senses
mr sikes  dragging oliver after him  elbowed his way through the thickest of the crowd  and bestowed very little attention on the numerous sights and sounds  which so astonished the boy
he nodded  twice or thrice  to a passing friend  and  resisting as many invitations to take a morning dram  pressed steadily onward  until they were clear of the turmoil  and had made their way through hosier lane into holborn
 now  young  un   said sikes  looking up at the clock of st
andrew s church   hard upon seven  you must step out
come  don t lag behind already  lazy legs   mr sikes accompanied this speech with a jerk at his little companion s wrist  oliver  quickening his pace into a kind of trot between a fast walk and a run  kept up with the rapid strides of the house breaker as well as he could
242 oliver twist they held their course at this rate  until they had passed hyde park corner  and were on their way to kensington  when sikes relaxed his pace  until an empty cart which was at some little distance behind  came up
seeing  hounslow  written on it  he asked the driver with as much civility as he could assume  if he would give them a lift as far as isleworth
 jump up   said the man
 is that your boy    yes  he s my boy   replied sikes  looking hard at oliver  and putting his hand abstractedly into the pocket where the pistol was
 your father walks rather too quick for you  don t he  my man   inquired the driver  seeing that oliver was out of breath
 not a bit of it   replied sikes  interposing
 he s used to it
here  take hold of my hand  ned
in with you   thus addressing oliver  he helped him into the cart  and the driver  pointing to a heap of sacks  told him to lie down there  and rest himself as they passed the different mile stones  oliver wondered  more and more  where his companion meant to take him
kensington  hammersmith  chiswick  kew bridge  brentford  were all passed  and yet they went on as steadily as if they had only just begun their journey
at length  they came to a public house called the coach and horses  a little way beyond which  another road appeared to run off
and here  the cart stopped
sikes dismounted with great precipitation  holding oliver by the hand all the while  and lifting him down directly  bestowed a furious look upon him  and rapped the sidepocket with his fist  in a significant manner
 good bye  boy   said the man
 he s sulky   replied sikes  giving him a shake   he s sulky
a young dog  don t mind him    not i   rejoined the other  getting into his cart
 it s a fine day  after all   and he drove away
sikes waited until he had fairly gone  and then  telling oliver he might look about him if he wanted  once again led him onward on his journey
they turned round to the left  a short way past the public house  and then  taking a right hand road  walked on for a long time  passing many large gardens and gentlemen s houses on both sides of the way  and stopping for nothing but a little beer  until they reached a town
here against the wall of a house  oliver saw written up in pretty large letters   hampton   they lingered about  in the fields  for some hours
at length they came back into the town  and  turning into an old public house with a defaced sign board  ordered some dinner by the kitchen fire
the kitchen was an old  low roofed room  with a great beam across the middle of the ceiling  and benches  with high backs to them  by the fire  on which were seated several rough men in smock frocks  drinking and smoking
they took no notice of oliver  and very little of sikes  and  as sikes took very little notice of the  he and his young comrade sat in a corner by themselves  without being much troubled by their company 244 oliver twist they had some cold meat for dinner  and sat so long after it  while mr sikes indulged himself with three or four pipes  that oliver began to feel quite certain they were not going any further being much tired with the walk  and getting up so early  he dozed a little at first  then  quite overpowered by fatigue and the fumes of the tobacco  fell asleep it was quite dark when he was awakened by a push from sikes
rousing himself sufficiently to sit up and look about him  he found that worthy in close fellowship and communication with a labouring man  over a pint of ale  so  you re going on to lower halliford  are you   inquired sikes
 yes  i am   replied the man  who seemed a little the worse—or better  as the case might be—for drinking   and not slow about it neither
my horse hasn t got a load behind him going back  as he had coming up in the mornin   and he won t be long a doing of it
here s luck to him
ecod  he s a good  un    could you give my boy and me a lift as far as there   demanded sikes  pushing the ale towards his new friend
 if you re going directly  i can   replied the man  looking out of the pot
 are you going to halliford    going on to shepperton   replied sikes
 i m your man  as far as i go   replied the other
 is all paid  becky    yes  the other gentleman s paid   replied the girl
 i say   said the man  with tipsy gravity   that won t do  you know    why not   rejoined sikes
 you re a going to accommodate us  and wot s to prevent my standing treat for a pint or so  in return   the stranger reflected upon this argument  with a very profound face  having done so  he seized sikes by the hand  and declared he was a real good fellow
to which mr sikes replied  he was joking  as  if he had been sober  there would have been strong reason to suppose he was
after the exchange of a few more compliments  they bade the company good night  and went out  the girl gathering up the pots and glasses as they did so  and lounging out to the door  with her hands full  to see the party start
the horse  whose health had been drunk in his absence  was standing outside  ready harnessed to the cart
oliver and sikes got in without any further ceremony  and the man to whom he belonged  having lingered for a minute or two  to bear him up   and to defy the hostler and the world to produce his equal  mounted also
then  the hostler was told to give the horse his head  and  his head being given him  he made a very unpleasant use of it  tossing it into the air with great disdain  and running into the parlour windows over the way  after performing those feats  and supporting himself for a short time on his hind legs  he started off at great speed  and rattled out of the town right gallantly the night was very dark
a damp mist rose from the river  and the marshy ground about  and spread itself over the dreary fields
it was piercing cold  too  all was gloomy and black
not a word was spoken  for the driver had grown sleepy  and sikes was in no mood to lead him into conversation
oliver sat huddled together  in a corner of the cart  246 oliver twist bewildered with alarm and apprehension  and figuring strange objects in the gaunt trees  whose branches waved grimly to and fro  as if in some fantastic joy at the desolation of the scene
as they passed sunbury church  the clock struck seven
there was a light in the ferry house window opposite  which streamed across the road  and threw into more sombre shadow a dark yew tree with graves beneath it
there was a dull sound of falling water not far off  and the leaves of the old tree stirred gently in the night wind
it seemed like quiet music for the repose of the dead
sunbury was passed through  and they came again into the lonely road
two or three miles more  and the cart stopped
sikes alighted  took oliver by the hand  and they once again walked on
they turned into no house at shepperton  as the weary boy had expected  but still kept walking on  in mud and darkness  through gloomy lanes and over cold open wastes  until they came within sight of the lights of a town at no great distance
on looking intently forward  oliver saw that the water was just below them  and that they were coming to the foot of a bridge
sikes kept straight on  until they were close upon the bridge  then turned suddenly down a bank upon the left
 the water   thought oliver  turning sick with fear
 he has brought me to this lonely place to murder me   he was about to throw himself on the ground  and make one struggle for his young life  when he saw that they stood before a solitary house  all ruinous and decayed there was a window on each side of the dilapidated entrance  and one story above  but no light was visible
the house was dark  dismantled  and the all appearance  uninhabited
sikes  with oliver s hand still in his  softly approached the low porch  and raised the latch
the door yielded to the pressure  and they passed in together
248 oliver twist the burglary  hallo   cried a loud  hoarse voice  as soon as they set foot in the passage
 don t make such a row   said sikes  bolting the door
 show a glim  toby    aha  my pal   cried the same voice
 a glim  barney  a glim  show the gentleman in  barney  wake up first  if convenient   the speaker appeared to throw a boot jack  or some such article  at the person he addressed  to rouse him from his slumbers  for the noise of a wooden body  falling violently  was heard  and then an indistinct muttering  as of a man between sleep and awake
 do you hear   cried the same voice
 there s bill sikes in the passage with nobody to do the civil to him  and you sleeping there  as if you took laudanum with your meals  and nothing stronger
are you any fresher now  or do you want the iron candlestick to wake you thoroughly   a pair of slipshod feet shuffled  hastily  across the bare floor of the room  as this interrogatory was put  and there issued  from a door on the right hand  first  a feeble candle  and next  the form of the same individual who has been heretofore described as labouring under the infirmity of speaking through his nose  and officiating as waiter at the public house on saffron hill
 bister sikes   exclaimed barney  with real or counterfeit joy   cub id  sir  cub id    here  you get on first   said sikes  putting oliver in front of him
 quicker  or i shall tread upon your heels   muttering a curse upon his tardiness  sikes pushed oliver before him  and they entered a low dark room with a smoky fire  two or three broken chairs  a table  and a very old couch  on which  with his legs much higher than his head  a man was reposing at full length  smoking a long clay pipe
he was dressed in a smartly cut snuff coloured coat  with large brass buttons  an orange neckerchief  a coarse  staring  shawl pattern waistcoat  and drab breeches
mr crackit (for he it was) had no very great quantity of hair  either upon his head or face  but what he had  was of a reddish dye  and tortured into long corkscrew curls  through which he occasionally thrust some very dirty fingers  ornamented with large common rings
he was a trifle above the middle size  and apparently rather weak in the legs  but this circumstance by no means detracted from his own admiration of his top boots  which he contemplated  in their elevated situation  with lively satisfaction  bill  my boy   said this figure  turning his head towards the door   i m glad to see you
i was almost afraid you d given it up  in which case i should have made a personal wentur
hallo   250 oliver twist uttering this exclamation in a tone of great surprise  as his eyes rested on oliver  mr toby crackit brought himself into a sitting posture  and demanded who that was  the boy
only the boy   replied sikes  drawing a chair towards the fire
 wud of bister fagid s lads   exclaimed barney  with a grin
 fagin s  eh   exclaimed toby  looking at oliver
 wot an inwalable boy that ll make  for the old ladies  pockets in chapels  his mug is a fortin  to him    there—there s enough of that   interposed sikes  impatiently  and stooping over his recumbant friend  he whispered a few words in his ear  at which mr crackit laughed immensely  and honoured oliver with a long stare of astonishment
 now   said sikes  as he resumed his seat   if you ll give us something to eat and drink while we re waiting  you ll put some heart in us  or in me  at all events
sit down by the fire  younker  and rest yourself  for you ll have to go out with us again to night  though not very far off   oliver looked at sikes  in mute and timid wonder  and drawing a stool to the fire  sat with his aching head upon his hands  scarecely knowing where he was  or what was passing around him
 here   said toby  as the young jew placed some fragments of food  and a bottle upon the table   success to the crack   he rose to honour the toast  and  carefully depositing his empty pipe in a corner  advanced to the table  filled a glass with spirits  and drank off its contents
mr sikes did the same
 a drain for the boy   said toby  half filling a wine glass
 down with it  innocence    indeed   said oliver  looking piteously up into the man s face   indeed  i—   down with it   echoed toby
 do you think i don t know what s good for you  tell him to drink it  bill    he had better   said sikes clapping his hand upon his pocket
 burn my body  if he isn t more trouble than a whole family of dodgers
drink it  you perwerse imp  drink it   frightened by the menacing gestures of the two men  oliver hastily swallowed the contents of the glass  and immediately fell into a violent fit of coughing  which delighted toby crackit and barney  and even drew a smile from the surly mr sikes
this done  and sikes having satisfied his appetite (oliver could eat nothing but a small crust of bread which they made him swallow)  the two men laid themselves down on chairs for a short nap oliver retained his stool by the fire  barney wrapped in a blanket  stretched himself on the floor  close outside the fender they slept  or appeared to sleep  for some time  nobody stirring but barney  who rose once or twice to throw coals on the fire oliver fell into a heavy doze  imagining himself straying along the gloomy lanes  or wandering about the dark churchyard  or retracing some one or other of the scenes of the past day  when he was roused by toby crackit jumping up and declaring it was half past one in an instant  the other two were on their legs  and all 252 oliver twist were actively engaged in busy preparation
sikes and his companion enveloped their necks and chins in large dark shawls  and drew on their great coats  barney  opening a cupboard  brought forth several articles  which he hastily crammed into the pockets
 barkers for me  barney   said toby crackit
 here they are   replied barney  producing a pair of pistols
 you loaded them yourself    all right   replied toby  stowing them away
 the persuaders    i ve got  em   replied sikes
 crape  keys  centre bits  darkies—nothing forgotten   inquired toby  fastening a small crowbar to a loop inside the skirt of his coat
 all right   rejoined his companion
 bring them bits of timber  barney
that s the time of day   with these words  he took a thick stick from barney s hands  who  having delivered another to toby  busied himself in fastening on oliver s cape  now then   said sikes  holding out his hand
oliver  who was completely stupified by the unwonted exercise  and the air  and the drink which had been forced upon him  put his hand mechanically into that which sikes extended for the purpose
 take his other hand  toby   said sikes
 look out  barney   the man went to the door  and returned to announce that all was quiet
the two robbers issued forth with oliver between them
barney  having made all fast  rolled himself up as before  and was soon asleep again it was now intensely dark
the fog was much heavier than it had been in the early part of the night  and the atmosphere was so damp  that  although no rain fell  oliver s hair and eyebrows  within a few minutes after leaving the house  had become stiff with the half frozen moisture that was floating about
they crossed the bridge  and kept on towards the lights which he had seen before
they were at no great distance off  and  as they walked pretty briskly  they soon arrived at chertsey
 slap through the town   whispered sikes   there ll be nobody in the way  to night  to see us   toby acquiesced  and they hurried through the main street of the little town  which at that late hour was wholly deserted
a dim light shone at intervals from some bedroom window  and the hoarse barking of dogs occasionally broke the silence of the night
but there was nobody abroad
they had cleared the town  as the church bell struck two
quickening their pace  they turned up a road upon the left hand
after walking about a quarter of a mile  they stopped before a detached house surrounded by a wall  to the top of which  toby crackit  scarcely pausing to take breath  climbed in a twinkling
 the boy next   said toby
 hoist him up  i ll catch hold of him   before oliver had time to look round  sikes had caught him under the arms  and in three or four seconds he and toby were lying on the grass on the other side sikes followed directly
and they stole cautiously towards the house
254 oliver twist and now  for the first time  oliver  well nigh mad with grief and terror  saw that housebreaking and robbery  if not murder  were the objects of the expedition
he clasped his hands together  and involuntarily uttered a subdued exclamation of horror
a mist came before his eyes  the cold sweat stood upon his ashy face  his limbs failed him  and he sank upon his knees
 get up   murmured sikes  trembling with rage  and drawing the pistol from his pocket   get up  or i ll strew your brains upon the grass    oh  for god s sake let me go   cried oliver   let me run away and die in the fields
i will never come near london  never  never  oh  pray have mercy on me  and do not make me steal
for the love of all the bright angels that rest in heaven  have mercy upon me   the man to whom this appeal was made  swore a dreadful oath  and had cocked the pistol  when toby  striking it from his grasp  placed his hand upon the boy s mouth  and dragged him to the house
 hush   cried the man   it won t answer here
say another word  and i ll do your business myself with a crack on the head
that makes no noise  and is quite as certain  and more genteel
here  bill  wrench the shutter open
he s game enough now  i ll engage
i ve seen older hands of his age took the same way  for a minute or two  on a cold night   sikes  invoking terrific imprecations upon fagin s head for sending oliver on such an errand  plied the crowbar vigorously  but with little noise
after some delay  and some assistance from toby  the shutter to which he had referred  swung open on its hinges
it was a little lattice window  about five feet and a half above the ground  at the back of the house  which belonged to a scullery  or small brewing place  at the end of the passage
the aperture was so small  that the inmates had probably not thought it worth while to defend it more securely  but it was large enough to admit a boy of oliver s size  nevertheless
a very brief exercise of mr sike s art  sufficed to overcome the fastening of the lattice  and it soon stood wide open also
 now listen  you young limb   whispered sikes  drawing a dark lantern from his pocket  and throwing the glare full on oliver s face   i m a going to put you through there
take this light  go softly up the steps straight afore you  and along the little hall  to the street door  unfasten it  and let us in    there s a bolt at the top  you won t be able to reach   interposed toby
 stand upon one of the hall chairs
there are three there  bill  with a jolly large blue unicorn and gold pitchfork on  em  which is the old lady s arms    keep quiet  can t you   replied sikes  with a threatening look  the room door is open  is it    wide   repied toby  after peeping in to satisfy himself  the game of that is  that they always leave it open with a catch  so that the dog  who s got a bed in here  may walk up and down the passage when he feels wakeful
ha  ha  barney  ticed him away to night
so neat   although mr crackit spoke in a scarcely audible whisper  and laughed without noise  sikes imperiously commanded him to be silent  and to get to work
toby complied  by first 256 oliver twist producing his lantern  and placing it on the ground  then by planting himself firmly with his head against the wall beneath the window  and his hands upon his knees  so as to make a step of his back this was no sooner done  than sikes  mounting upon him  put oiver gently through the window with his feet first  and  without leaving hold of his collar  planted him safely on the floor inside
 take this lantern   said sikes  looking into the room
 you see the stairs afore you   oliver  more dead than alive  gasped out   yes   sikes  pointing to the street door with the pistol barrel  briefly advised him to take notice that he was within shot all the way  and that if he faltered  he would fall dead that instant
 it s done in a minute   said sikes  in the same low whisper
 directly i leave go of you  do your work
hark    what s that   whispered the other man
they listened intently
 nothing   said sikes  releasing his hold of oliver
 now   in the short time he had had to collect his senses  the boy had firmly resolved that  whether he died in the attempt or not  he would make one effort to dart upstairs from the hall  and alarm the family
filled with this idea  he advanced at once  but stealthiy
 come back   suddenly cried sikes aloud
 back  back   scared by the sudden breaking of the dead stillness of the place  and by a loud cry which followed it  oliver let his lantern fall  and knew not whether to advance or fly
the cry was repeated—a light appeared—a vision of two terrified half dressed men at the top of the stairs swam before his eyes—a flash—a loud noise—a smoke—a crash somewhere  but where he knew not —and he staggered back
sikes had disappeared for an instant  but he was up again  and had him by the collar before the smoke had cleared away
he fired his own pistol after the men  who were already retreating  and dragged the boy up
 clasp your arm tighter   said sikes  as he drew him through the window
 give me a shawl here
they ve hit him
quick  how the boy bleeds   then came the loud ringing of a bell  mingled with the noise of fire arms  and the shouts of men  and the sensation of being carried over uneven ground at a rapid pace and then  the noises grew confused in the distance  and a cold deadly feeling crept over the boy s heart  and he saw or heard no more
258 oliver twist which contains the substance of a pleasant conversation between mr bumble and a lady  and shows that even a beadle may be susceptible on some points the night was bitter cold
the snow lay on the ground  frozen into a hard thick crust  so that only the heaps that had drifted into byways and corners were affected by the sharp wind that howled abroad  which  as if expending increased fury on such prey as it found  caught it savagely up in clouds  and  whirling it into a thousand misty eddies  scattered it in air
bleak  dark  and piercing cold  it was a night for the well housed and fed to draw round the bright fire and thank god they were at home  and for the homeless  starving wretch to lay him down and die many hungerworn outcasts close their eyes in our bare streets  at such times  who  let their crimes have been what they may  can hardly open them in a more bitter world
such was the aspect of out of doors affairs  when mr corney  the matron of the workhouse to which our readers have been already introduced as the birthplace of oliver twist  sat herself down before a cheerful fire in her own little room  and glanced  with no small degree of complacency  at a small round table  on which stood a tray of corresponding size  furnished with all necessary materials for the most grateful meal that matrons enjoy
in fact  mrs corney was about to solace herself with a cup of tea as she glanced from the table to the fireplace  where the smallest of all possible kettles was singing a small song in a small voice  her inward satisfaction evidently increased —so much so  indeed  that mrs corney smiled  well   said the matron  leaning her elbow on the table  and looking reflectively at the fire   i m sure we have all on us a great deal to be grateful for  a great deal  if we did but know it
ah   mrs corney shook her head mournfully  as if deploring the mental blindness of those paupers who did not know it  and thrusting a silver spoon (private property) into the inmost recesses of a two ounce tin tea caddy  proceeded to make the tea 260 oliver twist how slight a thing will disturb the equanimity of our frail minds  the black teapot  being very small and easily filled  ran over while mrs corney was moralising  and the water slightly scalded mrs corney s hand  drat the pot   said the worthy matron  setting it down very hastily on the hob   a little stupid thing  that only holds a couple of cups  what use is it of  to anybody  except   said mrs corney  pausing   except to a poor desolate creature like me oh dear   with these words  the matron dropped into her chair  and  once more resting her elbow on the table  thought of her solitary fate the small teapot  and the single cup  had awakened in her mind sad recollections of mr corney (who had not been dead more than five and twenty years)  and she was overpowered
 i shall never get another   said mrs corney  pettishly   i shall never get another—like him   whether this remark bore reference to the husband  or the teapot  is uncertain it might have been the latter  for mrs corney looked at it as she spoke  and took it up afterwards she had just tasted her first cup  when she was disturbed by a soft tap at the room door
 oh  come in with you   said mrs corney  sharply  some of the old women dying  i suppose
they always die when i m at meals
don t stand there  letting the cold air in  don t
what s amiss now  eh    nothing  ma am  nothing   replied a man s voice
 dear me   exclaimed the matron  in a much sweeter tone   is that mr bumble    at your service  ma am   said mr bumble  who had been stopping outside to rub his shoes clean  and to shake the snow off his coat  and who now made his appearance  bearing the cocked hat in one hand and a bundle in the other
 shall i shut the door  ma am   the lady modestly hesitated to reply  lest there should be any impropriety in holding an interview with mr bumble  with closed doors
mr bumble taking advantage of the hesitation  and being very cold himself  shut it without permission  hard weather  mr bumble   said the matron
 hard  indeed  ma am   replied the beadle
 anti porochial weather this  ma am
we have given away  mrs corney  we have given away a matter of twenty quartern loaves and a cheese and a half  this very blessed afternoon  and yet them paupers are not contented    of course not when would they be  mr bumble   said the matron  sipping her tea
 when  indeed  ma am   rejoined mr bumble
 why here s one man that  in consideraton of his wife and large family  has a quartern loaf and a good pound of cheese  full weight
is he grateful  ma am  is he grateful  not a copper farthing s worth of it  what does he do  ma am  but ask for a few coals  if it s only a pocket handkerchief full  he says  coals  what would he do with coals  toast his cheese with  em and then come back for more
that s the way with these people  ma am  give  em a apron full of coals to day  and they ll come back for another  the day after to morrow  as brazen as alabaster   262 oliver twist the matron expressed her entire concurrence in this intelligible simile  and the beadle went on
 i never   said mr bumble   see anything like the pitch it s got to
the day afore yesterday  a man—you have been a married woman  ma am  and i may mention it to you—a man  with hardly a rag upon his back (here mrs corney looked at the floor)  goes to our overseer s door when he has got company coming to dinner  and says  he must be relieved  mrs corney as he wouldn t go away  and shocked the company very much  our overseer sent him out a pound of potatoes and half a pint of oatmeal  my heart   says the ungrateful villain   what s the use of this to me  you might as well give me a pair of iron spectacles    very good   says our overseer  taking  em away again   you won t get anything else here    then i ll die in the streets   says the vagrant
 oh no  you won t   says our overseer    ha  ha  that was very good  so like mr grannett  wasn t it   interposed the matron
 well  mr bumble    well  ma am   rejoined the beadle   he went away  and he did die in the streets
there s a obstinate pauper for you    it beats anything i could have believed   observed the matron emphatically
 but don t you think out of door relief a very bad thing  any way  mr bumble  you re a gentleman of experience  and ought to know
come    mrs corney   said the beadle  smiling as men smile who are conscious of superior information   out of door relief  properly managed  ma am  is the porochial safeguard the great principle of out of door relief is  to give the paupers exactly what they don t want  and then they get tired of coming    dear me   exclaimed mrs corney  well  that is a good one  too    yes
betwixt you and me  ma am   returned mr bumble   that s the great principle  and that s the reason why  if you look at any cases that get into them owdacious newspapers  you ll always observe that sick families have been relieved with slices of cheese
that s the rule now  mrs corney  all over the country but  however   said the beadle  stopping to unpack his bundle   these are official secrets  ma am  not to be spoken of  except  as i may say  among the porochial officers  such as ourselves
this is the port wine  ma am  that the board ordered for the infirmary  real  fresh  genuine port wine  only out of the cask this forenoon  clear as a bell  and no sediment   having held the first bottle up to the light  and shaken it well to test its excellence  mr bumble placed them both on top of a chest of drawers  folded the handkerchief in which they had been wrapped  put it carefully in his pocket  and took up his hat  as if to go
 you ll have a very cold walk  mr bumble   said the matron
 it blows  ma am   replied mr bumble  turning up his coat collar   enough to cut one s ears off   the matron looked  from the little kettle  to the beadle  who was moving towards the door  and as the beadle coughed  preparatory to bidding her good night  bashfully inquired whether—whether he wouldn t take a cup of tea  mr bumble instantaneously turned back his collar again  264 oliver twist laid his hat and stick upon a chair  and drew another chair up to the table
as he slowly seated himself  he looked at the lady she fixed her eyes upon the little teapot
mr bumble coughed again  and slightly smiled
mrs corney rose to get another cup and saucer from the closet as she sat down  her eyes once again encountered those of the gallant beadle  she coloured  and applied herself to the task of making his tea
again mr bumble coughed— louder this time than he had coughed yet
 sweet  mr bumble   inquired the matron  taking up the sugar basin
 very sweet  indeed  ma am   replied mr bumble
he fixed his eyes on mrs corney as he said this  and if ever a beadle looked tender  mr bumble was that beadle at that moment the tea was made  and handed in silence
mr bumble  having spread a handkerchief over his knees to prevent the crumbs from sullying the splendour of his shorts  began to eat and drink  varying these amusements  occasionally  by fetching a deep sigh  which  however  had no injurious effect upon his appetite  but  on the contrary  rather seemed to facilitate his operations in the tea and toast department  you have a cat  ma am  i see   said mr bumble  glancing at one who  in the centre of her family  was basking before the fire   and kittens too  i declare    i am so fond of them  mr bumble you can t think   replied the matron
 they re so happy  so frolicsome  and so cheerful  that they are quite companions for me    very nice animals  ma am   replied mr bumble  approvingly   so very domestic    oh  yes   rejoined the matron with enthusiasm   so fond of their home too  that it s quite a pleasure  i m sure    mrs corney  ma am  said mr bumble  slowly  and marking the time with his teaspoon   i mean to say this  ma am  that any cat  or kitten  that could live with you  ma am  and not be fond of its home  must be a ass  ma am    oh  mr bumble   remonstrated mrs corney  it s of no use disguising facts  ma am   said mr bumble  slowly flourishing the teaspoon with a kind of amorous dignity which made him doubly impressive   i would drown it myself  with pleasure    then you re a cruel man   said the matron vivaciously  as she held out her hand for the beadle s cup   and a very hardhearted man besides    hard hearted  ma am   said mr bumble  hard   mr bumble resigned his cup without another word  squeezed mrs corney s little finger as she took it  and inflicting two open handed slaps upon his laced waistcoat  gave a mighty sigh  and hitched his chair a very little morsel farther from the fire it was a round table  and as mrs corney and mr bumble had been sitting opposite each other  with no great space between them  and fronting the fire  it will be seen that mr bumble  in receding from the fire  and still keeping at the table  increased the distance between himself and mrs corney  which proceeding  some prudent readers will doubtless be disposed to admire  and to consider an act of great heroism on mr bumble s part  he being in some sort tempted by 266 oliver twist time  place  and opportunity  to give utterance to certain soft nothings  which however well they may become the lips of the light and thoughtless  do seem immeasurably beneath the dignity of judges of the land  members of parliament  ministers of state  lord mayors  and other great public functionaries  but more particularly beneath the stateliness and gravity of a beadle  who (as is well known) should be the sternest and most inflexible among them all whatever were mr bumble s intentions  however (and no doubt they were of the best)  it unfortunately happened  as has been twice before remarked  that the table was a round one  consequently mr bumble  moving his chair by little and little  soon began to diminish the distance between himself and the matron  and  continuing to travel round the outer edge of the circle  brought his chair  in time  close to that in which the matron was seated indeed  the two chairs touched  and when they did so  mr bumble stopped now  if the matron had moved her chair to the right  she would have been scorched by the fire  and if to the left  she must have fallen into mr bumble s arms  so (being a discreet matron  and no doubt foreseeing these consequences at a glance) she remained where she was  and handed mr bumble another cup of tea  hard hearted  mrs corney   said mr bumble  stirring his tea  and looking up into the matron s face   are you hard hearted  mrs corney    dear me   exclaimed the matron   what a very curious question from a single man what can you want to know for  mr bumble   the beadle drank his tea to the last drop  finished a piece of toast  whisked the crumbs off his knees  wiped his lips  and deliberately kissed the matron  mr bumble   cried that discreet lady in a whisper  for the fright was so great  that she had quite lost her voice   mr bumble  i shall scream   mr bumble made no reply  but in a slow and dignified manner  put his arm round the matron s waist as the lady had stated her intention of screaming  of course she would have screamed at this additional boldness  but that the exertion was rendered unnecessary by a hasty knocking at the door  which was no sooner heard  than mr bumble darted  with much agility  to the wine bottles  and began dusting them with great violence  while the matron sharply demanded who was there
it is worthy of remark  as a curious physical instance of the efficacy of a sudden surprise in counteracting the effects of extreme fear  that her voice had quite recovered all its official asperity
 if you please  mistress   said a withered old female pauper  hideously ugly  putting her head in at the door   old sally is a going fast    well  what s that to me   angrily demanded the matron
 i can t keep her alive  can i    no  no  mistress   replied the old woman   nobody can  she s far beyond the reach of help
i ve seen a many people die  little babes and great strong men  and i know when death s a coming  well enough
but she s troubled in her 268 oliver twist mind  and when the fits are not on her —and that s not often  for she is dying very hard —she says she has got something to tell  which you must hear
she ll never die quiet till you come  mistress   at this intelligence  the worthy mrs corney muttered a variety of invectives against old women who couldn t even die without purposely annoying their betters  and  muffling herself in a thick shawl which she hastily caught up  briefly requested mr bumble to stay till she came back  lest anything particular should occur bidding the messenger walk fast  and not be all night hobbling up the stairs  she followed her from the room with a very ill grace  scolding all the way
mr bumble s conduct on being left to himself  was rather inexplicable he opened the closet  counted the teaspoons  weighed the sugar tongs  closely inspected a silver milk pot to ascertain that it was of the genuine metal  and  having satisfied his curiosity on these points  put on his cocked hat corner wise  and danced with much gravity four distinct times round the table
having gone through this very extraordinary performance  he took off the cocked hat again  and  spreading himself before the fire with his back towards it  seemed to be mentally engaged in taking an exact inventory of the furniture treats on a very poor subject
but is a short one  and may be found of importance in this history i t was no unfit messanger of death  who had disturbed the quiet of the matron s room
her body was bent by age  her limbs trembled with palsy  her face  distorted into a mumbling leer  resembled more the grotesque shaping of some wild pencil  than the work of nature s hand
alas  how few of nature s faces are left alone to gladden us with their beauty  the cares  and sorrows  and hungerings  of the world  change them as they change hearts  and it is only when those passions sleep  and have lost their hold for ever  that the troubled clouds pass off  and leave heaven s surface clear
it is a common thing for the countenances of the dead  even in that fixed and rigid state  to subside into 270 oliver twist the long forgotten expression of sleeping infancy  and settle into the very look of early life  so calm  so peaceful  do they grow again  that those who knew them in their happy childhood  kneel by the coffin s side in awe  and see the angel even upon earth
the old crone tottered alone the passages  and up the stairs  muttering some indistinct answers to the chidings of her companion  being at length compelled to pause for breath  she gave the light into her hand  and remained behind to follow as she might  while the more nimble superior made her way to the room where the sick woman lay
it was a bare garret room  with a dim light burning at the farther end
there was another old woman watching by the bed  the parish apothecary s apprentice was standing by the fire  making a toothpick out of a quill
 cold night  mrs corney   said this young gentleman  as the matron entered  very cold  indeed  sir   replied the mistress  in her most civil tones  and dropping a curtsey as she spoke
 you should get better coals out of your contractors   said the apothecary s deputy  breaking a lump on the top of the fire with the rusty poker   these are not at all the sort of thing for a cold night    they re the board s choosing  sir   returned the matron
 the least they could do  would be to keep us pretty warm  for our places are hard enough   the conversation was here interrupted by a moan from the sick woman
 oh   said the young mag  turning his face towards the bed  as if he had previously quite forgotten the patient   it s all u p
there  mrs corney    it is  is it  sir   asked the matron  if she lasts a couple of hours  i shall be surprised   said the apothecary s apprentice  intent upon the toothpick s point
 it s a break up of the system altogether
is she dozing  old lady   the attendant stooped over the bed  to ascertain  and nodded in the affirmative
 then perhaps she ll go off in that way  if you don t make a row   said the young man
 put the light on the floor
she won t see it there   the attendant did as she was told  shaking her head meanwhile  to intimate that the woman would not die so easily  having done so  she resumed her seat by the side of the other nurse  who had by this time returned
the mistress  with an expression of impatience  wrapped herself in her shawl  and sat at the foot of the bed
the apothecary s apprentice  having completed the manufacture of the toothpick  planted himself in front of the fire and made good use of it for ten minutes or so  when apparently growing rather dull  he wished mrs corney joy of her job  and took himself off on tiptoe when they had sat in silence for some time  the two old women rose from the bed  and crouching over the fire  held out their withered hands to catch the heat the flame threw a ghastly light on their shrivelled faces  and made their ugliness appear terrible  as  in this position  they began to converse in a low voice 272 oliver twist  did she say any more  anny dear  while i was gone   inquired the messenger
 not a word   replied the other
 she plucked and tore at her arms for a little time  but i held her hands  and she soon dropped off she hasn t much strength in her  so i easily kept her quiet
i ain t so weak for an old woman  although i am on parish allowance  no  no    did she drink the hot wine the doctor said she was to have   demanded the first
 i tried to get it down   rejoined the other
 but her teeth were tight set  and she clenched the mug so hard that it was as much as i could do to get it back again
so i drank it  and it did me good   looking cautiously round  to ascertain that they were not overheard  the two hags cowered nearer to the fire  and chuckled heartily
 i mind the time   said the first speaker   when she would have done the same  and made rare fun of it afterwards    ay  that she would   rejoined the other   she had a merry heart
a many  many  beautiful corpses she laid out  as nice and neat as waxwork
my old eyes have seen them—ay  and those old hands touched them too  for i have helped her  scores of times   stretching forth her trembling fingers as she spoke  the old creature shook them exultingly before her face  and fumbling in her pocket  brought out an old time discoloured tin snuff box  from which she shook a few grains into the outstretched palm of her companion  and a few more into her own while they were thus employed  the matron  who had been impatiently watching until the dying woman should awaken from her stupor  joined them by the fire  and sharply asked how long she was to wait   not long  mistress   replied the second woman  looking up into her face
 we have none of us long to wait for death
patience  patience  he ll be here soon enough for us all    hold your tongue  you doting idiot   said the matron sternly
 you  martha  tell me  has she been in this way before    often   answered the first woman
 but will never be again   added the second one   that is  she ll never wake again but once—and mind  mistress  that won t be for long    long or short   said the matron  snappishly   she won t find me here when she does wake  take care  both of you  how you worry me again for nothing
it s no part of my duty to see all the old women in the house die  and i won t—that s more
mind that  you impudent old harridans
if you make a fool of me again  i ll soon cure you  i warrant you   she was bouncing away  when a cry from the two women  who had turned towards the bed  caused her to look round
the patient had raised herself upright  and was stretching her arms towards them  who s that   she cried  in a hollow voice  hush  hush   said one of the women  stooping over her
 lie down  lie down    i ll never lie down again alive   said the woman  struggling
 i will tell her  come here  nearer  let me whisper 274 oliver twist in your ear   she clutched the matron by the arm  and forcing her into a chair by the bedside  was about to speak  when looking round  she caught sight of the two old women bending forward in the attitude of eager listeners
 turn them away   said the woman  drowsily   make haste  make haste   the two old crones  chiming in together  began pouring out many piteous lamentations that the poor dear was too far gone to know her best friends  and were uttering sundry protestations that they would never leave her  when the superior pushed them from the room  closed the door  and returned to the bedside
on being excluded  the old ladies changed their tone  and cried through the keyhole that old sally was drunk  which  indeed  was not unlikely  since  in addition to a moderate dose of opium prescribed by the apothecary  she was labouring under the effects of a final taste of gin and water which had been privily administered  in the openness of their hearts  by the worthy old ladies themselves  now listen to me   said the dying woman aloud  as if making a great effort to revive one latent spark of energy
 in this very room—in this very bed—i once nursed a pretty young creetur   that was brought into the house with her feet cut and bruised with walking  and all soiled with dust and blood
she gave birth to a boy  and died
let me think— what was the year again    never mind the year   said the impatient auditor   what about her    ay   murmured the sick woman  relapsing into her former drowsy state   what about her —what about—i know   she cried  jumping fiercely up  her face flushed  and her eyes starting from her head— i robbed her  so i did  she wasn t cold—i tell you she wasn t cold  when i stole it    stole what  for god s sake   cried the matron  with a gesture as if she would call for help
 it   replied the woman  laying her hand over the other s mouth
 the only thing she had
she wanted clothes to keep her warm  and food to eat  but she had kept it safe  and had it in her bosom
it was gold  i tell you  rich gold  that might have saved her life    gold   echoed the matron  bending eagerly over the woman as she fell back
 go on  go on—yest—what of it  who was the mother  when was it    she charge me to keep it safe   replied the woman with a groan   and trusted me as the only woman about her
i stole it in my heart when she first showed it me hanging round her neck  and the child s death  perhaps  is on me besides  they would have treated him better  if they had known it all    known what   asked the other
 speak    the boy grew so like his mother   said the woman  rambling on  and not heeding the question   that i could never forget it when i saw his face
poor girl  poor girl  she was so young  too  such a gentle lamb  wait  there s more to tell
i have not told you all  have i    no  no   replied the matron  inclining her head to catch 276 oliver twist the words  as they came more faintly from the dying woman
 be quick  or it may be too late    the mother   said the woman  making a more violent effort than before   the mother  when the pains of death first came upon her  whispered in my ear that if her baby was born alive  and thrived  the day might come when it would not feel so much disgraced to hear its poor young mother named
 and oh  kind heaven   she said  folding her thin hands together   whether it be boy or girl  raise up some friends for it in this troubled world  and take pity upon a lonely desolate child  abandoned to its mercy    the boy s name   demanded the matron
 they called him oliver   replied the woman  feebly
 the gold i stole was—   yes  yes—what   cried the other
she was bending eagerly over the woman to hear her reply  but drew back  instinctively  as she once again rose  slowly and stiffly  into a sitting posture  then  clutching the coverlid with both hands  muttered some indistinct sounds in her throat  and fell lifeless on the bed
 stone dead   said one of the old women  hurrying in as soon as the door was opened
 and nothing to tell  after all   rejoined the matron  walking carelessly away
the two crones  to all appearance  too busily occupied in the preparations for their dreadful duties to make any reply  were left alone  hovering about the body
wherein this history reverts to mr fagin and company while these things were passing in the country workhouse  mr fagin sat in the old den—the same from which oliver had been removed by the girl—brooding over a dull  smoky fire
he held a pair of bellows upon his knee  with which he had apparently been endeavouring to rouse it into more cheerful action  but he had fallen into deep thought  and with his arms folded on them  and his chin resting on his thumbs  fixed his eyes  abstractedly  on the rusty bars at a table behind him sat the artful dodger  master charles bates  and mr chitling  all intent upon a game of whist  the artful taking dummy against master bates and mr chitling
the countenance of the first named gentleman  peculiarly intelligent at all times  acquired great additional interest from his close observance of the game  and his attentive perusal of mr chitling s hand  upon which  from 278 oliver twist time to time  as occasion served  he bestowed a variety of earnest glances  wisely regulating his own play by the result of his observations upon his neighbour s cards
it being a cold night  the dodger wore his hat  as  indeed  was often his custom within doors
he also sustained a clay pipe between his teeth  which he only removed for a brief space when he deemed it necessary to apply for refreshment to a quart pot upon the table  which stood ready filled with ginand water for the accommodation of the company
master bates was also attentive to the play  but being of a more excitable nature than his accomplished friend  it was observable that he more frequently applied himself to the gin and water  and moreover indulged in many jests and irrelevant remarks  all highly unbecoming a scientific rubber indeed  the artful  presuming upon their close attachment  more than once took occasion to reason gravely with his companion upon these improprieties  all of which remonstrances  master bates received in extremely good part  merely requesting his friend to be  blowed   or to insert his head in a sack  or replying with some other neatly turned witticism of a similar kind  the happy application of which  excited considerable admiration in the mind of mr chitling
it was remarkable that the latter gentleman and his partner invariably lost  and that the circumstance  so far from angering master bates  appeared to afford him the highest amusement  inasmuch as he laughed most uproariously at the end of every deal  and protested that he had never seen such a jolly game in all his born days  that s two doubles and the rub   said mr chitling  with a very long face  as he drew half a crown from his waistcoat pocket
 i never see such a feller as you  jack  you win everything
even when we ve good cards  charley and i can t make nothing of  em   either the master or the manner of this remark  which was made very ruefully  delighted charley bates so much  that his consequent shout of laughter roused the jew from his reverie  and induced him to inquire what was the matter
 matter  fagin   cried charley
 i wish you had watched the play
tommy chitling hasn t won a point  and i went partners with him against the artfull and dumb    ay  ay   said the jew  with a grin  which sufficiently demonstrated that he was at no loss to understand the reason
 try  em again  tom  try  em again    no more of it for me  thank  ee  fagin   replied mr chitling   i ve had enough
that  ere dodger has such a run of luck that there s no standing again  him    ha  ha  my dear   replied the jew   you must get up very early in the morning  to win against the dodger    morning   said charley bates   you must put your boots on over night  and have a telescope at each eye  and a opera glass between your shoulders  if you want to come over him   mr dawkins received these handsome compliments with much philosophy  and offered to cut any gentleman in company  for the first picture card  at a shilling at a time
nobody accepting the challenge  and his pipe being by this time smoked out  he proceeded to amuse himself by sketch  280 oliver twist ing a ground plan of newgate on the table with the piece of chalk which had served him in lieu of counters  whistling  meantime  with peculiar shrillness  how precious dull you are  tommy   said the dodger  stopping short when there had been a long silence  and addressing mr chitling  what do you think he s thinking of  fagin    how should i know  my dear   replied the jew  looking round as he plied the bellows
 about his losses  maybe  or the little retirement in the country that he s just left  eh  ha  ha  is that it  my dear    not a bit of it   replied the dodger  stopping the subject of discourse as mr chitling was about to reply
 what do you say  charley    i should say   replied master bates  with a grin   that he was uncommon sweet upon betsy
see how he s a blushing  oh  my eye  here s a merry go rounder  tommy chitling s in love  oh  fagin  fagin  what a spree   thoroughly overpowered with the notion of mr chitling being the victim of the tender passion  master bates threw himself back in his chair with such violence  that he lost his balance  and pitched over upon the floor  where (the accident abating nothing of his merriment) he lay at full length until his laugh was over  when he resumed his former position  and began another laugh  never mind him  my dear   said the jew  winking at mr dawkins  and giving master bates a reproving tap with the nozzle of the bellows
 betsy s a fine girl
stick up to her  tom
stick up to her    what i mean to say  fagin   replied mr chitling  very red in the face   is  that that isn t anything to anybody here    no more it is   replied the jew   charley will talk
don t mind him  my dear  don t mind him
betsy s a fine girl
do as she bids you  tom  and you will make your fortune    so i do do as she bids me   replied mr chitling   i shouldn t have been milled  if it hadn t been for her advice
but it turned out a good job for you  didn t it  fagin  and what s six weeks of it  it must come  some time or another  and why not in the winter time when you don t want to go out a walking so much  eh  fagin    ah  to be sure  my dear   replied the jew
 you wouldn t mind it again  tom  would you   asked the dodger  winking upon charley and the jew   if bet was all right    i mean to say that i shouldn t   replied tom  angrily
 there  now
ah  who ll say as much as that  i should like to know  eh  fagin    nobody  my dear   replied the jew   not a soul  tom
i don t know one of  em that would do it besides you  not one of  em  my dear    i might have got clear off  if i d split upon her  mightn t i  fagin   angrily pursued the poor half witted dupe
 a word from me would have done it  wouldn t it  fagin    to be sure it would  my dear   replied the jew
 but i didn t blab it  did i  fagin   demanded tom  pouring question upon question with great volubility
 no  no  to be sure   replied the jew   you were too stouthearted for that
a deal too stout  my dear   282 oliver twist  perhaps i was   rejoined tom  looking round   and if i was  what s to laugh at  in that  eh  fagin   the jew  perceiving that mr chitling was considerably roused  hastened to assure him that nobody was laughing  and to prove the gravity of the company  appealed to master bates  the principal offender
but  unfortunately  charley  in opening his mouth to reply that he was never more serious in his life  was unable to prevent the escape of such a violent roar  that the abused mr chitling  without any preliminary ceremonies  rushed across the room and aimed a blow at the offender  who  being skilful in evading pursuit  ducked to avoid it  and chose his time so well that it lighted on the chest of the merry old gentleman  and caused him to stagger to the wall  where he stood panting for breath  while mr chitling looked on in intense dismay
 hark   cried the dodger at this moment   i heard the tinkler   catching up the light  he crept softly upstairs
the bell was rung again  with some impatience  while the party were in darkness
after a short pause  the dodger reappeared  and whispered fagin mysteriously
 what   cried the jew   alone   the dodger nodded in the affirmative  and  shading the flame of the candle with his hand  gave charley bates a private intimation  in dumb show  that he had better not be funny just then
having performed this friendly office  he fixed his eyes on the jew s face  and awaited his directions
the old man bit his yellow fingers  and meditated for some seconds  his face working with agitation the while  as if he dreaded something  and feared to know the worst
at length he raised his head
 where is he   he asked
the dodger pointed to the floor above  and made a gesture  as if to leave the room
 yes   said the jew  answering the mute inquiry   bring him down
hush  quiet  charley  gently  tom  scarce  scarce   this brief direction to charley bates  and his recent antagonist  was softly and immediately obeyed
there was no sound of their whereabout  when the dodger descended the stairs  bearing the light in his hand  and followed by a man in a coarse smock frock  who  after casting a hurried glance round the room  pulled off a large wrapper which had concealed the lower portion of his face  and disclosed  all haggard  unwashed  and unshorn  the features of flash toby crackit
 how are you  faguey   said this worthy  nodding to the jew
 pop that shawl away in my castor  dodger  so that i may know where to find it when i cut  that s the time of day  you ll be a fine young cracksman afore the old file now   with these words he pulled up the smock frock  and  winding it round his middle  drew a chair to the fire  and placed his feet upon the hob
 see there  faguey   he said  pointing disconsolately to his top boots   not a drop of day and martin since you know when  not a bubble of blacking  by jove  but don t look at me in that way  man
all in good time
i can t talk about business till i ve eat and drank  so produce the sustainance  and let s have a quiet fill out for the first time these three days   284 oliver twist the jew motioned to the dodger to place what eatables there were  upon the table  and  seating himself opposite the housebreaker  waited his leisure to judge from appearances  toby was by no means in a hurry to open the conversation
at first  the jew contented himself with patiently watching his countenance  as if to gain from its expression some clue to the intelligence he brought  but in vain he looked tired and worn  but there was the same complacent repose upon his features that they always wore  and through dirt  and beard  and whisker  there still shone  unimpaired  the self satisfied smirk of flash toby crackit
then the jew  in an agony of impatience  watched every morsel he put into his mouth  pacing up and down the room  meanwhile  in irrepressible excitement
it was all of no use
toby continued to eat with the utmost outward indifference  until he could eat no more  then  ordering the dodger out  he closed the door  mixed a glass of spirits and water  and composed himself for talking  first and foremost  faguey   said toby
 yes  yes   interposed the jew  drawing up his chair
mr crackit stopped to take a draught of spirits and water  and to declare that the gin was excellent  then placing his feet against the low mantelpiece  so as to bring his boots to about the level of his eye  he quietly resumed
 first and foremost  faguey   said the housebreaker   how s bill    what   screamed the jew  starting from his seat
 why  you don t mean to say—  began toby  turning pale
 mean   cried the jew  stamping furiously on the ground
 where are they  sikes and the boy  where are they  where have they been  where are they hiding  why have they not been here    the crack failed   said toby faintly
 i know it   replied the jew  tearing a newspaper from his pocket and pointing to it
 what more    they fired and hit the boy
we cut over the fields at the back  with him between us—straight as the crow flies— through hedge and ditch
they gave chase
damme  the whole country was awake  and the dogs upon us    the boy    bill had him on his back  and scudded like the wind
we stopped to take him between us  his head hung down  and he was cold
they were close upon our heels  every man for himself  and each from the gallows  we parted company  and left the youngster lying in a ditch alive or dead  that s all i know about him   the jew stopped to hear no more  but uttering a loud yell  and twining his hands in his hair  rushed from the room  and from the house
286 oliver twist in which a mysterious character appears upon the scene  and many things  inseparable from this history  are done and performed the old man had gained the street corner  before he began to recover the effect of toby crackit s intelligence
he had relaxed nothing of his unusual speed  but was still pressing onward  in the same wild and disordered manner  when the sudden dashing past of a carriage  and a boisterous cry from the foot passengers  who saw his danger  drove him back upon the pavement
avoiding  as much as was possible  all the main streets  and skulking only through the by ways and alleys  he at length emerged on snow hill
here he walked even faster than before  nor did he linger until he had again turned into a court  when  as if conscious that he was now in his proper element  he fell into his usual shuffling pace  and seemed to breathe more freely
near to the spot on which snow hill and holborn hill meet  opens  upon the right hand as you come out of the city  a narrow and dismal alley  leading to saffron hill
in its filthy shops are exposed for sale huge bunches of secondhand silk handkerchiefs  of all sizes and patterns  for here reside the traders who purchase them from pick pockets
hundreds of these handkerchiefs hang dangling from pegs outside the windows or flaunting from the door posts  and the shelves  within  are piled with them
confined as the limits of field lane are  it has its barber  its coffee shop  its beer shop  and its fried fish warehouse
it is a commercial colony of itself  the emporium of petty larceny  visited at early morning  and setting in of dusk  by silent merchants  who traffic in dark back parlours  and who go as strangely as they come
here  the clothesman  the shoe vamper  and the rag merchant  display their goods  as sign boards to the petty thief  here  stores of old iron and bones  and heaps of mildewy fragments of woollen stuff and linen  rust and rot in the grimy cellars
it was into this place that the jew turned
he was well known to the sallow denizens of the lane  for such of them as were on the look out to buy or sell  nodded  familiarly  as he passed along
he replied to their salutations in the same way  but bestowed no closer recognition until he reached 288 oliver twist the further end of the alley  when he stopped  to address a salesman of small stature  who had squeezed as much of his person into a child s chair as the chair would hold  and was smoking a pipe at his warehouse door
 why  the sight of you  mr fagin  would cure the hoptalymy   said this respectable trader  in acknowledgment of the jew s inquiry after his health
 the neighbourhood was a little too hot  lively   said fagin  elevating his eyebrows  and crossing his hands upon his shoulders
 well  i ve heerd that complaint of it  once or twice before   replied the trader   but it soon cools down again  don t you find it so   fagin nodded in the affirmative
pointing in the direction of saffron hill  he inquired whether any one was up yonder to night
 at the cripples   inquired the man
the jew nodded
 let me see   pursued the merchant  reflecting
 yes  there s some half dozen of  em gone in  that i knows
i don t think your friend s there    sikes is not  i suppose   inquired the jew  with a disappointed countenance
 non istwentus  as the lawyers say   replied the little man  shaking his head  and looking amazingly sly
 have you got anything in my line to night    nothing to night   said the jew  turning away
 are you going up to the cripples  fagin   cried the little man  calling after him
 stop  i don t mind if i have a drop there with you   but as the jew  looking back  waved his hand to intimate that he preferred being alone  and  moreover  as the little man could not very easily disengage himself from the chair  the sign of the cripples was  for a time  bereft of the advantage of mr lively s presence by the time he had got upon his legs  the jew had disappeared  so mr lively  after ineffectually standing on tiptoe  in the hope of catching sight of him  again forced himself into the little chair  and  exchanging a shake of the head with a lady in the opposite shop  in which doubt and mistrust were plainly mingled  resumed his pipe with a grave demeanour the three cripples  or rather the cripples  which was the sign by which the establishment was familiarly known to its patrons  was the public house in which mr sikes and his dog have already figured
merely making a sign to a man at the bar  fagin walked straight upstairs  and opening the door of a room  and softly insinuating himself into the chamber  looked anxiously about  shading his eyes with his hand  as if in search of some particular person the room was illuminated by two gas lights  the glare of which was prevented by the barred shutters  and closely drawn curtains of faded red  from being visible outside
the ceiling was blackened  to prevent its colour from being injured by the flaring of the lamps  and the place was so full of dense tobacco smoke  that at first it was scarcely possible to discern anything more
by degrees  however  as some of it cleared away through the open door  an assemblage of heads  as confused as the noises that greeted the 290 oliver twist ear  might be made out  and as the eye grew more accustomed to the scene  the spectator gradually became aware of the presence of a numerous company  male and female  crowded round a long table  at the upper end of which  sat a chairman with a hammer of office in his hand  while a professional gentleman with a bluish nose  and his face tied up for the benefit of a toothache  presided at a jingling piano in a remote corner
as fagin stepped softly in  the professional gentleman  running over the keys by way of prelude  occasioned a general cry of order for a song  which having subsided  a young lady proceeded to entertain the company with a ballad in four verses  between each of which the accompanyist played the melody all through  as loud as he could
when this was over  the chairman gave a sentiment  after which  the professional gentleman on the chairman s right and left volunteered a duet  and sang it  with great applause
it was curious to observe some faces which stood out prominently from among the group
there was the chairman himself  (the landlord of the house ) a coarse  rough  heavy built fellow  who  while the songs were proceeding  rolled his eyes hither and thither  and  seeming to give himself up to joviality  had an eye for everything that was done  and an ear for everything that was said—and sharp ones  too near him were the singers  receiving  with professional indifference  the compliments of the company  and applying themselves  in turn  to a dozen proffered glasses of spirits and water  tendered by their more boisterous admirers  whose countenances  expressive of almost every vice in almost every grade  irresistibly attracted the attention  by their very repulsiveness cunning  ferocity  and drunkeness in all its stages  were there  in their strongest aspect  and women  some with the last lingering tinge of their early freshness almost fading as you looked  others with every mark and stamp of their sex utterly beaten out  and presenting but one loathsome blank of profligacy and crime  some mere girls  others but young women  and none past the prime of life  formed the darkest and saddest portion of this dreary picture
fagin  troubled by no grave emotions  looked eagerly from face to face while these proceedings were in progress  but apparently without meeting that of which he was in search
succeeding  at length  in catching the eye of the man who occupied the chair  he beckoned to him slightly  and left the room  as quietly as he had entered it
 what can i do for you  mr fagin   inquired the man  as he followed him out to the landing
 won t you join us  they ll be delighted  every one of  em   the jew shook his head impatiently  and said in a whisper   is he here    no   replied the man
 and no news of barney   inquired fagin
 none   replied the landlord of the cripples  for it was he
 he won t stir till it s all safe
depend on it  they re on the scent down there  and that if he moved  he d blow upon the thing at once
he s all right enough  barney is  else i should have heard of him
i ll pound it  that barney s managing 292 oliver twist properly
let him alone for that    will he be here to night   asked the jew  laying the same emphasis on the pronoun as before
 monks  do you mean   inquired the landlord  hesitating
 hush   said the jew
 yes    certain   replied the man  drawing a gold watch from his fob   i expected him here before now
if you ll wait ten minutes  he ll be—   no  no   said the jew  hastily  as though  however desirous he might be to see the person in question  he was nevertheless relieved by his absence
 tell him i came here to see him  and that he must come to me to night
no  say tomorrow
as he is not here  to morrow will be time enough    good   said the man
 nothing more    not a word now   said the jew  descending the stairs
 i say   said the other  looking over the rails  and speaking in a hoarse whisper   what a time this would be for a sell  i ve got phil barker here  so drunk  that a boy might take him    ah  but it s not phil barker s time   said the jew  looking up
 phil has something more to do  before we can afford to part with him  so go back to the company  my dear  and tell them to lead merry lives—while they last
ha  ha  ha   the landlord reciprocated the old man s laugh  and returned to his guests
the jew was no sooner alone  than his countenance resumed its former expression of anxiety and thought
after a brief reflection  he called a hack cabriolet  and bade the man drive towards bethnal green
he dismissed him within some quarter of a mile of mr sikes s residence  and performed the short remainder of the distance  on foot
 now   muttered the jew  as he knocked at the door   if there is any deep play here  i shall have it out of you  my girl  cunning as you are   she was in her room  the woman said
fagin crept softly upstairs  and entered it without any previous ceremony
the girl was alone  lying with her head upon the table  and her hair straggling over it
 she has been drinking   thought the jew  cooly   or perhaps she is only miserable   the old man turned to close the door  as he made this reflection  the noise thus occasioned  roused the girl
she eyed his crafty face narrowly  as she inquired to his recital of toby crackit s story
when it was concluded  she sank into her former attitude  but spoke not a word
she pushed the candle impatiently away  and once or twice as she feverishly changed her position  shuffled her feet upon the ground  but this was all
during the silence  the jew looked restlessly about the room  as if to assure himself that there were no appearances of sikes having covertly returned apparently satisfied with his inspection  he coughed twice or thrice  and made as many efforts to open a conversation  but the girl heeded him no more than if he had been made of stone
at length he made another attempt  and rubbing his hands together  said  in his most concilitory tone  294 oliver twist  and where should you think bill was now  my dear   the girl moaned out some half intelligible reply  that she could not tell  and seemed  from the smothered noise that escaped her  to be crying
 and the boy  too   said the jew  straining his eyes to catch a glimpse of her face
 poor leetle child  left in a ditch  nance  only think    the child   said the girl  suddenly looking up   is better where he is  than among us  and if no harm comes to bill from it  i hope he lies dead in the ditch and that his young bones may rot there    what   cried the jew  in amazement
 ay  i do   returned the girl  meeting his gaze
 i shall be glad to have him away from my eyes  and to know that the worst is over
i can t bear to have him about me
the sight of him turns me against myself  and all of you    pooh   said the jew  scornfully
 you re drunk    am i   cried the girl bitterly
 it s no fault of yours  if i am not  you d never have me anything else  if you had your will  except now —the humour doesn t suit you  doesn t it    no   rejoined the jew  furiously
 it does not    change it  then   responded the girl  with a laugh
 change it   exclaimed the jew  exasperated beyond all bounds by his companion s unexpected obstinacy  and the vexation of the night   i will change it  listen to me  you drab
listen to me  who with six words  can strangle sikes as surely as if i had his bull s throat between my fingers now
if he comes back  and leaves the boy behind him  if he gets off free  and dead or alive  fails to restore him to me  murder him yourself if you would have him escape jack ketch and do it the moment he sets foot in this room  or mind me  it will be too late    what is all this   cried the girl involuntarily
 what is it   pursued fagin  mad with rage
 when the boy s worth hundreds of pounds to me  am i to lose what chance threw me in the way of getting safely  through the whims of a drunken gang that i could whistle away the lives of  and me bound  too  to a born devil that only wants the will  and has the power to  to—  panting for breath  the old man stammered for a word  and in that instant checked the torrent of his wrath  and changed his whole demeanour a moment before  his clenched hands had grasped the air  his eyes had dilated  and his face grown livid with passion  but now  he shrunk into a chair  and  cowering together  trembled with the apprehension of having himself disclosed some hidden villainy after a short silence  he ventured to look round at his companion
he appeared somewhat reassured  on beholding her in the same listless attitude from which he had first roused her
 nancy  dear   croaked the jew  in his usual voice
 did you mind me  dear    don t worry me now  fagin   replied the girl  raising her head languidly
 if bill has not done it this time  he will another
he has done many a good job for you  and will do many more when he can  and when he can t he won t  so no more about that    regarding this boy  my dear   said the jew  rubbing the 296 oliver twist palms of his hands nervously together  the boy must take his chance with the rest   interrupted nancy  hastily   and i say again  i hope he is dead  and out of harm s way  and out of yours —that is  if bill comes to no harm
and if toby got clear off  bill s pretty sure to be safe  for bill s worth two of toby any time    and about what i was saying  my dear   observed the jew  keeping his glistening eye steadily upon her
 your must say it all over again  if it s anything you want me to do   rejoined nancy   and if it is  you had better wait till to morrow
you put me up for a minute  but now i m stupid again   fagin put several other questions  all with the same drift of ascertaining whether the girl had profited by his unguarded hints  but  she answered them so readily  and was withal so utterly unmoved by his searching looks  that his original impression of her being more than a trifle in liquor  was confirmed
nancy  indeed  was not exempt from a failing which was very common among the jew s female pupils  and in which  in their tenderer years  they were rather encouraged than checked
her disordered appearance  and a wholesale perfume of geneva which pervaded the apartment  afforded stong confirmatory evidence of the justice of the jew s supposition  and when  after indulging in the temporary display of violence above described  she subsided  first into dullness  and afterwards into a compound of feelings  under the influence of which she shed tears one minute  and in the next gave utterance to various exclamations of  never say die   and divers calculations as to what might be the amount of the odds so long as a lady or gentleman was happy  mr fagin  who had had considerable experience of such matters in his time  saw  with great satisfaction  that she was very far gone indeed
having eased his mind by this discovery  and having accomplished his twofold object of imparting to the girl what he had  that night  heard  and of ascertaining  with his own eyes  that sikes had not returned  mr fagin again turned his face homeward  leaving his young friend asleep  with her head upon the table
it was within an hour of midnight
the weather being dark  and piercing cold  he had no great temptation to loiter
the sharp wind that scoured the streets  seemed to have cleared them of passengers  as of dust and mud  for few people were abroad  and they were to all appearance hastening fast home
it blew from the right quarter for the jew  however  and straight before it he went  trembling  and shivering  as every fresh gust drove him rudely on his way
he had reached the corner of his own street  and was already fumbling in his pocket for the door key  when a dark figure emerged from a projecting entrance which lay in deep shadow  and  crossing the road  glided up to him unperceived
 fagin   whispered a voice close to his ear
 ah   said the jew  turning quickly round   is that—   yes   interrupted the stranger
 i have been lingering here these two hours
where the devil have you been    on your business  my dear   replied the jew  glancing uneasily at his companion  and slackening his pace as he 298 oliver twist spoke
 on your business all night    oh  of course   said the stranger  with a sneer
 well  and what s come of it    nothing good   said the jew
 nothing bad  i hope   said the stranger  stopping short  and turning a startled look on his companion
the jew shook his head  and was about to reply  when the stranger  interrupting him  motioned to the house  before which they had by this time arrived  remarking  that he had better say what he had got to say  under cover  for his blood was chilled with standing about so long  and the wind blew through him
fagin looked as if he could have willingly excused himself from taking home a visitor at that unseasonable hour  and  indeed  muttered something about having no fire  but his companion repeating his request in a peremptory manner  he unlocked the door  and requested him to close it softly  while he got a light  it s as dark as the grave   said the man  groping forward a few steps
 make haste    shut the door   whispered fagin from the end of the passage
as he spoke  it closed with a loud noise
 that wasn t my doing   said the other man  feeling his way
 the wind blew it to  or it shut of its own accord  one or the other
look sharp with the light  or i shall knock my brains out against something in this confounded hole   fagin stealthily descended the kitchen stairs
after a short absence  he returned with a lighted candle  and the intelligence that toby crackit was asleep in the back room below  and that the boys were in the front one
beckoning the man to follow him  he led the way upstairs
 we can say the few words we ve got to say in here  my dear   said the jew  throwing open a door on the first floor   and as there are holes in the shutters  and we never show lights to our neighbours  we ll set the candle on the stairs
there   with those words  the jew  stooping down  placed the candle on an upper flight of stairs  exactly opposite to the room door
this done  he led the way into the apartment  which was destitute of all movables save a broken arm chair  and an old couch or sofa without covering  which stood behind the door
upon this piece of furniture  the stranger sat himself with the air of a weary man  and the jew  drawing up the arm chair opposite  they sat face to face it was not quite dark  the door was partially open  and the candle outside  threw a feeble reflection on the opposite wall
they conversed for some time in whispers
though nothing of the conversation was distinguishable beyond a few disjointed words here and there  a listener might easily have perceived that fagin appeared to be defending himself against some remarks of the stranger  and that the latter was in a state of considerable irritation they might have been talking  thus  for a quarter of an hour or more  when monks—by which name the jew had designated the strange man several times in the course of their colloquy—said  raising his voice a little   i tell you again  it was badly planned
why not have kept him here among the rest  and made a sneaking  snivelling 300 oliver twist pickpocket of him at once    only hear him   exclaimed the jew  shrugging his shoulders
 why  do you mean to say you couldn t have done it  if you had chosen   demanded monks  sternly
 haven t you done it  with other boys  scores of times  if you had had patience for a twelvemonth  at most  couldn t you have got him convicted  and sent safely out of the kingdom  perhaps for life    whose turn would that have served  my dear   inquired the jew humbly
 mine   replied monks
 but not mine   said the jew  submissively
 he might have become of use to me
when there are two parties to a bargain  it is only reasonable that the interests of both should be consulted  is it  my good friend    what then   demanded monks
 i saw it was not easy to train him to the business   replied the jew   he was not like other boys in the same circumstances    curse him  no   muttered the man   or he would have been a thief  long ago    i had no hold upon him to make him worse   pursued the jew  anxiously watching the countenance of his companion  his hand was not in
i had nothing to frighten him with  which we always must have in the beginning  or we labour in vain
what could i do  send him out with the dodger and charley  we had enough of that  at first  my dear  i trembled for us all    that was not my doing   observed monks
 no  no  my dear   renewed the jew
 and i don t quarrel with it now  because  if it had never happened  you might never have clapped eyes on the boy to notice him  and so led to the discovery that it was him you were looking for
well  i got him back for you by means of the girl  and then she begins to favour him    throttle the girl   said monks  impatiently
 why  we can t afford to do that just now  my dear   replied the jew  smiling   and  besides  that sort of thing is not in our way  or  one of these days  i might be glad to have it done
i know what these girls are  monks  well
as soon as the boy begins to harden  she ll care no more for him  than for a block of wood
you want him made a thief
if he is alive  i can make him one from this time  and  if—if—  said the jew  drawing nearer to the other — it s not likely  mind — but if the worst comes to the worst  and he is dead—   it s no fault of mine if he is   interposed the other man  with a look of terror  and clasping the jew s arm with trembling hands
 mind that
fagin  i had no hand in it
anything but his death  i told you from the first
i won t shed blood  it s always found out  and haunts a man besides
if they shot him dead  i was not the cause  do you hear me  fire this infernal den  what s that    what   cried the jew  grasping the coward round the body  with both arms  as he sprung to his feet  where    yonder  replied the man  glaring at the opposite wall
 the shadow  i saw the shadow of a woman  in a cloak and bonnet  pass along the wainscot like a breath   302 oliver twist the jew released his hold  and they rushed tumultuously from the room
the candle  wasted by the draught  was standing where it had been placed
it showed them only the empty staircase  and their own white faces
they listened intently  a profound silence reigned throughout the house
 it s your fancy   said the jew  taking up the light and turning to his companion
 i ll swear i saw it   replied monks  trembling
 it was bending forward when i saw it first  and when i spoke  it darted away   the jew glanced contemptuously at the pale face of his associate  and  telling him he could follow  if he pleased  ascended the stairs
they looked into all the rooms  they were cold  bare  and empty they descended into the passage  and thence into the cellars below
the green damp hung upon the low walls  the tracks of the snail and slug glistened in the light of the candle  but all was still as death
 what do you think now   said the jew  when they had regained the passage
 besides ourselves  there s not a creature in the house except toby and the boys  and they re safe enough
see here   as a proof of the fact  the jew drew forth two keys from his pocket  and explained  that when he first went downstairs  he had locked them in  to prevent any intrusion on the conference
this accumulated testimony effectually staggered mr monks
his protestations had gradually become less and less vehement as they proceeded in their search without making any discovery  and  now  he gave vent to several very grim laughs  and confessed it could only have been his excited imagination
he declined any renewal of the conversation  however  for that night  suddenly remembering that it was past one o clock
and so the amiable couple parted
304 oliver twist atones for the unpoliteness of a deserted a lady  most unceremoniously as it would be  by no means  seemly in a humble author to keep so mighty a personage as a beadle waiting  with his back to the fire  and the skirts of his coat gathered up under his arms  until such time as it might suit his pleasure to relieve him  and as it would still less become his station  or his gallentry to involve in the same neglect a lady on whom that beadle had looked with an eye of tenderness and affection  and in whose ear he had whispered sweet words  which  coming from such a quarter  might well thrill the bosom of maid or matron of whatsoever degree  the historian whose pen traces these words—trusting that he knows his place  and that he entertains a becoming reverence for those upon earth to whom high and important authority is delegated—hastens to pay them that respect which their position demands  and to treat them with all that duteous ceremony which their exalted rank  and (by consequence) great virtues  imperatively claim at his hands towards this end  indeed  he had purposed to introduce  in this place  a dissertation touching the divine right of beadles  and elucidative of the position  that a beadle can do no wrong  which could not fail to have been both pleasurable and profitable to the right minded reader but which he is unfortunately compelled  by want of time and space  to postpone to some more convenient and fitting opportunity  on the arrival of which  he will be prepared to show  that a beadle properly constituted  that is to say  a parochial beadle  attached to a parochail workhouse  and attending in his official capacity the parochial church  is  in right and virtue of his office  possessed of all the excellences and best qualities of humanity  and that to none of those excellences  can mere companies  beadles  or court of law beadles  or even chapelof ease beadles (save the last  and they in a very lowly and inferior degree)  lay the remotest sustainable claim
mr bumble had re counted the teaspoons  re weighed the sugar tongs  made a closer inspection of the milk pot  and ascertained to a nicety the exact condition of the furniture  down to the very horse hair seats of the chairs  and had repeated each process full half a dozen times  before he began to think that it was time for mrs corney to return thinking begets thinking  as there were no sounds of mrs corney s approach  it occured to mr bumble that it would 306 oliver twist be an innocent and virtuous way of spending the time  if he were further to allay his curiousity by a cursory glance at the interior of mrs corney s chest of drawers having listened at the keyhole  to assure himself that nobody was approaching the chamber  mr bumble  beginning at the bottom  proceeded to make himself acquainted with the contents of the three long drawers  which  being filled with various garments of good fashion and texture  carefully preserved between two layers of old newspapers  speckled with dried lavender  seemed to yield him exceeding satisfaction arriving  in course of time  at the right hand corner drawer (in which was the key)  and beholding therein a small padlocked box  which  being shaken  gave forth a pleasant sound  as of the chinking of coin  mr bumble returned with a stately walk to the fireplace  and  resuming his old attitude  said  with a grave and determined air   i ll do it   he followed up this remarkable declaration  by shaking his head in a waggish manner for ten minutes  as though he were remonstrating with himself for being such a pleasant dog  and then  he took a view of his legs in profile  with much seeming pleasure and interest he was still placidly engaged in this latter survey  when mrs corney  hurrying into the room  threw herself  in a breathless state  on a chair by the fireside  and covering her eyes with one hand  placed the other over her heart  and gasped for breath  mrs corney   said mr bumble  stooping over the matron   what is this  ma am  has anything happened  ma am  pray answer me  i m on—on—  mr bumble  in his alarm  could not immediately think of the word  tenterhooks   so he said  broken bottles    oh  mr bumble   cried the lady   i have been so dreadfully put out    put out  ma am   exclaimed mr bumble   who has dared to—  i know   said mr bumble  checking himself  with native majesty   this is them wicious paupers    it s dreadful to think of   said the lady  shuddering  then don t think of it  ma am   rejoined mr bumble  i can t help it   whimpered the lady  then take something  ma am   said mr bumble soothingly  a little of the wine    not for the world   replied mrs corney  i couldn t —oh  the top shelf in the right hand corner—oh   uttering these words  the good lady pointed  distractedly  to the cupboard  and underwent a convulsion from internal spasms mr bumble rushed to the closet  and  snatching a pint greenglass bottle from the shelf thus incoherently indicated  filled a tea cup with its contents  and held it to the lady s lips
 i m better now   said mrs corney  falling back  after drinking half of it mr bumble raised his eyes piously to the ceiling in thankfulness  and  bringing them down again to the brim of the cup  lifted it to his nose
 peppermint   exclaimed mrs corney  in a faint voice  smiling gently on the beadle as she spoke  try it  there s a little—a little something else in it   mr bumble tasted the medicine with a doubtful look  smacked his lips  took another taste  and put the cup down 308 oliver twist empty
 it s very comforting   said mrs corney  very much so indeed  ma am   said the beadle
as he spoke  he drew a chair beside the matron  and tenderly inquired what had happened to distress her
 nothing   replied mrs corney  i am a foolish  excitable  weak creetur    not weak  ma am   retorted mr bumble  drawing his chair a little closer
 are you a weak creetur  mrs corney    we are all weak creeturs   said mrs corney  laying down a general principle  so we are   said the beadle nothing was said on either side  for a minute or two afterwards
by the expiration of that time  mr bumble had illustrated the position by removing his left arm from the back of mrs corney s chair  where it had previously rested  to mrs corney s aprong string  round which is gradually became entwined  we are all weak creeturs   said mr bumble mrs corney sighed  don t sigh  mrs corney   said mr bumble  i can t help it   said mrs corney and she sighed again
 this is a very comfortable room  ma am   said mr bumble looking round
 another room  and this  ma am  would be a complete thing    it would be too much for one   murmured the lady
 but not for two  ma am   rejoined mr bumble  in soft accents
 eh  mrs corney   mrs corney drooped her head  when the beadle said this  the beadle drooped his  to get a view of mrs corney s face mrs corney  with great propriety  turned her head away  and released her hand to get at her pocket handkerchief  but insensibly replaced it in that of mr bumble  the board allows you coals  don t they  mrs corney   inquired the beadle  affectionately pressing her hand  and candles   replied mrs corney  slightly returning the pressure  coals  candles  and house rent free   said mr bumble  oh  mrs corney  what an angel you are   the lady was not proof against this burst of feeling she sank into mr bumble s arms  and that gentleman in his agitation  imprinted a passionate kiss upon her chaste nose  such porochial perfection   exclaimed mr bumble  rapturously  you know that mr slout is worse to night  my fascinator    yes   replied mrs corney  bashfully  he can t live a week  the doctor says   pursued mr bumble
 he is the master of this establishment  his death will cause a wacancy  that wacancy must be filled up
oh  mrs corney  what a prospect this opens  what a opportunity for a jining of hearts and housekeepings   mrs corney sobbed  the little word   said mr bumble  bending over the bashful beauty  the one little  little  little word  my blessed corney    ye—ye—yes   sighed out the matron
 one more   pursued the beadle   compose your darling feelings for only one more
when is it to come off   310 oliver twist mrs corney twice essayed to speak  and twice failed at length summoning up courage  she threw her arms around mr bumble s neck  and said  it might be as soon as ever he pleased  and that he was  a irresistible duck   matters being thus amicably and satisfactorily arranged  the contract was solemnly ratified in another teacupful of the peppermint mixture  which was rendered the more necessary  by the flutter and agitation of the lady s spirits while it was being disposed of  she acquainted mr bumble with the old woman s decease
 very good   said that gentleman  sipping his peppermint   i ll call at sowerberry s as i go home  and tell him to send tomorrow morning
was it that as frightened you  love    it wasn t anything particular  dear   said the lady evasively
 it must have been something  love   urged mr bumble
 won t you tell your own b     not now   rejoined the lady   one of these days
after we re married  dear    after we re married   exclaimed mr bumble
 it wasn t any impudence from any of them male paupers as—   no  no  love   interposed the lady  hastily
 if i thought it was   continued mr bumble   if i thought as any one of  em had dared to lift his wulgar eyes to that lovely countenance—   they wouldn t have dared to do it  love   responded the lady
 they had better not   said mr bumble  clenching his fist
 let me see any man  porochial or extra porochial  as would presume to do it  and i can tell him that he wouldn t do it a second time   unembellished by any violence of gesticulation  this might have seemed no very high compliment to the lady s charms  but  as mr bumble accompanied the threat with many warlike gestures  she was much touched with this proof of his devotion  and protested  with great admiration  that he was indeed a dove the dove then turned up his coat collar  and put on his cocked hat  and  having exchanged a long and affectionate embrace with his future partner  once again braved the cold wind of the night  merely pausing  for a few minutes  in the male paupers  ward  to abuse them a little  with the view of satisfying himself that he could fill the office of workhousemaster with needful acerbity assured of his qualifications  mr bumble left the building with a light heart  and bright visions of his future promotion  which served to occupy his mind until he reached the shop of the undertaker
now  mr and mrs sowerberry having gone out to tea and supper  and noah claypole not being at any time disposed to take upon himself a greater amount of physical exertion than is necessary to a convenient performance of the two functions of eating and drinking  the shop was not closed  although it was past the usual hour of shutting up mr bumble tapped with his cane on the counter several times  but  attracting no attention  and beholding a light shining through the glass window of the little parlour at the back of the shop  he made bold to peep in and see what was going forward  and when he saw what was going for  312 oliver twist ward  he was not a little surprised the cloth was laid for supper  the table was covered with bread and butter  plates and glasses  a porter pot and a winebottle
at the upper end of the table  mr noah claypole lolled negligently in an easy chair  with his legs thrown over one of the arms  an open clasp knife in one hand  and a mass of buttered bread in the other close beside him stood charlotte  opening oysters from a barrel  which mr claypole condescended to swallow  with remarkable avidity
a more than ordinary redness in the region of the young gentleman s nose  and a kind of fixed wink in his right eye  denoted that he was in a slight degree intoxicated  these symptoms were confirmed by the intense relish with which he took his oysters  for which nothing but a strong appreciation of their cooling properties  in cases of internal fever  could have sufficiently accounted  here s a delicious fat one  noah  dear   said charlotte   try him  do  only this one    what a delicious thing is a oyster   remarked mr claypole  after he had swallowed it
 what a pity it is  a number of  em should ever make you feel uncomfortable  isn t it  charlotte    it s quite a cruelty   said charlotte
 so it is   acquiesced mr claypole
 an t yer fond of oysters    not overmuch   replied charlotte
 i like to see you eat  em  noah dear  better than eating  em myself    lor   said noah  reflectively   how queer    have another   said charlotte
 here s one with such a beautiful  delicate beard    i can t manage any more   said noah
 i m very sorry
come here  charlotte  and i ll kiss yer    what   said mr bumble  bursting into the room
 say that again  sir   charlotte uttered a scream  and hid her face in her apron
mr claypole  without making any further change in his position than suffering his legs to reach the ground  gazed at the beadle in drunken terror
 say it again  you wile  owdacious fellow   said mr bumble
 how dare you mention such a thing  sir  and how dare you encourage him  you insolent minx  kiss her   exclaimed mr bumble  in strong indignation
 faugh    i didn t mean to do it   said noah  blubbering
 she s always a kissing of me  whether i like it  or not    oh  noah   cried charlotte  reproachfully
 yer are  yer know yer are   retorted noah
 she s always a doin  of it  mr bumble  sir  she chucks me under the chin  please  sir  and makes all manner of love    silence   cried mr bumble  sternly
 take yourself downstairs  ma am
noah  you shut up the shop  say another word till your master comes home  at your peril  and  when he does come home  tell him that mr bumble said he was to send a old woman s shell after breakfast to morrow morning
do you hear sir  kissing   cried mr bumble  holding up his hands
 the sin and wickedness of the lower orders in this porochial district is frightful  if parliament don t take their abominable courses under consideration  this country s ruined  and the character of the peasantry gone for 314 oliver twist ever   with these words  the beadle strode  with a lofty and gloomy air  from the undertaker s premises
and now that we have accompanied him so far on his road home  and have made all necessary preparations for the old woman s funeral  let us set on foot a few inquires after young oliver twist  and ascertain whether he be still lying in the ditch where toby crackit left him
looks after oliver  and proceeds with his adventures  wolves tear your throats   muttered sikes  grinding his teeth
 i wish i was among some of you  you d howl the hoarser for it   as sikes growled forth this imprecation  with the most desperate ferocity that his desperate nature was capable of  he rested the body of the wounded boy across his bended knee  and turned his head  for an instant  to look back at his pursuers
there was little to be made out  in the mist and darkness  but the loud shouting of men vibrated through the air  and the barking of the neighbouring dogs  roused by the sound of the alarm bell  resounded in every direction
 stop  you white livered hound   cried the robber  shouting after toby crackit  who  making the best use of his long legs  was already ahead
 stop   the repetition of the word  brought toby to a dead stand  316 oliver twist still
for he was not quite satisfied that he was beyond the range of pistol shot  and sikes was in no mood to be played with
 bear a hand with the boy   cried sikes  beckoning furiously to his confederate
 come back   toby made a show of returning  but ventured  in a low voice  broken for want of breath  to intimate considerable reluctance as he came slowly along
 quicker   cried sikes  laying the boy in a dry ditch at his feet  and drawing a pistol from his pocket
 don t play booty with me   at this moment the noise grew louder
sikes  again looking round  could discern that the men who had given chase were already climbing the gate of the field in which he stood  and that a couple of dogs were some paces in advance of them
 it s all up  bill   cried toby   drop the kid  and show  em your heels   with this parting advice  mr crackit  preferring the chance of being shot by his friend  to the certainty of being taken by his enemies  fairly turned tail  and darted off at full speed
sikes clenched his teeth  took one look around  threw over the prostrate form of oliver  the cape in which he had been hurriedly muffled  ran along the front of the hedge  as if to distract the attention of those behind  from the spot where the boy lay  paused  for a second  before another hedge which met it at right angles  and whirling his pistol high into the air  cleared it at a bound  and was gone
 ho  ho  there   cried a tremulous voice in the rear
 pincher  neptune  come here  come here   the dogs  who  in common with their masters  seemed to have no particular relish for the sport in which they were engaged  readily answered to the command
three men  who had by this time advanced some distance into the field  stopped to take counsel together
 my advice  or  leastways  i should say  my orders  is   said the fattest man of the party   that we  mediately go home again    i am agreeable to anything which is agreeable to mr giles   said a shorter man  who was by no means of a slim figure  and who was very pale in the face  and very polite  as frightened men frequently are
 i shouldn t wish to appear ill mannered  gentlemen   said the third  who had called the dogs back   mr giles ought to know    certainly   replied the shorter man   and whatever mr giles says  it isn t our place to contradict him
no  no  i know my sitiwation  thank my stars  i know my sitiwation   to tell the truth  the little man did seem to know his situation  and to know perfectly well that it was by no means a desirable one  for his teeth chattered in his head as he spoke
 you are afraid  brittles   said mr giles
 i an t   said brittles
 you are   said giles
 you re a falsehood  mr giles   said brittles
 you re a lie  brittles   said mr giles
now  these four retorts arose from mr giles s taunt  and mr giles s taunt had arisen from his indignation at having 318 oliver twist the responsibility of going home again  imposed upon himself under cover of a compliment the third man brought the dispute to a close  most philosophically
 i ll tell you what it is  gentlemen   said he   we re all afraid    speak for yourself  sir   said mr giles  who was the palest of the party
 so i do   replied the man
 it s natural and proper to be afraid  under such circumstances i am    so am i   said brittles   only there s no call to tell a man he is  so bounceably   these frank admissions softened mr giles  who at once owned that he was afraid  upon which  they all three faced about  and ran back again with the completest unanimity  until mr giles (who had the shortest wind of the party  as was encumbered with a pitchfork) most handsomely insisted on stopping  to make an apology for his hastiness of speech
 but it s wonderful   said mr giles  when he had explained   what a man will do  when his blood is up
i should have committed murder—i know i should—if we d caught one of them rascals   as the other two were impressed with a similar presentiment  and as their blood  like his  had all gone down again  some speculation ensued upon the cause of this sudden change in their temperament
 i know what it was   said mr giles   it was the gate    i shouldn t wonder if it was   exclaimed brittles  catching at the idea
 you may depend upon it   said giles   that that gate stopped the flow of the excitement
i felt all mine suddenly going away  as i was climbing over it   by a remarkable coincidence  the other two had been visited with the same unpleasant sensation at that precise moment
it was quite obvious  therefore  that it was the gate  especially as there was no doubt regarding the time at which the change had taken place  because all three remembered that they had come in sight of the robbers at the instant of its occurance
this dialogue was held between the two men who had surprised the burglars  and a travelling tinker who had been sleeping in an outhouse  and who had been roused  together with his two mongrel curs  to join in the pursuit
mr giles acted in the double capacity of butler and steward to the old lady of the mansion  brittles was a lad of all work  who  having entered her service a mere child  was treated as a promising young boy still  though he was something past thirty
encouraging each other with such converse as this  but  keeping very close together  notwithstanding  and looking apprehensively round  whenever a fresh gust rattled through the boughs  the three men hurried back to a tree  behind which they had left their lantern  lest its light should inform the thieves in what direction to fire
catching up the light  they made the best of their way home  at a good round trot  and long after their dusky forms had ceased to be discernible  the light might have been seen twinkling and dancing in the distance  like some exhalation of the 320 oliver twist damp and gloomy atmosphere through which it was swiftly borne the air grew colder  as day came slowly on  and the mist rolled along the ground like a dense cloud of smoke
the grass was wet  the pathways  and low places  were all mire and water  the damp breath of an unwholesome wind went languidly by  with a hollow moaning
still  oliver lay motionless and insensible on the spot where sikes had left him
morning drew on apace
the air become more sharp and piercing  as its first dull hue—the death of night  rather than the birth of day—glimmered faintly in the sky
the objects which had looked dim and terrible in the darkness  grew more and more defined  and gradually resolved into their familiar shapes
the rain came down  thick and fast  and pattered noisily among the leafless bushes
but  oliver felt it not  as it beat against him  for he still lay stretched  helpless and unconscious  on his bed of clay at length  a low cry of pain broke the stillness that prevailed  and uttering it  the boy awoke
his left arm  rudely bandaged in a shawl  hung heavy and useless at his side  the bandage was saturated with blood
he was so weak  that he could scarcely raise himself into a sitting posture  when he had done so  he looked feebly round for help  and groaned with pain trembling in every joint  from cold and exhaustion  he made an effort to stand upright  but  shuddering from head to foot  fell prostrate on the ground
after a short return of the stupor in which he had been so long plunged  oliver  urged by a creeping sickness at his heart  which seemed to warn him that if he lay there  he must surely die  got upon his feet  and essayed to walk
his head was dizzy  and he staggered to and from like a drunken man
but he kept up  nevertheless  and  with his head drooping languidly on his breast  went stumbling onward  he knew not whither
and now  hosts of bewildering and confused ideas came crowding on his mind
he seemed to be still walking between sikes and crackit  who were angrily disputing—for the very words they said  sounded in his ears  and when he caught his own attention  as it were  by making some violent effort to save himself from falling  he found that he was talking to them then  he was alone with sikes  plodding on as on the previous day  and as shadowy people passed them  he felt the robber s grasp upon his wrist
suddenly  he started back at the report of firearms  there rose into the air  loud cries and shouts  lights gleamed before his eyes  all was noise and tumult  as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away through all these rapid visions  there ran an undefined  uneasy conscious of pain  which wearied and tormented him incessantly
thus he staggered on  creeping  almost mechanically  between the bars of gates  or through hedge gaps as they came in his way  until he reached a road
here the rain began to fall so heavily  that it roused him
he looked about  and saw that at no great distance there was a house  which perhaps he could reach
pitying his condition  they might have compassion on him  and if they did not  it would be better  he thought  to die near human be  322 oliver twist ings  than in the lonely open fields
he summoned up all his strength for one last trial  and bent his faltering steps towards it
as he drew nearer to this house  a feeling come over him that he had seen it before
he remembered nothing of its details  but the shape and aspect of the building seemed familiar to him
that garden wall  on the grass inside  he had fallen on his knees last night  and prayed the two men s mercy
it was the very house they had attempted to rob
oliver felt such fear come over him when he recognised the place  that  for the instant  he forgot the agony of his wound  and thought only of flight
flight  he could scarcely stand  and if he were in full possession of all the best powers of his slight and youthful frame  whither could he fly  he pushed against the garden gate  it was unlocked  and swung open on its hinges
he tottered across the lawn  climbed the steps  knocked faintly at the door  and  his whole strength failing him  sunk down against one of the pillars of the little portico
it happened that about this time  mr giles  brittles  and the tinker  were recruiting themselves  after the fatigues and terrors of the night  with tea and sundries  in the kitchen not that it was mr giles s habit to admit to too great familiarity the humbler servants  towards whom it was rather his wont to deport himself with a lofty affability  which  while it gratified  could not fail to remind them of his superior position in society but  death  fires  and burglary  make all men equals  so mr giles sat with his legs stretched out before the kitchen fender  leaning his left arm on the table  while  with his right  he illustrated a circumstantial and minute account of the robbery  to which his bearers (but especially the cook and housemaid  who were of the party) listened with breathless interest  it was about half past tow   said mr giles   or i wouldn t swear that it mightn t have been a little nearer three  when i woke up  and  turning round in my bed  as it might be so  (here mr giles turned round in his chair  and pulled the corner of the table cloth over him to imitate bed clothes ) i fancied i heerd a noise   at this point of the narrative the cook turned pale  and asked the housemaid to shut the door  who asked brittles  who asked the tinker  who pretended not to hear  —heerd a noise   continued mr giles
 i says  at first   this is illusion   and was composing myself off to sleep  when i heerd the noise again  distinct    what sort of a noise   asked the cook
 a kind of a busting noise   replied mr giles  looking round him
 more like the noise of powdering a iron bar on a nutmeggrater   suggested brittles
 it was  when you heerd it  sir   rejoined mr giles   but  at this time  it had a busting sound
i turned down the clothes   continued giles  rolling back the table cloth   sat up in bed  and listened   the cook and housemaid simultaneously ejaculated  lor   and drew their chairs closer together
 i heerd it now  quite apparent   resumed mr giles
324 oliver twist   somebody   i says   is forcing of a door  or window  what s to be done  i ll call up that poor lad  brittles  and save him from being murdered in his bed  or his throat   i says   may be cut from his right ear to his left  without his ever knowing it   here  all eyes were turned upon brittles  who fixed his upon the speaker  and stared at him  with his mouth wide open  and his face expressive of the most unmitigated horror
 i tossed off the clothes   said giles  throwing away the table cloth  and looking very hard at the cook and housemaid   got softly out of bed  drew on a pair of—   ladies present  mr giles   murmured the tinker
 —of shoes  sir   said giles  turning upon him  and laying great emphasis on the word   seized the loaded pistol that always goes upstairs with the plate basket  and walked on tiptoes to his room
 brittles   i says  when i had woke him   don t be frightened    so you did   observed brittles  in a low voice
  we re dead men  i think  brittles   i says   continued giles    but don t be frightened    was he frightened   asked the cook
 not a bit of it   replied mr giles
 he was as firm—ah  pretty near as firm as i was    i should have died at once  i m sure  if it had been me   observed the housemaid
 you re a woman   retorted brittles  plucking up a little
 brittles is right   said mr giles  nodding his head  approvingly   from a woman  nothing else was to be expected
we  being men  took a dark lantern that was standing on brittle s hob  and groped our way downstairs in the pitch dark —as it might be so   mr giles had risen from his seat  and taken two steps with his eyes shut  to accompany his description with appropriate action  when he started violently  in common with the rest of the company  and hurried back to his chair
the cook and housemaid screamed
 it was a knock   said mr giles  assuming perfect serenity
 open the door  somebody   nobody moved
 it seems a strange sort of a thing  a knock coming at such a time in the morning   said mr giles  surveying the pale faces which surrounded him  and looking very blank himself   but the door must be opened do you hear  somebody   mr giles  as he spoke  looked at brittles  but that young man  being naturally modest  probably considered himself nobody  and so held that the inquiry could not have any application to him  at all events  he tendered no reply mr giles directed an appealing glance at the tinker  but he had suddenly fallen asleep the women were out of the question
 if brittles would rather open the door  in the presence of witnesses   said mr giles  after a short silence   i am ready to make one    so am i   said the tinker  waking up  as suddenly as he had fallen asleep
brittles capitualated on these terms  and the party being 326 oliver twist somewhat re assured by the discovery (made on throwing open the shutters) that it was now broad day  took their way upstairs  with the dogs in front the two women  who were afraid to stay below  brought up the rear
by the advice of mr giles  they all talked very loud  to warn any evil disposed person outside  that they were strong in numbers  and by a master stoke of policy  originating in the brain of the same ingenious gentleman  the dogs  tails were well pinched  in the hall  to make them bark savagely
these precautions having been taken  mr giles held on fast by the tinker s arm (to prevent his running away  as he pleasantly said)  and gave the word of command to open the door
brittles obeyed  the group  peeping timourously over each other s shoulders  beheld no more formidable object than poor little oliver twist  speechless and exhausted  who raised his heavy eyes  and mutely solicited their compassion
 a boy   exclaimed mr giles  valiantly  pushing the tinker into the background
 what s the matter with the— eh —why—brittles—look here—don t you know   brittles  who had got behind the door to open it  no sooner saw oliver  than he uttered a loud cry
mr giles  seizing the boy by one leg and one arm (fortunately not the broken limb) lugged him straight into the hall  and deposited him at full length on the floor thereof
 here he is   bawled giles  calling in a state of great excitement  up the staircase   here s one of the thieves  ma am  here s a thief  miss  wounded  miss  i shot him  miss  and brittles held the light    —in a lantern  miss   cried brittles  applying one hand to the side of his mouth  so that his voice might travel the better
the two women servants ran upstairs to carry the intelligence that mr giles had captured a robber  and the tinker busied himself in endeavouring to restore oliver  lest he should die before he could be hanged in the midst of all this noise and commotion  there was heard a sweet female voice  which quelled it in an instant
 giles   whispered the voice from the stair head
 i m here  miss   replied mr giles
 don t be frightened  miss  i ain t much injured
he didn t make a very desperate resistance  miss  i was soon too many for him    hush   replied the young lady   you frighten my aunt as much as the thieves did
is the poor creature much hurt    wounded desperate  miss   replied giles  with indescribable complacency
 he looks as if he was a going  miss   bawled brittles  in the same manner as before
 wouldn t you like to come and look at him  miss  in case he should    hush  pray  there s a good man   rejoined the lady
 wait quietly only one instant  while i speak to aunt   with a footstep as soft and gentle as the voice  the speaker tripped away
she soon returned  with the direction that the wounded person was to be carried  carefully  upstairs to mr giles s room  and that brittles was to saddle the pony and betake himself instantly to chertsey  from which place  he was to despatch  with all speed  a constable and doctor  but won t you take one look at him  first  miss   asked 328 oliver twist mr giles  with as much pride as if oliver were some bird of rare plumage  that he had skilfully brought down
 not one little peep  miss    not now  for the world   replied the young lady
 poor fellow  oh  treat him kindly  giles for my sake   the old servant looked up at the speaker  as she turned away  with a glance as proud and admiring as if she had been his own child
then  bending over oliver  he helped to carry him upstairs  with the care and solicitude of a woman
has an introductory account of the inmates of the house  to which oliver resorted i n a handsome room  though its furniture had rather the air of old fashioned comfort  than of modern elegance  there sat two ladies at a well spread breakfast table
mr giles  dressed with scrupulous care in a full suit of black  was in attendance upon them
he had taken his station some half way between the side board and the breakfasttable  and  with his body drawn up to its full height  his head thrown back  and inclined the merest trifle on one side  his left leg advanced  and his right hand thrust into his waist coat  while his left hung down by his side  grasping a waiter  looked like one who laboured under a very agreeable sense of his own merits and importance
330 oliver twist of the two ladies  one was well advanced in years  but the high backed oaken chair in which she sat  was not more upright than she
dressed with the utmost nicety and precision  in a quaint mixture of by gone costume  with some slight concessions to the prevailing taste  which rather served to point the old style pleasantly than to impair its effect  she sat  in a stately manner  with her hands folded on the table before her
her eyes (and age had dimmed but little of their brightness) were attentively upon her young companion
the younger lady was in the lovely bloom and springtime of womanhood  at that age  when  if ever angels be for god s good purposes enthroned in mortal forms  they may be  without impiety  supposed to abide in such as hers she was not past seventeen
cast in so slight and exquisite a mould  so mild and gentle  so pure and beautiful  that earth seemed not her element  nor its rough creatures her fit companions
the very intelligence that shone in her deep blue eye  and was stamped upon her noble head  seemed scarcely of her age  or of the world  and yet the changing expression of sweetness and good humour  the thousand lights that played about the face  and left no shadow there  above all  the smile  the cheerful  happy smile  were made for home  and fireside peace and happiness
she was busily engaged in the little offices of the table
chancing to raise her eyes as the elder lady was regarding her  she playfully put back her hair  which was simply braided on her forehead  and threw into her beaming look  such an expression of affection and artless loveliness  that blessed spirits might have smiled to look upon her
 and brittles has been gone upwards of an hour  has he   asked the old lady  after a pause
 an hour and twelve minutes  ma am   replied mr giles  referring to a silver watch  which he drew forth by a black ribbon
 he is always slow   remarked the old lady
 brittles always was a slow boy  ma am   replied the attendant
and seeing  by the bye  that brittles had been a slow boy for upwards of thirty years  there appeared no great probability of his ever being a fast one
 he gets worse instead of better  i think   said the elder lady
 it is very inexcusable in him if he stops to play with any other boys   said the young lady  smiling
mr giles was apparently considering the propriety of indulging in a respectful smile himself  when a gig drove up to the garden gate  out of which there jumped a fat gentleman  who ran straight up to the door  and who  getting quickly into the house by some mysterious process  burst into the room  and nearly overturned mr giles and the breakfast table together  i never heard of such a thing   exclaimed the fat gentleman
 my dear mrs maylie—bless my soul—in the silence of the night  too—i never heard of such a thing   with these expressions of condolence  the fat gentleman shook hands with both ladies  and drawing up a chair  inquired how they found themselves  you ought to be dead  positively dead with the fright   332 oliver twist said the fat gentleman  why didn t you send  bless me  my man should have come in a minute  and so would i  and my assistant would have been delighted  or anybody  i m sure  under such circumstances dear  dear  so unexpected  in the silence of the night  too   the doctor seemed expecially troubled by the fact of the robbery having been unexpected  and attempted in the night time  as if it were the established custom of gentlemen in the housebreaking way to transact business at noon  and to make an appointment  by post  a day or two previous
 and you  miss rose   said the doctor  turning to the young lady   i—   oh  very much so  indeed   said rose  interrupting him   but there is a poor creature upstairs  whom aunt wishes you to see    ah  to be sure   replied the doctor   so there is
that was your handiwork  giles  i understand   mr giles  who had been feverishly putting the tea cups to rights  blushed very red  and said that he had had that honour
 honour  eh   said the doctor   well  i don t know  perhaps it s as honourable to hit a thief in a back kitchen  as to hit your man at twelve paces
fancy that he fired in the air  and you ve fought a duel  giles   mr giles  who thought this light treatment of the matter an unjust attempt at diminishing his glory  answered respectfully  that it was not for the like of him to judge about that  but he rather thought it was no joke to the opposite party
 gad  that s true   said the doctor
 where is he  show me the way
i ll look in again  as i come down  mrs maylie that s the little window that he got in at  eh  well  i couldn t have believed it   talking all the way  he followed mr giles upstairs  and while he is going upstairs  the reader may be informed  that mr losberne  a surgeon in the neighbourhood  known through a circuit of ten miles round as  the doctor   had grown fat  more from good humour than from good living  and was as kind and hearty  and withal as eccentric an old bachelor  as will be found in five times that space  by any explorer alive
the doctor was absent  much longer than either he or the ladies had anticipated
a large flat box was fetched out of the gig  and a bedroom bell was rung very often  and the servants ran up and down stairs perpetually  from which tokens it was justly concluded that something important was going on above at length he returned  and in reply to an anxious inquiry after his patient  looked very mysterious  and closed the door  carefully
 this is a very extraordinary thing  mrs maylie   said the doctor  standing with his back to the door  as if to keep it shut  he is not in danger  i hope   said the old lady
 why  that would not be an extraordinary thing  under the circumstances   replied the doctor   though i don t think he is have you seen the thief    no   rejoined the old lady
334 oliver twist  nor heard anything about him    no    i beg your pardon  ma am  interposed mr giles   but i was going to tell you about him when doctor losberne came in   the fact was  that mr giles had not  at first  been able to bring his mind to the avowal  that he had only shot a boy
such commendations had been bestowed upon his bravery  that he could not  for the life of him  help postponing the explanation for a few delicious minutes  during which he had flourished  in the very zenith of a brief reputation for undaunted courage
 rose wished to see the man   said mrs maylie   but i wouldn t hear of it    humph   rejoined the doctor  there is nothing very alarming in his appearance
have you any objection to see him in my presence    if it be necessary   replied the old lady   certainly not    then i think it is necessary   said the doctor   at all events  i am quite sure that you would deeply regret not having done so  if you postponed it
he is perfectly quiet and comfortable now
allow me—miss rose  will you permit me  not the slightest fear  i pledge you my honour   relates what oliver s new visitors thought of him with many loquacious assurances that they would be agreeably surprised in the aspect of the criminal  the doctor drew the young lady s arm through one of him  and offering his disengaged hand to mrs maylie  led them  with much ceremony and stateliness  upstairs  now   said the doctor  in a whisper  as he softly turned the handle of a bedroom door   let us hear what you think of him
he has not been shaved very recently  but he don t look at all ferocious notwithstanding
stop  though  let me first see that he is in visiting order   stepping before them  he looked into the room
motioning them to advance  he closed the door when they had entered  and gently drew back the curtains of the bed
upon it  in lieu of the dogged  black visaged ruffian they had expected to behold  there lay a mere child  worn with pain and exhaustion  and sunk into a deep sleep
his wounded arm  336 oliver twist bound and splintered up  was crossed upon his breast  his head reclined upon the other arm  which was half hidden by his long hair  as it streamed over the pillow
the honest gentleman held the curtain in his hand  and looked on  for a minute or so  in silence
whilst he was watching the patient thus  the younger lady glided softly past  and seating herself in a chair by the bedside  gathered oliver s hair from his face
as she stooped over him  her tears fell upon his forehead
the boy stirred  and smiled in his sleep  as though these marks of pity and compassion had awakened some pleasant dream of a love and affection he had never known
thus  a strain of gentle music  or the rippling of water in a silent place  or the odour of a flower  or the mention of a familiar word  will sometimes call up sudden dim remembrances of scenes that never were  in this life  which vanish like a breath  which some brief memory of a happier existence  long gone by  would seem to have awakened  which no voluntary exertion of the mind can ever recall
 what can this mean   exclaimed the elder lady
 this poor child can never have been the pupil of robbers    vice   said the surgeon  replacing the curtain   takes up her abode in many temples  and who can say that a fair outside shell not enshrine her    but at so early an age   urged rose
 my dear young lady   rejoined the surgeon  mournfully shaking his head   crime  like death  is not confined to the old and withered alone
the youngest and fairest are too often its chosen victims    but  can you—oh  can you really believe that this delicate boy has been the voluntary associate of the worst outcasts of society   said rose the surgeon shook his head  in a manner which intimated that he feared it was very possible  and observing that they might disturb the patient  led the way into an adjoining apartment
 but even if he has been wicked   pursued rose   think how young he is  think that he may never have known a mother s love  or the comfort of a home  that ill usage and blows  or the want of bread  may have driven him to herd with men who have forced him to guilt
aunt  dear aunt  for mercy s sake  think of this  before you let them drag this sick child to a prison  which in any case must be the grave of all his chances of amendment
oh  as you love me  and know that i have never felt the want of parents in your goodness and affection  but that i might have done so  and might have been equally helpless and unprotected with this poor child  have pity upon him before it is too late    my dear love   said the elder lady  as she folded the weeping girl to her bosom   do you think i would harm a hair of his head    oh  no   replied rose  eagerly
 no  surely   said the old lady   my days are drawing to their close  and may mercy be shown to me as i show it to others  what can i do to save him  sir    let me think  ma am   said the doctor   let me think   mr losberne thrust his hands into his pockets  and took several turns up and down the room  often stopping  338 oliver twist and balancing himself on his toes  and frowning frightfully after various exclamations of  i ve got it now  and  no  i haven t   and as many renewals of the walking and frowning  he at length made a dead halt  and spoke as follows   i think if you give me a full and unlimited commission to bully giles  and that little boy  brittles  i can manage it
giles is a faithful fellow and an old servant  i know  but you can make it up to him in a thousand ways  and reward him for being such a good shot besides
you don t object to that    unless there is some other way of preserving the child   replied mrs maylie  there is no other   said the doctor
 no other  take my word for it    then my aunt invests you with full power   said rose  smiling through her tears   but pray don t be harder upon the poor fellows than is indispensably necessary    you seem to think   retorted the doctor   that everybody is disposed to be hard hearted to day  except yourself  miss rose
i only hope  for the sake of the rising male sex generally  that you may be found in as vulnerable and soft hearted a mood by the first eligible young fellow who appeals to your compassion  and i wish i were a young fellow  that i might avail myself  on the spot  of such a favourable opportunity for doing so  as the present    you are as great a boy as poor brittles himself   returned rose  blushing  well   said the doctor  laughing heartily   that is no very difficult matter
but to return to this boy
the great point of our agreement is yet to come
he will wake in an hour or so  i dare say  and although i have told that thick headed constable fellow downstairs that he musn t be moved or spoken to  on peril of his life  i think we may converse with him without danger
now i make this stipulation—that i shall examine him in your presence  and that  if  from what he says  we judge  and i can show to the satisfaction of your cool reason  that he is a real and thorough bad one (which is more than possible)  he shall be left to his fate  without any farther interference on my part  at all events    oh no  aunt   entreated rose
 oh yes  aunt   said the doctor
 is is a bargain    he cannot be hardened in vice   said rose   it is impossible    very good   retorted the doctor   then so much the more reason for acceding to my proposition   finally the treaty was entered into  and the parties thereunto sat down to wait  with some impatience  until oliver should awake
the patience of the two ladies was destined to undergo a longer trial than mr losberne had led them to expect  for hour after hour passed on  and still oliver slumbered heavily
it was evening  indeed  before the kind hearted doctor brought them the intelligence  that he was at length sufficiently restored to be spoken to
the boy was very ill  he said  and weak from the loss of blood  but his mind was so troubled with anxiety to disclose something  that he deemed it better to give him the opportunity  than to insist upon his remaining quiet until next morning  which he should oth  340 oliver twist erwise have done
the conference was a long one
oliver told them all his simple history  and was often compelled to stop  by pain and want of strength
it was a solemn thing  to hear  in the darkened room  the feeble voice of the sick child recounting a weary catalogue of evils and calamities which hard men had brought upon him
oh  if when we oppress and grind our fellow creatures  we bestowed but one thought on the dark evidences of human error  which  like dense and heavy clouds  are rising  slowly it is true  but not less surely  to heaven  to pour their after vengeance on our heads  if we heard but one instant  in imagination  the deep testimony of dead men s voices  which no power can stifle  and no pride shut out  where would be the injury and injustice  the suffering  misery  cruelty  and wrong  that each day s life brings with it  oliver s pillow was smoothed by gentle hands that night  and loveliness and virtue watched him as he slept
he felt calm and happy  and could have died without a murmur
the momentous interview was no sooner concluded  and oliver composed to rest again  than the doctor  after wiping his eyes  and condemning them for being weak all at once  betook himself downstairs to open upon mr giles and finding nobody about the parlours  it occurred to him  that he could perhaps originate the proceedings with better effect in the kitchen  so into the kitchen he went
there were assembled  in that lower house of the domestic parliament  the women servants  mr brittles  mr giles  the tinker (who had received a special invitation to regale himself for the remainder of the day  in consideration of his services)  and the constable the latter gentleman had a large staff  a large head  large features  and large half boots  and he looked as if he had been taking a proportionate allowance of ale—as indeed he had
the adventures of the previous night were still under discussion  for mr giles was expatiating upon his presence of mind  when the doctor entered  mr brittles  with a mug of ale in his hand  was corroborating everything  before his superior said it
 sit still   said the doctor  waving his hand
 thank you  sir  said mr giles
 misses wished some ale to be given out  sir  and as i felt no ways inclined for my own little room  sir  and was disposed for company  i am taking mine among  em here   brittles headed a low murmur  by which the ladies and gentlemen generally were understood to express the gratification they derived from mr giles s condescension
mr giles looked round with a patronising air  as much as to say that so long as they behaved properly  he would never desert them
 how is the patient to night  sir   asked giles
 so so   returned the doctor
 i am afraid you have got yourself into a scrape there  mr giles    i hope you don t mean to say  sir   said mr giles  trembling   that he s going to die
if i thought it  i should never be happy again
i wouldn t cut a boy off  no  not even brittles here  not for all the plate in the county  sir    that s not the point   said the doctor  mysteriously
 mr 342 oliver twist giles  are you a protestant    yes  sir  i hope so   faltered mr giles  who had turned very pale
 and what are you  boy   said the doctor  turning sharply upon brittles
 lord bless me  sir   replied brittles  starting violently   i m the same as mr giles  sir    then tell me this   said the doctor   both of you  both of you  are you going to take upon yourselves to swear  that that boy upstairs is the boy that was put through the little window last night  out with it  come  we are prepared for you   the doctor  who was universally considered one of the best tempered creatures on earth  made this demand in such a dreadful tone of anger  that giles and brittles  who were considerably muddled by ale and excitement  stared at each other in a state of stupefaction
 pay attention to the reply  constable  will you   said the doctor  shaking his forefinger with great solemnity of manner  and tapping the bridge of his nose with it  to bespeak the exercise of that worthy s utmost acuteness
 something may come of this before long   the constable looked as wise as he could  and took up his staff of office  which had been recling indolently in the chimney corner
 it s a simple question of identity  you will observe   said the doctor
 that s what it is  sir   replied the constable  coughing with great violence  for he had finished his ale in a hurry  and some of it had gone the wrong way
 here s the house broken into   said the doctor   and a couple of men catch one moment s glimpse of a boy  in the midst of gunpowder smoke  and in all the distraction of alarm and darkness
here s a boy comes to that very same house  next morning  and because he happens to have his arm tied up  these men lay violent hands upon him—by doing which  they place his life in great danger—and swear he is the thief
now  the question is  whether these men are justified by the fact  if not  in what situation do they place themselves   the constable nodded profoundly he said  if that wasn t law  he would be glad to know what was
 i ask you again   thundered the doctor   are you  on your solemn oaths  able to identify that boy   brittles looked doubtfully at mr giles  mr giles looked doubtfully at brittles  the constable put his hand behind his ear  to catch the reply  the two women and the tinker leaned forward to listen  the doctor glanced keenly round  when a ring was heard at the gate  and at the same moment  the sound of wheels
 it s the runners   cried brittles  to all appearance much relieved
 the what   exclaimed the doctor  aghast in his turn
 the bow street officers  sir   replied brittles  taking up a candle   me and mr giles sent for  em this morning    what   cried the doctor
 yes   replied brittles   i sent a message up by the coachman  and i only wonder they weren t here before  sir   344 oliver twist  you did  did you  then confound your—slow coaches down here  that s all   said the doctor  walking away
involves a critical position  who s that   inquired brittles  opening the door a little way  with the chain up  and peeping out  shading the candle with his hand
 open the door   replied a man outside   it s the officers from bow street  as was sent to to day   much comforted by this assurance  brittles opened the door to its full width  and confronted a portly man in a greatcoat  who walked in  without saying anything more  and wiped his shoes on the mat  as coolly as if he lived there
 just send somebody out to relieve my mate  will you  young man   said the officer   he s in the gig  a minding the prad
have you got a coach  us here  that you could put it up in  for five or ten minutes   brittles replying in the affirmative  and pointing out the building  the portly man stepped back to the garden gate  and helped his companion to put up the gig  while brittles lighted them  in a state of great admiration
this done  they returned to the house  and  being shown into a parlour  346 oliver twist took off their great coats and hats  and showed like what they were
the man who had knocked at the door  was a stout personage of middle height  aged about fifty  with shiny black hair  cropped pretty close  half whiskers  a round face  and sharp eyes
the other was a red headed  bony man  in top boots  with a rather ill favoured countenance  and a turned up sinister looking nose
 tell your governor that blathers and duff is here  will you   said the stouter man  smoothing down his hair  and laying a pair of handcuffs on the table
 oh  good evening  master
can i have a word or two with you in private  if you please   this was addressed to mr losberne  who now made his appearance  that gentleman  motioning brittles to retire  brought in the two ladies  and shut the door
 this is the lady of the house   said mr losberne  motioning towards mrs maylie mr blathers made a bow
being desired to sit down  he put his hat on the floor  and taking a chair  motioned to duff to do the same
the latter gentleman  who did not appear quite so much accustomed to good society  or quite so much at his ease in it—one of the two—seated himself  after undergoing several muscular affections of the limbs  and the head of his stick into his mouth  with some embarrassment  now  with regard to this here robbery  master   said blathers
 what are the circumstances   mr losberne  who appeared desirous of gaining time  recounted them at great length  and with much circumlocution messrs
blathers and duff looked very knowing meanwhile  and occasionally exchanged a nod
 i can t say  for certain  till i see the work  of course   said blathers   but my opinion at once is —i don t mind committing myself to that extent —that this wasn t done by a yokel  eh  duff    certainly not   replied duff
 and  translating the word yokel for the benefit of the ladies  i apprehend your meaning to be  that this attempt was not made by a countryman   said mr losberne  with a smile
 that s it  master   replied blathers
 this is all about the robbery  is it    all   replied the doctor
 now  what is this  about this here boy that the servants are a talking on   said blathers
 nothing at all   replied the doctor
 one of the frightened servants chose to take it into his head  that he had something to do with this attempt to break into the house  but it s nonsense  sheer absurdity    wery easy disposed of  if it is   remarked duff
 what he says is quite correct   observed blathers  nodding his head in a confirmatory way  and playing carelessly with the handcuffs  as if they were a pair of castanets
 who is the boy  what account does he give of himself  where did he come from  he didn t drop out of the clouds  did he  master   348 oliver twist  of course not   replied the doctor  with a nervous glance at the two ladies  i know his whole history  but we can talk about that presently
you would like  first  to see the place where the thieves made their attempt  i suppose    certainly   rejoined mr blathers
 we had better inspect the premises first  and examine the servants afterwards
that s the usual way of doing business   lights were then procured  and messrs
blathers and duff  attended by the native constable  brittles  giles  and everybody else in short  went into the little room at the end of the passage and looked out at the window  and afterwards went round by way of the lawn  and looked in at the window  and after that  had a candle handed out to inspect the shutter with  and after that  a lantern to trace the footsteps with  and after that  a pitchfork to poke the bushes with
this done  amidst the breathless interest of all beholders  they came in again  and mr giles and brittles were put through a melodramatic representation of their share in the previous night s adventures  which they performed some six times over  contradiction each other  in not more than one important respect  the first time  and in not more than a dozen the last
this consummation being arrived at  blathers and duff cleared the room  and held a long council together  compared with which  for secrecy and solemnity  a consultation of great doctors on the knottiest point in medicine  would be mere child s play
meanwhile  the doctor walked up and down the next room in a very uneasy state  and mrs maylie and rose looked on  with anxious faces  upon my word   he said  making a halt  after a great number of very rapid turns   i hardly know what to do    surely   said rose   the poor child s story  faithfully repeated to these men  will be sufficient to exonerate him    i doubt it  my dear young lady   said the doctor  shaking his head
 i don t think it would exonerate him  either with them  or with legal functionaries of a higher grade
what is he  after all  they would say  a runaway
judged by mere worldly considerations and probabilities  his story is a very doubtful one    you believe it  surely   interrupted rose
 i believe it  strange as it is  and perhaps i may be an old fool for doing so   rejoined the doctor   but i don t think it is exactly the tale for a practical police officer  nevertheless    why not   demanded rose
 because  my pretty cross examiner   replied the doctor   because  viewed with their eyes  there are many ugly points about it  he can only prove the parts that look ill  and none of those that look well
confound the fellows  they will have the way and the wherefore  and will take nothing for granted
on his own showing  you see  he has been the companion of thieves for some time past  he has been carried to a police officer  on a charge of picking a gentleman s pocket  he has been taken away  forcibly  from that gentleman s house  to a place which he cannot describe or point out  and of the situation of which he has not the remotest idea
he is brought down to chertsey  by men who seem to have taken a violent fancy to him  whether he will or no  and is put through a window to rob a house  and then  just at the very 350 oliver twist moment when he is going to alarm the inmates  and so do the very thing that would set him all to rights  there rushes into the way  a blundering dog of a half bred butler  and shoots him  as if on purpose to prevent his doing any good for himself  don t you see all this    i see it  of course   replied rose  smiling at the doctor s impetuosity   but still i do not see anything in it  to criminate the poor child    no   replied the doctor   of course not  bless the bright eyes of your sex  they never see  whether for good or bad  more than one side of any question  and that is  always  the one which first presents itself to them   having given vent to this result of experience  the doctor put his hands into his pockets  and walked up and down the room with even greater rapidity than before  the more i think of it   said the doctor   the more i see that it will occasion endless trouble and difficulty if we put these men in possession of the boy s real story
i am certain it will not be believed  and even if they can do nothing to him in the end  still the dragging it forward  and giving publicity to all the doubts that will be cast upon it  must interfere  materially  with your benevolent plan of rescuing him from misery    oh  what is to be done   cried rose
 dear  dear  whyddid they send for these people    why  indeed   exclaimed mrs maylie  i would not have had them here  for the world    all i know is   said mr losberne  at last  sitting down with a kind of desperate calmness   that we must try and carry it off with a bold face
the object is a good one  and that must be our excuse
the boy has strong symptoms of fever upon him  and is in no condition to be talked to any more  that s one comfort we must make the best of it  and if bad be the best  it is no fault of ours
come in    well  master   said blathers  entering the room followed by his colleague  and making the door fast  before he said any more
 this warn t a put up thing    and what the devil s a put up thing   demanded the doctor  impatiently
 we call it a put up robbery  ladies   said blathers  turning to them  as if he pitied their ignorance  but had a contempt for the doctor s   when the servants is in it    nobody suspected them  in this case   said mrs maylie  wery likely not  ma am   replied blathers   but they might have been in it  for all that    more likely on that wery account   said duff
 we find it was a town hand   said blathers  continuing his report   for the style of work is first rate    wery pretty indeed it is   remarked duff  in an undertone
 there was two of  em in it   continued blathers   and they had a boy with  em  that s plain from the size of the window
that s all to be said at present
we ll see this lad that you ve got upstairs at once  if you please    perhaps they will take something to drink first  mrs maylie   said the doctor  his face brightening  as if some new thought had occurred to him  oh  to be sure   exclaimed rose  eagerly
 you shall have 352 oliver twist it immediately  if you will    why  thank you  miss   said blathers  drawing his coatsleeve across his mouth   it s dry work  this sort of duty
anythink that s handy  miss  don t put yourself out of the way  on our accounts    what shall it be   asked the doctor  following the young lady to the sideboard
 a little drop of spirits  master  if it s all the same   replied blathers
 it s a cold ride from london  ma am  and i always find that spirits comes home warmer to the feelings   this interesting communication was addressed to mrs maylie  who received it very graciously while it was being conveyed to her  the doctor slipped out of the room
 ah   said mr blathers  not holding his wine glass by the stem  but grasping the bottom between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand  and placing it in front of his chest   i have seen a good many pieces of business like this  in my time  ladies    that crack down in the back lane at edmonton  blathers   said mr duff  assisting his colleague s memory
 that was something in this way  warn t it   rejoined mr blathers   that was done by conkey chickweed  that was    you always gave that to him  replied duff
 it was the family pet  i tell you
conkey hadn t any more to do with it than i had    get out   retorted mr blathers   i know better
do you mind that time when conkey was robbed of his money  though  what a start that was  better than any novel book i ever see    what was that   inquired rose  anxious to encourage any symptoms of good humour in the unwelcome visitors  it was a robbery  miss  that hardly anybody would have been down upon   said blathers
 this here conkey chickweed—   conkey means nosey  ma am   interposed duff
 of course the lady knows that  don t she   demanded mr blathers
 always interrupting  you are  partner  this here conkey chickweed  miss  kept a public house over battlebridge way  and he had a cellar  where a good many young lords went to see cock fighting  and badger drawing  and that  and a wery intellectural manner the sports was conducted in  for i ve seen  em off en
he warn t one of the family  at that time  and one night he was robbed of three hundred and twenty seven guineas in a canvas bag  that was stole out of his bedrrom in the dead of night  by a tall man with a black patch over his eye  who had concealed himself under the bed  and after committing the robbery  jumped slap out of window  which was only a story high he was wery quick about it
but conkey was quick  too  for he fired a blunderbuss arter him  and roused the neighbourhood
they set up a hue and cry  directly  and when they came to look about  em  found that conkey had hit the robber  for there was traces of blood  all the way to some palings a good distance off  and there they lost  em
however  he had made off with the blunt  and  consequently  the name of mr chickweed  licensed witler  appeared in the gazette among the other bankrupts  and all manner of benefits and subscriptions  and i don t know what all  was got 354 oliver twist up for the poor man  who was in a wery low state of mind about his loss  and went up and down the streets  for three or four days  a pulling his hair off in such a desperate manner that many people was afraid he might be going to make away with himself one day he came up to the office  all in a hurry  and had a private interview with the magistrate  who  after a deal of talk  rings the bell  and orders jem spyers in (jem was a active officer)  and tells him to go and assist mr chickweed in apprehending the man as robbed his house
 i see him  spyers   said chickweed   pass my house yesterday morning    why didn t you up  and collar him   says spyers
 i was so struck all of a heap  that you might have fractured my skull with a toothpick   says the poor man   but we re sure to have him  for between ten and eleven o clock at night he passed again   spyers no sooner heard this  than he put some clean linen and a comb  in his pocket  in case he should have to stop a day or two  and away he goes  and sets himself down at one of the public house windows behind the little red curtain  with his hat on  all ready to bolt out  at a moment s notice he was smoking his pipe here  late at night  when all of a sudden chickweed roars out   here he is  stop thief  murder   jem spyers dashes out  and there he sees chickweed  a tearing down the street full cry
away goes spyers  on goes chickweed  round turns the people  everybody roars out   thieves   and chickweed himself keeps on shouting  all the time  like mad spyers loses sight of him a minute as he turns a corner  shoots round  sees a little crowd  dives in   which is the man    d—me   says chickweed   i ve lost him again   it was a remarkable occurrence  but he warn t to be seen nowhere  so they went back to the public house
next morning  spyers took his old place  and looked out  from behind the curtain  for a tall man with a black patch over his eye  till his own two eyes ached again
at last  he couldn t help shutting  em  to ease  em a minute  and the very moment he did so  he hears chickweed a roaring out   here he is   off he starts once more  with chickweed half way down the street ahead of him  and after twice as long a run as the yesterday s one  the man s lost again  this was done  once or twice more  till one half the neighbours gave out that mr chickweed had been robbed by the devil  who was playing tricks with him arterwards  and the other half  that poor mr chickweed had gone mad with grief    what did jem spyers say   inquired the doctor  who had returned to the room shortly after the commencement of the story
 jem spyers   resumed the officer   for a long time said nothing at all  and listened to everything without seeming to  which showed he understood his business
but  one morning  he walked into the bar  and taking out his snuffbox  says  chickweed  i ve found out who done this here robbery    have you   said chickweed
 oh  my dear spyers  only let me have wengeance  and i shall die contented  oh  my dear spyers  where is the villain    come   said spyers  offering him a pinch of snuff   none of that gammon  you did it yourself   so he had  and a good bit of money he had made by it  too  and nobody would never have found it out  if he hadn t been so precious anxious to keep up appear  356 oliver twist ances   said mr blathers  putting down his wine glass  and clinking the handcuffs together
 very curious  indeed   observed the doctor
 now  if you please  you can walk upstairs    if you please  sir   returned mr blathers
closely following mr losberne  the two officers ascended to oliver s bedroom  mr giles preceding the party  with a lighted candle
oliver had been dozing  but looked worse  and was more feverish than he had appeared yet
being assisted by the doctor  he managed to sit up in bed for a minute or so  and looked at the strangers without at all understanding what was going forward—in fact  without seeming to recollect where he was  or what had been passing
 this   said mr losberne  speaking softly  but with great vehemence notwithstanding   this is the lad  who  being accidently wounded by a spring gun in some boyish trespass on mr what d  ye call him s grounds  at the back here  comes to the house for assistance this morning  and is immediately laid hold of and maltreated  by that ingenious gentleman with the candle in his hand  who has placed his life in considerable danger  as i can professionally certify   messrs
blathers and duff looked at mr giles  as he was thus recommended to their notice
the bewildered butler gazed from them towards oliver  and from oliver towards mr losberne  with a most ludicrous mixture of fear and perplexity
 you don t mean to deny that  i suppose   said the doctor  laying oliver gently down again
 it was all done for the—for the best  sir   answered giles
 i am sure i thought it was the boy  or i wouldn t have meddled with him
i am not of an inhuman disposition  sir    thought it was what boy   inquired the senior officer
 the housebreaker s boy  sir   replied giles
 they—they certainly had a boy    well  do you think so now   inquired blathers
 think what  now   replied giles  looking vacantly at his questioner
 think it s the same boy  stupid head   rejoined blathers  impatiently
 i don t know  i really don t know   said giles  with a rueful countenance
 i couldn t swear to him    what do you think   asked mr blathers
 i don t know what to think   replied poor giles
 i don t think it is the boy  indeed  i m almost certain that it isn t
you know it can t be    has this man been a drinking  sir   inquired blathers  turning to the doctor
 what a precious muddle headed chap you are   said duff  addressing mr giles  with supreme contempt
mr losberne had been feeling the patient s pulse during this short dialogue  but he now rose from the chair by the bedside  and remarked  that if the officers had any doubts upon the subject  they would perhaps like to step into the next room  and have brittles before them
acting upon this suggestion  they adjourned to a neighbouring apartment  where mr brittles  being called in  involved himself and his respected superior in such a won  358 oliver twist derful maze of fresh contradictions and impossibilities  as tended to throw no particular light on anything  but the fact of his own strong mystification  except  indeed  his declarations that he shouldn t know the real boy  if he were put before him that instant  that he had only taken oliver to be he  because mr giles had said he was  and that mr giles had  five minutes previously  admitted in the kitchen  that he begain to be very much afraid he had been a little too hasty among other ingenious surmises  the question was then raised  whether mr giles had really hit anybody  and upon examination of the fellow pistol to that which he had fired  it turned out to have no more destructive loading than gunpowder and brown paper  a discovery which made a considerable impression on everybody but the doctor  who had drawn the ball about ten minutes before
upon no one  however  did it make a greater impression than on mr giles himself  who  after labouring  for some hours  under the fear of having mortally wounded a fellow creature  eagerly caught at this new idea  and favoured it to the utmost finally  the officers  without troubling themselves very much about oliver  left the chertsey constable in the house  and took up their rest for that night in the town  promising to return the next morning with the next morning  there came a rumour  that two men and a boy were in the cage at kingston  who had been apprehended over night under suspicious circumstances  and to kingston messrs blathers and duff journeyed accordingly
the suspicious circumstances  however  resolving themselves  on investigation  into the one fact  that they had been discovered sleeping under a haystack  which  although a great crime  is only punishable by imprisonment  and is  in the merciful eye of the english law  and its comprehensive love of all the king s subjects  held to be no satisfactory proof  in the absence of all other evidence  that the sleeper  or sleepers  have committed burglary accompanied with violence  and have therefore rendered themselves liable to the punishment of death  messrs blathers and duff came back again  as wise as they went
in short  after some more examination  and a great deal more conversation  a neighbouring magistrate was readily induced to take the joint bail of mrs maylie and mr losberne for oliver s appearance if he should ever be called upon  and blathers and duff  being rewarded with a couple of guineas  returned to town with divided opinions on the subject of their expedition  the latter gentleman on a mature consideration of all the circumstances  inclining to the belief that the burglarious attempt had originated with the family pet  and the former being equally disposed to concede the full merit of it to the great mr conkey chickweed meanwhile  oliver gradually throve and prospered under the united care of mrs maylie  rose  and the kind hearted mr losberne if fervent prayers  gushing from hearts overcharged with gratitude  be heard in heaven—and if they be not  what prayers are —the blessings which the orphan child called down upon them  sunk into their souls  diffusing peace and happiness 360 oliver twist of the happy life oliver began to lead with his kind friends oliver s ailings were neither slight nor few
in addition to the pain and delay attendant on a broken limb  his exposure to the wet and cold had brought on fever and ague  which hung about him for many weeks  and reduced him sadly
but  at length  he began  by slow degrees  to get better  and to be able to say sometimes  in a few tearful words  how deeply he felt the goodness of the two sweet ladies  and how ardently he hoped that when he grew strong and well again  he could do something to show his gratitude  only something  which would let them see the love and duty with which his breast was full  something  however slight  which would prove to them that their gentle kindness had not been cast away  but that the poor boy whom their charity had rescued from misery  or death  was eager to serve them with his whole heart and soul
 poor fellow   said rose  when oliver had been one day feebly endeavouring to utter the words of thankfulness that rose to his pale lips   you shall have many opportunities of serving us  if you will
we are going into the country  and my aunt intends that you shall accompany us
the quiet place  the pure air  and all the pleasure and beauties of spring  will restore you in a few days
we will employ you in a hundred ways  when you can bear the trouble    the trouble   cried oliver
 oh  dear lady  if i could but work for you  if i could only give you pleasure by watering your flowers  or watching your birds  or running up and down the whole day long  to make you happy  what would i give to do it    you shall give nothing at all   said miss maylie  smiling   for  as i told you before  we shall employ you in a hundred ways  and if you only take half the trouble to please us  that you promise now  you will make me very happy indeed    happy  ma am   cried oliver   how kind of you to say so    you will make me happier than i can tell you   replied the young lady
 to think that my dear good aunt should have been the means of rescuing any one from such sad misery as you have described to us  would be an unspeakable pleasure to me  but to know that the object of her goodness and compassion was sincerely grateful and attached  in consequence  would delight me  more than you can well imagine
do you understand me   she inquired  watching oliver s thoughtful face
 oh yes  ma am  yes   replied oliver eagerly   but i was thinking that i am ungrateful now    to whom   inquired the young lady
362 oliver twist  to the kind gentleman  and the dear old nurse  who took so much care of me before   rejoined oliver
 if they knew how happy i am  they would be pleased  i am sure    i am sure they would   rejoined oliver s benefactress   and mr losberne has already been kind enough to promise that when you are well enough to bear the journey  he will carry you to see them    has he  ma am   cried oliver  his face brightening with pleasure
 i don t know what i shall do for joy when i see their kind faces once again   in a short time oliver was sufficiently recovered to undergo the fatigue of this expedition
one morning he and mr losberne set out  accordingly  in a little carriage which belonged to mrs maylie when they came to chertsey bridge  oliver turned very pale  and uttered a loud exclamation
 what s the matter with the boy   cried the doctor  as usual  all in a bustle
 do you see anything—hear anything—feel anything—eh    that  sir   cried oliver  pointing out of the carriage window
 that house    yes  well  what of it  stop coachman
pull up here   cried the doctor
 what of the house  my man  eh    the thieves—the house they took me to   whispered oliver
 the devil it is   cried the doctor
 hallo  there  let me out   but  before the coachman could dismount from his box  he had tumbled out of the coach  by some means or other  and  running down to the deserted tenement  began kicking at the door like a madman
 halloa   said a little ugly hump backed man  opening the door so suddenly  that the doctor  from the very impetus of his last kick  nearly fell forward into the passage
 what s the matter here    matter   exclaimed the other  collaring him  without a moment s reflection
 a good deal
robbery is the matter    there ll be murder the matter  too   replied the humpbacked man  coolly   if you don t take your hands off
do you hear me    i hear you   said the doctor  giving his captive a hearty shake
 where s—confound the fellow  what s his rascally name—sikes  that s it
where s sikes  you thief   the hump backed man stared  as if in excess of amazement and indignation  then  twisting himself  dexterously  from the doctor s grasp  growled forth a volley of horrid oaths  and retired into the house before he could shut the door  however  the doctor had passed into the parlour  without a word of parley
he looked anxiously round  not an article of furniture  not a vestige of anything  animate or inanimate  not even the position of the cupboards  answered oliver s description   now   said the hump backed man  who had watched him keenly   what do you mean by coming into my house  in this violent way  do you want to rob me  or to murder me  which is it   364 oliver twist  did you ever know a man come out to do either  in a chariot and a pair  you ridiculous old vampire   said the irritable doctor
 what do you want  then   demanded the hunchback
 will you take yourself off  before i do you a mischief  curse you    as soon as i think proper   said mr losberne  looking into the other parlour  which  like the first  bore no resemblance whatever to oliver s account of it
 i shall find you out  some day  my friend    will you   sneered the ill favoured cripple
 if you ever want me  i m here
i haven t lived here mad and all alone  for five and twenty years  to be scared by you
you shall pay for this  you shall pay for this   and so saying  the mis shapen little demon set up a yell  and danced upon the ground  as if wild with rage
 stupid enough  this   muttered the doctor to himself   the boy must have made a mistake here  put that in your pocket  and shut yourself up again   with these words he flung the hunchback a piece of money  and returned to the carriage
the man followed to the chariot door  uttering the wildest imprecations and curses all the way  but as mr losberne turned to speak to the driver  he looked into the carriage  and eyed oliver for an instant with a glance so sharp and fierce and at the same time so furious and vindictive  that  waking or sleeping  he could not forget it for months afterwards
he continued to utter the most fearful imprecations  until the driver had resumed his seat  and when they were once more on their way  they could see him some distance behind  beating his feet upon the ground  and tearing his hair  in transports of real or pretended rage
 i am an ass   said the doctor  after a long silence
 did you know that before  oliver    no  sir    then don t forget it another time    an ass   said the doctor again  after a further silence of some minutes
 even if it had been the right place  and the right fellows had been there  what could i have done  singlehanded  and if i had had assistance  i see no good that i should have done  except leading to my own exposure  and an unavoidable statement of the manner in which i have hushed up this business
that would have served me right  though
i am always involving myself in some scrape or other  by acting on impulse
it might have done me good   now  the fact was that the excellent doctor had never acted upon anything but impulse all through his life  and if was no bad compliment to the nature of the impulses which governed him  that so far from being involved in any peculiar troubles or misfortunes  he had the warmest respect and esteem of all who knew him
if the truth must be told  he was a little out of temper  for a minute or two  at being disappointed in procuring corroborative evidence of oliver s story on the very first occasion on which he had a chance of obtaining any
he soon came round again  however  and finding that oliver s replies to his questions  were still as straightforward and consistent  and still delivered with as much apparent sincerity and truth  as they had ever 366 oliver twist been  he made up his mind to attach full credence to them  from that time forth
as oliver knew the name of the street in which mr brownlow resided  they were enabled to drive straight thither
when the coach turned into it  his heart beat so violently  that he could scarcely draw his breath
 now  my boy  which house is it   inquired mr losberne
 that  that   replied oliver  pointing eagerly out of the window
 the white house
oh  make haste  pray make haste  i feel as if i should die  it makes me tremble so    come  come   said the good doctor  patting him on the shoulder
 you will see them directly  and they will be overjoyed to find you safe and well    oh  i hope so   cried oliver
 they were so good to me  so very  very good to me   the coach rolled on
it stopped
no  that was the wrong house  the next door
it went on a few paces  and stopped again
oliver looked up at the windows  with tears of happy expectation coursing down his face
alas  the white house was empty  and there was a bill in the window
 to let    knock at the next door   cried mr losberne  taking oliver s arm in his
 what has become of mr brownlow  who used to live in the adjoining house  do you know   the servant did not know  but would go and inquire
she presently returned  and said  that mr brownlow had sold off his goods  and gone to the west indies  six weeks before
oliver clasped his hands  and sank feebly backward
 has his housekeeper gone too   inquired mr losberne  after a moment s pause
 yes  sir   replied the servant
 the old gentleman  the housekeeper  and a gentleman who was a friend of mr brownlow s  all went together
 then turn towards home again   said mr losberne to the driver   and don t stop to bait the horses  till you get out of this confounded london    the book stall keeper  sir   said oliver
 i know the way there
see him  pray  sir  do see him    my poor boy  this is disappointment enough for one day   said the doctor
 quite enough for both of us
if we go to the book stall keeper s  we shall certainly find that he is dead  or has set his house on fire  or run away
no  home again straight   and in obedience to the doctor s impulse  home they went
this bitter disappointment caused oliver much sorrow and grief  even in the midst of his happiness  for he had pleased himself  many times during his illness  with thinking of all that mr brownlow and mrs bedwin would say to him  and what delight it would be to tell them how many long days and nights he had passed in reflecting on what they had done for him  and in bewailing his cruel separation from them the hope of eventually clearing himself with them  too  and explaining how he had been forced away  had buoyed him up  and sustained him  under many of his recent trials  and now  the idea that they should have gone so far  and carried with them the belief that the was an impostor and a robber—a belief which might remain uncontradicted to his dying day—was almost more than he 368 oliver twist could bear the circumstance occasioned no alteration  however  in the behaviour of his benefactors after another fortnight  when the fine warm weather had fairly begun  and every tree and flower was putting forth its young leaves and rich blossoms  they made preparations for quitting the house at chertsey  for some months sending the plate  which had so excited fagin s cupidity  to the banker s  and leaving giles and another servant in care of the house  they departed to a cottage at some distance in the country  and took oliver with them who can describe the pleasure and delight  the peace of mind and soft tranquillity  the sickly boy felt in the balmy air  and among the green hills and rich woods  of an inland village  who can tell how scenes of peace and quietude sink into the minds of pain worn dwellers in close and noisy places  and carry their own freshness  deep into their jaded hearts  men who have lived in crowded  pent up streets  through lives of toil  and who have never wished for change  men  to whom custom has indeed been second nature  and who have come almost to love each brick and stone that formed the narrow boundaries of their daily walks  even they  with the hand of death upon them  have been known to yearn at last for one short glimpse of nature s face  and  carried far from the scenes of their old pains and pleasures  have seemed to pass at once into a new state of being
crawling forth  from day to day  to some green sunny spot  they have had such memories wakened up within them by the sight of the sky  and hill and plain  and glistening water  that a foretaste of heaven itself has soothed their quick decline  and they have sunk into their tombs  as peacefully as the sun whose setting they watched from their lonely chamber window but a few hours before  faded from their dim and feeble sight  the memories which peaceful country scenes call up  are not of this world  nor of its thoughts and hopes
their gentle influence may teach us how to weave fresh garlands for the graves of those we loved  may purify our thoughts  and bear down before it old enmity and hatred  but beneath all this  there lingers  in the least reflective mind  a vague and half formed consciousness of having held such feelings long before  in some remote and distant time  which calls up solemn thoughts of distant times to come  and bends down pride and worldliness beneath it
it was a lovely spot to which they repaired
oliver  whose days had been spent among squalid crowds  and in the midst of noise and brawling  seemed to enter on a new existence there
the rose and honeysuckle clung to the cottage walls  the ivy crept round the trunks of the trees  and the garden flowers perfumed the air with delicious odours
hard by  was a little churchyard  not crowded with tall unsightly gravestones  but full of humble mounds  covered with fresh turf and moss  beneath which  the old people of the village lay at rest
oliver often wandered here  and  thinking of the wretched grave in which his mother lay  would sometimes sit him down and sob unseen  but  when he raised his eyes to the deep sky overhead  he would cease to think of her as lying in the ground  and would weep for her  sadly  but without pain 370 oliver twist it was a happy time
the days were peaceful and serene  the nights brought with them neither fear nor care  no languishing in a wretched prison  or associating with wretched men  nothing but pleasant and happy thoughts every morning he went to a white headed old gentleman  who lived near the little church  who taught him to read better  and to write  and who spoke so kindly  and took such pains  that oliver could never try enough to please him
then  he would walk with mrs maylie and rose  and hear them talk of books  or perhaps sit near them  in some shady place  and listen whilst the young lady read  which he could have done  until it grew too dark to see the letters then  he had his own lesson for the next day to prepare  and at this  he would work hard  in a little room which looked into the garden  till evening came slowly on  when the ladies would walk out again  and he with them  listening with such pleasure to all they said  and so happy if they wanted a flower that he could climb to reach  or had forgotten anything he could run to fetch  that he could never be quick enought about it when it became quite dark  and they returned home  the young lady would sit down to the piano  and play some pleasant air  or sing  in a low and gentle voice  some old song which it pleased her aunt to hear
there would be no candles lighted at such times as these  and oliver would sit by one of the windows  listening to the sweet music  in a perfect rapture
and when sunday came  how differently the day was spent  from any way in which he had ever spent it yet  and how happily too  like all the other days in that most happy time  there was the little church  in the morning  with the green leaves fluttering at the windows  the birds singing without  and the sweet smelling air stealing in at the low porch  and filling the homely building with its fragrance
the poor people were so neat and clean  and knelt so reverently in prayer  that it seemed a pleasure  not a tedious duty  their assembling there together  and though the singing might be rude  it was real  and sounded more musical (to oliver s ears at least) than any he had ever heard in church before
then  there were the walks as usual  and many calls studying all the week  and in the performance of which duty he felt more proud and pleased  than if he had been the clergyman himself in the morning  oliver would be a foot by six o clock  roaming the fields  and plundering the hedges  far and wide  for nosegays of wild flowers  with which he would return laden  home  and which it took great care and consideration to arrange  to the best advantage  for the embellishment of the breakfast table
there was fresh groundsel  too  for miss maylie s birds  with which oliver  who had been studying the subject under the able tuition of the village clerk  would decorate the cages  in the most approved taste
when the birds were made all spruce and smart for the day  there was usually some little commission of charity to execute in the village  or  failing that  there was rare cricket playing  sometimes  on the green  or  failing that  there was always something to do in the garden  or about the plants  to which oliver (who had studied this science also  under the same 372 oliver twist master  who was a gardener by trade ) applied himself with hearty good will  until miss rose made her appearance  when there were a thousand commendations to be bestowed on all he had done so three months glided away  three months which  in the life of the most blessed and favoured of mortals  might have been unmingled happiness  and which  in oliver s were true felicity
with the purest and most amiable generousity on one side  and the truest  warmest  soul felt gratitude on the other  it is no wonder that  by the end of that short time  oliver twist had become completely domesticated with the old lady and her niece  and that the fervent attachment of his young and sensitive heart  was repaid by their pride in  and attachment to  himself wherein the happiness of oliver and his friends  experiences a sudden check spring flew swiftly by  and summer came
if the village had been beautiful at first it was now in the full glow and luxuriance of its richness
the great trees  which had looked shrunken and bare in the earlier months  had now burst into strong life and health  and stretching forth their green arms over the thirsty ground  converted open and naked spots into choice nooks  where was a deep and pleasant shade from which to look upon the wide prospect  steeped in sunshine  which lay stretched beyond the earth had donned her mantle of brightest green  and shed her richest perfumes abroad it was the prime and vigour of the year  all things were glad and flourishing
still  the same quiet life went on at the little cottage  and the same cheerful serenity prevailed among its inmates
ol  374 oliver twist iver had long since grown stout and healthy  but health or sickness made no difference in his warm feelings of a great many people
he was still the same gentle  attached  affectionate creature that he had been when pain and suffering had wasted his strength  and when he was dependent for every slight attention  and comfort on those who tended him
one beautiful night  when they had taken a longer walk than was customary with them  for the day had been unusually warm  and there was a brilliant moon  and a light wind had sprung up  which was unusually refreshing
rose had been in high spirits  too  and they had walked on  in merry conversation  until they had far exceeded their ordinary bounds
mrs maylie being fatigued  they returned more slowly home the young lady merely throwing off her simple bonnet  sat down to the piano as usual
after running abstractedly over the keys for a few minutes  she fell into a low and very solemn air  and as she played it  they heard a sound as if she were weeping
 rose  my dear   said the elder lady
rose made no reply  but played a little quicker  as though the words had roused her from some painful thoughts
 rose  my love   cried mrs maylie  rising hastily  and bending over her  what is this  in tears  my dear child  what distresses you    nothing  aunt  nothing   replied the young lady
 i don t know what it is  i can t describe it  but i feel—   not ill  my love   interposed mrs maylie  no  no  oh  not ill   replied rose  shuddering as though some deadly chillness were passing over her  while she spoke   i shall be better presently
close the window  pray   oliver hastened to comply with her request
the young lady  making an effort to recover her cheerfulness  strove to play some livelier tune  but her fingers dropped powerless over the keys
covering her face with her hands  she sank upon a sofa  and gave vent to the tears which she was now unable to repress
 my child   said the elderly lady  folding her arms about her   i never saw you so before    i would not alarm you if i could avoid it   rejoined rose   but indeed i have tried very hard  and cannot help this i fear i am ill  aunt   she was  indeed  for  when candles were brought  they saw that in the very short time which had elapsed since their return home  the hue of her countenance had changed to a marble whiteness
its expression had lost nothing of its beauty  but it was changed  and there was an anxious haggard look about the gentle face  which it had never worn before
another minute  and it was suffused with a crimson flush  and a heavy wildness came over the soft blue eye again this disappeared  like the shadow thrown by a passing cloud  and she was once more deadly pale
oliver  who watched the old lady anxiously  observed that she was alarmed by these appearances  and so in truth  was he  but seeing that she affected to make light of them  he endeavoured to do the same  and they so far succeeded  that when rose was persuaded by her aunt to retire for the night  she was in better spirits  and appeared even in better health  assuring them that she felt certain she should rise in 376 oliver twist the morning  quite well
 i hope   said oliver  when mrs maylie returned   that nothing is the matter  she don t look well to night  but—  the old lady motioned to him not to speak  and sitting herself down in a dark corner of the room  remained silent for some time at length  she said  in a trembling voice   i hope not  oliver
i have been very happy with her for some years  too happy  perhaps
it may be time that i should meet with some misfortune  but i hope it is not this    what   inquired oliver
 the heavy blow   said the old lady   of losing the dear girl who has so long been my comfort and happiness    oh  god forbid   exclaimed oliver  hastily
 amen to that  my child   said the old lady  wringing her hands
 surely there is no danger of anything so dreadful   said oliver
 two hours ago  she was quite well    she is very ill now   rejoined mrs maylies   and will be worse  i am sure my dear  dear rose  oh  what shall i do without her   she gave way to such great grief  that oliver  suppressing his own emotion  ventured to remonstrate with her  and to beg  earnestly  that  for the sake of the dear young lady herself  she would be more calm
 and consider  ma am   said oliver  as the tears forced themselves into his eyes  despite of his efforts to the contrary  oh  consider how young and good she is  and what pleasure and comfort she gives to all about her
i am sure— certain—quite certain—that  for your sake  who are so good yourself  and for her own  and for the sake of all she makes so happy  she will not die
heaven will never let her die so young    hush   said mrs maylie  laying her hand on oliver s head  you think like a child  poor boy
but you teach me my duty  notwithstanding
i had forgotten it for a moment  oliver  but i hope i may be pardoned  for i am old  and have seen enough of illness and death to know the agony of separation from the objects of our love
i have seen enough  too  to know that it is not always the youngest and best who are spared to those that love them  but this should give us comfort in our sorrow  for heaven is just  and such things teach us  impressively  that there is a brighter world than this  and that the passage to it is speedy
god s will be done  i love her  and he know how well   oliver was surprised to see that as mrs maylie said these words  she checked her lamentations as though by one effort  and drawing herself up as she spoke  became composed and firm he was still more astonished to find that this firmness lasted  and that  under all the care and watching which ensued  mrs maylie was every ready and collected  performing all the duties which had devolved upon her  steadily  and  to all external appearances  even cheerfully but he was young  and did not know what strong minds are capable of  under trying circumstances how should he  when their possessors so seldom know themselves  378 oliver twist an anxious night ensued when morning came  mrs maylie s predictions were but too well verified rose was in the first stage of a high and dangerous fever
 we must be active  oliver  and not give way to useless grief   said mrs maylie  laying her finger on her lip  as she looked steadily into his face   this letter must be sent  with all possible expedition  to mr losberne it must be carried to the market town  which is not more than four miles off  by the footpath across the field  and thence dispatched  by an express on horseback  straight to chertsey
the people at the inn will undertake to do this  and i can trust to you to see it done  i know   oliver could make no reply  but looked his anxiety to be gone at once
 here is another letter   said mrs maylie  pausing to reflect   but whether to send it now  or wait until i see how rose goes on  i scarcely know i would not forward it  unless i feared the worst    is it for chertsey  too  ma am   inquired oliver  impatient to execute his commission  and holding out his trembling hand for the letter
 no   replied the old lady  giving it to him mechanically
oliver glanced at it  and saw that it was directed to harry maylie  esquire  at some great lord s house in the country  where  he could not make out
 shall it go  ma am   asked oliver  looking up  impatiently
 i think not   replied mrs maylie  taking it back  i will wait until to morrow   with these words  she gave oliver her purse  and he started off  without more delay  at the greatest speed he could muster
swiftly he ran across the fields  and down the little lanes which sometimes divided them  now almost hidden by the high corn on either side  and now emerging on an open field  where the mowers and haymakers were busy at their work  nor did he stop once  save now and then  for a few seconds  to recover breath  until he came  in a great heat  and covered with dust  on the little market place of the markettown
here he paused  and looked about for the inn
there were a white bank  and a red brewery  and a yellow town hall  and in one corner there was a large house  with all the wood about it painted green  before which was the sign of  the george   to this he hastened  as soon as it caught his eye
he spoke to a postboy who was dozing under the gateway  and who  after hearing what he wanted  referred him to the ostler  who after hearing all he had to say again  referred him to the landlord  who was a tall gentleman in a blue neckcloth  a white hat  drab breeches  and boots with tops to match  leaning against a pump by the stable door  picking his teeth with a silver toothpick
this gentleman walked with much deliberation into the bar to make out the bill  which took a long time making out  and after it was ready  and paid  a horse had to be saddled  and a man to be dressed  which took up ten good minutes more
meanwhile oliver was in such a desperate state of impatience and anxiety  that he felt as if he could have jumped 380 oliver twist upon the horse himself  and galloped away  full tear  to the next stage at length  all was ready  and the little parcel having been handed up  with many injunctions and entreaties for its speedy delivery  the man set spurs to his horse  and rattling over the uneven paving of the market place  was out of the town  and galloping along the turnpike road  in a couple of minutes
as it was something to feel certain that assistance was sent for  and that no time had been lost  oliver hurried up the inn yard  with a somewhat lighter heart
he was turning out of the gateway when he accidently stumbled against a tall man wrapped in a cloak  who was at that moment coming out of the inn door
 hah   cried the man  fixing his eyes on oliver  and suddenly recoiling
 what the devil s this    i beg your pardon  sir   said oliver   i was in a great hurry to get home  and didn t see you were coming    death   muttered the man to himself  glaring at the boy with his large dark eyes  who would have thought it  grind him to ashes  he d start up from a stone coffin  to come in my way    i am sorry   stammered oliver  confused by the strange man s wild look
 i hope i have not hurt you    rot you   murmured the man  in a horrible passion  between his clenched teeth   if i had only had the courage to say the word  i might have been free of you in a night
curses on your head  and black death on your heart  you imp  what are you doing here   the man shook his fist  as he uttered these words incoherently
he advanced towards oliver  as if with the intention of aiming a blow at him  but fell violently on the ground  writhing and foaming  in a fit
oliver gazed  for a moment  at the struggles of the madman (for such he supposed him to be)  and then darted into the house for help
having seen him safely carried into the hotel  he turned his face homewards  running as fast as he could  to make up for lost time  and recalling with a great deal of astonishment and some fear  the extraordinary behaviour of the person from whom he had just parted
the circumstance did not dwell in his recollection long  however  for when he reached the cottage  there was enough to occupy his mind  and to drive all considerations of self completely from his memory rose maylie had rapidly grown worse  before mid night she was delirious
a medical practitioner  who resided on the spot  was in constant attendance upon her  and after first seeing the patient  he had taken mrs maylie aside  and pronounced her disorder to be one of a most alarming nature  in fact   he said   it would be little short of a miracle  if she recovered   how often did oliver start from his bed that night  and stealing out  with noiseless footstep  to the staircase  listen for the slightest sound from the sick chamber  how often did a tremble shake his frame  and cold drops of terror start upon his brow  when a sudden trampling of feet caused him to fear that something too dreadful to think of  had even then occurred  and what had been the fervency of all 382 oliver twist the prayers he had ever muttered  compared with those he poured forth  now  in the agony and passion of his supplication for the life and health of the gentle creature  who was tottering on the deep grave s verge  oh  the suspense  the fearful  acute suspense  of standing idly by while the life of one we dearly love  is trembling in the balance  oh  the racking thoughts that crowd upon the mind  and make the heart beat violently  and the breath come thick  by the force of the images they conjure up before it  the desperate anxiety to be doing something to relieve the pain  or lessen the danger  which we have no power to alleviate  the sinking of soul and spirit  which the sad remembrance of our helplessness produces  what tortures can equal these  what reflections or endeavours can  in the full tide and fever of the time  allay them  morning came  and the little cottage was lonely and still
people spoke in whispers  anxious faces appeared at the gate  from time to time  women and children went away in tears
all the livelong day  and for hours after it had grown dark  oliver paced softly up and down the garden  raising his eyes every instant to the sick chamber  and shuddering to see the darkened window  looking as if death lay stretched inside late that night  mr losberne arrived
 it is hard   said the good doctor  turning away as he spoke   so young  so much beloved  but there is very little hope   another morning
the sun shone brightly  as brightly as if it looked upon no misery or care  and  with every leaf and flower in full bloom about her  with life  and health  and sounds and sights of joy  surrounding her on every side  the fair young creature lay  wasting fast
oliver crept away to the old churchyard  and sitting down on one of the green mounds  wept and prayed for her  in silence
there was such peace and beauty in the scene  so much of brightness and mirth in the sunny landscape  such blithesome music in the songs of the summer birds  such freedom in the rapid flight of the rook  careering overhead  so much of life and joyousness in all  that  when the boy raised his aching eyes  and looked about  the thought instinctively occurred to him  that this was not a time for death  that rose could surely never die when humbler things were all so glad and gay  that graves were for cold and cheerless winter  not for sunlight and fragrance
he almost thought that shrouds were for the old and shrunken  and that they never wrapped the young and graceful form in their ghastly folds
a knell from the church bell broke harshly on these youthful thoughts
another  again  it was tolling for the funeral service
a group of humble mourners entered the gate  wearing white favours  for the corpse was young
they stood uncovered by a grave  and there was a mother—a mother once—among the weeping train
but the sun shone brightly  and the birds sang on
oliver turned homeward  thinking on the many kindnesses he had received from the young lady  and wishing that the time could come again  that he might never cease showing her how grateful and attached he was
he had no cause for self reproach on the score of neglect  or want of thought  for he had been devoted to her service  and yet a hundred little occasions rose up before him  on which he 384 oliver twist fancied he might have been more zealous  and more earnest  and wished he had been
we need be careful how we deal with those about us  when every death carries to some small circle of survivors  thoughts of so much omitted  and so little done—of so many things forgotten  and so many more which might have been repaired  there is no remorse so deep as that which is unavailing  if we would be spared its tortures  let us remember this  in time
when he reached home mrs maylie was sitting in the little parlour oliver s heart sand at sight of her  for she had never left the bedside of her niece  and he trembled to think what change could have driven her away
he learnt that she had fallen into a deep sleep  from which she would waken  either to recovery and life  or to bid them farewell  and die
they sat  listening  and afraid to speak  for hours
the untasted meal was removed  with looks which showed that their thoughts were elsewhere  they watched the sun as he sank lower and lower  and  at length  cast over sky and earth those brilliant hues which herald his departure
their quick ears caught the sound of an approaching footstep
they both involuntarily darted to the door  as mr losberne entered
 what of rose   cried the old lady
 tell me at once  i can bear it  anything but suspense  oh   tell me  in the name of heaven    you must compose yourself   said the doctor supporting her
 be calm  my dear ma am  pray    let me go  in god s name  my dear child  she is dead  she is dying    no   cried the doctor  passionately
 as he is good and merciful  she will live to bless us all  for years to come   the lady fell upon her knees  and tried to fold her hands together  but the energy which had supported her so long  fled up to heaven with her first thanksgiving  and she sank into the friendly arms which were extended to receive her 386 oliver twist contains some introductory particulars relative to a young gentleman who now arrives upon the scene  and a new adventure which happened to oliver i t was almost too much happiness to bear
oliver felt stunned and stupefied by the unexpected intelligence  he could not weep  or speak  or rest
he had scarcely the power of understanding anything that had passed  until  after a long ramble in the quiet evening air  a burst of tears came to his relief  and he seemed to awaken  all at once  to a full sense of the joyful change that had occurred  and the almost insupportable load of anguish which had been taken from his breast
the night was fast closing in  when he returned homeward  laden with flowers which he had culled  with peculiar care  for the adornment of the sick chamber
as he walked briskly along the road  he heard behind him  the noise of some vehicle  approaching at a furious pace
looking round  he saw that it was a post chaise  driven at great speed  and as the horses were galloping  and the road was narrow  he stood leaning against a gate until it should have passed him
as it dashed on  oliver caught a glimpse of a man in a white nitecap  whose face seemed familiar to him  although his view was so brief that he could not identify the person
in another second or two  the nightcap was thrust out of the chaise window  and a stentorian voice bellowed to the driver to stop  which he did  as soon as he could pull up his horses
then  the nightcap once again appeared  and the same voice called oliver by his name
 here   cried the voice
 oliver  what s the news  miss rose  master o li ver    is is you  giles   cried oliver  running up to the chaisedoor
giles popped out his nightcap again  preparatory to making some reply  when he was suddenly pulled back by a young gentleman who occupied the other corner of the chaise  and who eagerly demanded what was the news
 in a word   cried the gentleman   better or worse   388 oliver twist  better—much better   replied oliver  hastily
 thank heaven   exclaimed the gentleman
 you are sure    quite  sir   replied oliver
 the change took place only a few hours ago  and mr losberne says  that all danger is at an end   the gentleman said not another word  but  opening the chaise door  leaped out  and taking oliver hurriedly by the arm  led him aside
 you are quite certain  there is no possibility of any mistake on your part  my boy  is there   demanded the gentleman in a tremulous voice
 do not deceive me  by awakening hopes that are not to be fulfilled    i would not for the world  sir   replied oliver
 indeed you may believe me
mr losberne s words were  that she would live to bless us all for many years to come
i heard him say so   the tears stood in oliver s eyes as he recalled the scene which was the beginning of so much happiness  and the gentleman turned his face away  and remained silent  for some minutes
oliver thought he heard him sob  more than once  but he feared to interrupt him by any fresh remark— for he could well guess what his feelings were—and so stood apart  feigning to be occupied with his nosegay
all this time  mr giles  with the white nightcap on  had been sitting on the steps of the chaise  supporting an elbow on each knee  and wiping his eyes with a blue cotton pocket handkerchief dotted with white spots
that the honest fellow had not been feigning emotion  was abundently demonstrated by the very red eyes with which he regarded the young gentleman  when he turned round and addressed him
 i think you had better go on to my mother s in the chaise  giles   said he
 i would rather walk slowly on  so as to gain a little time before i see her
you can say i am coming    i beg your pardon  mr harry   said giles  giving a final polish to his ruffled countenance with the handkerchief   but if you would leave the postboy to say that  i should be very much obliged to you
it wouldn t be proper for the maids to see me in this state  sir  i should never have any more authority with them if they did    well   rejoined harry maylie  smiling   you can do as you like
let him go on with the luggage  if you wish it  and do you follow with us
only first exchange that nightcap for some more appropriate covering  or we shall be taken for madmen   mr giles  reminded of his unbecoming costume  snatched off and pocketed his nightcap  and substituted a hat  of grave and sober shape  which he took out of the chaise
this done  the postboy drove off  giles  mr maylie  and oliver  followed at their leisure
as they walked along  oliver glanced from time to time with much interest and curiosity at the new comer
he seemed about five and twenty years of age  and was of the middle height  his countenance was frank and handsome  and his demeanor easy and prepossessing
notwithstanding the difference between youth and age  he bore so strong a likeness to the old lady  that oliver would have had no 390 oliver twist great difficulty in imagining their relationship  if he had not already spoken of her as his mother
mrs maylie was anxiously waiting to receive her son when he reached the cottage the meeting did not take place without great emotion on both sides
 mother   whispered the young man   why did you not write before    i did   replied mrs maylie   but  on reflection  i determined to keep back the letter until i had heard mr losberne s opinion    but why   said the young man   why run the chance of that occurring which so nearly happened  if rose had—i cannot utter that word now—if this illness had terminated differently  how could you ever have forgiven yourself  how could i ever have know happiness again    if that had been the case  harry   said mrs maylie   i fear your happiness would have been effectually blighted  and that your arrival here  a day sooner or a day later  would have been of very  very little import    and who can wonder if it be so  mother   rejoined the young man   or why should i say  if —it is—it is—you know it  mother—you must know it    i know that she deserves the best and purest love the heart of man can offer   said mrs maylie   i know that the devotion and affection of her nature require no ordinary return  but one that shall be deep and lasting if i did not feel this  and know  besides  that a changed behaviour in one she loved would break her heart  i should not feel my task so difficult of performance  or have to encounter so many struggles in my own bosom  when i take what seems to me to be the strict line of duty    this is unkind  mother   said harry  do you still suppose that i am a boy ignorant of my own mind  and mistaking the impulses of my own soul    i think  my dear son   returned mrs maylie  laying her hand upon his shoulder   that youth has many generous impulses which do not last  and that among them are some  which  being gratified  become only the more fleeting above all  i think  said the lady  fixing her eyes on her son s face   that if an enthusiastic  ardent  and ambitious man marry a wife on whose name there is a stain  which  though it originate in no fault of hers  may be visited by cold and sordid people upon her  and upon his children also  and  in exact proportion to his success in the world  be cast in his teeth  and made the subject of sneers against him  he may  no matter how generous and good his nature  one day repent of the connection he formed in early life and she may have the pain of knowing that he does so    mother   said the young man  impatiently   he would be a selfish brute  unworthy alike of the name of man and of the woman you describe  who acted thus    you think so now  harry   replied his mother  and ever will   said the young man
 the mental agony i have suffered  during the last two days  wrings from me the avowal to you of a passion which  as you well know  is not one of yesterday  nor one i have lightly formed
on rose  sweet  gentle girl  my heart is set  as firmly as ever heart of man was set on woman
i have no thought  no view  no 392 oliver twist hope in life  beyond her  and if you oppose me in this great stake  you take my peace and happiness in your hands  and cast them to the wind
mother  think better of this  and of me  and do not disregard the happiness of which you seem to think so little    harry   said mrs maylie   it is because i think so much of warm and sensitive hearts  that i would spare them from being wounded but we have said enough  and more than enough  on this matter  just now    let it rest with rose  then   interposed harry
 you will not press these overstrained opinions of yours  so far  as to throw any obstacle in my way    i will not   rejoined mrs maylie   but i would have you consider—   i have considered   was the impatient reply   mother  i have considered  years and years i have considered  ever since i have been capable of serious reflection
my feelings remain unchanged  as they ever will  and why should i suffer the pain of a delay in giving them vent  which can be productive of no earthly good  no  before i leave this place  rose shall hear me    she shall   said mrs maylie  there is something in your manner  which would almost imply that she will hear me coldly  mother   said the young man
 not coldly   rejoined the old lady   far from it    how then   urged the young man
 she has formed no other attachment    no  indeed   replied his mother   you have  or i mistake  too strong a hold on her affections already
what i would say   resumed the old lady  stopping her son as he was about to speak   is this
before you stake your all on this chance  before you suffer yourself to be carried to the highest point of hope  reflect for a few moments  my dear child  on rose s history  and consider what effect the knowledge of her doubtful birth may have on her decision  devoted as she is to us  with all the intensity of her noble mind  and with that perfect sacrifice of self which  in all matters  great or trifling  has always been her characteristic    what do you mean    that i leave you to discover   replied mrs maylie  i must go back to her
god bless you    i shall see you again to night   said the young man  eagerly
 by and by   replied the lady   when i leave rose    you will tell her i am here   said harry
 of course   replied mrs maylie  and say how anxious i have been  and how much i have suffered  and how i long to see her
you will not refuse to do this  mother    no   said the old lady   i will tell her all   and pressing her son s hand  affectionately  she hastened from the room
mr losberne and oliver had remained at another end of the apartment while this hurried conversation was proceeding
the former now held out his hand to harry maylie  and hearty salutations were exchanged between them
the doctor then communicated  in reply to multifarious questions 394 oliver twist from his young friend  a precise account of his patient s situation  which was quite as consolatory and full of promise  as oliver s statement had encouraged him to hope  and to the whole of which  mr giles  who affected to be busy about the luggage  listened with greedy ears
 have you shot anything particular  lately  giles   inquired the doctor  when he had concluded
 nothing particular  sir   replied mr giles  colouring up to the eyes
 nor catching any thieves  nor identifying any housebreakers   said the doctor
 none at all  sir   replied mr giles  with much gravity
 well   said the doctor   i am sorry to hear it  because you do that sort of thing admirably
pray  how is brittles    the boy is very well  sir   said mr giles  recovering his usual tone of patronage   and sends his respectful duty  sir    that s well   said the doctor
 seeing you here  reminds me  mr giles  that on the day before that on which i was called away so hurriedly  i executed  at the request of your good mistress  a small commission in your favour
just step into this corner a moment  will you   mr giles walked into the corner with much importance  and some wonder  and was honoured with a short whispering conference with the doctor  on the termination of which  he made a great many bows  and retired with steps of unusual stateliness
the subject matter of this conference was not disclosed in the parlour  but the kitchen was speedily enlightened concerning it  for mr giles walked straight thither  and having called for a mug of ale  announced  with an air of majesty  which was highly effective  that it had pleased his mistress  in consideration of his gallant behaviour on the occasion of that attempted robbery  to depost  in the local savings bank  the sum of five and twenty pounds  for his sole use and benefit
at this  the two women servants lifted up their hands and eyes  and supposed that mr giles  pulling out his shirt frill  replied   no  no   and that if they observed that he was at all haughty to his inferiors  he would thank them to tell him so
and then he made a great many other remarks  no less illustrative of his humility  which were received with equal favour and applause  and were  withal  as original and as much to the purpose  as the remarks of great men commonly are
above stairs  the remainder of the evening passed cheerfully away  for the doctor was in high spirits  and however fatigued or thoughtful harry maylie might have been at first  he was not proof against the worthy gentleman s good humour  which displayed itself in a great variety of sallies and professional recollections  and an abundance of small jokes  which struck oliver as being the drollest things he had ever heard  and caused him to laugh proportionately  to the evident satisfaction of the doctor  who laughed immoderately at himself  and made harry laugh almost as heartily  by the very force of sympathy so  they were as pleasant a party as  under the circumstances  they could well have been  and it was late before they retired  with light and thankful hearts  to take that rest of which  after the doubt and suspense they had recently undergone  they stood much in need oliver rose next morning  in better heart  and went about 396 oliver twist his usual occupations  with more hope and pleasure than he had known for many days
the birds were once more hung out  to sing  in their old places  and the sweetest wild flowers that could be found  were once more gathered to gladden rose with their beauty
the melancholy which had seemed to the sad eyes of the anxious boy to hang  for days past  over every object  beautiful as all were  was dispelled by magic
the dew seemed to sparkle more brightly on the green leaves  the air to rustle among them with a sweeter music  and the sky itself to look more blue and bright
such is the influence which the condition of our own thoughts  exercise  even over the appearance of external objects
men who look on nature  and their fellow men  and cry that all is dark and gloomy  are in the right  but the sombre colours are reflections from their own jaundiced eyes and hearts
the real hues are delicate  and need a clearer vision
it is worthy of remark  and oliver did not fail to note it at the time  that his morning expeditions were no longer made alone
harry maylie  after the very first morning when he met oliver coming laden home  was seized with such a passion for flowers  and displayed such a taste in their arrangement  as left his young companion far behind
if oliver were behindhand in these respects  he knew where the best were to be found  and morning after morning they scoured the country together  and brought home the fairest that blossomed
the window of the young lady s chamber was opened now  for she loved to feel the rich summer air stream in  and revive her with its freshness  but there always stood in water  just inside the lattice  one particular little bunch  which was made up with great care  every morning
oliver could not help noticing that the withered flowers were never thrown away  although the little vase was regularly replenished  nor  could he help observing  that whenever the doctor came into the garden  he invariably cast his eyes up to that particular corner  and nodded his head most expressively  as he set forth on his morning s walk
pending these observations  the days were flying by  and rose was rapidly recovering
nor did oliver s time hang heavy on his hands  although the young lady had not yet left her chamber  and there were no evening walks  save now and then  for a short distance  with mrs maylie he applied himself  with redoubled assiduity  to the instructions of the white headed old gentleman  and laboured so hard that his quick progress surprised even himself it was while he was engaged in this pursuit  that he was greatly startled and distressed by a most unexpected occurence
the little room in which he was accustomed to sit  when busy at his books  was on the ground floor  at the back of the house
it was quite a cottage room  with a lattice window  around which were clusters of jessamine and honeysuckle  that crept over the casement  and filled the place with their delicious perfume
it looked into a garden  whence a wicket gate opened into a small paddock  all beyond  was fine meadow land and wood
there was no other dwelling near  in that direction  and the prospect it commanded was very extensive
one beautiful evening  when the first shades of twilight 398 oliver twist were beginning to settle upon the earth  oliver sat at this window  intent upon his books
he had been poring over them for some time  and  as the day had been uncommonly sultry  and he had exerted himself a great deal  it it no disparagement to the authors  whoever they may have been  to say  that gradually and by slow degrees  he fell asleep there is a kind of sleep that steals upon us sometimes  which  while it holds the body prisoner  does not free the mind from a sense of things about it  and enable it to ramble at its pleasure
so far as an overpowering heaviness  a prostration of strength  and an utter inability to control our thoughts or power of motion  can be called sleep  this is it  and yet  we have a consciousness of all that is going on about us  and  if we dream at such a time  words which are really spoken  or sounds which really exist at the moment  accommodate themselves with surprising readiness to our visions  until reality and imagination become so strangely blended that it is afterwards almost matter of impossibility to separate the two nor is this  the most striking phenomenon indcidental to such a state
it is an undoubted fact  that although our senses of touch and sight be for the time dead  yet our sleeping thoughts  and the visionary scenes that pass before us  will be influenced and materially influenced  by the mere silent presence of some external object  which may not have been near us when we closed our eyes  and of whose vicinity we have had no waking consciousness
oliver knew  perfectly well  that he was in his own little room  that his books were lying on the table before him  that the sweet air was stirring among the creeping plants outside
and yet he was asleep
suddenly  the scene changed  the air became close and confined  and he thought  with a glow of terror  that he was in the jew s house again
there sat the hideous old man  in his accustomed corner  pointing at him  and whispering to another man  with his face averted  who sat beside him
 hush  my dear   he thought he heard the jew say   it is he  sure enough
come away    he   the other man seemed to answer   could i mistake him  think you  if a crowd of ghosts were to put themselves into his exact shape  and he stood amongst them  there is something that would tell me how to point him out if you buried him fifty feet deep  and took me across his grave  i fancy i should know  if there wasn t a mark above it  that he lay buried there   the man seemed to say this  with such dreadful hatred  that oliver awoke with the fear  and started up
good heaven  what was that  which sent the blood tingling to his heart  and deprived him of his voice  and of power to move  there—there—at the window—close before him—so close  that he could have almost touched him before he started back  with his eyes peering into the room  and meeting his  there stood the jew  and beside him  white with rage or fear  or both  were the scowling features of the man who had accosted him in the inn yard
it was but an instant  a glance  a flash  before his eyes  and they were gone
but they had recognised him  and he them  and their look was as firmly impressed upon his 400 oliver twist memory  as if it had been deeply carved in stone  and set before him from his birth
he stood transfixed for a moment  then  leaping from the window into the garden  called loudly for help
containing the unsatisfactory result of oliver s adventure  and a conversation of some importance between harry maylie and rose when the inmates of the house  attracted by oliver s cries  hurried to the spot from which they proceeded  they found him  pale and agitated  pointing in the direction of the meadows behind the house  and scarcely able to articulate the words   the jew  the jew   mr giles was at a loss to comprehend what this outcry meant  but harry maylie  whose perceptions were something quicker  and who had heard oliver s history from his 402 oliver twist mother  understood it at once
 what direction did he take   he asked  catching up a heavy stick which was standing in a corner
 that   replied oliver  pointing out the course the man had taken   i missed them in an instant    then  they are in the ditch   said harry
 follow  and keep as near me  as you can   so saying  he sprang over the hedge  and darted off with a speed which rendered it matter of exceeding difficulty for the others to keep near him
giles followed as well as he could  and oliver followed too  and in the course of a minute or two  mr losberne  who had been out walking  and just then returned  tumbled over the hedge after them  and picking himself up with more agility than he could have been supposed to possess  struck into the same course at no contemptible speed  shouting all the while  most prodigiously  to know what was the matter on they all went  nor stopped they once to breathe  until the leader  striking off into an angle of the field indicated by oliver  began to search  narrowly  the ditch and hedge adjoining  which afforded time for the remainder of the party to come up  and for oliver to communicate to mr losberne the circumstances that had led to so vigorous a pursuit the search was all in vain
there were not even the traces of recent footsteps  to be seen
they stood now  on the summit of a little hill  commanding the open fields in every direction for three or four miles
there was the village in the hollow on the left  but  in order to gain that  after pursuing the track oliver had pointed out  the men must have made a circuit of open ground  which it was impossible they could have accomplished in so short a time
a thick wood skirted the meadow land in another direction  but they could not have gained that covert for the same reason
 it must have been a dream  oliver   said harry maylie
 oh no  indeed  sir   replied oliver  shuddering at the very recollection of the old wretch s countenance   i saw him too plainly for that i saw them both  as plainly as i see you now    who was the other   inquired harry and mr losberne  together
 the very same man i told you of  who came so suddenly upon me at the inn   said oliver
 we had our eyes fixed full upon each other  and i could swear to him    they took this way   demanded harry   are you sure    as i am that the men were at the window   replied oliver  pointing down  as he spoke  to the hedge which divided the cottage garden from the meadow
 the tall man leaped over  just there  and the jew  running a few paces to the right  crept through that gap   the two gentlemen watched oliver s earnest face  as he spoke  and looking from him to each other  seemed to fell satisfied of the accuracy of what he said
still  in no direction were there any appearances of the trampling of men in hurried flight
the grass was long  but it was trodden down nowhere  save where their own feet had crushed it
the sides and brinks of the ditches were of damp clay  but in no one place could they discern the print of men s shoes  or the slightest mark which would indicate that any feet had 404 oliver twist pressed the ground for hours before
 this is strange   said harry
 strange   echoed the doctor
 blathers and duff  themselves  could make nothing of it   notwithstanding the evidently useless nature of their search  they did not desist until the coming on of night rendered its further prosecution hopeless  and even then  they gave it up with reluctance giles was dispatched to the different ale houses in the village  furnished with the best description oliver could give of the appearance and dress of the strangers
of these  the jew was  at all events  sufficiently remarkable to be remembered  supposing he had been seen drinking  or loitering about  but giles returned without any intelligence  calculated to dispel or lessen the mystery
on the next day  fresh search was made  and the inquiries renewed  but with no better success
on the day following  oliver and mr maylie repaired to the market town  in the hope of seeing or hearing something of the men there  but this effort was equally fruitless
after a few days  the affair began to be forgotten  as most affairs are  when wonder  having no fresh food to support it  dies away of itself
meanwhile  rose was rapidly recovering
she had left her room  was able to go out  and mixing once more with the family  carried joy into the hearts of all
but  although this happy change had a visible effect on the little circle  and although cheerful voices and merry laughter were once more heard in the cottage  there was at times  an unwonted restraint upon some there  even upon rose herself  which oliver could not fail to remark
mrs maylie and her son were often closeted together for a long time  and more than once rose appeared with traces of tears upon her face after mr losberne had fixed a day for his departure to chertsey  these symptoms increased  and it became evident that something was in progress which affected the peace of the young lady  and of somebody else besides at length  one morning  when rose was alone in the breakfast parlour  harry maylie entered  and  with some hesitation  begged permission to speak with her for a few moments
 a few—a very few—will suffice  rose   said the young man  drawing his chair towards her
 what i shall have to say  has already presented itself to your mind  the most cherished hopes of my heart are not unknown to you  though from my lips you have not heard them stated   rose had been very pale from the moment of his entrance  but that might have been the effect of her recent illness
she merely bowed  and bending over some plants that stood near  waited in silence for him to proceed
 i—i—ought to have left here  before   said harry
 you should  indeed   replied rose
 forgive me for saying so  but i wish you had    i was brought here  by the most dreadful and agonising of all apprehensions   said the young man   the fear of losing the one dear being on whom my every wish and hope are fixed
you had been dying  trembling between earth and heaven
we know that when the young  the beautiful  and 406 oliver twist good  are visited with sickness  their pure spirits insensibly turn towards their bright home of lasting rest  we know  heaven help us  that the best and fairest of our kind  too often fade in blooming   there were tears in the eyes of the gentle girl  as these words were spoken  and when one fell upon the flower over which she bent  and glistened brightly in its cup  making it more beautiful  it seemed as though the outpouring of her fresh young heart  claimed kindred naturally  with the loveliest things in nature
 a creature   continued the young man  passionately   a creature as fair and innocent of guile as one of god s own angels  fluttered between life and death
oh  who could hope  when the distant world to which she was akin  half opened to her view  that she would return to the sorrow and calamity of this  rose  rose  to know that you were passing away like some soft shadow  which a light from above  casts upon the earth  to have no hope that you would be spared to those who linger here  hardly to know a reason why you should be  to feel that you belonged to that bright sphere whither so many of the fairest and the best have winged their early flight  and yet to pray  amid all these consolations  that you might be restored to those who loved you—these were distractions almost too great to bear
they were mine  by day and night  and with them  came such a rushing torrent of fears  and apprehensions  and selfish regrets  lest you should die  and never know how devotedly i loved you  as almost bore down sense and reason in its course
you recovered
day by day  and almost hour by hour  some drop of health came back  and mingling with the spent and feeble stream of life which circulated languidly within you  swelled it again to a high and rushing tide
i have watched you change almost from death  to life  with eyes that turned blind with their eagerness and deep affection
do not tell me that you wish i had lost this  for it has softened my heart to all mankind    i did not mean that   said rose  weeping   i only wish you had left here  that you might have turned to high and noble pursuits again  to pursuits well worthy of you    there is no pursuit more worthy of me  more worthy of the highest nature that exists  than the struggle to win such a heart as yours   said the young man  taking her hand
 rose  my own dear rose  for years—for years—i have loved you  hoping to win my way to fame  and then come proudly home and tell you it had been pursued only for you to share  thinking  in my daydreams  how i would remind you  in that happy moment  of the many silent tokens i had given of a boy s attachment  and claim your hand  as in redemption of some old mute contract that had been sealed between us  that time has not arrived  but here  with not fame won  and no young vision realised  i offer you the heart so long your own  and stake my all upon the words with which you greet the offer    your behaviour has ever been kind and noble   said rose  mastering the emotions by which she was agitated  as you believe that i am not insensible or ungrateful  so hear my answer    it is  that i may endeavour to deserve you  it is  dear 408 oliver twist rose    it is   replied rose   that you must endeavour to forget me  not as your old and dearly attached companion  for that would wound me deeply  but  as the object of your love
look into the world  think how many hearts you would be proud to gain  are there
confide some other passion to me  if you will  i will be the truest  warmest  and most faithful friend you have   there was a pause  during which  rose  who had covered her face with one hand  gave free vent to her tears
harry still retained the other
 and your reasons  rose   he said  at length  in a low voice   your reasons for this decision    you have a right to know them   rejoined rose
 you can say nothing to alter my resolution
it is a duty that i must perform
i owe it  alike to others  and to myself    to yourself    yes  harry
i owe it to myself  that i  a friendless  portionless  girl  with a blight upon my name  should not give your friends reason to suspect that i had sordidly yielded to your first passion  and fastened myself  a clog  on all your hopes and projects
i owe it to you and yours  to prevent you from opposing  in the warmth of your generous nature  this great obstacle to your progress in the world    if your inclinations chime with your sense of duty—  harry began
 they do not   replied rose  colouring deeply
 then you return my love   said harry
 say but that  dear rose  say but that  and soften the bitterness of this hard disappointment    if i could have done so  without doing heavy wrong to him i loved   rejoined rose   i could have—   have received this declaration very differently   said harry
 do not conceal that from me  at least  rose    i could   said rose
 stay   she added  disengaging her hand   why should we prolong this painful interview  most painful to me  and yet productive of lasting happiness  notwithstanding  for it will be happiness to know that i once held the high place in your regard which i now occupy  and every triumph you achieve in life will animate me with new fortitude and firmness
farewell  harry  as we have met today  we meet no more  but in other relations than those in which this conversation have placed us  we may be long and happily entwined  and may every blessing that the prayers of a true and earnest heart can call down from the source of all truth and sincerity  cheer and prosper you    another word  rose   said harry
 your reason in your own words
from your own lips  let me hear it    the prospect before you   answered rose  firmly   is a brilliant one
all the honours to which great talents and powerful connections can help men in public life  are in store for you
but those connections are proud  and i will neither mingle with such as may hold in scorn the mother who gave me life  nor bring disgrace or failure on the son of her who has so well supplied that mother s place
in a word   said the young lady  turning away  as her temporary firmness forsook her   there is a stain upon my name  which the world visits on innocent heads
i will carry it into no blood 410 oliver twist but my own  and the reproach shall rest alone on me    one word more  rose
dearest rose  one more   cried harry  throwing himself before her  if i had been less—less fortunate  the world would call it—if some obscure and peaceful life had been my destiny—if i had been poor  sick  helpless—would you have turned from me then  or has my probable advancement to riches and honour  given this scruple birth    do not press me to reply   answered rose
 the question does not arise  and never will
it is unfair  almost unkind  to urge it    if your answer be what i almost dare to hope it is   retorted harry   it will shed a gleam of happiness upon my lonely way  and light the path before me
it is not an idle thing to do so much  by the utterance of a few brief words  for one who loves you beyond all else
oh  rose  in the name of my ardent and enduring attachment  in the name of all i have suffered for you  and all you doom me to undergo  answer me this one question    then  if your lot had been differently cast   rejoined rose   if you had been even a little  but not so far  above me  if i could have been a help and comfort to you in any humble scene of peace and retirement  and not a blot and drawback in ambitious and distinguished crowds  i should have been spared this trial
i have every reason to be happy  very happy  now  but then  harry  i own i should have been happier   busy recollections of old hopes  cherished as a girl  long ago  crowded into the mind of rose  while making this avowal  but they brought tears with them  as old hopes will when they come back withered  and they relieved her
 i cannot help this weakness  and it makes my purpose stronger   said rose  extending her hand
 i must leave you now  indeed    i ask one promise   said harry
 once  and only once more —say within a year  but it may be much sooner —i may speak to you again on this subject  for the last time    not to press me to alter my right determination   replied rose  with a melancholy smile   it will be useless    no   said harry   to hear you repeat it  if you will—finally repeat it  i will lay at your feet  whatever of station of fortune i may possess  and if you still adhere to your present resolution  will not seek  by word or act  to change it    then let it be so   rejoined rose   it is but one pang the more  and by that time i may be enabled to bear it better   she extended her hand again
but the young man caught her to his bosom  and imprinting one kiss on her beautiful forehead  hurried from the room
412 oliver twist is a very short one  and may appear of no great importance in its place  but it should be read notwithstanding  as a sequel to the last  and a key to one that will follow when its time arrives  and so you are resolved to be my travelling companion this morning  eh   said the doctor  as harry maylie joined him and oliver at the breakfast table
 why  you are not in the same mind or intention two half hours together    you will tell me a different tale one of these days   said harry  colouring without any perceptible reason
 i hope i may have good cause to do so   replied mr losberne   though i confess i don t think i shall
but yesterday morning you had made up your mind  in a great hurry  to stay here  and to accompany your mother  like a dutiful son  to the sea side
before noon  you announce that you are going to do me the honour of accompanying me as far as i go  on your road to london
and at night  you urge me  with great mystery  to start before the ladies are stirring  the consequence of which is  that young oliver here is pinned down to his breakfast when he ought to be ranging the meadows after botanical phenomena of all kinds
too bad  isn t it  oliver    i should have been very sorry not to have been at home when you and mr maylie went away  sir   rejoined oliver
 that s a fine fellow   said the doctor   you shall come and see me when you return
but  to speak seriously  harry  has any communication from the great nobs produced this sudden anxiety on your part to be gone    the great nobs   replied harry   under which designation  i presume  you include my most stately uncle  have not communicated with me at all  since i have been here  nor  at this time of the year  is it likely that anything would occur to render necessary my immediate attendance among them    well   said the doctor   you are a queer fellow
but of course they will get you into parliament at the election before christmas  and these sudden shiftings and changes are 414 oliver twist no bad preparation for political life
there s something in that
good training is always desirable  whether the race be for place  cup  or sweepstakes   harry maylie looked as if he could have followed up this short dialogue by one or two remarks that would have staggered the doctor not a little  but he contented himself with saying   we shall see   and pursued the subject no farther the post chaise drove up to the door shortly afterwards  and giles coming in for the luggage  the good doctor bustled out  to see it packed
 oliver   said harry maylie  in a low voice   let me speak a word with you   oliver walked into the window recess to which mr maylie beckoned him  much surprised at the mixture of sadness and boisterous spirits  which his whole behaviour displayed
 you can write well now   said harry  laying his hand upon his arm
 i hope so  sir   replied oliver
 i shall not be at home again  perhaps for some time  i wish you would write to me—say once a fort night  every alternate monday  to the general post office in london
will you    oh  certainly  sir  i shall be proud to do it   exclaimed oliver  greatly delighted with the commission
 i should like to know how—how my mother and miss maylie are   said the young man   and you can fill up a sheet by telling me what walks you take  and what you talk about  and whether she—they  i mean—seem happy and quite well
you understand me    oh  quite  sir  quite   replied oliver
 i would rather you did not mention it to them   said harry  hurrying over his words   because it might make my mother anxious to write to me oftener  and it is a trouble and worry to her
let is be a secret between you and me  and mind you tell me everything  i depend upon you   oliver  quite elated and honoured by a sense of his importance  faithfully promised to be secret and explicit in his communications
mr maylie took leave of him  with many assurances of his regard and protection
the doctor was in the chaise  giles (who  it had been arranged  should be left behind) held the door open in his hand  and the women servants were in the garden  looking on
harry cast one slight glance at the latticed window  and jumped into the carriage
 drive on   he cried   hard  fast  full gallop  nothing short of flying will keep pace with me  to day    halloa   cried the doctor  letting down the front glass in a great hurry  and shouting to the postillion   something very short of flyng will keep pace with me
do you hear   jingling and clattering  till distance rendered its noise inaudible  and its rapid progress only perceptible to the eye  the vehicle wound its way along the road  almost hidden in a cloud of dust  now wholly disappearing  and now becoming visible again  as intervening objects  or the intricacies of the way  permitted
it was not until even the dusty cloud was no longer to be seen  that the gazers dispersed
and there was one looker on  who remained with eyes 416 oliver twist fixed upon the spot where the carriage had disappeared  long after it was many miles away  for  behind the white curtain which had shrouded her from view when harry raised his eyes towards the window  sat rose herself
 he seems in high spirits and happy   she said  at length  i feared for a time he might be otherwise
i was mistaken
i am very  very glad   tears are signs of gladness as well as grief  but those which coursed down rose s face  as she sat pensively at the window  still gazing in the same direction  seemed to tell more of sorrow than of joy
in which the reader may perceive a contrast  not uncommon in matrimonial cases mr bumble sat in the workhouse parlour  with his eyes moodily fixed on the cheerless grate  whence  as it was summer time  no brighter gleam proceeded  than the reflection of certain sickly rays of the sun  which were sent back from its cold and shining surface
a paper fly cage dangled from the ceiling  to which he occasionally raised his eyes in gloomy thought  and  as the heedless insects hovered round the gaudy net work  mr bumble would heave a deep sigh  while a more gloomy shadow overspread his countenance
mr bumble was meditating  it might be that the insects brought to mind  some painful passage in his own past life
nor was mr bumble s gloom the only thing calculated 418 oliver twist to awaken a pleasing melancholy in the bosom of a spectator
there were not wanting other appearances  and those closely connected with his own person  which announced that a great change had taken place in the position of his affairs
the laced coat  and the cocked hat  where were they  he still wore knee breeches  and dark cotton stockings on his nether limbs  but they were not the breeches
the coat was wide skirted  and in that respect like the coat  but  oh how different  the mighty cocked hat was replaced by a modest round one
mr bumble was no longer a beadle
there are some promotions in life  which  independent of the more substantial rewards they offer  require peculiar value and dignity from the coats and waistcoats connected with them
a field marshal has his uniform  a bishop his silk apron  a counsellor his silk gown  a beadle his cocked hat
strip the bishop of his apron  or the beadle of his hat and lace  what are they  men
mere men
dignity  and even holiness too  sometimes  are more questions of coat and waistcoat than some people imagine
mr bumle had married mrs corney  and was master of the workhouse another beadle had come into power
on him the cocked hat  gold laced coat  and staff  had all three descended
 and to morrow two months it was done   said mr bumble  with a sigh
 it seems a age   mr bumble might have meant that he had concentrated a whole existence of happiness into the short space of eight weeks  but the sigh—there was a vast deal of meaning in the sigh  i sold myself   said mr bumble  pursuing the same train of relection   for six teaspoons  a pair of sugar tongs  and a milk pot  with a small quantity of second hand furniture  and twenty pound in money
i went very reasonable
cheap  dirt cheap    cheap   cried a shrill voice in mr bumble s ear   you would have been dear at any price  and dear enough i paid for you  lord above knows that   mr bumble turned  and encountered the face of his interesting consort  who  imperfectly comprehending the few words she had overheard of his complaint  had hazarded the foregoing remark at a venture
 mrs bumble  ma am   said mr bumble  with a sentimental sternness  well   cried the lady
 have the goodness to look at me   said mr bumble  fixing his eyes upon her
(if she stands such a eye as that   said mr bumble to himself   she can stand anything it is a eye i never knew to fail with paupers
if it fails with her  my power is gone  ) whether an exceedingly small expansion of eye be sufficient to quell paupers  who  being lightly fed  are in no very high condition  or whether the late mrs corney was particularly proof against eagle glances  are matters of opinion the matter of fact  is  that the matron was in no way overpowered by mr bumble s scowl  but  on the contrary  treated it with great disdain  and even raised a laugh threreat  which sounded as though it were genuine
on hearing this most unexpected sound  mr bumble 420 oliver twist looked  first incredulous  and afterwards amazed
he then relapsed into his former state  nor did he rouse himself until his attention was again awakened by the voice of his partner  are you going to sit snoring there  all day   inquired mrs bumble  i am going to sit here  as long as i think proper  ma am   rejoined mr bumble   and although i was not snoring  i shall snore  gape  sneeze  laugh  or cry  as the humour strikes me  such being my prerogative    your prerogative   sneered mrs bumble  with ineffable contempt  i said the word  ma am   said mr bumble
 the prerogative of a man is to command    and what s the prerogative of a woman  in the name of goodness   cried the relict of mr corney deceased
 to obey  ma am   thundered mr bumble
 your late unfortunate husband should have taught it you  and then  perhaps  he might have been alive now
i wish he was  poor man   mrs bumble  seeing at a glance  that the decisive moment had now arrived  and that a blow struck for the mastership on one side or other  must necessarily be final and conclusive  no sooner heard this allusion to the dead and gone  than she dropped into a chair  and with a loud scream that mr bumble was a hard hearted brute  fell into a paroxysm of tears but  tears were not the things to find their way to mr bumble s soul  his heart was waterproof
like washable beaver hats that improve with rain  his nerves were rendered stouter and more vigorous  by showers of tears  which  being tokens of weakness  and so far tacit admissions of his own power  please and exalted him
he eyed his good lady with looks of great satisfaction  and begged  in an encouraging manner  that she should cry her hardest  the exercise being looked upon  by the faculty  as stronly conducive to health
 it opens the lungs  washes the countenance  exercises the eyes  and softens down the temper   said mr bumble
 so cry away   as he discharged himself of this pleasantry  mr bumble took his hat from a peg  and putting it on  rather rakishly  on one side  as a man might  who felt he had asserted his superiority in a becoming manner  thrust his hands into his pockets  and sauntered towards the door  with much ease and waggishness depicted in his whole appearance now  mrs corney that was  had tried the tears  because they were less troublesome than a manual assault  but  she was quite prepared to make trial of the latter mode of proceeding  as mr bumble was not long in discovering the first proof he experienced of the fact  was conveyed in a hollow sound  immediately succeeded by the sudden flying off of his hat to the opposite end of the room
this preliminary proceeding laying bare his head  the expert lady  clasping him tightly round the throat with one hand  inflicted a shower of blows (dealt with singular vigour and dexterity) upon it with the other
this done  she created a little variety by scratching his face  and tearing his hair  422 oliver twist and  having  by this time  inflicted as much punishment as she deemed necessary for the offence  she pushed him over a chair  which was luckily well situated for the purpose  and defied him to talk about his prerogative again  if he dared
 get up   said mrs bumble  in a voice of command  and take yourself away from here  unless you want me to do something desperate   mr bumble rose with a very rueful countenance  wondering much what something desperate might be
picking up his hat  he looked towards the door
 are you going   demanded mr bumble
 certainly  my dear  certainly   rejoined mr bumble  making a quicker motion towards the door
 i didn t intend to—i m going  my dear  you are so very violent  that really i—  at this instant  mrs bumble stepped hastily forward to replace the carpet  which had been kicked up in the scuffle mr bumble immediately darted out of the room  without bestowing another thought on his unfinished sentence  leaving the late mrs corney in full possession of the field mr bumble was fairly taken by surprise  and fairly beaten
he had a decided propensity for bullying  derived no inconsiderable pleasure from the exercise of petty cruelty  and  consequently  was (it is needless to say) a coward
this is by no means a disparagement to his character  for many official personages  who are held in high respect and admiration  are the victims of similar infirmities the remark is made  indeed  rather in his favour than otherwise  and with a view of impressing the reader with a just sense of his qualifications for office
but  the measure of his degradation was not yet full
after making a tour of the house  and thinking  for the first time  that the poor laws really were too hard on people  and that men who ran away from their wives  leaving them chargeable to the parish  ought  in justice to be visited with no punishment at all  but rather rewarded as meritorious individuals who had suffered much  mr bumble came to a room where some of the female paupers were usually employed in washing the parish linen  when the sound of voices in conversation  now proceeded
 hem   said mr bumble  summoning up all his native dignity
 these women at least shall continue to respect the prerogative
hallo  hallo there  what do you mean by this noise  you hussies   with these words  mr bumble opened the door  and walked in with a very fierce and angry manner  which was at once exchanged for a most humiliated and cowering air  as his eyes unexpectedly rested on the form of his lady wife
 my dear   said mr bumble   i didn t know you were here    didn t know i was here   repeated mrs bumble  what do you do here    i thought they were talking rather too much to be doing their work properly  my dear   replied mr bumble  glancing distractedly at a couple of old women at the wash tub  who were comparing notes of admiration at the workhousemaster s humility
 you thought they were talking too much   said mrs 424 oliver twist bumble  what business is it of yours    why  my dear—  urged mr bumble submissively
 what business is it of yours   demanded mrs bumble  again  it s very true  you re matron here  my dear   submitted mr bumble   but i thought you mightn t be in the way just then    i ll tell you what  mr bumble   returned his lady
 we don t want any of your interference
you re a great deal too fond of poking your nose into things that don t concern you  making everybody in the house laugh  the moment your back is turned  and making yourself look like a fool every hour in the day
be off  come   mr bumble  seeing with excruciating feelings  the delight of the two old paupers  who were tittering together most rapturously  hesitated for an instant
mrs bumble  whose patience brooked no delay  caught up a bowl of soapsuds  and motioning him towards the door  ordered him instantly to depart  on pain of receiving the contents upon his portly person what could mr bumble do  he looked dejectedly round  and slunk away  and  as he reached the door  the titterings of the paupers broke into a shrill chuckle of irrepressible delight
it wanted but this
he was degraded in their eyes  he had lost caste and station before the very paupers  he had fallen from all the height and pomp of beadleship  to the lowest depth of the most snubbed hen peckery
 all in two months   said mr bumble  filled with dismal thoughts
 two months  no more than two months ago  i was not only my own master  but everybody else s  so far as the porochial workhouse was concerned  and now —  it was too much
mr bumble boxed the ears of the boy who opened the gate for him (for he had reached the portal in his reverie)  and walked  distractedly  into the street
he walked up one street  and down another  until exercise had abated the first passion of his grief  and then the revulsion of feeling made him thirsty
he passed a great many public houses  but  at length paused before one in a by way  whose parlour  as he gathered from a hasty peep over the blinds  was deserted  save by one solitary customer
it began to rain  heavily  at the moment
this determined him
mr bumble stepped in  and ordering something to drink  as he passed the bar  entered the apartment into which he had looked from the street
the man who was seated there  was tall and dark  and wore a large cloak
he had the air of a stranger  and seemed  by a certain haggardness in his look  as well as by the dusty soils on his dress  to have travelled some distance
he eyed bumble askance  as he entered  but scarcely deigned to nod his head in acknowledgment of his salutation
mr bumble had quite dignity enough for two  supposing even that the stranger had been more familiar  so he drank his gin and water in silence  and read the paper with great show of pomp and circumstance it so happened  however  as it will happen very often  when men fall into company under such circumstances  that mr bumble felt  every now and then  a powerful inducement  which he could not resist  to steal a look at the 426 oliver twist stranger  and that whenever he did so  he withdrew his eyes  in some confusion  to find that the stranger was at that moment stealing a look at him mr bumble s awkwardness was enhanced by the very remarkable expression of the stranger s eye  which was keen and bright  but shadowed by a scowl of distrust and suspicion  unlike anything he had ever observed before  and repulsive to behold
when they had encountered each other s glance several times in this way  the stranger  in a harsh  deep voice  broke silence
 were you looking for me   he said   when you peered in at the window    not that i am aware of  unless you re mr —  here mr bumble stopped short  for he was curious to know the stranger s name  and thought in his impatience  he might supply the blank
 i see you were not   said the stranger  and expression of quiet sarcasm playing about his mouth   or you have known my name
you don t know it
i would recommend you not to ask for it    i meant no harm  young man   observed mr bumble  majestically
 and have done none   said the stranger
another silence succeeded this short dialogue  which was again broken by the stranger
 i have seen you before  i think   said he
 you were differently dressed at that time  and i only passed you in the street  but i should know you again
you were beadle here  once  were you not    i was   said mr bumble  in some surprise   porochial beadle    just so   rejoined the other  nodding his head
 it was in that character i saw you
what are you now    master of the workhouse   rejoined mr bumble  slowly and impressively  to check any undue familiarity the stranger might otherwise assume
 master of the workhouse  young man    you have the same eye to your own interest  that you always had  i doubt not   resumed the stranger  looking keenly into mr bumble s eyes  as he raised them in astonishment at the question
 don t scruple to answer freely  man
i know you pretty well  you see    i suppose  a married man   replied mr bumble  shading his eyes with his hand  and surveying the stranger  from head to foot  in evident perplexity   is not more averse to turning an honest penny when he can  than a single one
porochial officers are not so well paid that they can afford to refuse any little extra fee  when it comes to them in a civil and proper manner   the stranger smiled  and nodded his head again  as much to say  he had not mistaken his man  then rang the bell
 fill this glass again   he said  handing mr bumble s empty tumbler to the landlord
 let it be strong and hot
you like it so  i suppose    not too strong   replied mr bumble  with a delicate cough
 you understand what that means  landlord   said the 428 oliver twist stranger  drily
the host smiled  disappeared  and shortly afterwards returned with a steaming jorum  of which  the first gulp brought the water into mr bumble s eyes
 now listen to me   said the stranger  after closing the door and window
 i came down to this place  to day  to find you out  and  by one of those chances which the devil throws in the way of his friends sometimes  you walked into the very room i was sitting in  while you were uppermost in my mind
i want some information from you
i don t ask you to give it for mothing  slight as it is
put up that  to begin with   as he spoke  he pushed a couple of sovereigns across the table to his companion  carefully  as though unwilling that the chinking of money should be heard without
when mr bumble had scrupulously examined the coins  to see that they were genuine  and had put them up  with much satisfaction  in his waistcoat pocket  he went on   carry your memory back—let me see—twelve years  last winter    it s a long time   said mr bumble
 very good
i ve done it    the scene  the workhouse    good    and the time  night    yes    and the place  the crazy hole  wherever it was  in which miserable drabs brought forth the life and health so often denied to themselves—gave birth to puling children for the parish to rear  and hid their shame  rot  em in the grave    the lying in room  i suppose   said mr bumble  not quite following the stranger s excited description  yes   said the stranger
 a boy was born there    a many boys   observed mr bumble  shaking his head  despondingly
 a murrain on the young devils   cried the stranger   i speak of one  a meek looking  pale faced boy  who was apprenticed down here  to a coffin maker—i wish he had made his coffin  and screwed his body in it—and who afterwards ran away to london  as it was supposed
 why  you mean oliver  young twist   said mr bumble   i remember him  of course
there wasn t a obstinater young rascal—   it s not of him i want to hear  i ve heard enough of him   said the stranger  stopping mr bumble in the outset of a tirade on the subject of poor oliver s vices
 it s of a woman  the hag that nursed his mother
where is she    where is she   said mr bumble  whom the gin and water had rendered facetious
 it would be hard to tell
there s no midwifery there  whichever place she s gone to  so i suppose she s out of employment  anyway    what do you mean   demanded the stranger  sternly
 that she died last winter   rejoined mr bumble
the man looked fixedly at him when he had given this information  and although he did not withdraw his eyes for some time afterwards  his gaze gradually became vacant and abstracted  and he seemed lost in thought
for some time  he appeared doubtful whether he ought to be relieved or 430 oliver twist disappointed by the intelligence  but at length he breathed more freely  and withdrawing his eyes  observed that it was no great matter
with that he rose  as if to depart
but mr bumble was cunning enough  and he at once saw that an opportunity was opened  for the lucrative disposal of some secret in the possession of his better half
he well remembered the night of old sally s death  which the occurrences of that day had given him good reason to recollect  as the occasion on which he had proposed to mrs corney  and although that lady had never confided to him the disclosure of which she had been the solitary witness  he had heard enough to know that it related to something that had occurred in the old woman s attendance  as workhouse nurse  upon the young mother of oliver twist hastily calling this circumstance to mind  he informed the stranger  with an air of mystery  that one woman had been closeted with the old harridan shortly before she died  and that she could  as he had reason to believe  throw some light on the subject of his inquiry  how can i find her   said the stranger  thrown off his guard  and plainly showing that all his fears (whatever they were) were aroused afresh by the intelligence
 only through me   rejoined mr bumble
 when   cried the stranger  hastily
 to morrow   rejoined bumble
 at nine in the evening   said the stranger  producing a scrap of paper  and writing down upon it  an obscure address by the water side  in characters that betrayed his agitation   at nine in the evening  bring her to me there
i needn t tell you to be secret
it s your interest   with these words  he led the way to the door  after stopping to pay for the liquor that had been drunk
shortly remarking that their roads were different  he departed  without more ceremony than an emphatic repetition of the hour of appointment for the following night
on glancing at the address  the parochial functionary observed that it contained no name
the stranger had not gone far  so he made after him to ask it
 what do you want   cried the man
turning quickly round  as bumble touched him on the arm
 following me    only to ask a question   said the other  pointing to the scrap of paper
 what name am i to ask for    monks   rejoined the man  and strode hastily  away
432 oliver twist containing an account of what passed between mr and mrs bumble  and mr monks  at their nocturnal interview i t was a dull  close  overcast summer evening the clouds  which had been threatening all day  spread out in a dense and sluggish mass of vapour  already yielded large drops of rain  and seemed to presage a violent thunder storm  when mr and mrs bumble  turning out of the main street of the town  directed their course towards a scattered little colony of ruinous houses  distant from it some mile and a half  or thereabouts  and erected on a low unwholesome swamp  bordering upon the river they were both wrapped in old and shabby outer garments  which might  perhaps  serve the double purpose of protecting their persons from the rain  and sheltering them from observation
the husband carried a lantern  from which  however  no light yet shone  and trudged on  a few paces in front  as though—the way being dirty—to give his wife the benefit of treading in his heavy footprints
they went on  in profound silence  every now and then  mr bumble relaxed his pace  and turned his head as if to make sure that his helpmate was following  then  discovering that she was close at his heels  he mended his rate of walking  and proceeded  at a considerable increase of speed  towards their place of destination
this was far from being a place of doubtful character  for it had long been known as the residence of none but low ruffians  who  under various pretences of living by their labour  subsisted chiefly on plunder and crime
it was a collection of mere hovels  some  hastily built with loose bricks  others  of old worm eaten ship timber  jumbled together without any attempt at order or arrangement  and planted  for the most part  within a few feet of the river s bank
a few leaky boats drawn up on the mud  and made fast to the dwarf wall which skirted it  and here and there an oar or coil of rope  appeared  at first  to indicate that the inhabitants of these miserable cottages pursued some avocation on the river  but a glance at the shattered and useless condition of the articles thus displayed  would have led a passer by  without much difficulty  to the conjecture that they were disposed there  rather for the preservation of appearances  than with any view to their being actually employed
434 oliver twist in the heart of this cluster of huts  and skirting the river  which its upper stories overhung  stood a large building  formerly used as a manufactory of some kind
it had  in its day  probably furnished employment to the inhabitants of the surrounding tenements
but it had long since gone to ruin
the rat  the worm  and the action of the damp  had weakened and rotted the piles on which it stood  and a considerable portion of the building had already sunk down into the water  while the remainder  tottering and bending over the dark stream  seemed to wait a favourable opportunity of following its old companion  and involving itself in the same fate
it was before this ruinous building that the worthy couple paused  as the first peal of distant thunder reverberated in the air  and the rain commenced pouring violently down
 the place should be somewhere here   said bumble  consulting a scrap of paper he held in his hand
 halloa there   cried a voice from above
following the sound  mr bumble raised his head and descried a man looking out of a door  breast high  on the second story
 stand still  a minute   cried the voice   i ll be with you directly   with which the head disappeared  and the door closed
 is that the man   asked mr bumble s good lady
mr bumble nodded in the affirmative
 then  mind what i told you   said the matron   and be careful to say as little as you can  or you ll betray us at once   mr bumble  who had eyed the building with very rueful looks  was apparently about to express some doubts relative to the advisability of proceeding any further with the enterprise just then  when he was prevented by the appearance of monks  w ho opened a small door  near which they stood  and beckoned them inwards
 come in   he cried impatiently  stamping his foot upon the ground
 don t keep me here   the woman  who had hesitated at first  walked boldly in  without any other invitation
mr bumble  who was ashamed or afraid to lag behind  followed  obviously very ill at ease and with scarcely any of that remarkable dignity which was usually his chief characteristic
 what the devil made you stand lingering there  in the wet   said monks  turning round  and addressing bumble  after he had bolted the door behind them
 we—we were only cooling ourselves   stammered bumble  looking apprehensively about him
 cooling yourselves   retorted monks
 not all the rain that ever fell  or ever will fall  will put as much of hell s fire out  as a man can carry about with him
you won t cool yourself so easily  don t think it   with this agreeable speech  monks turned short upon the matron  and bent his gaze upon her  till even she  who was not easily cowed  was fain to withdraw her eyes  and turn them them towards the ground
 this is the woman  is it   demanded monks
 hem  that is the woman   replied mr bumble  mindful of his wife s caution
436 oliver twist  you think women never can keep secrets  i suppose   said the matron  interposing  and returning  as she spoke  the searching look of monks
 i know they will always keep one till it s found out   said monks
 and what may that be   asked the matron
 the loss of their own good name   replied monks
 so  by the same rule  if a woman s a party to a secret that might hang or transport her  i m not afraid of her telling it to anybody  not i  do you understand  mistress    no   rejoined the matron  slightly colouring as she spoke
 of course you don t   said monks
 how should you   bestowing something half way between a smile and a frown upon his two companions  and again beckoning them to follow him  the man hastened across the apartment  which was of considerable extent  but low in the roof
he was preparing to ascend a steep staircase  or rather ladder  leading to another floor of warehouses above  when a bright flash of lightning streamed down the aperture  and a peal of thunder followed  which shook the crazy building to its centre
 hear it   he cried  shrinking back
 hear it  rolling and crashing on as if it echoed through a thousand caverns where the devils were hiding from it
i hate the sound   he remained silent for a few moments  and then  removing his hands suddenly from his face  showed  to the unspeakable discomposure of mr bumble  that it was much distorted and discoloured
 these fits come over me  now and then   said monks  observing his alarm   and thunder sometimes brings them on
don t mind me now  it s all over for this once   thus speaking  he led the way up the ladder  and hastily closing the window shutter of the room into which it led  lowered a lantern which hung at the end of a rope and pulley passed through one of the heavy beams in the ceiling  and which cast a dim light upon an old table and three chairs that were placed beneath it  now   said monks  when they had all three seated themselves   the sooner we come to our business  the better for all the woman know what it is  does she   the question was addressed to bumble  but his wife anticipated the reply  by intimating that she was perfectly acquainted with it
 he is right in saying that you were with this hag the night she died  and that she told you something—   about the mother of the boy you named   replied the matron interrupting him
 yes    the first question is  of what nature was her communication   said monks
 that s the second   observed the woman with much deliberation
 the first is  what may the communication be worth    who the devil can tell that  without knowing of what kind it is   asked monks
 nobody better than you  i am persuaded   answered mrs bumble  who did not want for spirit  as her yoke fellow could abundantly testify 438 oliver twist  humph   said monks significantly  and with a look of eager inquiry   there may be money s worth to get  eh    perhaps there may   was the composed reply
 something that was taken from her   said monks
 something that she wore
something that—   you had better bid   interrupted mrs bumble  i have heard enough  already  to assure me that you are the man i ought to talk to   mr bumble  who had not yet been admitted by his better half into any greater share of the secret than he had originally possessed  listened to this dialogue with outstretched neck and distended eyes  which he directed towards his wife and monks  by turns  in undisguised astonishment  increased  if possible  when the latter sternly demanded  what sum was required for the disclosure  what s it worth to you   asked the woman  as collectedly as before
 it may be nothing  it may be twenty pounds   replied monks
 speak out  and let me know which    add five pounds to the sum you have named  give me five and twenty pounds in gold   said the woman   and i ll tell you all i know
not before    five and twenty pounds   exclaimed monks  drawing back
 i spoke as plainly as i could   replied mrs bumble  it s not a large sum  either    not a large sum for a paltry secret  that may be nothing when it s told   cried monks impatiently   and which has been lying dead for twelve years past or more    such matters keep well  and  like good wine  often double their value in course of time   answered the matron  still preserving the resolute indifference she had assumed
 as to lying dead  there are those who will lie dead for twelve thousand years to come  or twelve million  for anything you or i know  who will tell strange tales at last    what if i pay it for nothing   asked monks  hesitating
 you can easily take it away again   replied the matron
 i am but a woman  alone here  and unprotected    not alone  my dear  nor unprotected  neither   submitted mr bumble  in a voice tremulous with fear   i am here  my dear
and besides   said mr bumble  his teeth chattering as he spoke   mr monks is too much of a gentleman to attempt any violence on porochial persons
mr monks is aware that i am not a young man  my dear  and also that i am a little run to seed  as i may say  bu he has heerd  i say i have no doubt mr monks has heerd  my dear  that i am a very determined officer  with very uncommon strength  if i m once roused
i only want a little rousing  that s all   as mr bumble spoke  he made a melancholy feint of grasping his lantern with fierce determination  and plainly showed  by the alarmed expression of every feature  that he did want a little rousing  and not a little  prior to making any very warlike demonstration  unless  indeed  against paupers  or other person or persons trained down for the purpose
 you are a fool   said mrs bumble  in reply   and had better hold your tongue    he had better have cut it out  before he came  if he can t 440 oliver twist speak in a lower tone   said monks  grimly  so  he s your husband  eh    he my husband   tittered the matron  parrying the question
 i thought as much  when you came in   rejoined monks  marking the angry glance which the lady darted at her spouse as she spoke
 so much the better  i have less hesitation in dealing with two people  when i find that there s only one will between them
i m in earnest
see here   he thrust his hand into a side pocket  and producing a canvas bag  told out twenty five sovereigns on the table  and pushed them over to the woman
 now   he said   gather them up  and when this cursed peal of thunder  which i feel is coming up to break over the house top  is gone  let s hear your story   the thunder  which seemed in fact much nearer  and to shiver and break almost over their heads  having subsided  monks  raising his face from the table  bent forward to listen to what the woman should say
the faces of the three nearly touched  as the two men leant over the small table in their eagerness to hear  and the woman also leant forward to render her whisper audible
the sickly rays of the suspended lantern falling directly upon them  aggravated the paleness and anxiety of their countenances  which  encircled by the deepest gloom and darkness  looked ghastly in the extreme
 when this woman  that we called old sally  died   the matron began   she and i were alone    was there no one by   asked monks  in the same hollow whisper   no sick wretch or idiot in some other bed  no one who could hear  and might  by possibility  understand    not a soul   replied the woman   we were alone i stood alone beside the body when death came over it    good   said monks  regarding her attentively
 go on    she spoke of a young creature   resumed the matron   who had brought a child into the world some years before  not merely in the same room  but in the same bed  in which she then lay dying    ay   said monks  with quivering lip  and glancing over his shoulder   blood  how things come about    the child was the one you named to him last night   said the matron  nodding carelessly towards her husband   the mother this nurse had robbed    in life   asked monks
 in death   replied the woman  with something like a shudder
 she stole from the corpse  when it had hardly turned to one  that which the dead mother had prayed her  with her last breath  to keep for the infant s sake    she sold it   cried monks  with desperate eagerness   did she sell it  where  when  to whom  how long before    as she told me  with great difficulty  that she had done this   said the matron   she fell back and died    without saying more   cried monks  in a voice which  from its very suppression  seemed only the more furious
 it s a lie  i ll not be played with
she said more
i ll tear the life out of you both  but i ll know what it was    she didn t utter another word   said the woman  to all appearance unmoved (as mr bumble was very far from 442 oliver twist being) by the strange man s violence   but she clutched my gown  violently  with one hand  which was partly closed  and when i saw that she was dead  and so removed the hand by force  i found it clasped a scrap of dirty paper    which contained—  interposed monks  stretching forward  nothing   replied the woman   it was a pawnbroker s duplicate    for what   demanded monks
 in good time i ll tell you   said the woman
 i judge that she had kept the trinket  for some time  in the hope of turning it to better account  and then had pawned it  and had saved or scraped together money to pay the pawnbroker s interest year by year  and prevent its running out  so that if anything came of it  it could still be redeemed
nothing had come of it  and  as i tell you  she died with the scrap of paper  all worn and tattered  in her hand
the time was out in two days  i thought something might one day come of it too  and so redeemed the pledge    where is it now   asked monks quickly
 there   replied the woman
and  as if glad to be relieved of it  she hastily threw upon the table a small kid bag scarcely large enough for a french watch  which monks pouncing upon  tore open with trembling hands
it contained a little gold locket  in which were two locks of hair  and a plain gold wedding ring
 it has the word  agnes  engraved on the inside   said the woman
 there is a blank left for the surname  and then follows the date  which is within a year before the child was born
i found out that    and this is all   said monks  after a close and eager scrutiny of the contents of the little packet
 all   replied the woman
mr bumble drew a long breath  as if he were glad to find that the story was over  and no mention made of taking the five and twenty pounds back again  and now he took courage to wipe the perspiration which had been trickling over his nose  unchecked  during the whole of the previous dialogue
 i know nothing of the story  beyond what i can guess at   said his wife addressing monks  after a short silence   and i want to know nothing  for it s safer not
but i may ask you two questions  may i    you may ask   said monks  with some show of surprise   but whether i answer or not is another question    —which makes three   observed mr bumble  essaying a stroke of facetiousness
 is that what you expected to get from me   demanded the matron
 it is   replied monks
 the other question    what do you propose to do with it  can it be used against me    never   rejoined monks   nor against me either
see here  but don t move a step forward  or your life is not worth a bulrush   with these words  he suddenly wheeled the table aside  and pulling an iron ring in the boarding  threw back a large 444 oliver twist trap door which opened close at mr bumble s feet  and caused that gentleman to retire several paces backward  with great precipitation
 look down   said monks  lowering the lantern into the gulf
 don t fear me
i could have let you down  quietly enough  when you were seated over it  if that had been my game   thus encouraged  the matron drew near to the brink  and even mr bumble himself  impelled by curiousity  ventured to do the same the turbid water  swollen by the heavy rain  was rushing rapidly on below  and all other sounds were lost in the noise of its plashing and eddying against the green and slimy piles
there had once been a water mill beneath  the tide foaming and chafing round the few rotten stakes  and fragments of machinery that yet remained  seemed to dart onward  with a new impulse  when freed from the obstacles which had unavailingly attempted to stem its headlong course
 if you flung a man s body down there  where would it be to morrow morning   said monks  swinging the lantern to and fro in the dark well
 twelve miles down the river  and cut to pieces besides   replied bumble  recoiling at the thought
monks drew the little packet from his breast  where he had hurriedly thrust it  and tying it to a leaden weight  which had formed a part of some pulley  and was lying on the floor  dropped it into the stream
it fell straight  and true as a die  clove the water with a scarcely audible splash  and was gone
the three looking into each other s faces  seemed to breathe more freely
 there   said monks  closing the trap door  which fell heavily back into its former position
 if the sea ever gives up its dead  as books say it will  it will keep its gold and silver to itself  and that trash among it
we have nothing more to say  and may break up our pleasant party    by all means   observed mr bumble  with great alacrity
 you ll keep a quiet tongue in your head  will you   said monks  with a threatening look
 i am not afraid of your wife    you may depend upon me  young man   answered mr bumble  bowing himself gradually towards the ladder  with excessive politeness  on everybody s account  young man  on my own  you know  mr monks    i am glad  for your sake  to hear it   remarked monks
 light your lantern  and get away from here as fast as you can   it was fortunate that the conversation terminated at this point  or mr bumble  who had bowed himself to within six inches of the ladder  would infallibly have pitched headlong into the room below he lighted his lantern from that which monks had detached from the rope  and now carried in his hand  and making no effort to prolong the discourse  descended in silence  followed by his wife
monks brought up the rear  after pausing on the steps to satisfy himself that there were no other sounds to be heard than the beating of the rain without  and the rushing of the water they traversed the lower room  slowly  and with caution  446 oliver twist for monks started at every shadow  and mr bumble  holding his lantern a foot above the ground  walked not only with remarkable care  but with a marvellously light step for a gentleman of his figure  looking nervously about him for hidden trap doors
the gate at which they had entered  was softly unfastened and opened by monks  merely exchanging a nod with their mysterious acquaintance  the married couple emerged into the wet and darkness outside
they were no sooner gone  than monks  who appeared to entertain an invincible repugnance to being left alone  called to a boy who had been hidden somewhere below
bidding him go first  and bear the light  he returned to the chamber he had just quitted
introduces some respectable characters with whom the reader is already acquainted  and shows how monks and the jew laid their worthy heads together on the evening following that upon which the three their little matter of business as therein narrated  mr william sikes  awakening from a nap  drowsily growled forth 448 oliver twist an inquiry what time of night it was
the room in which mr sikes propounded this question  was not one of those he had tenanted  previous to the chertsey expedition  although it was in the same quarter of the town  and was situated at no great distance from his former lodgings
it was not  in appearance  so desirable a habitation as his old quarters  being a mean and badly furnished apartment  of very limited size  lighted only by one small window in the shelving roof  and abutting on a close and dirty lane
nor were there wanting other indications of the good gentleman s having gone down in the world of late  for a great scarcity of furniture  and total absence of comfort  together with the disappearance of all such small moveables as spare clothes and linen  bespoke a state of extreme poverty  while the meagre and attenuated condition of mr sikes himself would have fully confirmed these symptoms  if they had stood in any need of corroboration the housebreaker was lying on the bed  wrapped in his white great coat  by way of dressing gown  and displaying a set of features in no degree improved by the cadaverous hue of illness  and the addition of a soiled nightcap  and a stiff  black beard of a week s growth
the dog sat at the bedside  now eyeing his master with a wistful look  and now pricking his ears  and uttering a low growl as some noise in the street  or in the lower part of the house  attracted his attention
seated by the window  busily engaged in patching an old waistcoat which formed a portion of the robber s ordinary dress  was a female  so pale and reduced with watching and privation  that there would have been considerable difficulty in recognising her as the same nancy who has already figured in this tale  but for the voice in which she replied to mr sikes s question
 not long gone seven   said the girl
 how do you feel tonight  bill    as weak as water   replied mr sikes  with an imprecation on his eyes and limbs
 here  lend us a hand  and let me get off this thundering bed anyhow   illness had not improved mr sikes s temper  for  as the girl raised him up and led him to a chair  he muttered various curses on her awkwardnewss  and struck her
 whining are you   said sikes
 come  don t stand snivelling there
if you can t do anything better than that  cut off altogether
d ye hear me    i hear you   replied the girl  turning her face aside  and forcing a laugh
 what fancy have you got in your head now    oh  you ve thought better of it  have you   growled sikes  marking the tear which trembled in her eye
 all the better for you  you have    why  you don t mean to say  you d be hard upon me tonight  bill   said the girl  laying her hand upon his shoulder
 no   cried mr sikes
 why not    such a number of nights   said the girl  with a touch of woman s tenderness  which communicated something like sweetness of tone  even to her voice   such a number of nights as i ve been patient with you  nursing and caring for you  as if you had been a child  and this the first that i ve seen you like yourself  you wouldn t have served me as you 450 oliver twist did just now  if you d thought of that  would you  come  come  say you wouldn t    well  then   rejoined mr sikes   i wouldn t
why  damme  now  the girls s whining again    it s nothing   said the girl  throwing herself into a chair
 don t you seem to mind me
it ll soon be over    what ll be over   demanded mr sikes in a savage voice
 what foolery are you up to  now  again  get up and bustle about  and don t come over me with your woman s nonsense   at any other time  this remonstrance  and the tone in which it was delivered  would have had the desired effect  but the girl being really weak and exhausted  dropped her head over the back of the chair  and fainted  before mr sikes could get out a few of the appropriate oaths with which  on similar occasions  he was accustomed to garnish his threats
not knowing  very well  what to do  in this uncommon emergency  for miss nancy s hysterics were usually of that violent kind which the patient fights and struggles out of  without much assistance  mr sikes tried a little blasphemy  and finding that mode of treatment wholly ineffectual  called for assistance
 what s the matter here  my dear   said fagin  looking in
 lend a hand to the girl  can t you   replied sikes impatiently
 don t stand chattering and grinning at me   with an exclamation of surprise  fagin hastened to the girl s assistance  while mr john dawkins (otherwise the artful dodger)  who had followed his venerable friend into the room  hastily deposited on the floor a bundle with which he was laden  and snatching a bottle from the grasp of master charles bates who came close at his heels  uncorked it in a twinkling with his teeth  and poured a portion of its contents down the patient s throat  previously taking a taste  himself  to prevent mistakes  give her a whiff of fresh air with the bellows  charley   said mr dawkins   and you slap her hands  fagin  while bill undoes the petticuts   these united restoratives  administered with great energy  especially that department consigned to master bates  who appeared to consider his share in the proceedings  a piece of unexampled pleasantry  were not long in producing the desired effect
the girl gradually recovered her senses  and  staggering to a chair by the bedside  hid her face upon the pillow  leaving mr sikes to confront the new comers  in some astonishment at their unlooked for appearance
 why  what evil wind has blowed you here   he asked fagin
 no evil wind at all  my dear  for evil winds blow nobody any good  and i ve brought something good with me  that you ll be glad to see
dodger  my dear  open the bundle  and give bill the little trifles that we spent all our money on  this morning   in compliance with mr fagin s request  the artful untied this bundle  which was of large size  and formed of an old table cloth  and handed the articles it contained  one by one  to charley bates  who placed them on the table  with various encomiums on their rarity and excellence 452 oliver twist  sitch a rabbit pie  bill   exclaimed that young gentleman  disclosing to view a huge pasty   sitch delicate creeturs  with sitch tender limbs  bill  that the wery bones melt in your mouth  and there s no occasion to pick  em  half a pound of seven and six penny green  so precious strong that if you mix it with biling water  it ll go nigh to blow the lid of the tea pot off  a pound and a half of moist sugar that the niggers didn t work at all at  afore they got it up to sitch a pitch of goodness —oh no  two half quartern brans  pound of best fresh  piece of double glo ster  and  to wind up all  some of the richest sort you ever lushed   uttering this last panegyrie  master bates produced  from one of his extensive pockets  a full sized wine bottle  carefully corked  while mr dawkins  at the same instant  poured out a wine glassful of raw spirits from the bottle he carried  which the invalid tossed down his throat without a moment s hesitation
 ah   said fagin  rubbing his hands with great satisfaction
 you ll do  bill  you ll do now    do   exclaimed mr sikes   i might have been done for  twenty times over  afore you d have done anything to help me
what do you mean by leaving a man in this state  three weeks and more  you false hearted wagabond    only hear him  boys   said fagin  shrugging his shoulders
 and us come to bring him all these beau ti ful things    the things is well enough in their way   observed mr sikes  a little soothed as he glanced over the table   but what have you got to say for yourself  why you should leave me here  down in the mouth  health  blunt  and everything else  and take no more notice of me  all this mortal time  than if i was that  ere dog —drive him down  charley    i never see such a jolly dog as that   cried master bates  doing as he was desired
 smelling the grub like a old lady a going to market  he d make his fortun  on the stage that dog would  and rewive the drayma besides    hold your din   cried sikes  as the dog retreated under the bed  still growling angrily
 what have you got to say for yourself  you withered old fence  eh    i was away from london  a week and more  my dear  on a plant   replied the jew
 and what about the other fortnight   demanded sikes
 what about the other fortnight that you ve left me lying here  like a sick rat in his hole    i couldn t help it  bill
i can t go into a long explanation before company  but i couldn t help it  upon my honour    upon your what   growled sikes  with excessive disgust
 here  cut me off a piece of that pie  one of you boys  to take the taste of that out of my mouth  or it ll choke me dead    don t be out of temper  my dear   urged fagin  submissively
 i have never forgot you  bill  never once    no  i ll pound it that you han t   replied sikes  with a bitter grin
 you ve been scheming and plotting away  every hour that i have laid shivering and burning here  and bill was to do this  and bill was to do that  and bill was to do it all  dirt cheap  as soon as he got well  and was quite poor enough for your work
if it hadn t been for the girl  i might have died   454 oliver twist  there now  bill   remonstrated fagin  eagerly catching at the word
 if it hadn t been for the girl  who but poor ould fagin was the means of your having such a handy girl about you    he says true enough there   said nancy  coming hastily forward
 let him be  let him be   nancy s appearance gave a new turn to the conversation  for the boys  receiving a sly wink from the wary old jew  began to ply her with liquor  of which  however  she took very sparingly  while fagin  assuming an unusual flow of spirits  gradually brought mr sikes into a better temper  by affecting to regard his threats as a little pleasant banter  and  moreover  by laughing very heartily at one or two rough jokes  which  after repeated applications to the spirit bottle  he condescended to make
 it s all very well   said mr sikes   but i must have some blunt from you to night    i haven t a piece of coin about me   replied the jew
 then you ve got lots at home   retorted sikes   and i must have some from there    lots   cried fagin  holding up is hands
 i haven t so much as would—   i don t know how much you ve got  and i dare say you hardly know yourself  as it would take a pretty long time to count it   said sikes   but i must have some to night  and that s flat    well  well   said fagin  with a sigh   i ll send the artful round presently    you won t do nothing of the kind   rejoined mr sikes
 the artful s a deal too artful  and would forget to come  or lose his way  or get dodged by traps and so be perwented  or anything for an excuse  if you put him up to it
nancy shall go to the ken and fetch it  to make all sure  and i ll lie down and have a snooze while she s gone   after a great deal of haggling and squabbling  fagin beat down the amount of the required advance from five pounds to three pounds four and sixpence  protesting with many solemn asseverations that that would only leave him eighteen pence to keep house with  mr sikes sullenly remarking that if he couldn t get any more he must accompany him home  with the dodger and master bates put the eatables in the cupboard the jew then  taking leave of his affectionate friend  returned homeward  attended by nancy and the boys  mr sikes  meanwhile  flinging himself on the bed  and composing himself to sleep away the time until the young lady s return in due course  they arrived at fagin s abode  where they found toby crackit and mr chitling intent upon their fifteenth game at cribbage  which it is scarcely necessary to say the latter gentleman lost  and with it  his fifteenth and last sixpence  much to the amusement of his young friends
mr crackit  apparently somewhat ashamed at being found relaxing himself with a gentleman so much his inferior in station and mental endowments  yawned  and inquiring after sikes  took up his hat to go  has nobody been  toby   asked fagin
 not a living leg   answered mr crackit  pulling up his collar   it s been as dull as swipes
you ought to stand 456 oliver twist something handsome  fagin  to recompense me for keeping house so long
damme  i m as flat as a juryman  and should have gone to sleep  as fast as newgate  if i hadn t had the good natur  to amuse this youngster
horrid dull  i m blessed if i an t   with these and other ejaculations of the same kind  mr toby crackit swept up his winnings  and crammed them into his waistcoat pocket with a haughty air  as though such small pieces of silver were wholly beneath the consideration of a man of his figure  this done  he swaggered out of the room  with so much elegance and gentility  that mr chitling  bestowing numerous admiring glances on his legs and boots till they were out of sight  assured the company that he considered his acquaintance cheap at fifteen sixpences an interview  and that he didn t value his losses the snap of his little finger
 wot a rum chap you are  tom   said master bates  highly amused by this declaration
 not a bit of it   replied mr chitling
 am i  fagin    a very clever fellow  my dear   said fagin  patting him on the shoulder  and winking to his other pupils
 and mr crackit is a heavy swell  an t he  fagin   asked tom
 no doubt at all of that  my dear    and it is a creditable thing to have his acquaintance  an t it  fagin   pursued tom
 very much so  indeed  my dear
they re only jealous  tom  because he won t give it to them    ah   cried tom  triumphantly   that s where it is  he has cleaned me out
but i can go and earn some more  when i like  can t i  fagin    to be sure you can  and the sooner you go the better  tom  so make up your loss at once  and don t lose any more time
dodger  charley  it s time you were on the lay
come  it s near ten  and nothing done yet   in obedience to this hint  the boys  nodding to nancy  took up their hats  and left the room  the dodger and his vivacious friend indulging  as they went  in many witticisms at the expense of mr chitling  in whose conduct  it is but justice to say  there was nothing very conspicuous or peculiar  inasmuch as there are a great number of spirited young bloods upon town  who pay a much higher price than mr chitling for being seen in good society  and a great number of fine gentlemen (composing the good society aforesaid) who established their reputation upon very much the same footing as flash toby crackit  now   said fagin  when they had left the room   i ll go and get you that cash  nancy
this is only the key of a little cupboard where i keep a few odd things the boys get  my dear
i never lock up my money  for i ve got none to lock up  my dear—ha  ha  ha —none to lock up
it s a poor trade  nancy  and no thanks  but i m fond of seeing the young people about me  and i bear it all  i bear it all
hush   he said  hastily concealing the key in his breast   who s that  listen   the girl  who was sitting at the table with her arms folded  appeared in no way interested in the arrival  or to care whether the person  whoever he was  came or went  until 458 oliver twist the murmur of a man s voice reached her ears the instant she caught the sound  she tore off her bonnet and shawl  with the rapidity of lightning  and thrust them under the table
the jew  turning round immediately afterwards  she muttered a complaint of the heat  in a tone of languor that contrasted  very remarkably  with the extreme haste and violence of this action  which  however  had been unobserved by fagin  who had his back towards her at the time
 bah   he whispered  as though nettled by the interruption   it s the man i expected before  he s coming downstairs
not a word about the money while he s here  nance
he won t stop long
not ten minutes  my dear   laying his skinny forefinger upon his lip  the jew carried a candle to the door  as a man s step was heard upon the stairs without
he reached it  at the same moment as the visitor  who  coming hastily into the room  was close upon the girl before he observed her
it was monks
 only one of my young people   said fagin  observing that monks drew back  on beholding a stranger
 don t move  nancy   the girl drew closer to the table  and glancing at monks with an air of careless levity  withdrew her eyes  but as he turned towards fagin  she stole another look  so keen and searching  and full of purpose  that if there had been any bystander to observe the change  he could hardly have believed the two looks to have proceeded from the same person
 any news   inquired fagin
 great    and—and—good   asked fagin  hesitating as though he feared to vex the other man by being too sanguine
 not bad  any way   replied monks with a smile
 i have been prompt enough this time
let me have a word with you   the girl drew closer to the table  and made no offer to leave the room  although she could see that monks was pointing to her
the jew  perhaps fearing she might say something aloud about the money  if he endeavoured to get rid of her  pointed upward  and took monks out of the room
 not that infernal hole we were in before   she could hear the man say as they went upstairs
fagin laughed  and making some reply which did not reach her  seemed  by the creaking of the boards  to lead his companion to the second story
before the sound of their footsteps had ceased to echo through the house  the girl had slipped off her shoes  and drawing her gown loosely over her head  and muffling her arms in it  stood at the door  listening with breathless interest the moment the noise ceased  she glided from the room  ascended the stairs with incredible softness and silence  and was lost in the gloom above
the room remained deserted for a quarter of an hour or more  the girl glided back with the same unearthly tread  and  immediately afterwards  the two men were heard descending
monks went at once into the street  and the jew crawled upstairs again for the money
when he returned  the girl was adjusting her shawl and bonnet  as if preparing 460 oliver twist to be gone
 why  nance    exclaimed the jew  starting back as he put down the candle   how pale you are    pale   echoed the girl  shading her eyes with her hands  as if to look steadily at him
 quite horrible
what have you been doing to yourself    nothing that i know of  except sitting in this close place for i don t know how long and all   replied the girl carelessly
 come  let me get back  that s a dear   with a sigh for every piece of money  fagin told the amount into her hand
they parted without more conversation  merely interchanging a  good night   when the girl got into the open street  she sat down upon a doorstep  and seemed  for a few moments  wholly bewildered and unable to pursue her way
suddenly she arose  and hurrying on  in a direction quite opposite to that in which sikes was awaiting her returned  quickened her pace  until it gradually resolved into a violent run
after completely exhausting herself  she stopped to take breath  and  as if suddenly recollecting herself  and deploring her inability to do something she was bent upon  wrung her hands  and burst into tears
it might be that her tears relieved her  or that she felt the full hopelessness of her condition  but she turned back  and hurrying with nearly as great rapidity in the contrary direction  partly to recover lost time  and partly to keep pace with the violent current of her own thoughts  soon reached the dwelling where she had left the housebreaker
if she betrayed any agitation  when she presented herself to mr sikes  he did not observe it  for merely inquiring if she had brought the money  and receiving a reply in the affirmative  he uttered a growl of satisfaction  and replacing his head upon the pillow  resumed the slumbers which her arrival had interrupted
it was fortunate for her that the possession of money occasioned him so much employment next day in the way of eating and drinking  and withal had so beneficial an effect in smoothing down the asperities of his temper  that he had neither time nor inclination to be very critical upon her behaviour and deportment
that she had all the abstracted and nervous manner of one who is on the eve of some bold and hazardous step  which it has required no common struggle to resolve upon  would have been obvious to the lynx eyed fagin  who would most probably have taken the alarm at once  but mr sikes lacking the niceties of discrimination  and being troubled with no more subtle misgivings than those which resolve themselves into a dogged roughness of behaviour towards everybody  and being  furthermore  in an unusually amiable condition  as has been already observed  saw nothing unusual in her demeanor  and indeed  troubled himself so little about her  that  had her agitation been far more perceptible than it was  it would have been very unlikely to have awakened his suspicions as that day closed in  the girl s excitement increased  and  when night came on  and she sat by  watching until the housebreaker should drink himself asleep  there was an unusual paleness in her cheek  and a fire in her eye  that even sikes observed with astonishment 462 oliver twist mr sikes being weak from the fever  was lying in bed  taking hot water with his gin to render it less inflammatory  and had pushed his glass towards nancy to be replenished for the third or fourth time  when these symptoms first struck him  why  burn my body   said the man  raising himself on his hands as he stared the girl in the face  you look like a corpse come to life again
what s the matter    matter   replied the girl
 nothing
what do you look at me so hard for    what foolery is this   demanded sikes  grasping her by the arm  and shaking her roughly
 what is it  what do you mean  what are you thinking of    of many things  bill   replied the girl  shivering  and as she did so  pressing her hands upon her eyes
 but  lord  what odds in that   the tone of forced gaiety in which the last words were spoken  seemd to produce a deeper impression on sikes than the wild and rigid look which had preceded them
 i tell you wot it is   said sikes   if you haven t caught the fever  and got it comin  on  now  there s something more than usual in the wind  and something dangerous too
you re not a going to—
no  damme  you wouldn t do that    do what   asked the girl
 there ain t   said sikes  fixing his eyes upon her  and muttering the words to himself   there ain t a stauncher hearted gal going  or i d have cut her throat three months ago she s got the fever coming on  that s it   fortifying himself with this assurance  sikes drained the glass to the bottom  and then  with many grumbling oaths  called for his physic the girl jumped up  with great alacrity  poured it quickly out  but with her back towards him  and held the vessel to his lips  while he drank off the contents
 now   said the robber   come and sit aside of me  and put on your own face  or i ll alter it so  that you won t know it agin when you do want it   the girl obeyed
sikes  locking her hand in his  fell back upon the pillow  turning his eyes upon her face
they closed  opened again  closed once more  again opened
he shifted his position restlessly  and  after dozing again  and again  for two or three minutes  and as often springing up with a look of terror  and gazing vacantly about him  was suddenly stricken  as it were  while in the very attitude of rising  into a deep and heavy sleep
the grasp of his hand relaxed  the upraised arm fell languidly by his side  and he lay like one in a profound trance
 the laudanum has taken effect at last   murmured the girl  as she rose from the bedside
 i may be too late  even now   she hastily dressed herself in her bonnet and shawl  looking fearfully round  from time to time  as if  despite the sleeping draught  she expected every moment to feel the pressure of sikes s heavy hand upon her shoulder  then  stooping softly over the bed  she kissed the robber s lips  and then opening and closing the room door with noiseless touch  hurried from the house
a watchman was crying half past nine  down a dark passage through which she had to pass  in gaining the main 464 oliver twist thoroughfare
 has it long gone the half hour   asked the girl
 it ll strike the hour in another quarter   said the man  raising his lantern to her face
 and i cannot get there in less than an hour or more   muttered nancy  brushing swiftly past him  and gliding rapidly down the street
many of the shops were already closing in the back lanes and avenues through which she tracked her way  in making from spitalfields towards the west end of london
the clock struck ten  increasing her impatience
she tore along the narrow pavement  elbowing the passengers from side to side  and darting almost under the horses  heads  crossed crowded streets  where clusters of persons were eagerly watching their opportunity to do the like
 the woman is mad   said the people  turning to look after her as she rushed away
when she reached the more wealthy quarter of the town  the streets were comparatively deserted  and here her headlong progress excited a still greater curiosity in the stragglers whom she hurried past
some quickened their pace behind  as though to see whither she was hastening at such an unusual rate  and a few made head upon her  and looked back  surprised at her undiminished speed  but they fell off one by one  and when she neared her place of destination  she was alone
it was a family hotel in a quiet but handsome street near hyde park
as the brilliant light of the lamp which burnt before its door  guided her to the spot  the clock struck eleven
she had loitered for a few paces as though irresolute  and making up her mind to advance  but the sound determined her  and she stepped into the hall
the porter s seat was vacant
she looked round with an air of incertitude  and advanced towards the stairs
 now  young woman   said a smartly dressed female  looking out from a door behind her   who do you want here    a lady who is stopping in this house   answered the girl
 a lady   was the reply  accompanied with a scornful look
 what lady    miss maylie   said nancy
the young woman  who had by this time  noted her appearance  replied only by a look of virtuous disdain  and summoned a man to answer her
to him  nancy repeated her request
 what name am i to say   asked the waiter
 it s of no use saying any   replied nancy
 nor business   said the man
 no  nor that neither   rejoined the girl
 i must see the lady    come   said the man  pushing her towards the door
 none of this
take yourself off    i shall be carried out if i go   said the girl violently   and i can make that a job that two of you won t like to do
isn t there anybody here   she said  looking round   that will see a simple message carried for a poor wretch like me   this appeal produced an effect on a good tempered faced man cook  who with some of the other servants was look  466 oliver twist ing on  and who stepped forward to interfere  take it up for her  joe  can t you   said this person
 what s the good   replied the man
 you don t suppose the young lady will see such as her  do you   this allusion to nancy s doubtful character  raised a vast quantity of chaste wrath in the bosoms of four housemaids  who remarked  with great fervour  that the creature was a disgrace to her sex  and strongly advocated her being thrown  ruthlessly  into the kennel  do what you like with me   said the girl  turning to the men again   but do what i ask you first  and i ask you to give this message for god almighty s sake   the soft hearted cook added his intercession  and the result was that the man who had first appeared undertook its delivery
 what s it to be   said the man  with one foot on the stairs
 that a young woman earnestly asks to speak to miss maylie alone   said nancy   and that if the lady will only hear the first word she has to say  she will know whether to hear her business  or to have her turned out of doors as an impostor    i say   said the man   you re coming it strong    you give the message   said the girl firmly   and let me hear the answer   the man ran upstairs
nancy remained  pale and almost breathless  listening with quivering lip to the very audible expressions of scorn  of which the chaste housemaids were very prolific  and of which they became still more so  when the man returned  and said the young woman was to walk upstairs
 it s no good being proper in this world   said the first housemaid
 brass can do better than the gold what has stood the fire   said the second
the third contented herself with wondering  what ladies was made of   and the fourth took the first in a quartette of  shameful   with which the dianas concluded
regardless of all this  for she had weightier matters at heart  nancy followed the man  with trembling limbs  to a small ante chamber  lighted by a lamp from the ceiling
here he left her  and retired
468 oliver twist a strange interview  which is a sequel to the last chamber the girl s life had been squandered in the streets  and among the most noisome of the stews and dens of london  but there was something of the woman s original nature left in her still  and when she heard a light step approaching the door opposite to that by which she had entered  and thought of the wide contrast which the small room would in another moment contain  she felt burdened with the sense of her own deep shame  and shrunk as though she could scarcely bear the presence of her with whom she had sought this interview
but struggling with these better feelings was pride —the vice of the lowest and most debased creatures no less than of the high and self assured
the miserable companion of thieves and ruffians  the fallen outcast of low haunts  the associate of the scourings of the jails and hulks  living within the shadow of the gallows itself —even this degraded being felt too proud to betray a feeble gleam of the womanly feeling which she thought a weakness  but which alone connected her with that humanity  of which her wasting life had obliterated so many  many traces when a very child
she raised her eyes sufficiently to observe that the figure which presented itself was that of a slight and beautiful girl  then  bending them on the ground  she tossed her head with affected carelessness as she said   it s a hard matter to get to see you  lady
if i had taken offence  and gone away  as many would have done  you d have been sorry for it one day  and not without reason either    i am very sorry if any one has behaved harshly to you   replied rose
 do not think of that
tell me why you wished to see me
i am the person you inquired for   the kind tone of this answer  the sweet voice  the gentle manner  the absence of any accent of haughtiness or displeasure  took the girl completely by surprise  and she burst into tears
 oh  lady  lady   she said  clasping her hands passionately before her face   if there was more like you  there would be fewer like me —there would—there would    sit down   said rose  earnestly
 if you are in poverty or affliction i shall be truly glad to relieve you if i can —i shall indeed
sit down    let me stand  lady   said the girl  still weeping   and do not speak to me so kindly till you know me better
it is growing late
is—is—that door shut    yes   said rose  recoiling a few steps  as if to be nearer assistance in case she should require it
 why   470 oliver twist  because   said the girl   i am about to put my life and the lives of others in your hands
i am the girl that dragged little oliver back to old fagin s on the night he went out from the house in pentonville    you   said rose maylie
 i  lady   replied the girl
 i am the infamous creature you have heard of  that lives among the thieves  and that never from the first moment i can recollect my eyes and senses opening on london streets have known any better life  or kinder words than they have given me  so help me god  do not mind shrinking openly from me  lady
i am younger than you would think  to look at me  but i am well used to it
the poorest women fall back  as i make my way along the crowded pavement    what dreadful things are these   said rose  involuntarily falling from her strange companion
 thank heaven upon your knees  dear lady   cried the girl   that you had friends to care for and keep you in your childhood  and that you were never in the midst of cold and hunger  and riot and drunkenness  and—and—something worse than all—as i have been from my cradle
i may use the word  for the alley and the gutter were mine  as they will be my deathbed    i pity you   said rose  in a broken voice
 it wrings my heart to hear you    heaven bless you for your goodness   rejoined the girl
 if you knew what i am sometimes  you would pity me  indeed
but i have stolen away from those who would surely murder me  if they knew i had been here  to tell you what i have overheard
do you know a man named monks    no   said rose
 he knows you   replied the girl   and knew you were here  for it was by hearing him tell the place that i found you out    i never heard the name   said rose
 then he goes by some other amongst us   rejoined the girl   which i more than thought before
some time ago  and soon after oliver was put into your house on the night of the robbery  i—suspecting this man—listened to a conversation held between him and fagin in the dark
i found out  from what i heard  that monks—the man i asked you about  you know—   yes   said rose   i understand    —that monks   pursued the girl   had seen him accidently with two of our boys on the day we first lost him  and had known him directly to be the same child that he was watching for  though i couldn t make out why
a bargain was struck with fagin  that if oliver was got back he should have a certain sum  and he was to have more for making him a thief  which this monks wanted for some purpose of his own
 for what purpose   asked rose
 he caught sight of my shadow on the wall as i listened  in the hope of finding out   said the girl   and there are not many people besides me that could have got out of their way in time to escape discovery
but i did  and i saw him no more till last night    and what occurred then   472 oliver twist  i ll tell you  lady
last night he came again
again they went upstairs  and i  wrapping myself up so that my shadow would not betray me  again listened at the door
the first words i heard monks say were these   so the only proofs of the boy s identity lie at the bottom of the river  and the old hag that received them from the mother is rotting in her coffin   they laughed  and talked of his success in doing this  and monks  talking on about the boy  and getting very wild  said that though he had got the young devil s money safely know  he d rather have had it the other way  for  what a game it would have been to have brought down the boast of the father s will  by driving him through every jail in town  and then hauling him up for some capital felony which fagin could easily manage  after having made a good profit of him besides    what is all this   said rose
 the truth  lady  though it comes from my lips   replied the girl
 then  he said  with oaths common enough in my ears  but strange to yours  that if he could gratify his hatred by taking the boy s life without bringing his own neck in danger  he would  but  as he couldn t  he d be upon the watch to meet him at every turn in life  and if he took advantage of his birth and history  he might harm him yet
 in short  fagin   he says   jew as you are  you never laid such snares as i ll contrive for my young brother  oliver    his brother   exclaimed rose
 those were his words   said nancy  glancing uneasily round  as she had scarcely ceased to do  since she began to speak  for a vision of sikes haunted her perpetually
 and more
when he spoke of you and the other lady  and said it seemed contrived by heaven  or the devil  against him  that oliver should come into your hands  he laughed  and said there was some comfort in that too  for how many thousands and hundreds of thousands of pounds would you not give  if you had them  to know who your two legged spaniel was    you do not mean   said rose  turning very pale   to tell me that this was said in earnest    he spoke in hard and angry earnest  if a man ever did   replied the girl  shaking her head
 he is an earnest man when his hatred is up
i know many who do worse things  but i d rather listen to them all a dozen times  than to that monks once
it is growing late  and i have to reach home without suspicion of having been on such an errand as this
i must get back quickly    but what can i do   said rose
 to what use can i turn this communication without you  back  why do you wish to return to companions you paint in such terrible colors  if you repeat this information to a gentleman whom i can summon in an instant from the next room  you can be consigned to some place of safety without half an hour s delay    i wish to go back   said the girl
 i must go back  because—how can i tell such things to an innocent lady like you —because among the men i have told you of  there is one  the most desperate among them all  that i can t leave  no  not even to be saved from the life i am leading now    your having interfered in this dear boy s behalf before   said rose   your coming here  at so great a risk  to tell me 474 oliver twist what you have heard  your manner  which convinces me of the truth of what you say  your evident contrition  and sense of shame  all lead me to believe that you might yet be reclaimed
oh   said the earnest girl  folding her hands as the tears coursed down her face   do not turn a deaf ear to the entreaties of one of your own sex  the first—the first  i do believe  who ever appealed to you in the voice of pity and compassion
do hear my words  and let me save you yet  for better things    lady   cried the girl  sinking on her knees   dear  sweet  angel lady  you are the first that ever blessed me with such words as these  and if i had heard them years ago  they might have turned me from a life of sin and sorrow  but it is too late  it is too late    it is never too late   said rose   for penitence and atonement    it is   cried the girl  writhing in agony of her mind   i cannot leave him now  i could not be his death    why should you be   asked rose
 nothing could save him   cried the girl
 if i told others what i have told you  and led to their being taken  he would be sure to die
he is the boldest  and has been so cruel    is it possible   cried rose   that for such a man as this  you can resign every future hope  and the certainty of immediate rescue  it is madness    i don t know what it is   answered the girl   i only know that it is so  and not with me alone  but with hundreds of others as bad and wretched as myself i must go back
whether it is god s wrath for the wrong i have done  i do not know  but i am drawn back to him through every suffering and ill usage  and i should be  i believe  if i knew that i was to die by his hand at last    what am i to do   said rose
 i should not let you depart from me thus    you should  lady  and i know you will   rejoined the girl  rising
 you will not stop my going because i have trusted in your goodness  and forced no promise from you  as i might have done    of what use  then  is the communication you have made   said rose
 this mystery must be investigated  or how will its disclosure to me  benefit oliver  whom you are anxious to serve    you must have some kind gentleman about you that will hear it as a secret  and advise you what to do   rejoined the girl
 but where can i find you again when it is necessary   asked rose
 i do not seek to know where these dreadful people live  but where will you be walking or passing at any settled period from this time    will you promise me that you will have my secret strictly kept  and come alone  or with the only other person that knows it  and that i shall not be watched or followed   asked the girl
 i promise you solemnly   answered rose
 every sunday night  from eleven until the clock strikes twelve   said the girl without hesitation   i will walk on london bridge if i am alive    stay another moment   interposed rose  as the girl moved 476 oliver twist hurriedly towards the door
 think once again on your own condition  and the opportunity you have of escaping from it
you have a claim on me  not only as the voluntary bearer of this intelligence  but as a woman lost almost beyond redemption
will you return to this gang of robbers  and to this man  when a word can save you  what fascination is it that can take you back  and make you cling to wickedness and misery  oh  is there no chord in your heart that i can touch  is there nothing left  to which i can appeal against this terrible infatuation    when ladies as young  and good  and beautiful as you are   replied the girl steadily   give away your hearts  love will carry you all lengths—even such as you  who have home  friends  other admirers  everything  to fill them
when such as i  who have no certain roof but the coffinlid  and no friend in sickness or death but the hospital nurse  set our rotten hearts on any man  and let him fill the place that has been a blank through all our wretched lives  who can hope to cure us  pity us  lady—pity us for having only one feeling of the woman left  and for having that turned  by a heavy judgment  from a comfort and a pride  into a new means of violence and suffering    you will   said rose  after a pause   take some money from me  which may enable you to live without dishonesty—at all events until we meet again    not a penny   replied the girl  waving her hand  do not close your heart against all my efforts to help you   said rose  stepping gently forward
 i wish to serve you indeed    you would serve me best  lady   replied the girl  wringing her hands   if you could take my life at once  for i have felt more grief to think of what i am  to night  than i ever did before  and it would be something not to die in the hell in which i have lived
god bless you  sweet lady  and send as much happiness on your head as i have brought shame on mine   thus speaking  and sobbing aloud  the unhappy creature turned away  while rose maylie  overpowered by this extraordinary interview  which had more the semblance of a rapid dream than an actual occurance  sank into a chair  and endeavoured to collect her wandering thoughts
478 oliver twist containing fresh discoveries  and showing that suprises  like misfortunes  seldom come alone her situation was  indeed  one of no common trial and difficulty
while she felt the most eager and burning desire to penetrate the mystery in which oliver s history was enveloped  she could not but hold sacred the confidence which the miserable woman with whom she had just conversed  had reposed in her  as a young and guileless girl
her words and manner had touched rose maylie s heart  and  mingled with her love for her young charge  and scarcely less intense in its truth and fervour  was her fond wish to win the outcast back to repentance and hope
they purposed remaining in london only three days  prior to departing for some weeks to a distant part of the coast
it was now midnight of the first day
what course of action could she determine upon  which could be adopted in eight and forty hours  or how could she postpone the journey without exciting suspicion  mr losberne was with them  and would be for the next two days  but rose was too well acquainted with the excellent gentleman s impetuosity  and foresaw too clearly the wrath with which  in the first explosion of his indignation  he would regard the instrument of oliver s recapture  to trust him with the secret  when her representations in the girl s behalf could be seconded by no experienced person
these were all reasons for the greatest caution and most circumspect behaviour in communicating it to mrs maylie  whose first impulse would infallibly be to hold a conference with the worthy doctor on the subject as to resorting to any legal adviser  even if she had known how to do so  it was scarcely to be thought of  for the same reason once the thought occurred to her of seeking assistance from harry  but this awakened the recollection of their last parting  and it seemed unworthy of her to call him back  when—the tears rose to her eyes as she pursued this train of reflection— he might have by this time learnt to forget her  and to be happier away
disturbed by these different reflections  inclining now to one course and then to another  and again recoiling from all  as each successive consideration presented itself to her mind  rose passed a sleepless and anxious night
after more communing with herself next day  she arrived at the 480 oliver twist desperate conclusion of consulting harry
 if it be painful to him   she thought   to come back here  how painful it will be to me  but perhaps he will not come  he may write  or he may come himself  and studiously abstain from meeting me—he did when he went away i hardly thought he would  but it was better for us both   and here rose dropped the pen  and turned away  as though the very paper which was to be her messenger should not see her weep
she had taken up the same pen  and laid it down again fifty times  and had considered and reconsidered the first line of her letter without writing the first word  when oliver  who had been walking in the streets  with mr giles for a body guard  entered the room in such breathless haste and violent agitation  as seemed to betoken some new cause of alarm
 what makes you look so flurried   asked rose  advancing to meet him
 i hardly know how  i feel as if i should be choked   replied the boy
 oh dear  to think that i should see him at last  and you should be able to know that i have told you the truth    i never thought you had told us anything but the truth   said rose  soothing him
 but what is this —of whom do you speak    i have seen the gentleman   replied oliver  scarcely able to articulate   the gentleman who was so good to me—mr brownlow  that we have so often talked about    where   asked rose
 getting out of a coach   replied oliver  shedding tears of delight   and going into a house
i didn t speak to him—i couldn t speak to him  for he didn t see me  and i trembled so  that i was not able to go up to him
but giles asked  for me  whether he lived there  and they said he did
look here   said oliver  opening a scrap of paper   here it is  here s where he lives—i m going there directly  oh  dear me  dear me  what shall i do when i come to see him and hear him speak again   with her attention not a little distracted by these and a great many other incoherent exclamations of joy  rose read the address  which was craven street  in the strand
she very soon determined upon turning the discovery to account
 quick   she said
 tell them to fetch a hackney coach  and be ready to go with me i will take you there directly  without a minute s loss of time
i will only tell my aunt that we are going out for an hour  and be ready as soon as you are   oliver needed no prompting to despatch  and in little more than five minutes they were on their way to craven street
when they arrived there  rose left oliver in the coach  under pretence of preparing the old gentleman to receive him  and sending up her card by the servant  requested to see mr brownlow on very pressing business
the servant soon returned  to beg that she would walk upstairs  and following him into an upper room  miss maylie was presented to an elderly gentleman of benevolent appearance  in a bottle green coat
at no great distance from whom  was seated 482 oliver twist another old gentleman  in nankeen breeches and gaiters  who did not look particularly benevolent  and who was sitting with his hands clasped on the top of a thick stick  and his chin propped thereupon
 dear me   said the gentleman  in the bottle green coat  hastily rising with great politeness   i beg your pardon  young lady—i imagined it was some importunate person who—i beg you will excuse me
be seated  pray    mr brownlow  i believe  sir   said rose  glancing from the other gentleman to the one who had spoken
 that is my name   said the old gentleman
 this is my friend  mr grimwig
grimwig  will you leave us for a few minutes    i believe   interposed miss maylie   that at this period of our interview  i need not give that gentleman the trouble of going away
if i am correctly informed  he is cognizant of the business on which i wish to speak to you   mr brownlow inclined his head
mr grimwig  who had made one very stiff bow  and risen from his chair  made another very stiff bow  and dropped into it again
 i shall surprise you very much  i have no doubt   said rose  naturally embarrassed   but you once showed great benevolence and goodness to a very dear young friend of mine  and i am sure you will take an interest in hearing of him again    indeed   said mr brownlow
 oliver twist you knew him as   replied rose
the words no sooner escaped her lips  than mr grimwig  who had been affecting to dip into a large book that lay on the table  upset it with a great crash  and falling back in his chair  discharged from his features every expression but one of unmitigated wonder  and indulged in a prolonged and vacant stare  then  as if ashamed of having betrayed so much emotion  he jerked himself  as it were  by a convulsion into his former attitude  and looking out straight before him emitted a long deep whistle  which seemed  at last  not to be discharged on empty air  but to die away in the innermost recesses of his stomach mr browlow was no less surprised  although his astonishment was not expressed in the same eccentric manner
he drew his chair nearer to miss maylie s  and said   do me the favour  my dear young lady  to leave entirely out of the question that goodness and benevolence of which you speak  and of which nobody else knows anything  and if you have it in your power to produce any evidence which will alter the unfavourable opinion i was once induced to entertain of that poor child  in heaven s name put me in possession of it    a bad one  i ll eat my head if he is not a bad one   growled mr grimwig  speaking by some ventriloquial power  without moving a muscle of his face
 he is a child of a noble nature and a warm heart   said rose  colouring   and that power which has thought fit to try him beyond his years  has planted in his breast affections and feelings which would do honour to many who have numbered his days six times over    i m only sixty one   said mr grimwig  with the same rigid face
484 oliver twist  and  as the devil s in it if this oliver is not twelve years old at least  i don t see the application of that remark    do not heed my friend  miss maylie   said mr brownlow   he does not mean what he says    yes  he does   growled mr grimwig
 no  he does not   said mr brownlow  obviously rising in wrath as he spoke
 he ll eat his head  if he doesn t   growled mr grimwig
 he would deserve to have it knocked off  if he does   said mr brownlow
 and he d uncommonly like to see any man offer to do it   responded mr grimwig  knocking his stick upon the floor
having gone thus far  the two old gentlemen severally took snuff  and afterwards shook hands  according to their invariable custom
 now  miss maylie   said mr brownlow   to return to the subject in which your humanity is so much interested
will you let me know what intelligence you have of this poor child  allowing me to promise that i exhausted every means in my power of discovering him  and that since i have been absent from this country  my first impression that he had imposed upon me  and had been persuaded by his former associates to rob me  has been considerably shaken   rose  who had had time to collect her thoughts  at once related  in a few natural words  all that had befallen oliver since he left mr brownlow s house  reserving nancy s information for that gentleman s private ear  and concluding with the assurance that his only sorrow  for some months past  had been not being able to meet with his former benefactor and friend
 thank god   said the old gentleman
 this is great happiness to me  great happiness
but you have not told me where he is now  miss maylie
you must pardon my finding fault with you —but why not have brought him    he is waiting in a coach at the door   replied rose
 at this door   cried the old gentleman
with which he hurried out of the room  down the stairs  up the coachsteps  and into the coach  without another word
when the room door closed behind him  mr grimwig lifted up his head  and converting one of the hind legs of his chair into a pivot  described three distinct circles with the assistance of his stick and the table  stitting in it all the time
after performing this evolution  he rose and limped as fast as he could up and down the room at least a dozen times  and then stopping suddenly before rose  kissed her without the slightest preface
 hush   he said  as the young lady rose in some alarm at this unusual proceeding
 don t be afraid
i m old enough to be your grandfather
you re a sweet girl
i like you
here they are   in fact  as he threw himself at one dexterous dive into his former seat  mr brownlow returned  accompanied by oliver  whom mr grimwig received very graciously  and if the gratification of that moment had been the only reward for all her anxiety and care in oliver s behalf  rose maylie would have been well repaid  there is somebody else who should not be forgotten  by the bye   said mr brownlow  ringing the bell
 send mrs 486 oliver twist bedwin here  if you please   the old housekeeper answered the summons with all dispatch  and dropping a curtsey at the door  waited for orders  why  you get blinder every day  bedwin   said mr brownlow  rather testily
 well  that i do  sir   replied the old lady
 people s eyes  at my time of life  don t improve with age  sir    i could have told you that   rejoined mr brownlow   but put on your glasses  and see if you can t find out what you were wanted for  will you   the old lady began to rummage in her pocket for her spectacles
but oliver s patience was not proof against this new trial  and yielding to his first impulse  he sprang into her arms  god be good to me   cried the old lady  embracing him   it is my innocent boy    my dear old nurse   cried oliver
 he would come back—i knew he would   said the old lady  holding him in her arms  how well he looks  and how like a gentleman s son he is dressed again  where have you been  this long  long while  ah  the same sweet face  but not so pale  the same soft eye  but not so sad
i have never forgotten them or his quiet smile  but have seen them every day  side by side with those of my own dear children  dead and gone since i was a lightsome young creature   running on thus  and now holding oliver from her to mark how he had grown  now clasping him to her and passing her fingers fondly through his hair  the good soul laughed and wept upon his neck by turns
leaving her and oliver to compare notes at leisure  mr brownlow led the way into another room  and there  heard from rose a full narration of her interview with nancy  which occasioned him no little surprise and perplexity
rose also explained her reasons for not confiding in her friend mr losberne in the first instance
the old gentleman considered that she had acted prudently  and readily undertook to hold solemn conference with the worthy doctor himself to afford him an early opportunity for the execution of this design  it was arranged that he should call at the hotel at eight o clock that evening  and that in the meantime mrs maylie should be cautiously informed of all that had occurred these preliminaries adjusted  rose and oliver returned home
rose had by no means overrated the measure of the good doctor s wrath
nancy s history was no sooner unfolded to him  than he poured forth a shower of mingled threats and execrations  threatened to make her the first victim of the combined ingenuity of messrs
blathers and duff  and actually put on his hat preparatory to sallying forth to obtain the assistance of those worthies
and  doubtless  he would  in this first outbreak  have carried the intention into effect without a moment s consideration of the consequences  if he had not been restrained  in part  by corresponding violence on the side of mr brownlow  who was himself of an irascible temperament  and party by such arguments and representations as seemed best calculated to dissuade him from his hotbrained purpose 488 oliver twist  then what the devil is to be done   said the impetuous doctor  when they had rejoined the two ladies
 are we to pass a vote of thanks to all these vagabonds  male and female  and beg them to accept a hundred pounds  or so  apiece  as a trifling mark of our esteem  and some slight acknowledgment of their kindness to oliver    not exactly that   rejoined mr brownlow  laughing   but we must proceed gently and with great care    gentleness and care   exclaimed the doctor
 i d send them one and all to—   never mind where   interposed mr brownlow
 but reflect whether sending them anywhere is likely to attain the object we have in view    what object   asked the doctor
 simply  the discovery of oliver s parentage  and regaining for him the inheritance of which  if this story be true  he has been fraudulently deprived    ah   said mr losberne  cooling himself with his pockethandkerchief   i almost forgot that    you see   pursued mr brownlow   placing this poor girl entirely out of the question  and supposing it were possible to bring these scoundrels to justice without compromising her safety  what good should we bring about    hanging a few of them at least  in all probability   suggested the doctor   and transporting the rest    very good   replied mr brownlow  smiling   but no doubt they will bring that about for themselves in the fulness of time  and if we step in to forestall them  it seems to me that we shall be performing a very quixotic act  in direct opposition to our own interest—or at least to oliver s  which is the same thing    how   inquired the doctor  thus it is quite clear that we shall have extreme difficulty in getting to the bottom of this mystery  unless we can bring this man  monks  upon his knees
that can only be done by stratagem  and by catching him when he is not surrounded by these people
for  suppose he were apprehended  we have no proof against him
he is not even (so far as we know  or as the facts appear to us) concerned with the gang in any of their robberies
if he were not discharged  it is very unlikely that he could receive any further punishment than being committed to prison as a rogue and vagabond  and of course ever afterwards his mouth would be so obstinately closed that he might as well  for our purposes  be deaf  dumb  blind  and an idiot    then   said the doctor impetuously   i put it to you again  whether you think it reasonable that this promise to the girl should be considered binding  a promise made with the best and kindest intentions  but really—   do not discuss the point  my dear young lady  pray   said mr brownlow  interrupting rose as she was about to speak
 the promise shall be kept
i don t think it will  in the slightest degree  interfere with our proceedings
but  before we can resolve upon any precise course of action  it will be necessary to see the girl  to ascertain from her whether she will point out this monks  on the understanding that he is to be dealt with by us  and not by the law  or  if she will not  or cannot do that  to procure from her such an account of his 490 oliver twist haunts and description of his person  as will enable us to identify him
she cannot be seen until next sunday night  this is tuesday
i would suggest that in the meantime  we remain perfectly quiet  and keep these matters secret even from oliver himself   although mr loseberne received with many wry faces a proposal involving a delay of five whole days  he was fain to admit that no better course occurred to him just then  and as both rose and mrs maylie sided very strongly with mr brownlow  that gentleman s proposition was carried unanimously  i should like   he said   to call in the aid of my friend grimwig he is a strange creature  but a shrewd one  and might prove of material assistance to us  i should say that he was bred a lawyer  and quitted the bar in disgust because he had only one brief and a motion of course  in twenty years  though whether that is recommendation or not  you must determine for yourselves    i have no objection to your calling in your friend if i may call in mine   said the doctor
 we must put it to the vote   replied mr brownlow   who may he be    that lady s son  and this young lady s—very old friend   said the doctor  motioning towards mrs maylie  and concluding with an expressive glance at her niece rose blushed deeply  but she did not make any audible objection to this motion (possibly she felt in a hopeless minority)  and harry maylie and mr grimwig were accordingly added to the committee
 we stay in town  of course   said mrs maylie   while there remains the slightest prospect of prosecuting this inquiry with a chance of success i will spare neither trouble nor expense in behalf of the object in which we are all so deeply interested  and i am content to remain here  if it be for twelve months  so long as you assure me that any hope remains    good   rejoined mr brownlow
 and as i see on the faces about me  a disposition to inquire how it happened that i was not in the way to corroborate oliver s tale  and had so suddenly left the kingdom  let me stipulate that i shall be asked no questions until such time as i may deem it expedient to forestall them by telling my own story
believe me  i make this request with good reason  for i might otherwise excite hopes destined never to be realised  and only increase difficulties and disappointments already quite numerous enough
come  supper has been announced  and young oliver  who is all alone in the next room  will have begun to think  by this time  that we have wearied of his company  and entered into some dark conspiracy to thrust him forth upon the world   with these words  the old gentleman gave his hand to mrs maylie  and escorted her into the supper room mr losberne followed  leading rose  and the council was  for the present  effectually broken up
492 oliver twist an old acquaintance of oliver s  exhibiting decided marks of genius  becomes a public character in the metropolis upon the night when nancy  having lulled mr sikes to sleep  hurried on her self imposed mission to rose maylie  there advanced towards london  by the great north road  two persons  upon whom it is expedient that this history should bestow some attention
they were a man and woman  or perhaps they would be better described as a male and female  for the former was one of those long limbed  knock kneed  shambling  bony people  to whom it is difficult to assign any precise age — looking as they do  when they are yet boys  like undergrown men  and when they are almost men  like overgrown boys
the woman was young  but of a robust and hardy make  as she need have been to bear the weight of the heavy bundle which was strapped to her back
her companion was not encumbered with much luggage  as there merely dangled from a stick which he carried over his shoulder  a small parcel wrapped in a common handkerchief  and apparently light enough
this circumstance  added to the length of his legs  which were of unusual extent  enabled him with much ease to keep some half dozen paces in advance of his companion  to whom he occasionally turned with an impatient jerk of the head  as if reproaching her tardiness  and urging her to greater exertion thus  they had toiled along the dusty road  taking little heed of any object within sight  save when they stepped aside to allow a wider passage for the mail coaches which were whirling out of town  until they passed through highgate archway  when the foremost traveller stopped and called impatiently to his companion   come on  can t yer  what a lazybones yer are  charlotte    it s a heavy load  i can tell you   said the female  coming up  almost breathless with fatigue
 heavy  what are yer talking about  what are yer made for   rejoined the male traveller  changing his own little bundle as he spoke  to the other shoulder
 oh  there yer are  resting again  well  if yer ain t enough to tire anybody s patience out  i don t know what is   494 oliver twist  is it much farther   asked the woman  resting herself against a bank  and looking up with the perspiration streaming from her face
 much farther  yer as good as there   said the long legged tramper  pointing out before him
 look there  those are the lights of london    they re a good two mile off  at least   said the woman despondingly
 never mind whether they re two mile off  or twenty   said noah claypole  for he it was   but get up and come on  or i ll kick yer  and so i give yer notice   as noah s red nose grew redder with anger  and as he crossed the road while speaking  as if fully prepared to put his threat into execution  the woman rose without any further remark  and trudged onward by his side
 where do you mean to stop for the night  noah   she asked  after they had walked a few hundred yards
 how should i know   replied noah  whose temper had been considerably impaired by walking
 near  i hope   said charlotte
 no  not near   replied mr claypole
 there  not near  so don t think it    why not    when i tell yer that i don t mean to do a thing  that s enough  without any why or because either   replied mr claypole with dignity
 well  you needn t be so cross   said his companion
 a pretty thing it would be  wouldn t it to go and stop at the very first public house outside the town  so that sowerberry  if he come up after us  might poke in his old nose  and have us taken back in a cart with handcuffs on   said mr claypole in a jeering tone
 no  i shall go and lose myself among the narrowest streets i can find  and not stop till we come to the very out of the wayest house i can set eyes on
 cod  yer may thanks yer stars i ve got a head  for if we hadn t gone  at first  the wrong road a purpose  and come back across country  yer d have been locked up hard and fast a week ago  my lady
and serve yer right for being a fool    i know i ain t as cunning as you are   replied charlotte   but don t put all the blame on me  and say i should have been locked up
you would have been if i had been  any way    yer took the money from the till  yer know yer did   said mr claypole
 i took it for you  noah  dear   rejoined charlotte
 did i keep it   asked mr claypole
 no  you trusted in me  and let me carry it like a dear  and so you are   said the lady  chucking him under the chin  and drawing her arm through his
this was indeed the case  but as it was not mr claypole s habit to repose a blind and foolish confidence in anybody  it should be observed  in justice to that gentleman  that he had trusted charlotte to this extent  in order that  if they were pursued  the money might be found on her  which would leave him an opportunity of asserting his innocence of any theft  and would greatly facilitate his chances of escape
of course  he entered at this juncture  into no explanation of 496 oliver twist his motives  and they walked on very lovingly together
in pursuance of this cautious plan  mr claypole went on  without halting  until he arrived at the angel at islington  where he wisely judged  from the crowd of passengers and numbers of vehicles  that london began in earnest
just pausing to observe which appeared the most crowded streets  and consequently the most to be avoided  he crossed into saint john s road  and was soon deep in the obscurity of the intricate and dirty ways  which  lying between gray s inn lane and smithfield  render that part of the town one of the lowest and worst that improvement has left in the midst of london
through these streets  noah claypole walked  dragging charlotte after him  now stepping into the kennel to embrace at a glance the whole external character of some small public house  now jogging on again  as some fancied appearance induced him to believe it too public for his purpose
at length  he stopped in front of one  more humble in appearance and more dirty than any he had yet seen  and  having crossed over and surveyed it from the opposite pavement  graciously announced his intention of putting up there  for the night
 so give us the bundle   said noah  unstrapping it from the woman s shoulders  and slinging it over his own   and don t yer speak  except when yer spoke to
what s the name of the house—t h r—three what    cripples   said charlotte
 three cripples   repeated noah   and a very good sign too
now  then  keep close at my heels  and come along   with these injunctions  he pushed the rattling door with his shoulder  and entered the house  followed by his companion
there was nobody in the bar but a young jew  who  with his two elbows on the counter  was reading a dirty newspaper
he stared very hard at noah  and noah stared very hard at him
if noah had been attired in his charity boy s dress  there might have been some reason for the jew opening his eyes so wide  but as he had discarded the coat and badge  and wore a short smock frock over his leathers  there seemed no particular reason for his appearance exciting so much attention in a public house
 is this the three cripples   asked noah
 that is the dabe of this  ouse   replied the jew
 a gentleman we met on the road  coming up from the country  recommended us here   said noah  nudging charlotte  perhaps to call her attention to this most ingenious device for attracting respect  and perhaps to warn her to betray no surprise
 we want to sleep here to night    i b dot certaid you cad   said barney  who was the attendant sprite   but i ll idquire    show us the tap  and give us a bit of cold meat and a drop of beer while yer inquiring  will yer   said noah
barney complied by ushering them into a small backroom  and setting the required viands before them  having done which  he informed the travellers that they could be lodged that night  and left the amiable couple to their refreshment
498 oliver twist now  this back room was immediately behind the bar  and some steps lower  so that any person connected with the house  undrawing a small curtain which concealed a single pane of glass fixed in the wall of the last named apartment  about five feet from its flooring  could not only look down upon any guests in the back room without any great hazard of being observed (the glass being in a dark angle of the wall  between which and a large upright beam the observer had to thrust himself)  but could  by applying his ear to the partition  ascertain with tolerable distinctness  their subject of conversation the landlord of the house had not withdrawn his eye from this place of espial for five minutes  and barney had only just returned from making the communication above related  when fagin  in the course of his evening s business  came into the bar to inquire after some of his young pupils
 hush   said barney   stradegers id the next roob    strangers   repeated the old man in a whisper
 ah  ad rub uds too   added barney
 frob the cuttry  but subthig in your way  or i b bistaked   fagin appeared to receive this communication with great interest
mounting a stool  he cautiously applied his eye to the pane of glass  from which secret post he could see mr claypole taking cold beef from the dish  and porter from the pot  and administering homoepathic doses of both to charlotte  who sat patiently by  eating and drinking at his pleasure
 aha   he whispered  looking round to barney   i like that fellow s looks
he d be of use to us  he knows how to train the girl already
don t make as much noise as a mouse  my dear  and let me hear  em talk—let me hear  em   he again applied his eye to the glass  and turning his ear to the partition  listened attentively  with a subtle and eager look upon his face  that might have appertained to some old goblin
 so i mean to be a gentleman   said mr claypole  kicking out his legs  and continuing a conversation  the commencement of which fagin had arrived too late to hear
 no more jolly old coffins  charlotte  but a gentleman s life for me  and  if yer like  yer shall be a lady    i should like that well enough  dear   replied charlotte   but tills ain t to be emptied every day  and people to get clear off after it    tills be blowed   said mr claypole   there s more things besides tills to be emptied    what do you mean   asked his companion
 pockets  women s ridicules  houses  mail coaches  banks   said mr claypole  rising with the porter
 but you can t do all that  dear   said charlotte
 i shall look out to get into company with them as can   replied noah
 they ll be able to make us useful some way or another
why  you yourself are worth fifty women  i never see such a precious sly and deceitful creetur as yer can be when i let yer    lor  how nice it is to hear yer say so   exclaimed charlotte  imprinting a kiss upon his ugly face
 there  that ll do  don t yer be too affectionate  in case i m cross with yer   said noah  disengaging himself with great 500 oliver twist gravity  i should like to be the captain of some band  and have the whopping of  em  and follering  em about  unbeknown to themselves that would suit me  if there was good profit  and if we could only get in with some gentleman of this sort  i say it would be cheap at that twenty pound note you ve got —especially as we don t very well know how to get rid of it ourselves   after expressing this opinion  mr claypole looked into the porter pot with an aspect of deep wisdom  and having well shaken its contents  nodded condescendingly to charlotte  and took a draught  wherewith he appeared greatly refreshed
he was meditating another  when the sudden opening of the door  and the appearance of a stranger  interrupted him
the stranger was mr fagin
and very amiable he looked  and a very low bow he made  as he advanced  and setting himself down at the nearest table  ordered something to drink of the grinning barney  a pleasant night  sir  but cool for the time of year   said fagin  rubbing his hands
 from the country  i see  sir    how do yer see that   asked noah claypole
 we have not so much dust as that in london   replied fagin  pointing from noah s shoes to those of his companion  and from them to the two bundles
 yer a sharp feller   said noah
 ha  ha  only hear that  charlotte    why  one need be sharp in this town  my dear   replied the jew  sinking his voice to a confidential whisper   and that s the truth   fagin followed up this remark by striking the side of his nose with his right forefinger —a gesture which noah attempted to imitate  though not with complete success  in consequence of his own nose not being large enough for the purpose
however  mr fagin seemed to interpret the endeavour as expressing a perfect coincidence with his opinion  and put about the liquor which barney reappeared with  in a very friendly manner
 good stuff that   observed mr claypole  smacking his lips
 dear   said fagin
 a man need be always emptying a till  or a pocket  or a woman s reticule  or a house  or a mailcoach  or a bank  if he drinks it regularly   mr claypole no sooner heard this extract from his own remarks than he fell back in his chair  and looked from the jew to charlotte with a countenance of ashy palences and excessive terror
 don t mind me  my dear   said fagin  drawing his chair closer
 ha  ha  it was lucky it was only me that heard you by chance
it was very lucky it was only me    i didn t take it   stammered noah  no longer stretching out his legs like an independent gentleman  but coiling them up as well as he could under his chair   it was all her doing  yer ve got it now  charlotte  yer know yer have    no matter who s got it  or who did it  my dear   replied fagin  glancing  nevertheless  with a hawk s eye at the girl and the two bundles  i m in that way myself  and i like you for it    in what way   asked mr claypole  a little recovering
502 oliver twist  in that way of business   rejoined fagin   and so are the people of the house
you ve hit the right nail upon the head  and are as safe here as you could be
there is not a safer place in all this town than is the cripples  that is  when i like to make it so
and i have taken a fancy to you and the young woman  so i ve said the word  and you may make your minds easy   noah claypole s mind might have been at ease after this assurance  but his body certainly was not  for he shuffled and writhed about  into various uncouth positions  eyeing his new friend meanwhile with mingled fear and suspicion
 i ll tell you more   said fagin  after he had reassured the girl  by dint of friendly nods and muttered encouragements
 i have got a friend that i think can gratify your darling wish  and put you in the right way  where you can take whatever department of the business you think will suit you best at first  and be taught all the others    yer speak as if yer were in earnest   replied noah
 what advantage would it be to me to be anything else   inquired fagin  shrugging his shoulders
 here  let me have a word with you outside    there s no occasion to trouble ourselves to move   said noah  getting his legs by gradual degrees abroad again
 she ll take the luggage upstairs the while
charlotte  see to them bundles   this mandate  which had been delivered with great majesty  was obeyed without the slightest demur  and charlotte made the best of her way off with the packages while noah held the door open and watched her out
 she s kept tolerably well under  ain t she   he asked as he resumed his seat  in the tone of a keeper who had tamed some wild animal
 quite perfect   rejoined fagin  clapping him on the shoulder
 you re a genius  my dear    why  i suppose if i wasn t  i shouldn t be here   replied noah
 but  i say  she ll be back if yer lose time    now  what do you think   said fagin
 if you was to like my friend  could you do better than join him    is he in a good way of business  that s where it is   responded noah  winking one of his little eyes
 the top of the tree  employs a power of hands  has the very best society in the profession    regular town maders   asked mr claypole
 not a countryman among  em  and i don t think he d take you  even on my recommendation  if he didn t run rather short of assistants just now   replied fagin
 should i have to hand over   said noah  slapping his breeches pocket
 it couldn t possibly be done without   replied fagin  in a most decided manner
 twenty pound  though—it s a lot of money    not when it s in a note you can t get rid of   retorted fagin
 number and date taken  i suppose  payment stopped at the bank  ah  it s not worth much to him
it ll have to go abroad  and he couldn t sell it for a great deal in the market    when could i see him   asked noah doubtfully
 to morrow morning   504 oliver twist  where    here    um   said noah
 what s the wages    live like a gentleman—board and lodging  pipes and spirits free—half of all you earn  and half of all the young woman earns   replied mr fagin
whether noah claypole  whose rapacity was none of the least comprehensive  would have acceded even to these glowing terms  had he been a perfectly free agent  is very doubtful  but as he recollected that  in the event of his refusal  it was in the power of his new acquaintance to give him up to justice immediately (and more unlikely things had come to pass)  he gradually relented  and said he thought that would suit him  but  yer see   observed noah   as she will be able to do a good deal  i should like to take something very light    a little fancy work   suggested fagin
 ah  something of that sort   replied noah
 what do you think would suit me now  something not too trying for the strength  and not very dangerous  you know
that s the sort of thing    i heard you talk of something in the spy way upon the others  my dear   said fagin
 my friend wants somebody who would do that well  very much    why  i did mention that  and i shouldn t mind turning my hand to it sometimes   rejoined mr claypole slowly   but it wouldn t pay by itself  you know    that s true   observed the jew  ruminating or pretending to ruminate
 no  it might not    what do you think  then   asked noah  anxiously regarding him
 something in the sneaking way  where it was pretty sure work  and not much more risk than being at home    what do you think of the old ladies   asked fagin
 there s a good deal of money made in snatching their bags and parcels  and running round the corner    don t they holler out a good deal  and scratch sometimes   asked noah  shaking his head
 i don t think that would answer my purpose
ain t there any other line open    stop   said fagin  laying his hand on noah s knee
 the kinchin lay    the kinchins  my dear   said fagin   is the young children that s sent on errands by their mothers  with sixpences and shillings  and the lay is just to take their money away— they ve always got it ready in their hands —then knock  em into the kennel  and walk off very slow  as if there were nothing else the matter but a child fallen down and hurt itself
ha  ha  ha    ha  ha   roared mr claypole  kicking up his legs in an ecstasy
 lord  that s the very thing    to be sure it is   replied fagin   and you can have a few good beats chalked out in camden town  and battle bridge  and neighborhoods like that  where they re always going errands  and you can upset as many kinchins as you want  any hour in the day
ha  ha  ha   with this  fagin poked mr claypole in the side  and they joined in a burst of laughter both long and loud
506 oliver twist  well  that s all right   said noah  when he had recovered himself  and charlotte had returned  what time to morrow shall we say    will ten do   asked fagin  adding  as mr claypole nodded assent   what name shall i tell my good friend    mr bolter   replied noah  who had prepared himself for such emergency  mr morris bolter
this is mrs bolter    mrs bolter s humble servant   said fagin  bowing with grotesque politeness  i hope i shall know her better very shortly    do you hear the gentleman  charlotte   thundered mr claypole  yes  noah  dear   replied mrs bolter  extending her hand  she calls me noah  as a sort of fond way of talking   said mr morris bolter  late claypole  turning to fagin
 you understand    oh yes  i understand—perfectly   replied fagin  telling the truth for once
 good night  good night   with many adieus and good wishes  mr fagin went his way
noah claypole  bespeaking his good lady s attention  proceeded to enlighten her relative to the arrangement he had made  with all that haughtiness and air of superiority  becoming  not only a member of the sterner sex  but a gentleman who appreciated the dignity of a special appointment on the kinchin lay  in london and its vicinity
wherein is shown how the artful dodger got into trouble  and so it was you that was your own friend  was it   asked mr claypole  otherwise bolter  when  by virtue of the compact entered into between them  he had removed next day to fagin s house
  cod  i thought as much last night    every man s his own friend  my dear   replied fagin  with his most insinuating grin
 he hasn t as good a one as himself anywhere    except sometimes   replied morris bolter  assuming the air of a man of the world  some people are nobody s enemies but their own  yer know    don t believe that   said fagin
 when a man s his own enemy  it s only because he s too much his own friend  not because he s careful for everybody but himself pooh  pooh  there ain t such a thing in nature    there oughn t to be  if there is   replied mr bolter
 that stands to reason
some conjurers say that number 508 oliver twist three is the magic number  and some say number seven
it s neither  my friend  neither
it s number one
 ha  ha   cried mr bolter
 number one for ever    in a little community like ours  my dear   said fagin  who felt it necessary to qualify this position   we have a general number one  without considering me too as the same  and all the other young people    oh  the devil   exclaimed mr bolter
 you see   pursued fagin  affecting to disregard this interruption   we are so mixed up together  and identified in our interests  that it must be so
for instance  it s your object to take care of number one—meaning yourself    certainly   replied mr bolter
 yer about right there    well  you can t take care of yourself  number one  without taking care of me  number one    number two  you mean   said mr bolter  who was largely endowed with the quality of selfishness
 no  i don t   retorted fagin
 i m of the same importance to you  as you are to yourself    i say   interrupted mr bolter   yer a very nice man  and i m very fond of yer  but we ain t quite so thick together  as all that comes to    only think   said fagin  shrugging his shoulders  and stretching out his hands   only consider you ve done what s a very pretty thing  and what i love you for doing  but what at the same time would put the cravat round your throat  that s so very easily tied and so very difficult to unloose—in plain english  the halter   mr bolter put his hand to his neckerchief  as if he felt it inconveniently tight  and murmured an assent  qualified in tone but not in substance
 the gallows   continued fagin   the gallows  my dear  is an ugly finger post  which points out a very short and sharp turning that has stopped many a bold fellow s career on the broad highway
to keep in the easy road  and keep it at a distance  is object number one with you    of course it is   replied mr bolter
 what do yer talk about such things for    only to show you my meaning clearly   said the jew  raising his eyebrows
 to be able to do that  you depend upon me
to keep my little business all snug  i depend upon you
the first is your number one  the second my number one
the more you value your number one  the more careful you must be of mine  so we come at last to what i told you at first—that a regard for number one holds us all together  and must do so  unless we would all go to pieces in company    that s true   rejoined mr bolter  thoughtfully
 oh  yer a cunning old codger   mr fagin saw  with delight  that this tribute to his powers was no mere compliment  but that he had really impressed his recruit with a sense of his wily genius  which it was most important that he should entertain in the outset of their acquaintance
to strengthen an impression so desirable and useful  he followed up the blow by acquainting him  in some detail  with the magnitude and extent of his operations  blending truth and fiction together  as best served his purpose  and bringing both to bear  with so much 510 oliver twist art  that mr bolter s respect visibly increased  and became tempered  at the same time  with a degree of wholesome fear  which it was highly desirable to awaken
 it s this mutual trust we have in each other that consoles me under heavy losses   said fagin
 my best hand was taken from me  yesterday morning    you don t mean to say he died   cried mr bolter
 no  no   replied fagin   not so bad as that
not quite so bad    what  i suppose he was—   wanted   interposed fagin
 yes  he was wanted    very particular   inquired mr bolter
 no   replied fagin   not very
he was charged with attempting to pick a pocket  and they found a silver snuff box on him —his own  my dear  his own  for he took snuff himself  and was very fond of it they remanded him till to day  for they thought they knew the owner
ah  he was worth fifty boxes  and i d give the price of as many to have him back
you should have known the dodger  my dear  you should have known the dodger    well  but i shall know him  i hope  don t yer think so   said mr bolter
 i m doubtful about it   replied fagin  with a sigh
 if they don t get any fresh evidence  it ll only be a summary conviction  and we shall have him back again after six weeks or so  but  if they do  it s a case of lagging
they know what a clever lad he is  he ll be a lifer
they ll make the artful nothing less than a lifer    what do you mean by lagging and a lifer   demanded mr bolter
 what s the good of talking in that way to me  why don t yer speak so as i can understand yer   fagin was about to translate these mysterious expressions into the vulgar tongue  and  being interpreted  mr bolter would have been informed that they represented that combination of words   transportation for life   when the dialogue was cut short by the entry of master bates  with his hands in his breeches pockets  and his face twisted into a look of semi comical woe
 it s all up  fagin   said charley  when he and his new companion had been made known to each other
 what do you mean    they ve found the gentleman as owns the box  two or three more s a coming to  dentify him  and the artful s booked for a passage out   replied master bates
 i must have a full suit of mourning  fagin  and a hatband  to wisit him in  afore he sets out upon his travels
to think of jack dawkins—lummy jack—the dodger—the artful dodger—going abroad for a common twopenny halfpenny sneeze box  i never thought he d a done it under a gold watch  chain  and seals  at the lowest
oh  why didn t he rob some rich old gentleman of all his walables  and go out as a gentleman  and not like a common prig  without no honour nor glory   with this expression of feeling for his unfortunate friend  master bates sat himself on the nearest chair with an aspect of chagrin and despondency  what do you talk about his having neither honour nor glory for   exclaimed fagin  darting an angry look at his 512 oliver twist pupil
 wasn t he always the top sawyer among you all  is there one of you that could touch him or come near him on any scent  eh    not one   replied master bates  in a voice rendered husky by regret   not one    then what do you talk of   replied fagin angrily   what are you blubbering for     cause it isn t on the rec ord  is it   said charley  chafed into perfect defiance of his venerable friend by the current of his regrets    cause it can t come out in the  dictment   cause nobody will never know half of what he was
how will he stand in the newgate calendar  p raps not be there at all
oh  my eye  my eye  wot a blow it is    ha  ha   cried fagin  extending his right hand  and turning to mr bolter in a fit of chuckling which shook him as though he had the palsy   see what a pride they take in their profession  my dear
ain t it beautiful   mr bolter nodded assent  and fagin  after contemplating the grief of charley bates for some seconds with evident satisfaction  stepped up to that young gentleman and patted him on the shoulder
 never mind  charley   said fagin soothingly   it ll come out  it ll be sure to come out
they ll all know what a clever fellow he was  he ll show it himself  and not disgrace his old pals and teachers think how young he is too  what a distinction  charley  to be lagged at his time of life    well  it is a honour that is   said charley  a little consoled
 he shall have all he wants   continued the jew
 he shall be kept in the stone jug  charley  like a gentleman
like a gentleman  with his beer every day  and money in his pocket to pitch and toss with  if he can t spend it    no  shall he though   cried charley bates
 ay  that he shall   replied fagin   and we ll have a big wig  charley  one that s got the greatest gift of the gab  to carry on his defence  and he shall make a speech for himself too  if he likes  and we ll read it all in the papers— artful dodger—shrieks of laughter—here the court was convulsed —eh  charley  eh    ha  ha  laughed master bates   what a lark that would be  wouldn t it  fagin  i say  how the artful would bother  em wouldn t he    would   cried fagin  he shall—he will    ah  to be sure  so he will   repeated charley  rubbing his hands
 i think i see him now   cried the jew  bending his eyes upon his pupil
 so do i   cried charley bates
 ha  ha  ha  so do i
i see it all afore me  upon my soul i do  fagin
what a game  what a regular game  all the big wigs trying to look solemn  and jack dawkins addressing of  em as intimate and comfortable as if he was the judge s own son making a speech arter dinner—ha  ha  ha   in fact  mr fagin had so well humoured his young friend s eccentric disposition  that master bates  who had at first been disposed to consider the imprisoned dodger rather in the light of a victim  now looked upon him as the chief actor in a scene of most uncommon and exquisite humour  514 oliver twist and felt quite impatient for the arrival of the time when his old companion should have so favourable an opportunity of displaying his abilities
 we must know how he gets on to day  by some handy means or other   said fagin
 let me think    shall i go   asked charley
 not for the world   replied fagin
 are you mad  my dear  stark mad  that you d walk into the very place where—no  charley  no
one is enough to lose at a time    you don t mean to go yourself  i suppose   said charley with a humorous leer
 that wouldn t quite fit   replied fagin shaking his head
 then why don t you send this new cove   asked master bates  laying his hand on noah s arm
 nobody knows him    why  if he didn t mind—  observed fagin
 mind   interposed charley
 what should he have to mind    really nothing  my dear   said fagin  turning to mr bolter   really nothing    oh  i dare say about that  yer know   observed noah  backing towards the door  and shaking his head with a kind of sober alarm
 no  no—none of that
it s not in my department  that ain t    wot department has he got  fagin   inquired master bates  surveying noah s lank form with much disgust
 the cutting away when there s anything wrong  and the eating all the wittles when there s everything right  is that his branch    never mind   retorted mr bolter   and don t yer take liberties with yer superiors  little boy  or yer ll find yerself in the wrong shop   master bates laughed so vehemently at this magnificent threat  that it was some time before fagin could interpose  and represent to mr bolter that he incurred no possible danger in visiting the police office  that  inasmuch as no account of the little affair in which he had engaged  nor any description of his person  had yet been forwarded to the metropolis  it was very probable that he was not even suspected of having resorted to it for shelter  and that  if he were properly disguised  it would be as safe a spot for him to visit as any in london  inasmuch as it would be  of all places  the very last  to which he could be supposed likely to resort of his own free will
persuaded  in part  by these representations  but overborne in a much greater degree by his fear of fagin  mr bolter at length consented  with a very bad grace  to undertake the expedition
by fagin s directions  he immediately substituted for his own attire  a waggoner s frock  velveteen breeches  and leather leggings  all of which articles the jew had at hand
he was likewise furnished with a felt hat well garnished with turnpike tickets  and a carter s whip
thus equipped  he was to saunter into the office  as some country fellow from covent garden market might be supposed to do for the gratification of his curiousity  and as he was as awkward  ungainly  and raw boned a fellow as need be  mr fagin had no fear but that he would look the part to perfection
516 oliver twist these arrangements completed  he was informed of the necessary signs and tokens by which to recognise the artful dodger  and was conveyed by master bates through dark and winding ways to within a very short distance of bow street
having described the precise situation of the office  and accompanied it with copious directions how he was to walk straight up the passage  and when he got into the side  and pull off his hat as he went into the room  charley bates bade him hurry on alone  and promised to bide his return on the spot of their parting
noah claypole  or morris bolter as the reader pleases  punctually followed the directions he had received  which—master bates being pretty well acquainted with the locality—were so exact that he was enabled to gain the magisterial presence without asking any question  or meeting with any interruption by the way
he found himself jostled among a crowd of people  chiefly women  who were huddled together in a dirty frowsy room  at the upper end of which was a raised platform railed off from the rest  with a dock for the prisoners on the left hand against the wall  a box for the witnesses in the middle  and a desk for the magistrates on the right  the awful locality last named  being screened off by a partition which concealed the bench from the common gaze  and left the vulgar to imagine (if they could) the full majesty of justice there were only a couple of women in the dock  who were nodding to their admiring friends  while the clerk read some depositions to a couple of policemen and a man in plain clothes who leant over the table
a jailer stood reclining against the dock rail  tapping his nose listlessly with a large key  except when he repressed an undue tendency to conversation among the idlers  by proclaiming silence  or looked sternly up to bid some woman  take that baby out   when the gravity of justice was disturbed by feeble cries  half smothered in the mother s shawl  from some meagre infant
the room smelt close and unwholesome  the walls were dirt discoloured  and the ceiling blackened
there was an old smoky bust over the mantel shelf  and a dusty clock above the dock—the only thing present  that seemed to go on as it ought  for depravity  or poverty  or an habitual acquaintance with both  had left a taint on all the animate matter  hardly less unpleasant than the thick greasy scum on every inaminate object that frowned upon it
noah looked eagerly about him for the dodger  but although there were several women who would have done very well for that distinguished character s mother or sister  and more than one man who might be supposed to bear a strong resemblance to his father  nobody at all answering the description given him of mr dawkins was to be seen
he waited in a state of much suspense and uncertainty until the women  being committed for trial  went flaunting out  and then was quickly relieved by the appearance of another prisoner who he felt at once could be no other than the object of his visit
it was indeed mr dawkins  who  shuffling into the office with the big coat sleeves tucked up as usual  his left hand in his pocket  and his hat in his right hand  preceded the jailer  with a rolling gait altogether indescribable  and  taking his 518 oliver twist place in the dock  requested in an audible voice to know what he was placed in that  ere disgraceful sitivation for
 hold your tongue  will you   said the jailer
 i m an englishman  ain t i   rejoined the dodger
 where are my priwileges    you ll get your privileges soon enough   retorted the jailer   and pepper with  em    we ll see wot the secretary of state for the home affairs has got to say to the beaks  if i don t   replied mr dawkins
 now then  wot is this here business  i shall thank the madg strates to dispose of this here little affair  and not to keep me while they read the paper  for i ve got an appointment with a genelman in the city  and as i am a man of my word and wery punctual in business matters  he ll go away if i ain t there to my time  and then pr aps ther won t be an action for damage against them as kep me away
oh no  certainly not   at this point  the dodger  with a show of being very particular with a view to proceedings to be had thereafter  desired the jailer to communicate  the names of them two files as was on the bench   which so tickled the spectators  that they laughed almost as heartily as master bates could have done if he had heard the request
 silence there   cried the jailer
 what is this   inquired one of the magistrates
 a pick pocketing case  your worship    has the boy ever been here before    he ought to have been  a many times   replied the jailer
 he has been pretty well everywhere else
i know him well  your worship    oh  you know me  do you   cried the artful  making a note of the statement
 wery good
that s a case of deformation of character  any way   here there was another laugh  and another cry of silence
 now then  where are the witnesses   said the clerk
 ah  that s right   added the dodger
 where are they  i should like to see  em   this wish was immediately gratified  for a policeman stepped forward who had seen the prisoner attempt the pocket of an unknown gentleman in a crowd  and indeed take a handkerchief therefrom  which  being a very old one  he deliberately put back again  after trying in on his own countenance
for this reason  he took the dodger into custody as soon as he could get near him  and the said dodger  being searched  had upon his person a silver snuff box  with the owner s name engraved upon the lid
this gentleman had been discovered on reference to the court guide  and being then and there present  swore that the snuff box was his  and that he had missed it on the previous day  the moment he had disengaged himself from the crowd before referred to he had also remarked a young gentleman in the throng  particularly active in making his way about  and that young gentleman was the prisoner before him
 have you anything to ask this witness  boy   said the magistrate
 i wouldn t abase myself by descending to hold no conversation with him  replied the dodger
520 oliver twist  have you anything to say at all    do you hear his worship ask if you ve anything to say   inquired the jailer  nudging the silent dodger with his elbow
 i beg your pardon   said the dodger  looking up with an air of abstraction
 did you redress yourself to me  my man    i never see such an out and out young wagabond  your worship   observed the officer with a grin
 do you mean to say anything  you young shaver    no   replied the dodger   not here  for this ain t the shop for justice  besides which  my attorney is a breakfasting this morning with the wice president of the house of commons  but i shall have something to say elsewhere  and so will he  and so will a wery numerous and  spectable circle of acquaintance as ll make them beaks wish they d never been born  or that they d got their footmen to hang  em up to their own hat pegs  afore they let  em come out this morning to try it on upon me
i ll—   there  he s fully committed   interposed the clerk
 take him away    come on   said the jailer
 oh ah  i ll come on   replied the dodger  brushing his hat with the palm of his hand
 ah  (to the bench) it s no use your looking frightened  i won t show you no mercy  not a ha porth of it
you ll pay for this  my fine fellers
i wouldn t be you for something  i wouldn t go free  now  if you was to fall down on your knees and ask me
here  carry me off to prison  take me away   with these last words  the dodger suffered himself to be led off by the collar  threatening  till he got into the yard  to make a parliamentary business of it  and then grinning in the officer s face  with great glee and self approval having seen him locked up by himself in a little cell  noah made the best of his way back to where he had left master bates after waiting here some time  he was joined by that young gentleman  who had prudently abstained from showing himself until he had looked carefully abroad from a snug retreat  and ascertained that his new friend had not been followed by any impertinent person the two hastened back together  to bear to mr fagin the animating news that the dodger was doing full justice to his bringing up  and establishing for himself a glorious reputation 522 oliver twist the time arrives for nancy to redeem her pledge to rose maylie
she fails
adept as she was  in all the arts of cunning and dissimulation  the girl nancy could not wholly conceal the effect which the knowledge of the step she had taken  wrought upon her mind
she remembered that both the crafty jew and the brutal sikes had confided to her schemes  which had been hidden from all others  in the full confidence that she was trustworthy and beyond the reach of their suspicion
vile as those schemes were  desperate as were their originators  and bitter as were her feelings towards fagin  who had led her  step by step  deeper and deeper down into an abyss of crime and misery  whence was no escape  still  there were times when  even towards him  she felt some relenting  lest her disclosure should bring him within the iron grasp he had so long eluded  and he should fall at last—richly as he merited such a fate—by her hand
but  these were the mere wanderings of a mind unwholly to detach itself from old companions and associations  though enabled to fix itself steadily on one object  and resolved not to be turned aside by any consideration
her fears for sikes would have been more powerful inducements to recoil while there was yet time  but she had stipulated that her secret should be rigidly kept  she had dropped no clue which could lead to his discovery  she had refused  even for his sake  a refuge from all the guilt and wretchedness that encompasses her—and what more could she do  she was resolved though all her mental struggles terminated in this conclusion  they forced themselves upon her  again and again  and left their traces too she grew pale and thin  even within a few days
at times  she took no heed of what was passing before her  or no part in conversations where once  she would have been the loudest
at other times  she laughed without merriment  and was noisy without a moment afterwards—she sat silent and dejected  brooding with her head upon her hands  while the very effort by which she roused herself  told  more forcibly than even these indications  that she was ill at ease  and that her thoughts were occupied with matters very different and distant from those in the course of discussion by her companions
it was sunday night  and the bell of the nearest church struck the hour
sikes and the jew were talking  but they paused to listen
the girl looked up from the low seat on which she crouched  and listened too
eleven
524 oliver twist  an hour this side of midnight   said sikes  raising the blind to look out and returning to his seat
 dark and heavy it is too
a good night for business this    ah   replied fagin
 what a pity  bill  my dear  that there s none quite ready to be done    you re right for once   replied sikes gruffly
 it is a pity  for i m in the humour too   fagin sighed  and shook his head despondingly
 we must make up for lost time when we ve got things into a good train
that s all i know   said sikes
 that s the way to talk  my dear   replied fagin  venturing to pat him on the shoulder
 it does me good to hear you    does you good  does it   cried sikes
 well  so be it    ha  ha  ha   laughed fagin  as if he were relieved by even this concession
 you re like yourself to night  bill
quite like yourself    i don t feel like myself when you lay that withered old claw on my shoulder  so take it away   said sikes  casting off the jew s hand
 it make you nervous  bill —reminds you of being nabbed  does it   said fagin  determined not to be offended
 reminds me of being nabbed by the devil   returned sikes
 there never was another man with such a face as yours  unless it was your father  and i suppose he is singeing his grizzled red beard by this time  unless you came straight from the old  un without any father at all betwixt you  which i shouldn t wonder at  a bit   fagin offered no reply to this compliment  but  pulling sikes by the sleeve  pointed his finger towards nancy  who had taken advantage of the foregoing conversation to put on her bonnet  and was now leaving the room
 hallo   cried sikes
 nance
where s the gal going to at this time of night    not far    what answer s that   retorted sikes
 do you hear me    i don t know where   replied the girl
 then i do   said sikes  more in the spirit of obstinacy than because he had any real objection to the girl going where she listed
 nowhere
sit down    i m not well
i told you that before   rejoined the girl
 i want a breath of air    put your head out of the winder   replied sikes
 there s not enough there   said the girl
 i want it in the street    then you won t have it   replied sikes
with which assurance he rose  locked the door  took the key out  and pulling her bonnet from her head  flung it up to the top of an old press
 there   said the robber
 now stop quietly where you are  will you    it s not such a matter as a bonnet would keep me   said the girl turning very pale
 what do you mean  bill  do you know what you re doing    know what i m—oh   cried sikes  turning to fagin   she s out of her senses  you know  or she daren t talk to me in that way    you ll drive me on the something desperate   muttered the girl placing both hands upon her breast  as though to keep down by force some violent outbreak
 let me go  will 526 oliver twist you —this minute—this instant    no   said sikes
 tell him to let me go  fagin
he had better
it ll be better for him
do you hear me   cried nancy stamping her foot upon the ground
 hear you   repeated sikes turning round in his chair to confront her
 aye  and if i hear you for half a minute longer  the dog shall have such a grip on your throat as ll tear some of that screaming voice out
wot has come over you  you jade  wot is it    let me go   said the girl with great earnestness  then sitting herself down on the floor  before the door  she said   bill  let me go  you don t know what you are doing
you don t  indeed
for only one hour—do—do    cut my limbs off one by one   cried sikes  seizing her roughly by the arm   if i don t think the gal s stark raving mad
get up    not till you let me go—not till you let me go—never— never   screamed the girl
sikes looked on  for a minute  watching his opportunity  and suddenly pinioning her hands dragged her  struggling and wrestling with him by the way  into a small room adjoining  where he sat himself on a bench  and thrusting her into a chair  held her down by force she struggled and implored by turns until twelve o clock had struck  and then  wearied and exhausted  ceased to contest the point any further
with a caution  backed by many oaths  to make no more efforts to go out that night  sikes left her to recover at leisure and rejoined fagin
 whew   said the housebreaker wiping the perspiration from his face
 wot a precious strange gal that is    you may say that  bill   replied fagin thoughtfully
 you may say that    wot did she take it into her head to go out to night for  do you think   asked sikes
 come  you should know her better than me
wot does is mean    obstinacy  woman s obstinacy  i suppose  my dear    well  i suppose it is   growled sikes
 i thought i had tamed her  but she s as bad as ever    worse   said fagin thoughtfully
 i never knew her like this  for such a little cause    nor i   said sikes
 i think she s got a touch of that fever in her blood yet  and it won t come out—eh    like enough    i ll let her a little blood  without troubling the doctor  if she s took that way again   said sikes
fagin nodded an expressive approval of this mode of treatment
 she was hanging about me all day  and night too  when i was stretched on my back  and you  like a blackhearted wolf as you are  kept yourself aloof   said sikes  we was poor too  all the time  and i think  one way or other  it s worried and fretted her  and that being shut up here so long has made her restless—eh    that s it  my dear   replied the jew in a whisper
 hush   as he uttered these words  the girl herself appeared and resumed her former seat
her eyes were swollen and red  she rocked herself to and fro  tossed her head  and  after a little time  burst out laughing
528 oliver twist  why  now she s on the other tack   exclaimed sikes  turning a look of excessive surprise on his companion
fagin nodded to him to take no further notice just then  and  in a few minutes  the girl subsided into her accustomed demeanour
whispering sikes that there was no fear of her relapsing  fagin took up his hat and bade him good night
he paused when he reached the room door  and looking round  asked if somebody would light him down the dark stairs
 light him down   said sikes  who was filling his pipe
 it s a pity he should break his neck himself  and disappoint the sight seers show him a light   nancy followed the old man downstairs  with a candle
when they reached the passage  he laid his finger on his lip  and drawing close to the girl  said  in a whisper
 what is it  nancy  dear    what do you mean   replied the girl  in the same tone
 the reason of all this   replied fagin
 if he —he pointed with his skinny fore finger up the stairs— is so hard with you (he s a brute  nance  a brute beast)  why don t you—   well   said the girl  as fagin paused  with his mouth almost touching her ear  and his eyes looking into hers
 no matter just now
we ll talk of this again
you have a friend in me  nance  a staunch friend
i have the means at hand  quiet and close
if you want revenge on those that treat you like a dog—like a dog  worse than his dog  for he humours him sometimes—come to me
i say  come to me
he is the mere hound of a day  but you know me of old  nance    i know you well   replied the girls  without manifesting the least emotion
 good night   she shrank back  as fagin offered to lay his hand on hers  but said good night again  in a steady voice  and  answering his parting look with a nod of intelligence  closed the door between them
fagin walked towards his home  intent upon the thoughts that were working within his brain
he had conceived the idea—not from what had just passed though that had tended to confirm him  but slowly and by degrees—that nancy  wearied of the housebreaker s brutality  had conceived an attachment for some new friend
her altered manner  her repeated absences from home alone  her comparative indifference to the interests of the gang for which she had once been so zealous  and  added to these  her desperate impatience to leave home that night at a particular hour  all favoured the supposition  and rendered it  to him at least  almost matter of certainty
the object of this new liking was not among his myrmidons
he would be a valuable acquisition with such an assistant as nancy  and must (thus fagin argued) be secured without delay
there was another  and a darker object  to be gained
sikes knew too much  and his ruffian taunts had not galled fagin the less  because the wounds were hidden
the girl must know  well  that if she shook him off  she could never be safe from his fury  and that it would be surely wreaked— to the maiming of limbs  or perhaps the loss of life—on the object of her more recent fancy
 with a little persuasion   thought fagin   what more like  530 oliver twist ly than that she would consent to poison him  women have done such things  and worse  to secure the same object before now
there would be the dangerous villain  the man i hate  gone  another secured in his place  and my influence over the girl  with a knowledge of this crime to back it  unlimited   these things passed through the mind of fagin  during the short time he sat alone  in the housebreaker s room  and with them uppermost in his thoughts  he had taken the opportunity afterwards afforded him  of sounding the girl in the broken hints he threw out at parting
there was no expression of surprise  no assumption of an inability to understand his meaning
the girl clearly comprehended it
her glance at parting showed that
but perhaps she would recoil from a plot to take the life of sikes  and that was one of the chief ends to be attained
 how   thought fagin  as he crept homeward   can i increase my influence with her  what new power can i acquire   such brains are fertile in expedients
if  without extracting a confession from herself  he laid a watch  discovered the object of her altered regard  and threatened to reveal the whole history to sikes (of whom she stood in no common fear) unless she entered into his designs  could he not secure her compliance   i can   said fagin  almost aloud
 she durst not refuse me then
not for her life  not for her life  i have it all
the means are ready  and shall be set to work
i shall have you yet   he cast back a dark look  and a threatening motion of the hand  towards the spot where he had left the bolder villian  and went on his way  busying his bony hands in the folds of his tattered garment  which he wrenched tightly in his grasp  as though there were a hated enemy crushed with every motion of his fingers
532 oliver twist noah claypole is employed by fagin on a secret mission the old man was up  betimes  next morning  and waited impatiently for the appearance of his new associate  who after a delay that seemed interminable  at length presented himself  and commenced a voracious assault on the breakfast  bolter   said fagin  drawing up a chair and seating himself opposite morris bolter  well  here i am   returned noah
 what s the matter  don t yer ask me to do anything till i have done eating
that s a great fault in this place
yer never get time enough over yer meals    you can talk as you eat  can t you   said fagin  cursing his dear young friend s greediness from the very bottom of his heart
 oh yes  i can talk
i get on better when i talk   said noah  cutting a monstrous slice of bread
 where s charlotte    out   said fagin
 i sent her out this morning with the other young woman  because i wanted us to be alone    oh   said noah
 i wish yer d ordered her to make some buttered toast first
well
talk away
yer won t interrupt me   there seemed  indeed  no great fear of anything interrupting him  as he had evidently sat down with a determination to do a great deal of business
 you did well yesterday  my dear   said fagin
 beautiful  six shillings and ninepence halfpenny on the very first day  the kinchin lay will be a fortune to you    don t you forget to add three pint pots and a milk can   said mr bolter
 no  no  my dear
the pint pots were great strokes of genius  but the milk can was a perfect masterpiece    pretty well  i think  for a beginner   remarked mr bolter complacently
 the pots i took off airy railings  and the milk can was standing by itself outside a public house
i thought it might get rusty with the rain  or catch cold  yer know
eh  ha  ha  ha   fagin affected to laugh very heartily  and mr bolter having had his laugh out  took a series of large bites  which finished his first hunk of bread and butter  and assisted himself to a second  i want you  bolter   said fagin  leaning over the table   to do a piece of work for me  my dear  that needs great care and caution    i say   rejoined bolter   don t yer go shoving me into danger  or sending me any more o  yer police offices
that don t 534 oliver twist suit me  that don t  and so i tell yer    that s not the smallest danger in it—not the very smallest   said the jew   it s only to dodge a woman    an old woman   demanded mr bolter
 a young one   replied fagin
 i can do that pretty well  i know   said bolter
 i was a regular cunning sneak when i was at school
what am i to dodge her for  not to—   not to do anything  but to tell me where she goes  who she sees  and  if possible  what she says  to remember the street  if it is a street  or the house  if it is a house  and to bring me back all the information you can    what ll yer give me   asked noah  setting down his cup  and looking his employer  eagerly  in the face
 if you do it well  a pound  my dear
one pound   said fagin  wishing to interest him in the scent as much as possible
 and that s what i never gave yet  for any job of work where there wasn t valuable consideration to be gained    who is she   inquired noah
 one of us    oh lor   cried noah  curling up his nose
 yer doubtful of her  are yer    she had found out some new friends  my dear  and i must know who they are   replied fagin
 i see   said noah
 just to have the pleasure of knowing them  if they re respectable people  eh  ha  ha  ha  i m your man    i knew you would be   cried fagin  eleated by the success of his proposal
 of course  of course   replied noah
 where is she  where am i to wait for her  where am i to go    all that  my dear  you shall hear from me
i ll point her out at the proper time   said fagin
 you keep ready  and leave the rest to me   that night  and the next  and the next again  the spy sat booted and equipped in his carter s dress  ready to turn out at a word from fagin
six nights passed—six long weary nights—and on each  fagin came home with a disappointed face  and briefly intimated that it was not yet time
on the seventh  he returned earlier  and with an exultation he could not conceal
it was sunday
 she goes abroad to night   said fagin   and on the right errand  i m sure  for she has been alone all day  and the man she is afraid of will not be back much before daybreak
come with me
quick   noah started up without saying a word  for the jew was in a state of such intense excitement that it infected him
they left the house stealthily  and hurrying through a labyrinth of streets  arrived at length before a public house  which noah recognised as the same in which he had slept  on the night of his arrival in london
it was past eleven o clock  and the door was closed
it opened softly on its hinges as fagin gave a low whistle
they entered  without noise  and the door was closed behind them
scarcely venturing to whisper  but substituting dumb show for words  fagin  and the young jew who had admitted them  pointed out the pane of glass to noah  and signed 536 oliver twist to him to climb up and observe the person in the adjoining room
 is that the woman   he asked  scarcely above his breath
fagin nodded yes
 i can t see her face well   whispered noah
 she is looking down  and the candle is behind her
 stay there   whispered fagin
he signed to barney  who withdrew
in an instant  the lad entered the room adjoining  and  under pretence of snuffing the candle  moved it in the required position  and  speaking to the girl  caused her to raise her face
 i see her now   cried the spy
 plainly    i should know her among a thousand   he hastily descended  as the room door opened  and the girl came out
fagin drew him behind a small partition which was curtained off  and they held their breaths as she passed within a few feet of their place of concealment  and emerged by the door at which they had entered
 hist   cried the lad who held the door
 dow   noah exchanged a look with fagin  and darted out
 to the left   whispered the lad   take the left had  and keep od the other side   he did so  and  by the light of the lamps  saw the girl s retreating figure  already at some distance before him
he advanced as near as he considered prudent  and kept on the opposite side of the street  the better to observe her motions
she looked nervously round  twice or thrice  and once stopped to let two men who were following close behind her  pass on
she seemed to gather courage as she advanced  and to walk with a steadier and firmer step
the spy preserved the same relative distance between them  and followed  with his eye upon her
538 oliver twist the appointment kept the church clocks chimed three quarters past eleven  as two figures emerged on london bridge
one  which advanced with a swift and rapid step  was that of a woman who looked eagerly about her as though in quest of some expected object  the other figure was that of a man  who slunk along in the deepest shadow he could find  and  at some distance  accommodated his pace to hers  stopping when she stopped  and as she moved again  creeping stealthily on  but never allowing himself  in the ardour of his pursuit  to gain upon her footsteps thus  they crossed the bridge  from the middlesex to the surrey shore  when the woman  apparently disappointed in her anxious scrutiny of the foot passengers  turned back
the movement was sudden  but he who watched her  was not thrown off his guard by it  for  shrinking into one of the recesses which surmount the piers of the bridge  and leaning over the parapet the better to conceal his figure  he suffered her to pass on the opposite pavement
when she was about the same distance in advance as she had been before  he slipped quietly down  and followed her again
at nearly the centre of the bridge  she stopped
the man stopped too
it was a very dark night
the day had been unfavourable  and at that hour and place there were few people stirring
such as there were  hurried quickly past  very possibly without seeing  but certainly without noticing  either the woman  or the man who kept her in view
their appearance was not calculated to attract the importunate regards of such of london s destitute population  as chanced to take their way over the bridge that night in search of some cold arch or doorless hovel wherein to lay their heads  they stood there in silence  neither speaking nor spoken to  by any one who passed
a mist hung over the river  deepening the red glare of the fires that burnt upon the small craft moored off the different wharfs  and rendering darker and more indistinct the murky buildings on the banks
the old smoke stained storehouses on either side  rose heavy and dull from the dense mass of roofs and gables  and frowned sternly upon water too black to reflect even their lumbering shapes
the tower of old saint saviour s church  and the spire of saint magnus  so long the giant warders of the ancient bridge  were visible in the gloom  but the forest of shipping below bridge  and the thickly scattered spires of churches above  were nearly all hidden from sight
the girl had taken a few restless turns to and fro—closely watched meanwhile by her hidden observer—when the heavy bell of st
paul s tolled for the death of another day
midnight had come upon the crowded city
the palace  the night cellar  the jail  the madhouse  the chambers of birth 540 oliver twist and death  of health and sickness  the rigid face of the corpse and the calm sleep of the child  midnight was upon them all
the hour had not struck two minutes  when a young lady  accompanied by a grey haired gentleman  alighted from a hackney carriage within a short distance of the bridge  and  having dismissed the vehicle  walked straight towards it
they had scarcely set foot upon its pavement  when the girl started  and immediately made towards them
they walked onward  looking about them with the air of persons who entertained some very slight expectation which had little chance of being realised  when they were suddenly joined by this new associate
they halted with an exclamation of surprise  but suppressed it immediately  for a man in the garments of a countryman came close up— brushed against them  indeed—at that precise moment
 not here   said nancy hurriedly   i am afraid to speak to you here
come away—out of the public road—down the steps yonder   as she uttered these words  and indicated  with her hand  the direction in which she wished them to proceed  the countryman looked round  and roughly asking what they took up the whole pavement for  passed on
the steps to which the girl had pointed  were those which  on the surrey bank  and on the same side of the bridge as saint saviour s church  form a landing stairs from the river
to this spot  the man bearing the appearance of a countryman  hastened unobserved  and after a moment s survey of the place  he began to descend
these stairs are a part of the bridge  they consist of three flights
just below the end of the second  going down  the stone wall on the left terminates in an ornamental pilaster facing towards the thames
at this point the lower steps widen  so that a person turning that angle of the wall  is necessarily unseen by any others on the stairs who chance to be above him  if only a step
the countryman looked hastily round  when he reached this point  and as there seemed no better place of concealment  and  the tide being out  there was plenty of room  he slipped aside  with his back to the pilaster  and there waited  pretty certain that they would come no lower  and that even if he could not hear what was said  he could follow them again  with safety
so tardily stole the time in this lonely place  and so eager was the spy to penetrate the motives of an interview so different from what he had been led to expect  that he more than once gave the matter up for lost  and persuaded himself  either that they had stopped far above  or had resorted to some entirely different spot to hold their mysterious conversation he was on the point of emerging from his hiding place  and regaining the road above  when he heard the sound of footsteps  and directly afterwards of voices almost close at his ear
he drew himself straight upright against the wall  and  scarcely breathing  listened attentively  this is far enough   said a voice  which was evidently that of the gentleman
 i will not suffer the young lady to go any farther
many people would have distrusted you too much to have come even so far  but you see i am willing to hu  542 oliver twist mour you    to humour me   cried the voice of the girl whom he had followed
 you re considerate  indeed  sir
to humour me  well  well  it s no matter    why  for what   said the gentleman in a kinder tone   for what purpose can you have brought us to this strange place  why not have let me speak to you  above there  where it is light  and there is something stirring  instead of bringing us to this dark and dismal hole    i told you before   replied nancy   that i was afraid to speak to you there
i don t know why it is   said the girl  shuddering   but i have such a fear and dread upon me tonight that i can hardly stand    a fear of what   asked the gentleman  who seemed to pity her
 i scarcely know of what   replied the girl
 i wish i did
horrible thoughts of death  and shrouds with blood upon them  and a fear that has made me burn as if i was on fire  have been upon me all day
i was reading a book to night  to wile the time away  and the same things came into the print    imagination   said the gentleman  soothing her
 no imagination   replied the girl in a hoarse voice
 i ll swear i saw  coffin  written in every page of the book in large black letters —aye  and they carried one close to me  in the streets to night    there is nothing unusual in that   said the gentleman
 they have passed me often    real ones   rejoined the girl
 this was not   there was something so uncommon in her manner  that the flesh of the concealed listener crept as he heard the girl utter these words  and the blood chilled within him
he had never experienced a greater relief than in hearing the sweet voice of the young lady as she begged her to be calm  and not allow herself to become the prey of such fearful fancies
 speak to her kindly   said the young lady to her companion
 poor creature  she seems to need it    your haughty religious people would have held their heads up to see me as i am to night  and preached of flames and vengeance   cried the girl  oh  dear lady  why ar n t those who claim to be god s own folks as gentle and as kind to us poor wretches as you  who  having youth  and beauty  and all that they have lost  might be a little proud instead of so much humbler    ah   said the gentleman  a turk turns his face  after washing it well  to the east  when he says his prayers  these good people  after giving their faces such a rub against the world as to take the smiles off  turn with no less regularity  to the darkest side of heaven
between the mussulman and the pharisee  commend me to the first   these words appeared to be addressed to the young lady  and were perhaps uttered with the view of afffording nancy time to recover herself
the gentleman  shortly afterwards  addressed himself to her  you were not here last sunday night   he said
 i couldn t come   replied nancy   i was kept by force    by whom   544 oliver twist  him that i told the young lady of before    you were not suspected of holding any communication with anybody on the subject which has brought us here tonight  i hope   asked the old gentleman
 no   replied the girl  shaking her head
 it s not very easy for me to leave him unless he knows why  i couldn t give him a drink of laudanum before i came away    did he awake before you returned   inquired the gentleman
 no  and neither he nor any of them suspect me    good   said the gentleman
 now listen to me    i am ready   replied the girl  as he paused for a moment
 this young lady   the gentleman began   has communicated to me  and to some other friends who can be safely trusted  what you told her nearly a fortnight since
i confess to you that i had doubts  at first  whether you were to be implicitly relied upon  but now i firmly believe you are    i am   said the girl earnestly
 i repeat that i firmly believe it
to prove to you that i am disposed to trust you  i tell you without reserve  that we propose to extort the secret  whatever it may be  from the fear of this man monks
but if—if—  said the gentleman   he cannot be secured  or  if secured  cannot be acted upon as we wish  you must deliver up the jew    fagin   cried the girl  recoiling
 that man must be delivered up by you   said the gentleman
 i will not do it  i will never do it   replied the girl
 devil that he is  and worse than devil as he has been to me  i will never do that    you will not   said the gentleman  who seemed fully prepared for this answer
 never   returned the girl
 tell me why    for one reason   rejoined the girl firmly   for one reason  that the lady knows and will stand by me in  i know she will  for i have her promise  and for this other reason  besides  that  bad life as he has led  i have led a bad life too  there are many of us who have kept the same courses together  and i ll not turn upon them  who might—any of them—have turned upon me  but didn t  bad as they are    then   said the gentleman  quickly  as if this had been the point he had been aiming to attain   put monks into my hands  and leave him to me to deal with    what if he turns against the others    i promise you that in that case  if the truth is forced from him  there the matter will rest  there must be circumstances in oliver s little history which it would be painful to drag before the public eye  and if the truth is once elicited  they shall go scot free    and if it is not   suggested the girl  then   pursued the gentleman   this fagin shall not be brought to justice without your consent
in such a case i could show you reasons  i think  which would induce you to yield it    have i the lady s promise for that   asked the girl
 you have   replied rose
 my true and faithful pledge    monks would never learn how you knew what you do   546 oliver twist said the girl  after a short pause
 never   replied the gentleman
 the intelligence should be brought to bear upon him  that he could never even guess    i have been a liar  and among liars from a little child   said the girl after another interval of silence   but i will take your words   after receving an assurance from both  that she might safely do so  she proceeded in a voice so low that it was often difficult for the listener to discover even the purport of what she said  to describe  by name and situation  the public house whence she had been followed that night
from the manner in which she occasionally paused  it appeared as if the gentleman were making some hasty notes of the information she communicated
when she had thoroughly explained the localities of the place  the best position from which to watch it without exciting observation  and the night and hour on which monks was most in the habit of frequenting it  she seemed to consider for a few moments  for the purpose of recalling his features and appearances more forcibly to her recollection
 he is tall   said the girl   and a strongly made man  but not stout  he has a lurking walk  and as he walks  constantly looks over his shoulder  first on one side  and then on the other
don t forget that  for his eyes are sunk in his head so much deeper than any other man s  that you might almost tell him by that alone
his face is dark  like his hair and eyes  and  although he can t be more than six or eight and twenty  withered and haggard
his lips are often discoloured and disfigured with the marks of teeth  for he has desperate fits  and sometimes even bites his hands and covers them with wounds—why did you start   said the girl  stopping suddenly
the gentleman replied  in a hurried manner  that he was not conscious of having done so  and begged her to proceed
 part of this   said the girl   i have drawn out from other people at the house i tell you of  for i have only seen him twice  and both times he was covered up in a large cloak
i think that s all i can give you to know him by
stay though   she added
 upon his throat  so high that you can see a part of it below his neckerchief when he turns his face  there is—   a broad red mark  like a burn or scald   cried the gentleman
 how s this   said the girl
 you know him   the young lady uttered a cry of surprise  and for a few moments they were so still that the listener could distinctly hear them breathe
 i think i do   said the gentleman  breaking silence
 i should by your description
we shall see
many people are singularly like each other
it may not be the same   as he expressed himself to this effect  with assumed carelessness  he took a step or two nearer the concealed spy  as the latter could tell from the distinctness with which he heard him mutter   it must be he    now   he said  returning  so it seemed by the sound  to the spot where he had stood before   you have given us most 548 oliver twist valuable assistance  young woman  and i wish you to be the better for it what can i do to serve you    nothing   replied nancy
 you will not persist in saying that   rejoined the gentleman  with a voice and emphasis of kindness that might have touched a much harder and more obdurate heart
 think now
tell me    nothing  sir   rejoined the girl  weeping
 you can do nothing to help me
i am past all hope  indeed    you put yourself beyond its pale   said the gentleman
 the past has been a dreary waste with you  of youthful energies mis spent  and such priceless treasures lavished  as the creator bestows but once and never grants again  but  for the future  you may hope
i do not say that it is in our power to offer you peace of heart and mind  for that must come as you seek it  but a quiet asylum  either in england  or  if you fear to remain here  in some foreign country  it is not only within the compass of our ability but our most anxious wish to secure you
before the dawn of morning  before this river wakes to the first glimpse of day light  you shall be placed as entirely beyond the reach of your former associates  and leave as utter an absence of all trace behind you  as if you were to disappear from the earth this moment
come  i would not have you go back to exchange one word with any old companion  or take one look at any old haunt  or breathe the very air which is pestilence and death to you
quit them all  while there is time and opportunity    she will be persuaded now   cried the young lady
 she hesitates  i am sure    i fear not  my dear   said the gentleman
 no sir  i do not   replied the girl  after a short struggle
 i am chained to my old life
i loathe and hate it now  but i cannot leave it
i must have gone too far to turn back —and yet i don t know  for if you had spoken to me so  some time ago  i should have laughed it off
but   she said  looking hastily round   this fear comes over me again
i must go home    home   repeated the young lady  with great stress upon the word
 home  lady   rejoined the girl
 to such a home as i have raised for myself with the work of my whole life
let us part
i shall be watched or seen
go  go  if i have done you any service all i ask is  that you leave me  and let me go my way alone    it is useless   said the gentleman  with a sigh
 we compromise her safety  perhaps  by staying here
we may have detained her longer than she expected already    yes  yes   urged the girl
 you have    what   cried the young lady
 can be the end of this poor creature s life    what   repeated the girl
 look before you  lady
look at that dark water
how many times do you read of such as i who spring into the tide  and leave no living thing  to care for  or bewail them
it may be years hence  or it may be only months  but i shall come to that at last    do not speak thus  pray   returned the young lady  sobbing
 it will never reach your ears  dear lady  and god forbid such horrors should   replied the girl
 good night  good  550 oliver twist night   the gentleman turned away
 this purse   cried the young lady
 take it for my sake  that you may have some resource in an hour of need and trouble    no   replied the girl
 i have not done this for money
let me have that to think of
and yet—give me something that you have worn  i should like to have something—no  no  not a ring—your gloves or handkerchief—anything that i can keep  as having belonged to you  sweet lady
there
bless you  god bless you
good night  good night   the violent agitation of the girl  and the apprehension of some discovery which would subject her to ill usage and violence  seemed to determine the gentleman to leave her  as she requested
the sound of retreating footsteps were audible and the voices ceased
the two figures of the young lady and her companion soon afterwards appeared upon the bridge
they stopped at the summit of the stairs
 hark   cried the young lady  listening
 did she call  i thought i heard her voice    no  my love   replied mr brownlow  looking sadly back
 she has not moved  and will not till we are gone   rose maylie lingered  but the old gentleman drew her arm through his  and led her  with gentle force  away
as they disappeared  the girl sunk down nearly at her full length upon one of the stone stairs  and vented the anguish of her heart in bitter tears
after a time she arose  and with feeble and tottering steps ascended the street
the astonished listener remained motionless on his post for some minutes afterwards  and having ascertained  with many cautious glances round him  that he was again alone  crept slowly from his hiding place  and returned  stealthily and in the shade of the wall  in the same manner as he had descended
peeping out  more than once  when he reached the top  to make sure that he was unobserved  noah claypole darted away at his utmost speed  and made for the jew s house as fast as his legs would carry him
552 oliver twist fatal consequences i t was nearly two hours before day break  that time which in the autumn of the year  may be truly called the dead of night  when the streets are silent and deserted  when even sounds appear to slumber  and profligacy and riot have staggered home to dream  it was at this still and silent hour  that fagin sat watching in his old lair  with face so distorted and pale  and eyes so red and blood shot  that he looked less like a man  than like some hideous phantom  moist from the grave  and worried by an evil spirit
he sat crouching over a cold hearth  wrapped in an old torn coverlet  with his face turned towards a wasting candle that stood upon a table by his side
his right hand was raised to his lips  and as  absorbed in thought  he hit his long black nails  he disclosed among his toothless gums a few such fangs as should have been a dog s or rat s stretched upon a mattress on the floor  lay noah claypole  fast asleep towards him the old man sometimes directed his eyes for an instant  and then brought them back again to the candle  which with a long burnt wick drooping almost double  and hot grease falling down in clots upon the table  plainly showed that his thoughts were busy elsewhere
indeed they were
mortification at the overthrow of his notable scheme  hatred of the girl who had dared to palter with strangers  and utter distrust of the sincerity of her refusal to yield him up  bitter disappointment at the loss of his revenge on sikes  the fear of detection  and ruin  and death  and a fierce and deadly rage kindled by all  these were the passionate considerations which  following close upon each other with rapid and ceaseless whirl  shot through the brain of fagin  as every evil thought and blackest purpose lay working at his heart
he sat without changing his attitude in the least  or appearing to tkae the smallest heed of time  until his quick ear seemed to be attracted by a footstep in the street
 at last   he muttered  wiping his dry and fevered mouth
 at last   the bell rang gently as he spoke
he crept upstairs to the door  and presently returned accompanied by a man muffled to the chin  who carried a bundle under one arm
sitting down and throwing back his outer coat  the man displayed the burly frame of sikes
 there   he said  laying the bundle on the table
 take care of that  and do the most you can with it
it s been trouble enough to get  i thought i should have been here  three hours ago   fagin laid his hand upon the bundle  and locking it in the cupboard  sat down again without speaking
but he did not take his eyes off the robber  for an instant  during this action  and now that they sat over against each other  554 oliver twist face to face  he looked fixedly at him  with his lips quivering so violently  and his face so altered by the emotions which had mastered him  that the housebreaker involuntarily drew back his chair  and surveyed him with a look of real affright
 wot now   cried sikes
 wot do you look at a man so for   fagin raised his right hand  and shook his trembling forefinger in the air  but his passion was so great  that the power of speech was for the moment gone
 damme   said sikes  feeling in his breast with a look of alarm
 he s gone mad
i must look to myself here    no  no   rejoined fagin  finding his voice
 it s not—you re not the person  bill
i ve no—no fault to find with you    oh  you haven t  haven t you   said sikes  looking sternly at him  and ostentatiously passing a pistol into a more convenient pocket
 that s lucky—for one of us
which one that is  don t matter    i ve got that to tell you  bill   said fagin  drawing his chair nearer   will make you worse than me    aye   returned the robber with an incredulous air
 tell away  look sharp  or nance will think i m lost    lost   cried fagin
 she has pretty well settled that  in her own mind  already   sikes looked with an aspect of great perplexity into the jew s face  and reading no satisfactory explanation of the riddle there  clenched his coat collar in his huge hand and shook him soundly
 speak  will you   he said   or if you don t  it shall be for want of breath
open your mouth and say wot you ve got to say in plain words
out with it  you thundering old cur  out with it    suppose that lad that s laying there—  fagin began
sikes turned round to where noah was sleeping  as if he had not previously observed him
 well   he said  resuming his former position
 suppose that lad   pursued fagin   was to peach—to blow upon us all—first seeking out the right folks for the purpose  and then having a meeting with  em in the street to paint our likenesses  describe every mark that they might know us by  and the crib where we might be most easily taken
suppose he was to do all this  and besides to blow upon a plant we ve all been in  more or less—of his own fancy  not grabbed  trapped  tried  earwigged by the parson and brought to it on bread and water —but of his own fancy  to please his own taste  stealing out at nights to find those most interested against us  and peaching to them
do you hear me   cried the jew  his eyes flashing with rage
 suppose he did all this  what then    what then   replied sikes  with a tremendous oath
 if he was left alive till i came  i d grind his skull under the iron heel of my boot into as many grains as there are hairs upon his head    what if i did it   cried fagin almost in a yell
 i  that knows so much  and could hang so many besides myself    i don t know   replied sikes  clenching his teeth and turning white at the mere suggestion
 i d do something in the jail that  ud get me put in irons  and if i was tried along 556 oliver twist with you  i d fall upon you with them in the open court  and beat your brains out afore the people
i should have such strength   muttered the robber  poising his brawny arm   that i could smash your head as if a loaded waggon had gone over it    you would    would i   said the housebreaker
 try me    if it was charley  or the dodger  or bet  or—   i don t care who   replied sikes impatiently
 whoever it was  i d serve them the same   fagin looked hard at the robber  and  motioning him to be silent  stooped over the bed upon the floor  and shook the sleeper to rouse him
sikes leant forward in his chair  looking on with his hands upon his knees  as if wondering much what all this questioning and preparation was to end in
 bolter  bolter  poor lad   said fagin  looking up with an expression of devilish anticipation  and speaking slowly and with marked emphasis
 he s tired—tired with watching for her so long —watching for her  bill    wot d ye mean   asked sikes  drawing back
fagin made no answer  but bending over the sleeper again  hauled him into a sitting posture
when his assumed name had been repeated several times  noah rubbed his eyes  and  giving a heavy yawn  looked sleepily about him
 tell me that again—once again  just for him to hear   said the jew  pointing to sikes as he spoke
 tell yer what   asked the sleepy noah  shaking himself pettishy  that about—nancy   said fagin  clutching sikes by the wrist  as if to prevent his leaving the house before he had heard enough
 you followed her    yes    to london bridge    yes    where she met two people    so she did    a gentleman and a lady that she had gone to of her own accord before  who asked her to give up all her pals  and monks first  which she did—and to describe him  which she did—and to tell her what house it was that we meet at  and go to  which she did—and where it could be best watched from  which she did—and what time the people went there  which she did
she did all this
she told it all every word without a threat  without a murmur—she did—did she not   cried fagin  half mad with fury
 all right   replied noah  scratching his head
 that s just what it was    what did they say  about last sunday    about last sunday   replied noah  considering
 why i told yer that before    again
tell it again   cried fagin  tightening his grasp on sikes  and brandishing his other hand aloft  as the foam flew from his lips
 they asked her   said noah  who  as he grew more wakeful  seemed to have a dawning perception who sikes was   they asked her why she didn t come  last sunday  as she promised
she said she couldn t   558 oliver twist  why—why  tell him that    because she was forcibly kept at home by bill  the man she had told them of before   replied noah
 what more of him   cried fagin
 what more of the man she had told them of before  tell him that  tell him that    why  that she couldn t very easily get out of doors unless he knew where she was going to   said noah   and so the first time she went to see the lady  she—ha  ha  ha  it made me laugh when she said it  that it did—she gave him a drink of laudanum    hell s fire   cried sikes  breaking fiercely from the jew
 let me go   flinging the old man from him  he rushed from the room  and darted  wildly and furiously  up the stairs
 bill  bill   cried fagin  following him hastily
 a word
only a word   the word would not have been exchanged  but that the housebreaker was unable to open the door  on which he was expending fruitless oaths and violence  when the jew came panting up
 let me out   said sikes
 don t speak to me  it s not safe
let me out  i say    hear me speak a word   rejoined fagin  laying his hand upon the lock
 you won t be—   well   replied the other
 you won t be—too—violent  bill   the day was breaking  and there was light enough for the men to see each other s faces
they exchanged one brief glance  there was a fire in the eyes of both  which could not be mistaken
 i mean   said fagin  showing that he felt all disguise was now useless   not too violent for safety
be crafty  bill  and not too bold   sikes made no reply  but  pulling open the door  of which fagin had turned the lock  dashed into the silent streets
without one pause  or moment s consideration  without once turning his head to the right or left  or raising his eyes to the sky  or lowering them to the ground  but looking straight before him with savage resolution  his teeth so tightly compressed that the strained jaw seemed starting through his skin  the robber held on his headlong course  nor muttered a word  nor relaxed a muscle  until he reached his own door
he opened it  softly  with a key  strode lightly up the stairs  and entering his own room  double locked the door  and lifting a heavy table against it  drew back the curtain of the bed
the girl was lying  half dressed  upon it
he had roused her from her sleep  for she raised herself with a hurried and startled look
 get up   said the man
 it is you  bill   said the girl  with an expression of pleasure at his return
 it is   was the reply
 get up   there was a candle burning  but the man hastily drew it from the candlestick  and hurled it under the grate
seeing the faint light of early day without  the girl rose to undraw the curtain
 let it be   said sikes  thrusting his hand before her
560 oliver twist  there s enough light for wot i ve got to do    bill   said the girl  in the low voice of alarm   why do you look like that at me   the robber sat regarding her  for a few seconds  with dilated nostrils and heaving breast  and then  grasping her by the head and throat  dragged her into the middle of the room  and looking once towards the door  placed his heavy hand upon her mouth
 bill  bill   gasped the girl  wrestling with the strength of mortal fear — i—i won t scream or cry—not once—hear me—speak to me—tell me what i have done    you know  you she devil   returned the robber  suppressing his breath
 you were watched to night  every word you said was heard    then spare my life for the love of heaven  as i spared yours   rejoined the girl  clinging to him
 bill  dear bill  you cannot have the heart to kill me
oh  think of all i have given up  only this one night  for you
you shall have time to think  and save yourself this crime  i will not loose my hold  you cannot throw me off
bill  bill  for dear god s sake  for your own  for mine  stop before you spill my blood  i have been true to you  upon my guilty soul i have   the man struggled violently  to release his arms  but those of the girl were clasped round his  and tear her as he would  he could not tear them away  bill   cried the girl  striving to lay her head upon his breast   the gentleman and that dear lady  told me to night of a home in some foreign country where i could end my days in solitude and peace
let me see them again  and beg them  on my knees  to show the same mercy and goodness to you  and let us both leave this dreadful place  and far apart lead better lives  and forget how we have lived  except in prayers  and never see each other more
it is never too late to repent
they told me so—i feel it now—but we must have time—a little  little time   the housebreaker freed one arm  and grasped his pistol
the certainty of immediate detection if he fired  flashed across his mind even in the midst of his fury  and he beat it twice with all the force he could summon  upon the upturned face that almost touched his own
she staggered and fell  nearly blinded with the blood that rained down from a deep gash in her forehead  but raising herself  with difficulty  on her knees  drew from her bosom a white handkerchief—rose maylie s own—and holding it up  in her folded hands  as high towards heaven as her feeble strength would allow  breathed one prayer for mercy to her maker
it was a ghastly figure to look upon
the murderer staggering backward to the wall  and shutting out the sight with his hand  seized a heavy club and struck her down
562 oliver twist the flight of sikes of all bad deeds that  under cover of the darkness  had been committed with wide london s bounds since night hung over it  that was the worst
of all the horrors that rose with an ill scent upon the morning air  that was the foulest and most cruel
the sun—the bright sun  that brings back  not light alone  but new life  and hope  and freshness to man—burst upon the crowded city in clear and radiant glory
through costly coloured glass and paper mended window  through cathedral dome and rotten crevice  it shed its equal ray
it lighted up the room where the murdered woman lay
it did
he tried to shut it out  but it would stream in
if the sight had been a ghastly one in the dull morning  what was it  now  in all that brilliant light  he had not moved  he had been afraid to stir
there had been a moan and motion of the hand  and  with terror added to rage  he had struck and struck again
once he threw a rug over it  but it was worse to fancy the eyes  and imagine them moving towards him  than to see them glaring upward  as if watching the reflection of the pool of gore that quivered and danced in the sunlight on the ceiling
he had plucked it off again
and there was the body—mere flesh and blood  nor more—but such flesh  and so much blood  he struck a light  kindled a fire  and thrust the club into it
there was hair upon the end  which blazed and shrunk into a light cinder  and  caught by the air  whirled up the chimney
even that frightened him  sturdy as he was  but he held the weapon till it broke  and then piled it on the coals to burn away  and smoulder into ashes
he washed himself  and rubbed his clothes  there were spots that would not be removed  but he cut the pieces out  and burnt them how those stains were dispersed about the room  the very feet of the dog were bloody
all this time he had  never once  turned his back upon the corpse  no  not for a moment
such preparations completed  he moved  backward  towards the door  dragging the dog with him  lest he should soil his feet anew and carry out new evidence of the crime into the streets
he shut the door softly  locked it  took the key  and left the house
he crossed over  and glanced up at the window  to be sure that nothing was visible from the outside
there was the curtain still drawn  which she would have opened to admit the light she never saw again
it lay nearly under there
he knew that
god  how the sun poured down upon the very spot  the glance was instantaneous
it was a relief to have got free of the room
he whistled on the dog  and walked rapidly away
he went through islington  strode up the hill at high  564 oliver twist gate on which stands the stone in honour of whittington  turned down to highgate hill  unsteady of purpose  and uncertain where to go  struck off to the right again  almost as soon as he began to descend it  and taking the foot path across the fields  skirted caen wood  and so came on hampstead heath
traversing the hollow by the vale of heath  he mounted the opposite bank  and crossing the road which joins the villages of hampstead and highgate  made along the remaining portion of the heath to the fields at north end  in one of which he laid himself down under a hedge  and slept soon he was up again  and away —not far into the country  but back towards london by the high road—then back again—then over another part of the same ground as he already traversed—then wandering up and down in fields  and lying on ditches  brinks to rest  and starting up to make for some other spot  and do the same  and ramble on again
where could he go  that was near and not too public  to get some meat and drink  hendon
that was a good place  not far off  and out of most people s way
thither he directed his steps —running sometimes  and sometimes  with a strange perversity  loitering at a snail s pace  or stopping altogether and idly breaking the hedges with a stick
but when he got there  all the people he met—the very children at the doors—seemed to view him with suspicion
back he turned again  without the courage to purchase bit or drop  though he had tasted no food for many hours  and once more he lingered on the heath  uncertain where to go
he wandered over miles and miles of ground  and still came back to the old place
morning and noon had passed  and the day was on the wane  and still he rambled to and fro  and up and down  and round and round  and still lingered about the same spot
at last he got away  and shaped his course for hatfield
it was nine o clock at night  when the man  quite tired out  and the dog  limping and lame from the unaccustomed exercise  turned down the hill by the church of the quiet village  and plodding along the little street  crept into a small public house  whose scanty light had guided them to the spot
there was a fire in the tap room  and some countrylabourers were drinking before it
they made room for the stranger  but he sat down in the furthest corner  and ate and drank alone  or rather with his dog  to whom he cast a morsel of food from time to time
the conversation of the men assembled here  turned upon the neighboring land  and farmers  and when those topics were exhausted  upon the age of some old man who had been buried on the previous sunday  the young men present considering him very old  and the old men present declaring him to have been quite young—not older  one white haired grandfather said  than he was—with ten or fifteen year of life in him at least—if he had taken care  if he had taken care
there was nothing to attract attention  or excite alarm in this
the robber  after paying his reckoning  sat silent and unnoticed in his corner  and had almost dropped asleep  when he was half wakened by the noisy entrance of a new comer
566 oliver twist this was an antic fellow  half pedlar and half mountebank  who travelled about the country on foot to vend hones  stops  razors  washballs  harness paste  medicine for dogs and horses  cheap perfumery  cosmetics  and suchlike wares  which he carried in a case slung to his back
his entrance was the signal for various homely jokes with the countrymen  which slackened not until he had made his supper  and opened his box of treasures  when he ingeniously contrived to unite business with amusement
 and what be that stoof  good to eat  harry   asked a grinning countryman  pointing to some composition cakes in one corner
 this   said the fellow  producing one   this is the infallible and invaluable composition for removing all sorts of stain  rust  dirt  mildew  spick  speck  spot  or spatter  from silk  satin  linen  cambrick  cloth  crape  stuff  carpet  merino  muslin  bombazeen  or woollen stuff
wine stains  fruit stains  beer stains  water stains  paint stains  pitchstains  any stains  all come out at one rub with the infallible and invaluable composition
if a lady stains her honour  she has only need to swallow one cake and she s cured at once— for it s poison
if a gentleman wants to prove this  he has only need to bolt one little square  and he has put it beyond question—for it s quite as satisfactory as a pistol bullet  and a great deal nastier in the flavour  consequently the more credit in taking it
one penny a square
with all these virtues  one penny a square   there were two buyers directly  and more of the listeners plainly hesitated
the vendor observing this  increased in loquacity
 it s all bought up as fast as it can be made   said the fellow
 there are fourteen water mills  six steam engines  and a galvanic battery  always a working upon it  and they can t make it fast enough  though the men work so hard that they die off  and the widows is pensioned directly  with twenty pound a year for each of the children  and a premium of fifty for twins
one penny a square  two half pence is all the same  and four farthings is received with joy
one penny a square  wine stains  fruit stains  beer stains  water stains  paint stains  pitch stains  mud stains  blood stains  here is a stain upon the hat of a gentleman in company  that i ll take clean out  before he can order me a pint of ale    hah   cried sikes starting up
 give that back    i ll take it clean out  sir   replied the man  winking to the company   before you can come across the room to get it
gentlemen all  observe the dark stain upon this gentleman s hat  no wider than a shilling  but thicker than a half crown
whether it is a wine stain  fruit stain  beer stain  waterstain  paint stain  pitch stain  mud stain  or blood stain—  the man got no further  for sikes with a hideous imprecation overthrew the table  and tearing the hat from him  burst out of the house
with the same perversity of feeling and irresolution that had fastened upon him  despite himself  all day  the murderer  finding that he was not followed  and that they most probably considered him some drunken sullen fellow  turned back up the town  and getting out of the glare of the lamps of a stage coach that was standing in the street  568 oliver twist was walking past  when he recognised the mail from london  and saw that it was standing at the little post office he almost knew what was to come  but he crossed over  and listened
the guard was standing at the door  waiting for the letter bag
a man  dressed like a game keeper  came up at the moment  and he handed him a basket which lay ready on the pavement
 that s for your people   said the guard
 now  look alive in there  will you
damn that  ere bag  it warn t ready night afore last  this won t do  you know    anything new up in town  ben   asked the game keeper  drawing back to the window shutters  the better to admire the horses
 no  nothing that i knows on   replied the man  pulling on his gloves
 corn s up a little
i heerd talk of a murder  too  down spitalfields way  but i don t reckon much upon it    oh  that s quite true   said a gentleman inside  who was looking out of the window
 and a dreadful murder it was    was it  sir   rejoined the guard  touching his hat
 man or woman  pray  sir    a woman   replied the gentleman
 it is supposed—   now  ben   replied the coachman impatiently
 damn that  ere bag   said the guard   are you gone to sleep in there    coming   cried the office keeper  running out
 coming   growled the guard
 ah  and so s the young  ooman of property that s going to take a fancy to me  but i don t know when
here  give hold
all ri—ight   the horn sounded a few cheerful notes  and the coach was gone
sikes remained standing in the street  apparently unmoved by what he had just heard  and agitated by no stronger feeling than a doubt where to go
at length he went back again  and took the road which leads from hatfield to st
albans
he went on doggedly  but as he left the town behind him  and plunged into the solitude and darkness of the road  he felt a dread and awe creeping upon him which shook him to the core
every object before him  substance or shadow  still or moving  took the semblance of some fearful thing  but these fears were nothing compared to the sense that haunted him of that morning s ghastly figure following at his heels
he could trace its shadow in the gloom  supply the smallest item of the outline  and note how stiff and solemn it seemed to stalk along
he could hear its garments rustling in the leaves  and every breath of wind came laden with that last low cry
if he stopped it did the same
if he ran  it followed—not running too  that would have been a relief  but like a corpse endowed with the mere machinery of life  and borne on one slow melancholy wind that never rose or fell
at times  he turned  with desperate determination  resolved to beat this phantom off  though it should look him dead  but the hair rose on his head  and his blood stood still  for it had turned with him and was behind him then
he had kept it before him that morning  but it was behind now—always
he leaned his back against a bank  and felt that it stood above him  visibly out against the cold night  570 oliver twist sky
he threw himself upon the road—on his back upon the road at his head it stood  silent  erect  and still—a living grave stone  with its epitaph in blood
let no man talk of murderers escaping justice  and hint that providence must sleep
there were twenty score of violent deaths in one long minute of that agony of fear
there was a shed in a field he passed  that offered shelter for the night
before the door  were three tall poplar trees  which made it very dark within  and the wind moaned through them with a dismal wail
he could not walk on  till daylight came again  and here he stretched himself close to the wall—to undergo new torture for now  a vision came before him  as constant and more terrible than that from which he had escaped those widely staring eyes  so lustreless and so glassy  that he had better borne to see them than think upon them  appeared in the midst of the darkness  light in themselves  but giving light to nothing there were but two  but they were everywhere
if he shut out the sight  there came the room with every wellknown object—some  indeed  that he would have forgotten  if he had gone over its contents from memory—each in its accustomed place
the body was in its place  and its eyes were as he saw them when he stole away
he got up  and rushed into the field without
the figure was behind him
he re entered the shed  and shrunk down once more
the eyes were there  before he had laid himself along and here he remained in such terror as none but he can know  trembling in every limb  and the cold sweat starting from every pore  when suddenly there arose upon the nightwind the noise of distant shouting  and the roar of voices mingled in alarm and wonder
any sound of men in that lonely place  even though it conveyed a real cause of alarm  was something to him
he regained his strength and energy at the prospect of personal danger  and springing to his feet  rushed into the open air
the broad sky seemed on fire
rising into the air with showers of sparks  and rolling one above the other  were sheets of flame  lighting the atmosphere for miles round  and driving clouds of smoke in the direction where he stood
the shouts grew louder as new voices swelled the roar  and he could hear the cry of fire  mingled with the ringing of an alarm bell  the fall of heavy bodies  and the crackling of flames as they twined round some new obstacle  and shot aloft as though refreshed by food
the noise increased as he looked
there were people there—men and women—light  bustle
it was like new life to him
he darted onward—straight  headlong—dashing through brier and brake  and leaping gate and fence as madly as his dog  who careered with loud and sounding bark before him
he came upon the spot
there were half dressed figures tearing to and fro  some endeavouring to drag the frightened horses from the stables  others driving the cattle from the yard and out houses  and others coming laden from the burning pile  amidst a shower of falling sparks  and the tumbling down of red hot beams the apertures  where doors and windows stood an hour ago  disclosed a mass of raging fire  walls rocked and crumbled into the burning well  the molten lead and iron poured down  white hot  upon the 572 oliver twist ground
women and children shrieked  and men encouraged each other with noisy shouts and cheers
the clanking of the engine pumps  and the spirting and hissing of the water as it fell upon the blazing wood  added to the tremendous roar
he shouted  too  till he was hoarse  and flying from memory and himself  plunged into the thickest of the throng hither and thither he dived that night  now working at the pumps  and now hurrying through the smoke and flame  but never ceasing to engage himself wherever noise and men were thickest up and down the ladders  upon the roofs of buildings  over floors that quaked and trembled with his weight  under the lee of falling bricks and stones  in every part of that great fire was he  but he bore a charmed life  and had neither scratch nor bruise  nor weariness nor thought  till morning dawned again  and only smoke and blackened ruins remained
this mad excitement over  there returned  with ten fold force  the dreadful consciousness of his crime
he looked suspiciously about him  for the men were conversing in groups  and he feared to be the subject of their talk
the dog obeyed the significant beck of his finger  and they drew off  stealthily  together
he passed near an engine where some men were seated  and they called to him to share in their refreshment
he took some bread and meat  and as he drank a draught of beer  heard the firemen  who were from london  talking about the murder
 he has gone to birmingham  they say   said one   but they ll have him yet  for the scouts are out  and by to morrow night there ll be a cry all through the country   he hurried off  and walked till he almost dropped upon the ground  then lay down in a lane  and had a long  but broken and uneasy sleep
he wandered on again  irresolute and undecided  and oppressed with the fear of another solitary night
suddenly  he took the desperate resolution to going back to london
 there s somebody to speak to there  at all event   he thought
 a good hiding place  too
they ll never expect to nab me there  after this country scent
why can t i lie by for a week or so  and  forcing blunt from fagin  get abroad to france  damme  i ll risk it   he acted upon this impluse without delay  and choosing the least frequented roads began his journey back  resolved to lie concealed within a short distance of the metropolis  and  entering it at dusk by a circuitous route  to proceed straight to that part of it which he had fixed on for his destination
the dog  though
if any description of him were out  it would not be forgotten that the dog was missing  and had probably gone with him
this might lead to his apprehension as he passed along the streets
he resolved to drown him  and walked on  looking about for a pond  picking up a heavy stone and tying it to his handerkerchief as he went
the animal looked up into his master s face while these preparations were making  whether his instinct apprehended something of their purpose  or the robber s sidelong look at him was sterner than ordinary  he skulked a little farther in the rear than usual  and cowered as he came more slowly 574 oliver twist along
when his master halted at the brink of a pool  and looked round to call him  he stopped outright
 do you hear me call  come here   cried sikes
the animal came up from the very force of habit  but as sikes stooped to attach the handkerchief to his throat  he uttered a low growl and started back
 come back   said the robber
the dog wagged his tail  but moved not
sikes made a running noose and called him again
the dog advanced  retreated  paused an instant  and scoured away at his hardest speed
the man whistled again and again  and sat down and waited in the expectation that he would return
but no dog appeared  and at length he resumed his journey
monks and mr brownlow at length meet
their conversation  and the intelligence that interrupts it the twilight was beginning to close in  when mr brownlow alighted from a hackney coach at his own door  and knocked softly
the door being opened  a sturdy man got out of the coach and stationed himself on one side of the steps  while another man  who had been seated on the box  dismounted too  and stood upon the other side at a sign from mr brownlow  they helped out a third man  and taking him between them  hurried him into the house
this man was monks
they walked in the same manner up the stairs without 576 oliver twist speaking  and mr brownlow  preceding them  led the way into a back room
at the door of this apartment  monks  who had ascended with evident reluctance  stopped
the two men looked at the old gentleman as if for instructions
 he knows the alternative   said mr browlow
 if he hesitates or moves a finger but as you bid him  drag him into the street  call for the aid of the police  and impeach him as a felon in my name    how dare you say this of me   asked monks
 how dare you urge me to it  young man   replied mr brownlow  confronting him with a steady look
 are you mad enough to leave this house  unhand him
there  sir
you are free to go  and we to follow
but i warn you  by all i hold most solemn and most sacred  that instant will have you apprehended on a charge of fraud and robbery
i am resolute and immoveable
if you are determined to be the same  your blood be upon your own head    by what authority am i kidnapped in the street  and brought here by these dogs   asked monks  looking from one to the other of the men who stood beside him
 by mine   replied mr brownlow
 those persons are indemnified by me
if you complain of being deprived of your liberty—you had power and opportunity to retrieve it as you came along  but you deemed it advisable to remain quiet—i say again  throw yourself for protection on the law
i will appeal to the law too  but when you have gone too far to recede  do not sue to me for leniency  when the power will have passed into other hands  and do not say i plunged you down the gulf into which you rushed  yourself   monks was plainly disconcerted  and alarmed besides
he hesitated
 you will decide quickly   said mr brownlow  with perfect firmness and composure
 if you wish me to prefer my charges publicly  and consign you to a punishment the extent of which  although i can  with a shudder  foresee  i cannot control  once more  i say  for you know the way
if not  and you appeal to my forbearance  and the mercy of those you have deeply injured  seat yourself  without a word  in that chair
it has waited for you two whole days   monks muttered some unintelligible words  but wavered still
 you will be prompt   said mr brownlow
 a word from me  and the alternative has gone for ever   still the man hesitated
 i have not the inclination to parley   said mr brownlow   and  as i advocate the dearest interests of others  i have not the right    is there—  demanded monks with a faltering tongue —  is there—no middle course    none   monks looked at the old gentleman  with an anxious eye  but  reading in his countenance nothing but severity and determination  walked into the room  and  shrugging his shoulders  sat down
 lock the door on the outside   said mr brownlow to the attendants   and come when i ring   the men obeyed  and the two were left alone together
 this is pretty treatment  sir   said monks  throwing down 578 oliver twist his hat and cloak   from my father s oldest friend    it is because i was your father s oldest friend  young man   returned mr brownlow   it is because the hopes and wishes of young and happy years were bound up with him  and that fair creature of his blood and kindred who rejoined her god in youth  and left me here a solitary  lonely man  it is because he knelt with me beside his only sisters  deathbed when he was yet a boy  on the morning that would—but heaven willed otherwise—have made her my young wife  it is because my seared heart clung to him  from that time forth  through all his trials and errors  till he died  it is because old recollections and associations filled my heart  and even the sight of you brings with it old thoughts of him  it is because of all these things that i am moved to treat you gently now—yes  edward leeford  even now—and blush for your unworthiness who bear the name    what has the name to do with it   asked the other  after contemplating  half in silence  and half in dogged wonder  the agitation of his companion
 what is the name to me    nothing   replied mr brownlow   nothing to you
but it was hers  and even at this distance of time brings back to me  an old man  the glow and thrill which i once felt  only to hear it repeated by a stranger
i am very glad you have changed it—very—very    this is all mighty fine   said monks (to retain his assumed designation) after a long silence  during which he had jerked himself in sullen defiance to and fro  and mr brownlow had sat  shading his face with his hand  but what do you want with me    you have a brother   said mr brownlow  rousing himself   a brother  the whisper of whose name in your ear when i came behind you in the street  was  in itself  almost enough to make you accompany me hither  in wonder and alarm    i have no brother   replied monks  you know i was an only child
why do you talk to me of brothers  you know that  as well as i    attend to what i do know  and you may not   said mr brownlow
 i shall interest you by and by
i know that of the wretched marriage  into which family pride  and the most sordid and narrowest of all ambition  forced your unhappy father when a mere boy  you were the sole and most unnatural issue    i don t care for hard names   interrupted monks with a jeering laugh  you know the fact  and that s enough for me    but i also know   pursued the old gentleman   the misery  the slow torture  the protracted anguish of that ill assorted union
i know how listlessly and wearily each of that wretched pair dragged on their heavy chain through a world that was poisoned to them both i know how cold formalities were succeeded by open taunts  how indifference gave place to dislike  dislike to hate  and hate to loathing  until at last they wrenched the clanking bond asunder  and retiring a wide space apart  carried each a galling fragment  of which nothing but death could break the rivets  to hide it in new society beneath the gayest looks they could assume
your mother succeeded  she forgot it soon
but it rusted and cankered at your father s heart for years   580 oliver twist  well  they were separated   said monks   and what of that    when they had been separated for some time   returned mr brownlow   and your mother  wholly given up to continental frivolities  had utterly forgotten the young husband ten good years her junior  who  with prospects blighted  lingered on at home  he fell among new friends
this circumstance  at least  you know already    not i   said monks  turning away his eyes and beating his foot upon the ground  as a man who is determined to deny everything  not i    your manner  no less than your actions  assures me that you have never forgotten it  or ceased to think of it with bitterness   returned mr brownlow
 i speak of fifteen years ago  when you were not more than eleven years old  and your father but one and thirty—for he was  i repeat  a boy  when his father ordered him to marry
must i go back to events which cast a shade upon the memory of your parent  or will you spare it  and disclose to me the truth    i have nothing to disclose   rejoined monks
 you must talk on if you will    these new friends  then   said mr brownlow   were a naval officer retired from active service  whose wife had died some half a year before  and left him with two children— there had been more  but  of all their family  happily but two survived
they were both daughters  one a beautiful creature of nineteen  and the other a mere child of two or three years old    what s this to me   asked monks
 they resided   said mr brownlow  without seeming to hear the interruption   in a part of the country to which your father in his wandering had repaired  and where he had taken up his abode
acquaintance  intimacy  friendship  fast followed on each other
your father was gifted as few men are
he had his sister s soul and person
as the old officer knew him more and more  he grew to love him
i would that it had ended there
his daughter did the same
the old gentleman paused  monks was biting his lips  with his eyes fixed upon the floor  seeing this  he immediately resumed   the end of a year found him contracted  solemnly contracted  to that daughter  the object of the first  true  ardent  only passion of a guileless girl    your tale is of the longest   observed monks  moving restlessly in his chair
 it is a true tale of grief and trial  and sorrow  young man   returned mr brownlow   and such tales usually are  if it were one of unmixed joy and happiness  it would be very brief
at length one of those rich relations to strengthen whose interest and importance your father had been sacrificed  as others are often—it is no uncommon case—died  and to repair the misery he had been instrumental in occasioning  left him his panacea for all griefs—money
it was necessary that he should immediately repair to rome  whither this man had sped for health  and where he had died  leaving his affairs in great confusion
he went  was seized with mortal illness there  was followed  the moment the intelligence reached paris  by your mother who carried you with her  he 582 oliver twist died the day after her arrival  leaving no will—no will— so that the whole property fell to her and you   at this part of the recital monks held his breath  and listened with a face of intense eagerness  though his eyes were not directed towards the speaker
as mr brownlow paused  he changed his position with the air of one who has experienced a sudden relief  and wiped his hot face and hands
 before he went abroad  and as he passed through london on his way   said mr brownlow  slowly  and fixing his eyes upon the other s face   he came to me    i never heard of that   interrupted monks in a tone intended to appear incredulous  but savouring more of disagreeable surprise
 he came to me  and left with me  among some other things  a picture—a portrait painted by himself—a likeness of this poor girl—which he did not wish to leave behind  and could not carry forward on his hasty journey he was worn by anxiety and remorse almost to a shadow  talked in a wild  distracted way  of ruin and dishonour worked by himself  confided to me his intention to convert his whole property  at any loss  into money  and  having settled on his wife and you a portion of his recent acquisition  to fly the country—i guessed too well he would not fly alone—and never see it more even from me  his old and early friend  whose strong attachment had taken root in the earth that covered one most dear to both—even from me he withheld any more particular confession  promising to write and tell me all  and after that to see me once again  for the last time on earth
alas  that was the last time
i had no letter  and i never saw him more    i went   said mr brownlow  after a short pause   i went  when all was over  to the scene of his—i will use the term the world would freely use  for worldly harshness or favour are now alike to him—of his guilty love  resolved that if my fears were realised that erring child should find one heart and home to shelter and compassionate her
the family had left that part a week before  they had called in such trifling debts as were outstanding  discharged them  and left the place by night
why  or whithter  none can tell   monks drew his breath yet more freely  and looked round with a smile of triumph
 when your brother   said mr brownlow  drawing nearer to the other s chair   when your brother  a feeble  ragged  neglected child  was cast in my way by a stronger hand than chance  and rescued by me from a life of vice and infamy—   what   cried monks
 by me   said mr brownlow
 i told you i should interest you before long
i say by me—i see that your cunning associate suppressed my name  although for ought he knew  it would be quite strange to your ears
when he was rescued by me  then  and lay recovering from sickness in my house  his strong resemblance to this picture i have spoken of  struck me with astonishment
even when i first saw him in all his dirt and misery  there was a lingering expression in his face that came upon me like a glimpse of some old friend flashing on one in a vivid dream
i need not tell you he was snared away before i knew his history—  584 oliver twist  why not   asked monks hastily
 because you know it well    i    denial to me is vain   replied mr brownlow
 i shall show you that i know more than that    you—you—can t prove anything against me   stammered monks
 i defy you to do it    we shall see   returned the old gentleman with a searching glance
 i lost the boy  and no efforts of mine could recover him
your mother being dead  i knew that you alone could solve the mystery if anybody could  and as when i had last heard of you you were on your own estate in the west indies—whither  as you well know  you retired upon your mother s death to escape the consequences of vicious courses here—i made the voyage
you had left it  months before  and were supposed to be in london  but no one could tell where
i returned
your agents had no clue to your residence
you came and went  they said  as strangely as you had ever done  sometimes for days together and sometimes not for months  keeping to all appearance the same low haunts and mingling with the same infamous herd who had been your associates when a fierce ungovernable boy
i wearied them with new applications
i paced the streets by night and day  but until two hours ago  all my efforts were fruitless  and i never saw you for an instant    and now you do see me   said monks  rising boldly   what then  fraud and robbery are high sounding words—justified  you think  by a fancied resemblance in some young imp to an idle daub of a dead man s brother  you don t even know that a child was born of this maudlin pair  you don t even know that    i did not   replied mr brownlow  rising too   but within the last fortnight i have learnt it all
you have a brother  you know it  and him
there was a will  which your mother destroyed  leaving the secret and the gain to you at her own death
it contained a reference to some child likely to be the result of this sad connection  which child was born  and accidentally encountered by you  when your suspicions were first awakened by his resemblance to your father
you repaired to the place of his birth
there existed proofs—proofs long suppressed—of his birth and parentage
those proofs were destroyed by you  and now  in your own words to your accomplice the jew   the only proofs of the boy s identity lie at the bottom of the river  and the old hag that received them form the mother is rotting in her coffin   unworthy son  coward  liar —you  who hold your councils with thieves and murderers in dark rooms at night —you  whose plots and wiles have brought a violent death upon the head of one worth millions such as you —you  who from your cradle were gall and bitterness to your own father s heart  and in whom all evil passions  vice  and profligacy  festered  till they found a vent in a hideous disease which had made your face an index even to your mind—you  edward leeford  do you still brave me    no  no  no   returned the coward  overwhelmed by these accumulated charges  every word   cried the gentleman   every word that has 586 oliver twist passed between you and this detested villain  is known to me
shadows on the wall have caught your whispers  and brought them to my ear  the sight of the persecuted child has turned vice itself  and given it the courage and almost the attributes of virtue
murder has been done  to which you were morally if not really a party    no  no   interposed monks
 i—i knew nothing of that  i was going to inquire the truth of the story when you overtook me
i didn t know the cause
i thought it was a common quarrel    it was the partial disclosure of your secrets   replied mr brownlow
 will you disclose the whole    yes  i will    set your hand to a statement of truth and facts  and repeat it before witnesses    that i promise too    remain quietly here  until such a document is drawn up  and proceed with me to such a place as i may deem most advisable  for the purpose of attesting it    if you insist upon that  i ll do that also   replied monks
 you must do more than that   said mr brownlow
 make restitution to an innocent and unoffending child  for such he is  although the offspring of a guilty and most miserable love
you have not forgotten the provisions of the will
carry them into execution so far as your brother is concerned  and then go where you please
in this world you need meet no more   while monks was pacing up and down  meditating with dark and evil looks on this proposal and the possibilities of evading it  torn by his fears on the one hand and his hatred on the other  the door was hurriedly unlocked  and a gentleman (mr losberne) entered the room in violent agitation
 the man will be taken   he cried
 he will be taken tonight    the murderer   asked mr brownlow
 yes  yes   replied the other
 his dog has been seen lurking about some old haunt  and there seems little doubt hat his master either is  or will be  there  under cover of the darkness spies are hovering about in every direction
i have spoken to the men who are charged with his capture  and they tell me he cannot escape
a reward of a hundred pounds is proclaimed by government to night    i will give fifty more   said mr brownlow   and proclaim it with my own lips upon the spot  if i can reach it
where is mr maylie    harry  as soon as he had seen your friend here  safe in a coach with you  he hurried off to where he heard this   replied the doctor   and mounting his horse sallied forth to join the first party at some place in the outskirts agreed upon between them    fagin   said mr brownlow   what of him    when i last heard  he had not been taken  but he will be  or is  by this time
they re sure of him    have you made up your mind   asked mr brownlow  in a low voice  of monks
 yes   he replied
 you—you—will be secret with me    i will
remain here till i return
it is your only hope of 588 oliver twist safety
they left the room  and the door was again locked
 what have you done   asked the doctor in a whisper
 all that i could hope to do  and even more
coupling the poor girl s intelligence with my previous knowledge  and the result of our good friend s inquiries on the spot  i left him no loophole of escape  and laid bare the whole villainy which by these lights became plain as day
write and appoint the evening after to morrow  at seven  for the meeting
we shall be down there  a few hours before  but shall require rest  especially the young lady  who may have greater need of firmness than either you or i can quite foresee just now
but my blood boils to avenge this poor murdered creature
which way have they taken    drive straight to the office and you will be in time   replied mr losberne
 i will remain here   the two gentlemen hastily separated  each in a fever of excitement wholly uncontrollable
the pursuit and escape near to that part of the thames on which the church at rotherhithe abuts  where the buildings on the banks are dirtiest and the vessels on the river blackest with the dust of colliers and the smoke of close built low roofed houses  there exists the filthiest  the strangest  the most extraordinary of the many localities that are hidden in london  wholly unknown  even by name  to the great mass of its inhabitants
to reach this place  the visitor has to penetrate through a maze of close  narrow  and muddy streets  thronged by the rougest and poorest of waterside people  and devoted to the traffic they may be supposed to occasion
the cheapest and least delicate provisions are heaped in the shops  the coarsest and commonest articles of wearing apparel dangle at the salesman s door  and stream from the house parapet and windows
jostling with unemployed labourers of the lowest class  ballast heavers  coal whippers  brazen women  ragged children  and the raff and refuse of the river  he makes his way with difficulty along  assailed by offensive sights and smells from the narrow alleys which branch off 590 oliver twist on the right and left  and deafened by the clash of ponderous waggons that bear great piles of merchandise from the stacks of warehouses that rise from every corner
arriving  at length  in streets remoter and less frequented than those through which he has passed  he walks beneath tottering house fronts projecting over the pavement  dismantled walls that seem to totter as he passes  chimneys half crushed half hesitating to fall  windows guarded by rusty iron bars that time and dirt have almost eaten away  every imaginable sign of desolation and neglect
in such a neighborhood  beyond dockhead in the borough of southwark  stands jacob s island  surrounded by a muddy ditch  six or eight feet deep and fifteen or twenty wide when the tide is in  once called mill pond  but known in the days of this story as folly ditch
it is a creek or inlet from the thames  and can always be filled at high water by opening the sluices at the lead mills from which it took its old name
at such times  a stranger  looking from one of the wooden bridges thrown across it at mill lane  will see the inhabitants of the houses on either side lowering from their back doors and windows  buckets  pails  domestic utensils of all kinds  in which to haul the water up  and when his eye is turned from these operations to the houses themselves  his utmost astonishment will be excited by the scene before him crazy wooden galleries common to the backs of half a dozen houses  with holes from which to look upon the slime beneath  windows  broken and patched  with poles thrust out  on which to dry the linen that is never there  rooms so small  so filthy  so confined  that the air would seem too tainted even for the dirt and squalor which they shelter  wooden chambers thrusting themselves out above the mud  and threatening to fall into it—as some have done  dirt besmeared walls and decaying foundations  every repulsive lineament of poverty  every loathsome indication of filth  rot  and garbage  all these ornament the banks of folly ditch in jacob s island  the warehouses are roofless and empty  the walls are crumbling down  the windows are windows no more  the doors are falling into the streets  the chimneys are blackened  but they yield no smoke
thirty or forty years ago  before losses and chancery suits came upon it  it was a thriving place  but now it is a desolate island indeed
the houses have no owners  they are broken open  and entered upon by those who have the courage  and there they live  and there they die
they must have powerful motives for a secret residence  or be reduced to a destitute condition indeed  who seek a refuge in jacob s island
in an upper room of one of these houses—a detached house of fair size  ruinous in other respects  but strongly defended at door and window  of which house the back commanded the ditch in manner already described—there were assembled three men  who  regarding each other every now and then with looks expressive of perplexity and expectation  sat for some time in profound and gloomy silence
one of these was toby crackit  another mr chitling  and the third a robber of fifty years  whose nose had been almost beaten in  in some old scuffle  and whose face bore a frightful scar which might probably be traced to the same 592 oliver twist occasion
this man was a returned transport  and his name was kags
 i wish   said toby turning to mr chitling   that you had picked out some other crig when the two old ones got too warm  and had not come here  my fine feller    why didn t you  blunder head   said kags
 well  i thought you d have been a little more glad to see me than this   replied mr chitling  with a melancholy air
 why  look e  young gentleman   said toby   when a man keeps himself so very ex clusive as i have done  and by that means has a snug house over his head with nobody a prying and smelling about it  it s rather a startling thing to have the honour of a wisit from a young gentleman (however respectable and pleasant a person he may be to play cards with at conweniency) circumstanced as you are    especially  when the exclusive young man has got a friend stopping with him  that s arrived sooner than was expected from foreign parts  and is too modest to want to be presented to the judges on his return   added mr kags there was a short silence  after which toby crackit  seeming to abandon as hopeless any further effort to maintain his usual devil may care swagger  turned to chitling and said   when was fagin took then    just at dinner time—two o clock this afternoon
charley and i made our lucky up the wash us chimney  and bolter got into the empty water butt  head downwards  but his legs were so precious long that they stuck out at the top  and so they took him too    and bet    poor bet  she went to see the body  to speak to who it was   replied chitling  his countenance falling more and more   and went off mad  screaming and raving  and beating her head against the boards  so they put a strait weskut on her and took her to the hospital—and there she is    wot s come of young bates   demanded kags
 he hung about  not to come over here afore dark  but he ll be here soon   replied chitling
 there s nowhere else to go to now  for the people at the cripples are all in custody  and the bar of the ken—i went up there and see it with my own eyes—is filled with traps    this is a smash   observed toby  biting his lips
 there s more than one will go with this    the sessions are on   said kags   if they get the inquest over  and bolter turns king s evidence  as of course he will  from what he s said already  they can prove fagin an accessory before the fact  and get the trial on on friday  and he ll swing in six days from this  by g—    you should have heard the people groan   said chitling   the officers fought like devils  or they d have torn him away
he was down once  but they made a ring round him  and fought their way along
you should have seen how he looked about him  all muddy and bleeding  and clung to them as if they were his dearest friends
i can see  em now  not able to stand upright with the pressing of the mob  and draggin him along amongst  em  i can see the people jumping up  one behind another  and snarling with their teeth and making at him  i can see the blood upon his hair and beard  and 594 oliver twist hear the cries with which the women worked themselves into the centre of the crowd at the street corner  and swore they d tear his heart out   the horror stricken witness of this scene pressed his hands upon his ears  and with his eyes closed got up and paced violently to and fro  like one distracted while he was thus engaged  and the two men sat by in silence with their eyes fixed upon the floor  a pattering noise was heard upon the stairs  and sikes s dog bounded into the room
they ran to the window  downstairs  and into the street
the dog had jumped in at an open window  he made no attempt to follow them  nor was his master to be seen
 what s the meaning of this   said toby when they had returned
 he can t be coming here
i—i—hope not    if he was coming here  he d have come with the dog   said kags  stooping down to examine the animal  who lay panting on the floor
 here  give us some water for him  he has run himself faint    he s drunk it all up  every drop   said chitling after watching the dog some time in silence  covered with mud— lame—half blind—he must have come a long way    where can he have come from   exclaimed toby
 he s been to the other kens of course  and finding them filled with strangers come on here  where he s been many a time and often
but where can he have come from first  and how comes he here alone without the other    he —(none of them called the murderer by his old name)— he can t have made away with himself what do you think   said chitling
toby shook his head
 if he had   said kags   the dog  ud want to lead us away to where he did it
no
i think he s got out of the country  and left the dog behind
he must have given him the slip somehow  or he wouldn t be so easy   this solution  appearing the most probable one  was adopted as the right  the dog  creeping under a chair  coiled himself up to sleep  without more notice from anybody it being now dark  the shutter was closed  and a candle lighted and placed upon the table
the terrible events of the last two days had made a deep impression on all three  increased by the danger and uncertainty of their own position
they drew their chairs closer together  starting at every sound
they spoke little  and that in whispers  and were as silent and awe stricken as if the remains of the murdered woman lay in the next room
they had sat thus  some time  when suddenly was heard a hurried knocking at the door below
 young bates   said kags  looking angrily round  to check the fear he felt himself the knocking came again
no  it wasn t he
he never knocked like that
crackit went to the window  and shaking all over  drew in his head
there was no need to tell them who it was  his pale face was enough
the dog too was on the alert in an instant  and ran whining to the door
 we must let him in   he said  taking up the candle
 isn t there any help for it   asked the other man in a hoarse voice
596 oliver twist  none
he must come in    don t leave us in the dark   said kags  taking down a candle from the chimney piece  and lighting it  with such a trembling hand that the knocking was twice repeated before he had finished
crackit went down to the door  and returned followed by a man with the lower part of his face buried in a handkerchief  and another tied over his head under his hat
he drew them slowly off
blanched face  sunken eyes  hollow cheeks  beard of three days  growth  wasted flesh  short thick breath  it was the very ghost of sikes
he laid his hand upon a chair which stood in the middle of the room  but shuddering as he was about to drop into it  and seeming to glance over his shoulder  dragged it back close to the wall—as close as it would go—and ground it against it—and sat down
not a word had been exchanged
he looked from one to another in silence
if an eye were furtively raised and met his  it was instantly averted
when his hollow voice broke silence  they all three started
they seemed never to have heard its tones before
 how came that dog here   he asked
 alone
three hours ago    to night s paper says that fagin s took
is it true  or a lie    true   they were silent again
 damn you all   said sikes  passing his hand across his forehead
 have you nothing to say to me   there was an uneasy movement among them  but nobody spoke
 you that keep this house   said sikes  turning his face to crackit   do you mean to sell me  or to let me lie here till this hunt is over    you may stop here  if you think it safe   returned the person addressed  after some hesitation
sikes carried his eyes slowly up the wall behind him  rather trying to turn his head than actually doing it  and said   is—it—the body—is it buried   they shook their heads
 why isn t it   he retorted with the same glance behind him
 wot do they keep such ugly things above the ground for —who s that knocking   crackit intimated  by a motion of his hand as he left the room  that there was nothing to fear  and directly came back with charley bates behind him
sikes sat opposite the door  so that the moment the boy entered the room he encountered his figure
 toby   said the boy falling back  as sikes turned his eyes towards him   why didn t you tell me this  downstairs   there had been something so tremendous in the shrinking off of the three  that the wretched man was willing to propitiate even this lad accordingly he nodded  and made as though he would shake hands with him
 let me go into some other room   said the boy  retreating still farther
 charley   said sikes  stepping forward
 don t you—don t 598 oliver twist you know me    don t come nearer me   answered the boy  still retreating  and looking  with horror in his eyes  upon the murderer s face
 you monster   the man stopped half way  and they looked at each other  but sikes s eyes sunk gradually to the ground
 witness you three   cried the boy shaking his clenched fist  and becoming more and more excited as he spoke
 witness you three—i m not afraid of him—if they come here after him  i ll give him up  i will
i tell you out at once
he may kill me for it if he likes  or if he dares  but if i am here i ll give him up
i d give him up if he was to be boiled alive
murder  help  if there s the pluck of a man among you three  you ll help me
murder  help  down with him   pouring out these cries  and accompanying them with violent gesticulation  the boy actually threw himself  single handed  upon the strong man  and in the intensity of his energy and the suddenness of his surprise  brought him heavily to the ground the three spectators seemed quite stupefied
they offered no interference  and the boy and man rolled on the ground together  the former  heedless of the blows that showered upon him  wrenching his hands tighter and tighter in the garments about the murderer s breast  and never ceasing to call for help with all his might
the contest  however  was too unequal to last long
sikes had him down  and his knee was on his throat  when crackit pulled him back with a look of alarm  and pointed to the window
there were lights gleaming below  voices in loud and earnest conversation  the tramp of hurried footsteps— endless they seemed in number—crossing the nearest wooden bridge
one man on horseback seemed to be among the crowd  for there was the noise of hoofs rattling on the uneven pavement
the gleam of lights increased  the footsteps came more thickly and noisily on
then  came a loud knocking at the door  and then a hoarse murmur from such a multitude of angry voices as would have made the boldest quail
 help   shrieked the boy in a voice that rent the air
 he s here  break down the door    in the king s name   cried the voices without  and the hoarse cry arose again  but louder
 break down the door   screamed the boy
 i tell you they ll never open it
run straight to the room where the light is
break down the door   strokes  thick and heavy  rattled upon the door and lower window shutters as he ceased to speak  and a loud huzzah burst from the crowd  giving the listener  for the first time  some adequate idea of its immense extent
 open the door of some place where i can lock this screeching hell babe   cried sikes fiercely  running to and fro  and dragging the boy  now  as easily as if he were an empty sack
 that door
quick   he flung him in  bolted it  and turned the key
 is the downstairs door fast    double locked and chained   replied crackit  who  with the other two men  still remained quite helpless and bewildered
 the panels—are they strong   600 oliver twist  lined with sheet iron    and the windows too    yes  and the windows    damn you   cried the desperate ruffian  throwing up the sash and menacing the crowd
 do your worst  i ll cheat you yet   of all the terrific yells that ever fell on mortal ears  none could exceed the cry of the infuriated throng
some shouted to those who were nearest to set the house on fire  others roared to the officers to shoot him dead
among them all  none showed such fury as the man on horseback  who  throwing himself out of the saddle  and bursting through the crowd as if he were parting water  cried  beneath the window  in a voice that rose above all others   twenty guineas to the man who brings a ladder   the nearest voices took up the cry  and hundreds echoed it some called for ladders  some for sledge hammers  some ran with torches to and fro as if to seek them  and still came back and roared again  some spent their breath in impotent curses and execrations  some pressed forward with the ecstasy of madmen  and thus impeded the progress of those below  some among the boldest attempted to climb up by the water spout and crevices in the wall  and all waved to and fro  in the darkness beneath  like a field of corn moved by an angry wind  and joined from time to time in one loud furious roar
 the tide   cried the murderer  as he staggered back into the room  and shut the faces out   the tide was in as i came up
give me a rope  a long rope
they re all in front
i may drop into the folly ditch  and clear off that way
give me a rope  or i shall do three more murders and kill myself
the panic stricken men pointed to where such articles were kept  the murderer  hastily selecting the longest and strongest cord  hurried up to the house top
all the window in the rear of the house had been long ago bricked up  except one small trap in the room where the boy was locked  and that was too small even for the passage of his body
but  from this aperture  he had never ceased to call on those without  to guard the back  and thus  when the murderer emerged at last on the house top by the door in the roof  a loud shout proclaimed the fact to those in front  who immediately began to pour round  pressing upon each other in an unbroken stream
he planted a board  which he had carried up with him for the purpose  so firmly against the door that it must be matter of great difficulty to open it from the inside  and creeping over the tiles  looked over the low parapet
the water was out  and the ditch a bed of mud
the crowd had been hushed during these few moments  watching his motions and doubtful of his purpose  but the instant they perceived it and knew it was defeated  they raised a cry of triumphant execration to which all their previous shouting had been whispers
again and again it rose
those who were at too great a distance to know its meaning  took up the sound  it echoed and re echoed  it seemed as though the whole city had poured its population out to curse him
on pressed the people from the front—on  on  on  in 602 oliver twist a strong struggling current of angry faces  with here and there a glaring torch to lighten them up  and show them out in all their wrath and passion
the houses on the opposite side of the ditch had been entered by the mob  sashes were thrown up  or torn bodily out  there were tiers and tiers of faces in every window  cluster upon cluster of people clinging to every house top
each little bridge (and there were three in sight) bent beneath the weight of the crowd upon it
still the current poured on to find some nook or hole from which to vent their shouts  and only for an instant see the wretch  they have him now   cried a man on the nearest bridge
 hurrah   the crowd grew light with uncovered heads  and again the shout uprose
 i will give fifty pounds   cried an old gentleman from the same quarter   to the man who takes him alive
i will remain here  till he come to ask me for it   there was another roar
at this moment the word was passed among the crowd that the door was forced at last  and that he who had first called for the ladder had mounted into the room
the stream abruptly turned  as this intelligence ran from mouth to mouth  and the people at the windows  seeing those upon the bridges pouring back  quitted their stations  and running into the street  joined the concourse that now thronged pell mell to the spot they had left  each man crushing and striving with his neighbor  and all panting with impatience to get near the door  and look upon the criminal as the officers brought him out
the cries and shrieks of those who were pressed almost to suffocation  or trampled down and trodden under foot in the confusion  were dreadful  the narrow ways were completely blocked up  and at this time  between the rush of some to regain the space in front of the house  and the unavailing struggles of others to extricate themselves from the mass  the immediate attention was distracted from the murderer  although the universal eagerness for his capture was  if possible  increased the man had shrunk down  thoroughly quelled by the ferocity of the crowd  and the impossibility of escape  but seeing this sudden change with no less rapidity than it had occurred  he sprang upon his feet  determined to make one last effort for his life by dropping into the ditch  and  at the risk of being stifled  endeavouring to creep away in the darkness and confusion
roused into new strength and energy  and stimulated by the noise within the house which announced that an entrance had really been effected  he set his foot against the stack of chimneys  fastened one end of the rope tightly and firmly round it  and with the other made a strong running noose by the aid of his hands and teeth almost in a second
he could let himself down by the cord to within a less distance of the ground than his own height  and had his knife ready in his hand to cut it then and drop at the very instant when he brought the loop over his head previous to slipping it beneath his arm pits  and when the old gentleman before mentioned (who had clung so tight to the railing of the bridge as to resist the force of 604 oliver twist the crowd  and retain his position) earnestly warned those about him that the man was about to lower himself down— at that very instant the murderer  looking behind him on the roof  threw his arms above his head  and uttered a yell of terror  the eyes again   he cried in an unearthly screech
staggering as if struck by lightning  he lost his balance and tumbled over the parapet
the noose was on his neck
it ran up with his weight  tight as a bow string  and swift as the arrow it speeds
he fell for five and thirty feet
there was a sudden jerk  a terrific convulsion of the limbs  and there he hung  with the open knife clenched in his stiffening hand
the old chimney quivered with the shock  but stood it bravely
the murderer swung lifeless against the wall  and the boy  thrusting aside the dangling body which obscured his view  called to the people to come and take him out  for god s sake
a dog  which had lain concealed till now  ran backwards and forwards on the parapet with a dismal howl  and collecting himself for a spring  jumped for the dead man s shoulders missing his aim  he fell into the ditch  turning completely over as he went  and striking his head against a stone  dashed out his brains
affording an explanation of more mysteries than one  and comprehending a proposal of marriage with no word of settlement or pin money days old  when oliver found himself  at three o clock in the afternoon  in a travelling carriage rolling fast towards his native town mrs maylie  and rose  and mrs bedwin  and the good doctor were with him  and mr brownlow followed in a post chaise  accompanied by one other person 606 oliver twist whose name had not been mentioned they had not talked much upon the way  for oliver was in a flutter of agitation and uncertainty which deprived him of the power of collecting his thoughts  and almost of speech  and appeared to have scarcely less effect on his companions  who shared it  in at least an equal degree he and the two ladies had been very carefully made acquainted by mr brownlow with the nature of the admissions which had been forced from monks  and although they knew that the object of their present journey was to complete the work which had been so well begun  still the whole matter was enveloped in enough of doubt and mystery to leave them in endurance of the most intense suspense
the same kind friend had  with mr losberne s assistance  cautiously stopped all channels of communication through which they could receive intelligence of the dreadful occurrences that so recently taken place
 it was quite true   he said   that they must know them before long  but it might be at a better time than the present  and it could not be at a worse   so  they travelled on in silence  each busied with reflections on the object which had brought them together  and no one disposed to give utterance to the thoughts which crowded upon all
but if oliver  under these influences  had remained silent while they journeyed towards his birth place by a road he had never seen  how the whole current of his recollections ran back to old times  and what a crowd of emotions were wakened up in his breast  when they turned into that which he had traversed on foot  a poor houseless  wandering boy  without a friend to help him  or a roof to shelter his head
 see there  there   cried oliver  eagerly clasping the hand of rose  and pointing out at the carriage window   that s the stile i came over  there are the hedges i crept behind  for fear any one should overtake me and force me back  yonder is the path across the fields  leading to the old house where i was a little child  oh dick  dick  my dear old friend  if i could only see you now    you will see him soon   replied rose  gently taking his folded hands between her own
 you shall tell him how happy you are  and how rich you have grown  and that in all your happiness you have none so great as the coming back to make him happy too    yes  yes   said oliver   and we ll—we ll take him away from here  and have him clothed and taught  and send him to some quiet country place where he may grow strong and well —shall we   rose nodded  yes   for the boy was smiling through such happy tears that she could not speak
 you will be kind and good to him  for you are to every one   said oliver
 it will make you cry  i know  to hear what he can tell  but never mind  never mind  it will be all over  and you will smile again—i know that too—to think how changed he is  you did the same with me
he said  god bless you  to me when i ran away   cried the boy with a burst of affectionate emotion   and i will say  god bless you  now  and show him how i love him for it   as they approached the town  and at length drove through its narrow streets  it became matter of no small dif  608 oliver twist ficulty to restrain the boy within reasonable bounds
there was sowerberry s the undertaker s just as it used to be  only smaller and less imposing in appearance than he remembered it—there were all the well known shops and houses  with almost every one of which he had some slight incident connected—there was gamfield s cart  the very cart he used to have  standing at the old public house door—there was the workhouse  the dreary prison of his youthful days  with its dismal windows frowning on the street—there was the same lean porter standing at the gate  at sight of whom oliver involuntarily shrunk back  and then laughed at himself for being so foolish  then cried  then laughed again—there were scores of faces at the doors and windows that he knew quite well—there was nearly everything as if he had left it but yesterday  and all his recent life had been but a happy dream but it was pure  earnest  joyful reality
they drove straight to the door of the chief hotel (which oliver used to stare up at  with awe  and think a mighty palace  but which had somehow fallen off in grandeur and size)  and here was mr grimwig all ready to receive them  kissing the young lady  and the old one too  when they got out of the coach  as if he were the grandfather of the whole party  all smiles and kindness  and not offering to eat his head—no  not once  not even when he contradicted a very old postboy about the nearest road to london  and maintained he knew it best  though he had only come that way once  and that time fast asleep
there was dinner prepared  and there were bedrooms ready  and everything was arranged as if by magic notwithstanding all this  when the hurry of the first halfhour was over  the same silence and constraint prevailed that had marked their journey down
mr brownlow did not join them at dinner  but remained in a separate room
the two other gentlemen hurried in and out with anxious faces  and  during the short intervals when they were present  conversed apart
once  mrs maylie was called away  and after being absent for nearly an hour  returned with eyes swollen with weeping all these things made rose and oliver  who were not in any new secrets  nervous and uncomfortable
they sat wondering  in silence  or  if they exchanged a few words  spoke in whispers  as if they were afraid to hear the sound of their own voices
at length  when nine o clock had come  and they began to think they were to hear no more that night  mr losberne and mr grimwig entered the room  followed by mr brownlow and a man whom oliver almost shrieked with surprise to see  for they told him it was his brother  and it was the same man he had met at the market town  and seen looking in with fagin at the window of his little room
monks cast a look of hate  which  even then  he could not dissemble  at the astonished boy  and sat down near the door
mr brownlow  who had papers in his hand  walked to a table near which rose and oliver were seated
 this is a painful task   said he   but these declarations  which have been signed in london before many gentlemen  must be substance repeated here
i would have spared you the degradation  but we must hear them from your own lips before we part  and you know why   610 oliver twist  go on   said the person addressed  turning away his face
 quick
i have almost done enough  i think
don t keep me here    this child   said mr brownlow  drawing oliver to him  and laying his hand upon his head   is your half brother  the illegitimate son of your father  my dear friend edwin leeford  by poor young agnes fleming  who died in giving him birth    yes   said monks  scowling at the trembling boy  the beating of whose heart he might have heard
 that is the bastard child    the term you use   said mr brownlow  sternly   is a reproach to those long since passed beyong the feeble censure of the world
it reflects disgrace on no one living  except you who use it
let that pass
he was born in this town    in the workhouse of this town   was the sullen reply
 you have the story there   he pointed impatiently to the papers as he spoke
 i must have it here  too   said mr brownlow  looking round upon the listeners
 listen then  you   returned monks
 his father being taken ill at rome  was joined by his wife  my mother  from whom he had been long separated  who went from paris and took me with her—to look after his property  for what i know  for she had no great affection for him  nor he for her
he knew nothing of us  for his senses were gone  and he slumbered on till next day  when he died
among the papers in his desk  were two  dated on the night his illness first came on  directed to yourself   he addressed himself to mr brownlow   and enclosed in a few short lines to you  with an intimation on the cover of the package that it was not to be forwarded till after he was dead one of these papers was a letter to this girl agnes  the other a will    what of the letter   asked mr brownlow
 the letter —a sheet of paper crossed and crossed again  with a penitent confession  and prayers to god to help her
he had palmed a tale on the girl that some secret mystery— to be explained one day—prevented his marrying her just then  and so she had gone on  trusting patiently to him  until she trusted too far  and lost what none could ever give her back
she was  at that time  within a few months of her confinement
he told her all he had meant to do  to hide her shame  if he had lived  and prayed her  if he died  not to curse him memory  or think the consequences of their sin would be visited on her or their young child  for all the guilt was his
he reminded her of the day he had given her the little locket and the ring with her christian name engraved upon it  and a blank left for that which he hoped one day to have bestowed upon her—prayed her yet to keep it  and wear it next her heart  as she had done before—and then ran on  wildly  in the same words  over and over again  as if he had gone distracted
i believe he had    the will   said mr brownlow  as oliver s tears fell fast
monks was silent
 the will   said mr brownlow  speaking for him   was in the same spirit as the letter
he talked of miseries which his wife had brought upon him  of the rebellious disposition  vice  malice  and premature bad passions of you his 612 oliver twist only son  who had been trained to hate him  and left you  and your mother  each an annuity of eight hundred pounds
the bulk of his property he divided into two equal portions—one for agnes fleming  and the other for their child  it it should be born alive  and ever come of age
if it were a girl  it was to inherit the money unconditionally  but if a boy  only on the stipulation that in his minority he should never have stained his name with any public act of dishonour  meanness  cowardice  or wrong
he did this  he said  to mark his confidence in the other  and his conviction—only strengthened by approaching death—that the child would share her gentle heart  and noble nature
if he were disappointed in this expectation  then the money was to come to you  for then  and not till then  when both children were equal  would he recognise your prior claim upon his purse  who had none upon his heart  but had  from an infant  repulsed him with coldness and aversion    my mother   said monks  in a louder tone   did what a woman should have done
she burnt this will
the letter never reached its destination  but that  and other proofs  she kept  in case they ever tried to lie away the blot
the girl s father had the truth from her with every aggravation that her violent hate—i love her for it now—could add
goaded by shame and dishonour he fled with his children into a remote corner of wales  changing his very name that his friends might never know of his retreat  and here  no great while afterwards  he was found dead in his bed
the girl had left her home  in secret  some weeks before  he had searched for her  on foot  in every town and village near  it was on the night when he returned home  assured that she had destroyed herself  to hide her shame and his  that his old heart broke   there was a short silence here  until mr brownlow took up the thread of the narrative
 years after this   he said   this man s—edward leeford s—mother came to me
he had left her  when only eighteen  robbed her of jewels and money  gambled  squandered  forged  and fled to london  where for two years he had associated with the lowest outcasts
she was sinking under a painful and incurable disease  and wished to recover him before she died
inquiries were set on foot  and strict searches made
they were unavailing for a long time  but ultimately successful  and he went back with her to france
 there she died   said monks   after a lingering illness  and  on her death bed  she bequeathed these secrets to me  together with her unquenchable and deadly hatred of all whom they involved—though she need not have left me that  for i had inherited it long before
she would not believe that the girl had destroyed herself  and the child too  but was filled with the impression that a male child had been born  and was alive
i swore to her  if ever it crossed my path  to hunt it down  never to let it rest  to pursue it with the bitterest and most unrelenting animosity  to vent upon it the hatred that i deeply felt  and to spit upon the empty vaunt of that insulting will by draggin it  if i could  to the very gallows foot
she was right
he came in my way at last
i began well  and  but for babbling drabs  i would have finished as i began   614 oliver twist as the villain folded his arms tight together  and muttered curses on himself in the impotence of baffled malice  mr brownlow turned to the terrified group beside him  and explained that the jew  who had been his old accomplice and confidant  had a large reward for keeping oliver ensnared  of which some part was to be given up  in the event of his being rescued  and that a dispute on this head had led to their visit to the country house for the purpose of identifying him  the locket and ring   said mr brownlow  turning to monks
 i bought them from the man and woman i told you of  who stole them from the nurse  who stole them from the corpse   answered monks without raising his eyes
 you know what became of them   mr brownlow merely nodded to mr grimwig  who disappearing with great alacrity  shortly returned  pushing in mrs bumble  and dragging her unwilling consort after him  do my hi s deceive me   cried mr bumble  with illfeigned enthusiasm   or is that little oliver  oh o li ver  if you know d how i ve been a grieving for you—   hold your tongue  fool   murmured mrs bumble  isn t natur  natur  mrs bumble   remonstrated the workhouse master  can t i be supposed to feel—i as brought him up porochially—when i see him a setting here among ladies and gentlemen of the very affablest description  i always loved that boy as if he d been my—my—my own grandfather   said mr bumble  halting for an appropriate comparison
 master oliver  my dear  you remember the blessed gentleman in the white waistcoat  ah  he went to heaven last week  in a oak coffin with plated handles  oliver    come  sir   said mr grimwig  tartly   suppress your feelings    i will do my endeavours  sir   replied mr bumble
 how do you do  sir  i hope you are very well   this salutation was addressed to mr brownlow  who had stepped up to within a short distance of the respectable couple
he inquired  as he pointed to monks   do you know that person    no   replied mrs bumble flatly  perhaps you don t   said mr brownlow  addressing her spouse
 i never saw him in all my life   said mr bumble
 nor sold him anything  perhaps    no   replied mrs bumble  you never had  perhaps  a certain gold locket and ring   said mr brownlow
 certainly not   replied the matron
 why are we brought here to answer to such nonsense as this   again mr brownlow nodded to mr grimwig  and again that gentleman limped away with extraordinary readiness
but not again did he return with a stout man and wife  for this time  he led in two palsied women  who shook and tottered as they walked
 you shut the door the night old sally died   said the foremost one  raising her shrivelled hand   but you couldn t shut 616 oliver twist out the sound  nor stop the chinks    no  no   said the other  looking round her and wagging her toothless jaws
 no  no  no    we heard her try to tell you what she d done  and saw you take a paper from her hand  and watched you too  next day  to the pawnbroker s shop   said the first
 yes   added the second   and it was a  locket and gold ring   we found out that  and saw it given you
we were by
oh  we were by    and we know more than that   resumed the first   for she told us often  long ago  that the young mother had told her that  feeling she should never get over it  she was on her way  at the time that she was taken ill  to die near the grave of the father of the child    would you like to see the pawnbroker himself   asked mr grimwig with a motion towards the door  no   replied the woman   if he—she pointed to monks—  has been coward enough to confess  as i see he had  and you have sounded all these hags till you have found the right ones  i have nothing more to say
i did sell them  and they re where you ll never get them
what then    nothing   replied mr brownlow   except that it remains for us to take care that neither of you is employed in a situation of trust again
you may leave the room    i hope   said mr bumble  looking about him with great ruefulness  as mr grimwig disappeared with the two old women   i hope that this unfortunate little circumstance will not deprive me of my porochial office    indeed it will   replied mr brownlow  you may make up your mind to that  and think yourself well off besides    it was all mrs bumble she would do it   urged mr bumble  first looking round to ascertain that his partner had left the room
 that is no excuse   replied mr brownlow
 you were present on the occasion of the destruction of these trinkets  and indeed are the more guilty of the two  in the eye of the law  for the law supposes that your wife acts under your direction    if the law supposes that   said mr bumble  squeezing his hat emphatically in both hands   the law is a ass—a idiot
if that s the eye of the law  the law is a bachelor  and the worst i wish the law is  that his eye may be opened by experience— by experience   laying great stress on the repetition of these two words  mr bumble fixed his hat on very tight  and putting his hands in his pockets  followed his helpmate downstairs
 young lady   said mr brownlow  turning to rose   give me your hand
do not tremble
you need not fear to hear the few remaining words we have to say    if they have—i do not know how they can  but if they have—any reference to me   said rose   pray let me hear them at some other time
i have not strength or spirits now    nay   returned the old gentlman  drawing her arm through his   you have more fortitude than this  i am sure
do you know this young lady  sir    yes   replied monks
 i never saw you before   said rose faintly
 i have seen you often   returned monks
618 oliver twist  the father of the unhappy agnes had two daughters   said mr brownlow
 what was the fate of the other—the child    the child   replied monks   when her father died in a strange place  in a strange name  without a letter  book  or scrap of paper that yielded the faintest clue by which his friends or relatives could be traced—the child was taken by some wretched cottagers  who reared it as their own    go on   said mr brownlow  signing to mrs maylie to approach  go on    you couldn t find the spot to which these people had repaired   said monks   but where friendship fails  hatred will often force a way my mother found it  after a year of cunning search—ay  and found the child    she took it  did she    no
the people were poor and began to sicken—at least the man did—of their fine humanity  so she left it with them  giving them a small present of money which would not last long  and promised more  which she never meant to send
she didn t quite rely  however  on their discontent and poverty for the child s unhappiness  but told the history of the sister s shame  with such alterations as suited her  bade them take good heed of the child  for she came of bad blood   and told them she was illegitimate  and sure to go wrong at one time or other
the circumstances countenanced all this  the people believed it  and there the child dragged on an existence  miserable enough even to satisfy us  until a widow lady  residing  then  at chester  saw the girl by chance  pitied her  and took her home there was some cursed spell  i think  against us  for in spite of all our efforts she remained there and was happy
i lost sight of her  two or three years ago  and saw her no more until a few months back    do you see her now    yes
leaning on your arm    but not the less my niece   cried mrs maylie  folding the fainting girl in her arms   not the less my dearest child i would not lose her now  for all the treasures of the world my sweet companion  my own dear girl    the only friend i ever had   cried rose  clinging to her
 the kindest  best of friends
my heart will burst
i cannot bear all this    you have borne more  and have been  through all  the best and gentlest creature that ever shed happiness on every one she knew   said mrs maylie  embracing her tenderly  come  come  my love  remember who this is who waits to clasp you in his arms  poor child  see here—look  look  my dear    not aunt   cried oliver  throwing his arms about her neck   i ll never call her aunt—sister  my own dear sister  that something taught my heart to love so dearly from the first  rose  dear  darling rose   let the tears which fell  and the broken words which were exchanged in the long close embrace between the orphans  be sacred a father  sister  and mother  were gained  and lost  in that one moment
joy and grief were mingled in the cup  but there were no bitter tears  for even grief itself arose so softened  and clothed in such sweet and tender recollections  that it became a solemn pleasure  and lost all 620 oliver twist character of pain
they were a long  long time alone
a soft tap at the door  at length announced that some one was without
oliver opened it  glided away  and gave place to harry maylie
 i know it all   he said  taking a seat beside the lovely girl
 dear rose  i know it all    i am not here by accident   he added after a lengthened silence   nor have i heard all this to night  for i knew it yesterday—only yesterday
do you guess that i have come to remind you of a promise    stay   said rose
 you do know all    all
you gave me leave  at any time within a year  to renew the subject of our last discourse    i did    not to press you to alter your determination   pursued the young man   but to hear you repeat it  if you would
i was to lay whatever of station or fortune i might possess at your feet  and if you still adhered to your former determination  i pledged myself  by no word or act  to seek to change it    the same reasons which influenced me then  will influence me know   said rose firmly
 if i ever owed a strict and rigid duty to her  whose goodness saved me from a life of indigence and suffering  when should i ever feel it  as i should to night  it is a struggle   said rose   but one i am proud to make  it is a pang  but one my heart shall bear    the disclosure of to night  —harry began
 the disclosure of to night   replied rose softly   leaves me in the same position  with reference to you  as that in which i stood before    you harden your heart against me  rose   urged her lover
 oh harry  harry   said the young lady  bursting into tears   i wish i could  and spare myself this pain    then why inflict it on yourself   said harry  taking her hand
 think  dear rose  think what you have heard tonight    and what have i heard  what have i heard   cried rose
 that a sense of his deep disgrace so worked upon my own father that he shunned all—there  we have said enough  harry  we have said enough    not yet  not yet   said the young man  detaining her as she rose
 my hopes  my wishes  prospects  feeling  every thought in life except my love for you  have undergone a change
i offer you  now  no distinction among a bustling crowd  no mingling with a world of malice and detraction  where the blood is called into honest cheeks by aught but real disgrace and shame  but a home—a heart and home— yes  dearest rose  and those  and those alone  are all i have to offer    what do you mean   she faltered
 i mean but this—that when i left you last  i left you with a firm determination to level all fancied barriers between yourself and me  resolved that if my world could not be yours  i would make yours mine  that no pride of birth should curl the lip at you  for i would turn from it
this i have done
those who have shrunk from me because of this  have shrunk from you  and proved you so far right
such 622 oliver twist power and patronage  such relatives of influence and rank  as smiled upon me then  look coldly now  but there are smiling fields and waving trees in england s richest county  and by one village church—mine  rose  my own —there stands a rustic dwelling which you can make me prouder of  than all the hopes i have renounced  measured a thousandfold
this is my rank and station now  and here i lay it down    it s a trying thing waiting supper for lovers   said mr grimwig  waking up  and pulling his pocket handkerchief from over his head
truth to tell  the supper had been waiting a most unreasonable time
neither mrs maylie  nor harry  nor rose (who all came in together)  could offer a word in extenuation  i had serious thoughts of eating my head to night   said mr grimwig   for i began to think i should get nothing else
i ll take the liberty  if you ll allow me  of saluting the bride that is to be   mr grimwig lost no time in carrying this notice into effect upon the blushing girl  and the example  being contagious  was followed both by the doctor and mr brownlow  some people affirm that harry maylie had been observed to set it  orginally  in a dark room adjoining  but the best authorities consider this downright scandal  he being young and a clergyman
 oliver  my child   said mrs maylie   where have you been  and why do you look so sad  there are tears stealing down your face at this moment what is the matter   it is a world of disappointment  often to the hopes we most cherish  and hopes that do our nature the greatest honour
poor dick was dead  624 oliver twist fagin s last night alive the court was paved  from floor to roof  with human faces
inquisitive and eager eyes peered from every inch of space
from the rail before the dock  away into the sharpest angle of the smallest corner in the galleries  all looks were fixed upon one man—fagin
before him and behind  above  below  on the right and on the left  he seemed to stand surrounded by a firmament  all bright with gleaming eyes
he stood there  in all this glare of living light  with one hand resting on the wooden slab before him  the other held to his ear  and his head thrust forward to enable him to catch with greater distinctness every word that fell from the presiding judge  who was delivering his charge to the jury
at times  he turned his eyes sharply upon them to observe the effect of the slightest featherweight in his favour  and when the points against him were stated with terrible distinctness  looked towards his counsel  in mute appeal that he would  even then  urge something in his behalf
beyond these manifestations of anxiety  he stirred not hand or foot
he had scarcely moved since the trial began  and now that the judge ceased to speak  he still remained in the same strained attitude of close attention  with his gaze ben on him  as though he listened still
a slight bustle in the court  recalled him to himself looking round  he saw that the juryman had turned together  to consider their verdict
as his eyes wandered to the gallery  he could see the people rising above each other to see his face  some hastily applying their glasses to their eyes  and others whispering their neighbours with looks expressive of abhorrence
a few there were  who seemed unmindful of him  and looked only to the jury  in impatient wonder how they could delay
but in no one face—not even among the women  of whom there were many there—could he read the faintest sympathy with himself  or any feeling but one of allabsorbing interest that he should be condemned as he saw all this in one bewildered glance  the deathlike stillness came again  and looking back he saw that the jurymen had turned towards the judge
hush  they only sought permission to retire
he looked  wistfully  into their faces  one by one when they passed out  as though to see which way the greater number leant  but that was fruitless
the jailed touched him on the shoulder
he followed mechanically to the end of the dock  and sat down on a chair
the man pointed it out  or he would not have seen it
he looked up into the gallery again
some of the people were eating  and some fanning themselves with handkerchiefs  for the crowded place was very hot there was one young man sketching his face in a little note book he wondered whether it was like  and looked on when the artist 626 oliver twist broke his pencil point  and made another with his knife  as any idle spectator might have done
in the same way  when he turned his eyes towards the judge  his mind began to busy itself with the fashion of his dress  and what it cost  and how he put it on
there was an old fat gentleman on the bench  too  who had gone out  some half an hour before  and now come back
he wondered within himself whether this man had been to get his dinner  what he had had  and where he had had it  and pursued this train of careless thought until some new object caught his eye and roused another not that  all this time  his mind was  for an instant  free from one oppressive overwhelming sense of the grave that opened at his feet  it was ever present to him  but in a vague and general way  and he could not fix his thoughts upon it
thus  even while he trembled  and turned burning hot at the idea of speedy death  he fell to counting the iron spikes before him  and wondering how the head of one had been broken off  and whether they would mend it  or leave it as it was
then  he thought of all the horrors of the gallows and the scaffold—and stopped to watch a man sprinkling the floor to cool it—and then went on to think again
at length there was a cry of silence  and a breathless look from all towards the door
the jury returned  and passed him close
he could glean nothing from their faces  they might as well have been of stone
perfect stillness ensued— not a rustle—not a breath—guilty
the building rang with a tremendous shout  and another  and another  and then it echoed loud groans  that gathered strength as they swelled out  like angry thunder
it was a peal of joy from the populace outside  greeting the news that he would die on monday
the noise subsided  and he was asked if he had anything to say why sentence of death should not be passed upon him
he had resumed his listening attitude  and looked intently at his questioner while the demand was made  but it was twice repeated before he seemed to hear it  and then he only muttered that he was an old man—an old man—and so  dropping into a whisper  was silent again
the judge assumed the black cap  and the prisoner still stood with the same air and gesture
a woman in the gallery  uttered some exclamation  called forth by this dread solemnity  he looked hastily up as if angry at the interruption  and bent forward yet more attentively
the address was solemn and impressive  the sentence fearful to hear
but he stood  like a marble figure  without the motion of a nerve
his haggard face was still thrust forward  his under jaw hanging down  and his eyes staring out before him  when the jailer put his hand upon his arm  and beckoned him away
he gazed stupidly about him for an instant  and obeyed
they led him through a paved room under the court  where some prisoners were waiting till their turns came  and others were talking to their friends  who crowded round a grate which looked into the open yard
there was nobody there to speak to him  but  as he passed  the prisoners fell back to render him more visible to the people who were clinging to the bars  and they assailed him with oppro  628 oliver twist brious names  and screeched and hissed
he shook his fist  and would have spat upon them  but his conductors hurried him on  through a gloomy passage lighted by a few dim lamps  into the interior of the prison
here  he was searched  that he might not have about him the means of anticipating the law  this ceremony performed  they led him to one of the condemned cells  and left him there—alone
he sat down on a stone bench opposite the door  which served for seat and bedstead  and casting his blood shot eyes upon the ground  tried to collect his thoughts
after awhile  he began to remember a few disjointed fragments of what the judge had said  though it had seemed to him  at the time  that he could not hear a word
these gradually fell into their proper places  and by degrees suggested more  so that in a little time he had the whole  almost as it was delivered
to be hanged by the neck  till he was dead—that was the end
to be hanged by the neck till he was dead
as it came on very dark  he began to think of all the men he had known who had died upon the scaffold  some of them through his means
they rose up  in such quick succession  that he could hardly count them
he had seen some of them die —and had joked too  because they died with prayers upon their lips
with what a rattling noise the drop went down  and how suddenly they changed  from strong and vigorous men to dangling heaps of clothes  some of them might have inhabited that very cell—sat upon that very spot
it was very dark  why didn t they bring a light  the cell had been built for many years
scores of men must have passed their last hours there
it was like sitting in a vault strewn with dead bodies—the cap  the noose  the pinioned arms  the faces that he knew  even beneath that hideous veil —light  light  at length  when his hands were raw with beating against the heavy door and walls  two men appeared  one bearing a candle  which he thrust into an iron candlestick fixed against the wall  the other dragging in a mattress on which to pass the night  for the prisoner was to be left alone no more then came the night—dark  dismal  silent night
other watchers are glad to hear this church clock strike  for they tell of life and coming day
to him they brought despair
the boom of every iron bell came laden with the one  deep  hollow sound—death
what availed the noise and bustle of cheerful morning  which penetrated even there  to him  it was another form of knell  with mockery added to the warning
the day passed off
day  there was no day  it was gone as soon as come—and night came on again  night so long  and yet so short  long in its dreadful silence  and short in its fleeting hours
at one time he raved and blasphemed  and at another howled and tore his hair
venerable men of his own persuasion had come to pray beside him  but he had driven them away with curses
they renewed their charitable efforts  and he beat them off
saturday night
he had only one night more to live
and as he thought of this  the day broke—sunday
it was not until the night of this last awful day  that a 630 oliver twist withering sense of his helpless  desperate state came in its full intensity upon his blighted soul  not that he had ever held any defined or positive hope of mercy  but that he had never been able to consider more than the dim probability of dying so soon
he had spoken little to either of the two men  who relieved each other in their attendance upon him  and they  for their parts  made no effort to rouse his attention
he had sat there  awake  but dreaming
now  he started up  every minute  and with gasping mouth and burning skin  hurried to and fro  in such a paroxysm of fear and wrath that even they—used to such sights—recoiled from him with horror
he grew so terrible  at last  in all the tortures of his evil conscience  that one man could not bear to sit there  eyeing him alone  and so the two kept watch together
he cowered down upon his stone bed  and thought of the past
he had been wounded with some missiles from the crowd on the day of his capture  and his head was bandaged with a linen cloth
his red hair hung down upon his bloodless face  his beard was torn  and twisted into knots  his eyes shone with a terrible light  his unwashed flesh crackled with the fever that burnt him up
eight—nine—then
if it was not a trick to frighten him  and those were the real hours treading on each other s heels  where would he be  when they came round again  eleven  another struck  before the voice of the previous hour had ceased to vibrate
at eight  he would be the only mourner in his own funeral train  at eleven— those dreadful walls of newgate  which have hidden so much misery and such unspeakable anguish  not only from the eyes  but  too often  and too long  from the thoughts  of men  never held so dread a spectacle as that
the few who lingered as they passed  and wondered what the man was doing who was to be hanged to morrow  would have slept but ill that night  if they could have seen him
from early in the evening until nearly midnight  little groups of two and three presented themselves at the lodgegate  and inquired  with anxious faces  whether any reprieve had been received these being answered in the negative  communicated the welcome intelligence to clusters in the street  who pointed out to one another the door from which he must come out  and showed where the scaffold would be built  and  walking with unwilling steps away  turned back to conjure up the scene
by degrees they fell off  one by one  and  for an hour  in the dead of night  the street was left to solitude and darkness
the space before the prison was cleared  and a few strong barriers  painted black  had been already thrown across the road to break the pressure of the expected crowd  when mr brownlow and oliver appeared at the wicket  and presented an order of admission to the prisoner  signed by one of the sheriffs
they were immediately admitted into the lodge
 is the young gentleman to come too  sir   said the man whose duty it was to conduct them
 it s not a sight for children  sir    it is not indeed  my friend   rejoined mr brownlow   but my business with this man is intimately connected with him  and as this child has seen him in the full career of his success and villainy  i think it as well—even at the cost of 632 oliver twist some pain and fear—that he should see him now   these few words had been said apart  so as to be inaudible to oliver
the man touched his hat  and glancing at oliver with some curiousity  opened another gate  opposite to that by which they had entered  and led them on  through dark and winding ways  towards the cells
 this   said the man  stopping in a gloomy passage where a couple of workmen were making some preparations in profound silence— this is the place he passes through
if you step this way  you can see the door he goes out at   he led them into a stone kitchen  fitted with coppers for dressing the prison food  and pointed to a door
there was an open grating above it  throught which came the sound of men s voices  mingled with the noise of hammering  and the throwing down of boards
there were putting up the scaffold
from this place  they passed through several strong gates  opened by other turnkeys from the inner side  and  having entered an open yard  ascended a flight of narrow steps  and came into a passage with a row of strong doors on the left hand
motioning them to remain where they were  the turnkey knocked at one of these with his bunch of keys
the two attendants  after a little whispering  came out into the passage  stretching themselves as if glad of the temporary relief  and motioned the visitors to follow the jailer into the cell they did so the condemned criminal was seated on his bed  rocking himself from side to side  with a countenance more like that of a snared beast than the face of a man his mind was evidently wandering to his old life  for he continued to mutter  without appearing conscious of their presence otherwise than as a part of his vision
 good boy  charley—well done—  he mumbled
 oliver  too  ha  ha  ha  oliver too—quite the gentleman now—quite the—take that boy away to bed   the jailer took the disengaged hand of oliver  and  whispering him not to be alarmed  looked on without speaking
 take him away to bed   cried fagin
 do you hear me  some of you  he has been the—the—somehow the cause of all this
it s worth the money to bring him up to it—bolter s throat  bill  never mind the girl—bolter s throat as deep as you can cut
saw his head off    fagin   said the jailer
 that s me   cried the jew  falling instantly  into the attitude of listening he had assumed upon his trial
 an old man  my lord  a very old  old man    here   said the turnkey  laying his hand upon his breast to keep him down
 here s somebody wants to see you  to ask you some questions  i suppose
fagin  fagin  are you a man    i shan t be one long   he replied  looking up with a face retaining no human expression but rage and terror
 strike them all dead  what right have they to butcher me   as he spoke he caught sight of oliver and mr brownlow
shrinking to the furthest corner of the seat  he demanded to know what they wanted there
 steady   said the turnkey  still holding him down
 now  sir  tell him what you want
quick  if you please  for he 634 oliver twist grows worse as the time gets on    you have some papers   said mr brownlow advancing   which were placed in your hands  for better security  by a man called monks    it s all a lie together   replied fagin
 i haven t one—not one    for the love of god   said mr brownlow solemnly   do not say that now  upon the very verge of death  but tell me where they are
you know that sikes is dead  that monks has confessed  that there is no hope of any further gain
where are those papers    oliver   cried fagin  beckoning to him
 here  here  let me whisper to you    i am not afraid   said oliver in a low voice  as he relinquished mr brownlow s hand
 the papers   said fagin  drawing oliver towards him   are in a canvas bag  in a hole a little way up the chimney in the top front room
i want to talk to you  my dear
i want to talk to you    yes  yes   returned oliver
 let me say a prayer
do  let me say one prayer
say only one  upon your knees  with me  and we will talk till morning    outside  outside   replied fagin  pushing the boy before him towards the door  and looking vacantly over his head
 say i ve gone to sleep—they ll believe you
you can get me out  if you take me so
now then  now then    oh  god forgive this wretched man   cried the boy with a burst of tears  that s right  that s right   said fagin
 that ll help us on
this door first
if i shake and tremble  as we pass the gallows  don t you mind  but hurry on
now  now  now    have you nothing else to ask him  sir   inquired the turnkey
 no other question   replied mr brownlow
 if i hoped we could recall him to a sense of his position—   nothing will do that  sir   replied the man  shaking his head
 you had better leave him   the door of the cell opened  and the attendants returned
 press on  press on   cried fagin
 softly  but not so slow
faster  faster   the men laid hands upon him  and disengaging oliver from his grasp  held him back
he struggled with the power of desperation  for an instant  and then sent up cry upon cry that penetrated even those massive walls  and rang in their ears until they reached the open yard
it was some time before they left the prison
oliver nearly swooned after this frightful scene  and was so weak that for an hour or more  he had not the strength to walk
day was dawning when they again emerged
a great multitude had already assembled  the windows were filled with people  smoking and playing cards to beguile the time  the crowd were pushing  quarrelling  joking
everything told of life and animation  but one dark cluster of objects in the centre of all—the black stage  the cross beam  the rope  and all the hideous apparatus of death
636 oliver twist and last the fortunes of those who have figured in this tale are nearly closed
the little that remains to their historian to relate  is told in few and simple words
before three months had passed  rose fleming and harry maylie were married in the village church which was henceforth to be the scene of the young clergyman s labours  on the same day they entered into possession of their new and happy home
mrs maylie took up her abode with her son and daughter in law  to enjoy  during the tranquil remainder of her days  the greatest felicity that age and worth can know— the contemplation of the happiness of those on whom the warmest affections and tenderest cares of a well spent life  have been unceasingly bestowed it appeared  on full and careful investigation  that if the wreck of property remaining in the custody of monks (which had never prospered either in his hands or in those of his mother) were equally divided between himself and oliver  it would yield  to each  little more than three thousand pounds by the provisions of his father s will  oliver would have been entitled to the whole  but mr brownlow  unwilling to deprive the elder son of the opportunity of retrieving his former vices and pursuing an honest career  proposed this mode of distribution  to which his young charge joyfully acceded
monks  still bearing that assumed name  retired with his portion to a distant part of the new world  where  having quickly squandered it  he once more fell into his old courses  and  after undergoing a long confinement for some fresh act of fraud and knavery  at length sunk under an attack of his old disorder  and died in prison
as far from home  died the chief remaining members of his friend fagin s gang
mr brownlow adopted oliver as his son
removing with him and the old housekeeper to within a mile of the parsonage house  where his dear friends resided  he gratified the only remaining wish of oliver s warm and earnest heart  and thus linked together a little society  whose condition approached as nearly to one of perfect happiness as can ever be known in this changing world
soon after the marriage of the young people  the worthy doctor returned to chertsey  where  bereft of the presence of his old friends  he would have been discontented if his temperament had admitted of such a feeling  and would have turned quite peevish if he had known how
for two or three months  he contented himself with hinting that he feared the air began to disagree with him  then  finding that the place really no longer was  to him  what it had been  he settled his business on his assistant  took a bachelor s cottage outside the village of which his young friend was 638 oliver twist pastor  and instantaneously recovered here he took to gardening  planting  fishing  carpentering  and various other pursuits of a similar kind  all undertaken with his characteristic impetuosity
in each and all he has since become famous throughout the neighborhood  as a most profound authority
before his removal  he had managed to contract a strong friendship for mr grimwig  which that eccentric gentleman cordially reciprocated
he is accordingly visited by mr grimwig a great many times in the course of the year
on all such occasions  mr grimwig plants  fishes  and carpenters  with great ardour  doing everything in a very singular and unprecedented manner  but always maintaining with his favourite asseveration  that his mode is the right one
on sundays  he never fails to criticise the sermon to the young clergyman s face  always informing mr losberne  in strict confidence afterwards  that he considers it an excellent performance  but deems it as well not to say so it is a standing and very favourite joke  for mr brownlow to rally him on his old prophecy concerning oliver  and to remind him of the night on which they sat with the watch between them  waiting his return  but mr grimwig contends that he was right in the main  and  in proof thereof  remarks that oliver did not come back after all  which always calls forth a laugh on his side  and increases his good humour
mr noah claypole  receiving a free pardon from the crown in consequence of being admitted approver against fagin  and considering his profession not altogether as safe a one as he could wish  was  for some little time  at a loss for the means of a livelihood  not burdened with too much work
after some consideration  he went into business as an informer  in which calling he realises a genteel subsistence
his plan is  to walk out once a week during church time attended by charlotte in respectable attire
the lady faints away at the doors of charitable publicans  and the gentleman being accommodated with three penny worth of brandy to restore her  lays an information next day  and pockets half the penalty
sometimes mr claypole faints himself  but the result is the same mr and mrs bumble  deprived of their situations  were gradually reduced to great indigence and misery  and finally became paupers in that very same workhouse in which they had once lorded it over others mr bumble has been heard to say  that in this reverse and degradation  he has not even spirits to be thankful for being separated from his wife
as to mr giles and brittles  they still remain in their old posts  although the former is bald  and the last named boy quite grey
they sleep at the parsonage  but divide their attentions so equally among its inmates  and oliver and mr brownlow  and mr losberne  that to this day the villagers have never been able to discover to which establishment they properly belong
master charles bates  appalled by sikes s crime  fell into a train of reflection whether an honest life was not  after all  the best
arriving at the conclusion that it certainly was  he turned his back upon the scenes of the past  resolved to amend it in some new sphere of action
he struggled hard  and suffered much  for some time  but  having a contented 640 oliver twist disposition  and a good purpose  succeeded in the end  and  from being a farmer s drudge  and a carrier s lad  he is now the merriest young grazier in all northamptonshire
and now  the hand that traces these words  falters  as it approaches the conclusion of its task  and would weave  for a little longer space  the thread of these adventures
i would fain linger yet with a few of those among whom i have so long moved  and share their happiness by endeavouring to depict it
i would show rose maylie in all the bloom and grace of early womanhood  shedding on her secluded path in life soft and gentle light  that fell on all who trod it with her  and shone into their hearts
i would paint her the life and joy of the fire side circle and the lively summer group  i would follow her through the sultry fields at noon  and hear the low tones of her sweet voice in the moonlit evening walk  i would watch her in all her goodness and charity abroad  and the smiling untiring discharge of domestic duties at home  i would paint her and her dead sister s child happy in their love for one another  and passing whole hours together in picturing the friends whom they had so sadly lost  i would summon before me  once again  those joyous little faces that clustered round her knee  and listen to their merry prattle  i would recall the tones of that clear laugh  and conjure up the sympathising tear that glistened in the soft blue eye
these  and a thousand looks and smiles  and turns fo thought and speech—i would fain recall them every one
how mr brownlow went on  from day to day  filling the mind of his adopted child with stores of knowledge  and becoming attached to him  more and more  as his nature developed itself  and showed the thriving seeds of all he wished him to become—how he traced in him new traits of his early friend  that awakened in his own bosom old remembrances  melancholy and yet sweet and soothing—how the two orphans  tried by adversity  remembered its lessons in mercy to others  and mutual love  and fervent thanks to him who had protected and preserved them—these are all matters which need not to be told
i have said that they were truly happy  and without strong affection and humanity of heart  and gratitude to that being whose code is mercy  and whose great attribute is benevolence to all things that breathe  happiness can never be attained
within the altar of the old village church there stands a white marble tablet  which bears as yet but one word   agnes   there is no coffin in that tomb  and may it be many  many years  before another name is placed above it  but  if the spirits of the dead ever come back to earth  to visit spots hallowed by the love—the love beyond the grave—of those whom they knew in life  i believe that the shade of agnes sometimes hovers round that solemn nook
i believe it none the less because that nook is in a church  and she was weak and erring
