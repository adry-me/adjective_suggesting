dearest father  you asked me recently why i maintain that i am afraid of you
as usual  i was unable to think of any answer to your question  partly for the very reason that i am afraid of you  and partly because an explanation of the grounds for this fear would mean going into far more details than i could even approximately keep in mind while talking
and if i now try to give you an answer in writing  it will still be very incomplete  because  even in writing  this fear and its consequences hamper me in relation to you and because the magnitude of the subject goes far beyond the scope of my memory and power of reasoning  to you the matter always seemed very simple  at least in so far as you talked about it in front of me  and indiscriminately in front of many other people
it looked to you more or less as follows  you have worked hard all your life  have sacrificed everything for your children  above all for me  consequently i have lived high and handsome  have been completely at liberty to learn whatever i wanted  and have had no cause for material worries  which means worries of any kind at all
you have not expected any gratitude for this  knowing what "children's gratitude" is like  but have expected at least some sort of obligingness  some sign of sympathy
instead i have always hidden from you  in my room  among my books  with crazy friends  or with crackpot ideas
i have never talked to you frankly  i have never come to you when you were in the synagogue  never visited you at franzensbad  nor indeed ever shown any family feeling  i have never taken any interest in the business or your other concerns  i saddled you with the factory and walked off  i encouraged ottla in her obstinacy  and never lifted a finger for you (never even got you a theater ticket)  while i do everything for my friends
if you sum up your judgment of me  the result you get is that  although you don't charge me with anything downright improper or wicked (with the exception perhaps of my latest marriage plan)  you do charge me with coldness  estrangements and ingratitude
and  what is more  you charge me with it in such a way as to make it seem my fault  as though i might have been able  with something like a touch on the steering wheel  to make everything quite different  while you aren't in the slightest to blame  unless it be for having been too good to me
this  your usual way of representing it  i regard as accurate only in so far as i too believe you are entirely blameless in the matter of our estrangement
but i am equally entirely blameless
if i could get you to acknowledge this  then what would be possible isâ€ not  i think  a new life  we are both much too old for thatâ€ but still  a kind of peace  no cessation  but still  a diminution of your unceasing reproaches
oddly enough you have some sort of notion of what i mean
for instance  a short time ago you said to me  "i have always been fond of you  even though outwardly i didn't act toward you as other fathers generally do  and this precisely because i can't pretend as other people can " now  father  on the whole i have never doubted your goodness toward me  but this remark i consider wrong
you can't pretend  that is true  but merely for that reason to maintain that other fathers pretend is either mere opinionated nests  and as such beyond discussion  or on the other handâ€ and this in my view is what it really isâ€ a veiled expression of the fact that something is wrong in our relationship and that you have played your part in causing it to be so  but without its being your fault
if you really mean that  then we are in agreement
i'm not going to say  of course  that i have become what i am only as a result of your influence
that would be very much exaggerated (and i am indeed inclined to this exaggeration)
it is indeed quite possible that even if i had grown up entirely free from your influence i still could not have become a person after your own heart
i should probably have still become a weakly  timid  hesitant  restless person  neither robert kafka nor karl hermann  but yet quite different from what i really am  and we might have got on with each other excellently
i should have been happy to have you as a friend  as a boss  an uncle  a grandfather  even (though rather more hesitantly) as a father in law
only as a father you have been too strong for me  particularly since my brothers died when they were small and my sisters came along only much later  so that i alone had to bear the brunt of itâ€ and for that i was much too weak
compare the twoof us  i  to put it in a very much abbreviated form  a lã¶wy with a certain kafka component  which  however  is not set in motion by the kafka will to life  business  and conquest  but by a lã¶wyish spur that impels more secretly  more diffidently  and in another direction  and which often fails to work entirely
you  on the other hand  a true kafka in strength  health  appetite  loudness of voice  eloquence  self satisfaction  worldly dominance  endurance  presence of mind  knowledge of human nature  a certain way of doing things on a grand scale  of course also with all the defects and weaknesses that go with these advantages and into which your temperament and sometimes your hot temper drive you
you are perhaps not wholly a kafka in your general outlook  in so far as i can compare you with uncle philipp  ludwig  and heinrich
that is odd  and here i don't see quite clear either
after all  they were all more cheerful  fresher  more informal  more easygoing  less severe than you
(in this  by the way  i have inherited a great deal from you and taken much too good care of my inheritance  without  admittedly  having the necessary counterweights in my own nature  as you have ) yet you too  on the other hand  have in this respect gone through various phases
you were perhaps more cheerful before you were disappointed by your children  especially by me  and were depressed at home (when other people came in  you were quite different)  perhaps you have become more cheerful again since then  now that your grandchildren and your son in law again give you something of that warmth which your children  except perhaps valli  could not give you
in any case  we were so different and in our difference so dangerous to each other that if anyone had tried to calculate in advance how i  the slowly developing child  and you  the full grown man  would behave toward one another  he could have assumed that you would simply trample me underfoot so that nothing was left of me
well  that did not happen
nothing alive can be calculated
but perhaps something worse happened
and in saying this i would all the time beg of you not to forget that i never  and not even for a single moment believe any guilt to be on your side
the effect you had on me was the effect you could not help having
but you should stop considering it some particular malice on my part that i succumbed to that effect
i was a timid child
for all that  i am sure i was also obstinate  as children are
i am sure that mother spoiled me too  but i cannot believe i was particularly difficult to manage  i cannot believe that a kindly word  a quiet taking by the hand  a friendly look  could not have got me to do anything that was wanted of me
now you are  after all  basically a charitable and kindhearted person (what follows will not be in contradiction to this  i am speaking only of the impression you made on the child)  but not every child has the endurance and fearlessness to go on searching until it comes to the kindliness that lies beneath the surface
you can treat a child only in the way you yourself are constituted  with vigor  noise  and hot temper  and in this case such behavior seemed to you to be also most appropriate because you wanted to bring me up to be a strong  brave boy
your educational methods in the very early years i can't  of course  directly describe today  but i can more or less imagine them by drawing conclusions from the later years and from your treatment of felix
what must be considered as heightening the effect is that you were then younger and hence more energetic  wilder  more primitive  and still more reckless than you are today and that you were  besides  completely tied to the business  scarcely able to be with me even once a day  and therefore made all the more profound impression on me  one that never really leveled out to the flatness of habit
there is only one episode in the early years of which i have a direct memory
you may remember it  too
one night i kept on whimpering for water  not  i am certain  because i was thirsty  but probably partly to be annoying  partly to amuse myself
after several vigorous threats had failed to have any effect  you took me out of bed  carried me out onto the pavlatche * and left me there alone for a while in my nightshirt  outside the shut door
i am not going to say that this was wrongâ€ perhaps there was really no other way of getting peace and quiet that nightâ€ but i mention it as typical of your methods of bringing up a child and their effect on me
i dare say i was quite obedient afterward at that period  but it did me inner harm
what was for me a matter of course  that senseless asking for water  and then the extraordinary terror of being carried outside were twothings that i  my nature being what it was  could never properly connect with each other
even years afterward i suffered from the tormenting fancy that the huge man  my father  the ultimate authority  would come almost for no reason at all and take me out of bed in the night and carry me out onto the pavlatche  and that consequently i meant absolutely nothing as far as he was concerned
*pavlatche is the czech word for the long balcony in the inner courtyard of old houses in prague
(ed ) that was only a small beginning  but this feeling of being nothing that often dominates me (a feeling that is in another respect  admittedly  also a noble and fruitful one) comes largely from your influence
what i would have needed was a little encouragement  a little friendliness  a little keeping open of my road  instead of which you blocked it for me  though of course with the good intention of making me take another road
but i was not fit for that
you encouraged me  for instance  when i saluted and marched smartly  but i was no future soldier  or you encouraged me when i was able to eat heartily or even drink beer with my meals  or when i was able to repeat songs  singing what i had not understood  or prattle to you using your own favorite expressions  imitating you  but nothing of this had anything to do with my future
and it is characteristic that even today you really only encourage me in anything when you yourself are involved in it  when what is at stake is your own sense of self importance  which i damage (for instance by my intended marriage) or which is damaged in me (for instance when pepa is abusive to me)
then i receive encouragement  i am reminded of my worth  the matches i would be entitled to make are pointed out to me  and pepa is condemned utterly
but apart from the fact that at my age i am already nearly unsusceptible to encouragement  what help could it be to me anyway  if it only comes when it isn't primarily a matter of myself at all  at that time  and at that time in every way  i would have needed encouragement
i was  after all  weighed down by your mere physical presence
i remember  for instance  how we often undressed in the same bathing hut
there was i  skinny  weakly  slight  you strong  tall  broad
even inside the hut i felt a miserable specimen  and what's more  not only in your eyes but in the eyes of the whole world  for you were for me the measure of all things
but then when we stepped out of the bathing hut before the people  you holding me by my hand  a little skeleton  unsteady  barefoot on the boards  frightened of the water  incapable of copying your swimming strokes  which you  with the best of intentions  but actually to my profound humiliation  kept on demonstrating  then i was frantic with desperation and at such moments all my bad experiences in all areas  fitted magnificently together
i felt best when you sometimes undressed first and i was able to stay behind in the hut alone and put off the disgrace of showing myself in public until at last you came to see what i was doing and drove me out of the hut
i was grateful to you for not seeming to notice my anguish  and besides  i was proud of my father's body
by the way  this difference between us remains much the same to this very day
in keeping  furthermore  was your intellectual domination
you had worked your way so far up by your own energies alone  and as a result you had unbounded confidence in your opinion
that was not yet so dazzling for me  a child as later for the boy growing up
from your armchair you ruled the world
your opinion was correct  every other was mad  wild  meshugge  not normal
your self confidence indeed was so great that you had no need to be consistent at all and yet never ceased to be in the right
it did sometimes happen that you had no opinions whatsoever about a matter and as a result every conceivable opinion with respect to the matter was necessarily wrong  without exception
you were capable  for instance  of running down the czechs  and then the germans  and then the jews  and what is more  not only selectively but in every respect  and finally nobody was left except yourself
for me you took on the enigmatic quality that all tyrants have whose rights are based on their person and not on reason
at least so it seemed to me
now  when i was the subject you were actually astonishingly often right  which in conversation was not surprising  for there was hardly ever any conversation between us  but also in reality
yet this was nothing particularly incomprehensible  either  in all my thinking i was  after all  under the heavy pressure of your personality  even in that part of itâ€ and particularly in thatâ€ which was not in accord with yours
all these thoughts  seemingly independent of you  were from the beginning burdened with your belittling judgments  it was almost impossible to endure this and still work out a thought with any measure of completeness and permanence
i am not here speaking of any sublime thoughts  but of every little childhood enterprise
it was only necessary to be happy about something or other  to be filled with the thought of it  to come home and speak of it  and the answer was an ironic sigh  a shaking of the head  a tapping on the table with a finger  "is that all you're so worked up about " or "such worries i'd like to have " or "the things some people have time to think about " or "where is that going to get you " or "what a song and dance about nothing " of course  you couldn't be expected to be enthusiastic about every childish triviality when you were in a state of vexation and worry
but that was not the point
rather  by virtue of your antagonistic nature  you could not help but always and inevitably cause the child such disappointments  and further  this antagonism  accumulating material  was constantly intensified  eventually the pattern expressed itself even if  for once  you were of the same opinion as i  finally  these disappointments of the child were not the ordinary disappointments of life but  since they involved you  the all important personage  they struck to the very core
courage  resolution  confidence  delight in this and that  could not last when you were against it or even if your opposition was merely to be assumed  and it was to be assumed in almost everything i did
this applied to people as well as to thoughts
it was enough that i should take a little interest in a personâ€ which in any case did not happen often  as a result of my natureâ€ for you  without any consideration for my feelings or respect for my judgment  to move in with abuse  defamation  and denigration
innocent  childlike people  such as  for instance  the yiddish actor lã¶wy  had to pay for that
without knowing him you compared him  in some dreadful way that i have now forgotten  to vermin and  as was so often the case with people i was fond of  you were automatically ready with the proverb of the dog and its fleas
here i particularly recall the actor because at that time i made a note of your pronouncements about him  with the comment  "this is how my father speaks of my friend (whom he does not even know)  simply because he is my friend
i shall always be able to bring this up against him whenever he reproaches me with the lack of a child's affection and gratitude " what was always incomprehensible to me was your total lack of feeling for the suffering and shame you could inflict on me with your words and judgments
it was as though you had no notion of your power
i too  i am sure  often hurt you with what i said  but then i always knew  and it pained me  but i could not control myself  could not keep the words back  i was sorry even while i was saying them
but you struck out with your words without much ado  you weren't sorry for anyone  either during or afterward  one was utterly defenseless against you
but your whole method of upbringing was like that
you have  i think  a gift for bringing up children  you could  i am sure  have been of help to a human being of your own kind with your methods  such a person would have seen the reasonableness of what you told him  would not have troubled about anything else  and would quietly have done things the way he was told
but for me as a child everything you called out to me was positively a heavenly commandment  i never forgot it  it remained for me the most important means of forming a judgment of the world  above all of forming a judgment of you yourself  and there you failed entirely
since as a child i was with you chiefly during meals  your teaching was to a large extent the teaching of proper behavior at table
what was brought to the table had to be eaten  the quality of the food was not to be discussedâ€ but you yourself often found the food inedible  called it "this swill " said "that cow" (the cook) had ruined it
because in accordance with your strong appetite and your particular predilection you ate everything fast  hot  and in big mouthfuls  the child had to hurry  there was a somber silence at table  interrupted by admonitions  "eat first  talk afterward " or "faster  faster  faster " or "there you are  you see  i finished ages ago " bones mustn't be cracked with the teeth  but you could
vinegar must not be sipped noisily  but you could
the main thing was that the bread should be cut straight
but it didn't matter that you did it with a knife dripping with gravy
care had to be taken that no scraps fell on the floor
in the end it was under your chair that there were the most scraps
at table one wasn't allowed to do anything but eat  but you cleaned and cut your fingernails  sharpened pencils  cleaned your ears with a toothpick
please  father  understand me correctly  in themselves these would have been utterly insignificant details  they only became depressing for me because you  so tremendously the authoritative man  did not keep the commandments you imposed on me hence the world was for me divided into three parts  one in which i  the slave  lived under laws that had been invented only for me and which i could  i did not know why  never completely comply with  then a second world  which was infinitely remote from mine  in which you lived  concerned with government  with the issuing of orders and with the annoyance about their not being obeyed  and finally a third world where everybody else lived happily and free from orders and from having to obey
i was continually in disgrace  either i obeyed your orders  and that was a disgrace  for they applied  after all  only to me  or i was defiant  and that was a disgrace too  for how could i presume to defy you  or i could not obey because i did not  for instance  have your strength  your appetite  your skill  although you expected it of me as a matter of course  this was the greatest disgrace of all
this was not the course of the child's reflections  but of his feelings
my situation at that time becomes clearer  perhaps  if i compare it with that of felix
you do  of course  treat him in a similar way  even indeed employing a particularly terrible method against him in his upbringing  whenever at meals he does anything that is in your opinion unclean  you are not content to say to him  as you used to say to me  "you are a pig " but add  "a real hermann" or "just like your father " now this may perhapsâ€ one can't say more than "perhaps"â€ not really harm felix in any essential way  because you are only a grandfather to him  an especially important one  of course  but still not everything as you were for me  and besides  felix is of a quiet  even at this stage to a certain extent manly character  one who may perhaps be disconcerted by a great voice thundering at him  but not permanently conditioned by it
but above all he is  of course  only comparatively seldom with you  and besides  he is also under other influences  you are for him a rather endearing curiosity from which he can pick and choose whatever he likes
for me you were nothing in the least like a curiosity  i couldn't pick and choose  i had to take everything
and this without being able to produce any arguments against any of it  for it is fundamentally impossible for you to talk calmly about a subject you don't approve of or even one that was not suggested by you  your imperious temperament does not permit it
in recent years you have been explaining this as due to your nervous heart condition
i don't know that you were ever essentially different
rather  the nervous heart condition is a means by which you exert your domination more strongly  since the thought of it necessarily chokes off the least opposition from others
this is  of course  not a reproach  only a statement of fact
as in ottla's case  when you say  "you simply can't talk to her at all  she flies straight in your face " but in reality she does not begin by flying out at all
you mistake the person for the thing
the thing under discussion is what flies in your face and you immediately made up your mind about it without listening to the person  whatever is brought forward afterward merely serves to irritate you further  never to convince you
then all one gets from you is  "do whatever you like
so far as i'm concerned you have a free hand
you're of age  i've no advice to give you " and all this with that frightful  hoarse undertone of anger and utter condemnation that makes me tremble less today than in my childhood only because the child's exclusive sense of guilt has been partly replaced by insight into our helplessness  yours and mine
the impossibility of getting on calmly together had one more result  actually a very natural one  i lost the capacity to talk
i daresay i would not have become a very eloquent person in any case  but i would  after all  have acquired the usual fluency of human language
but at a very early stage you forbade me to speak
your threat  "not a word of contradiction " and the raised hand that accompanied it have been with me ever since
what i got from youâ€ and you are  whenever it is a matter of your own affairs  an excellent talkerâ€ was a hesitant  stammering mode of speech  and even that was still too much for you  and finally i kept silent  at first perhaps out of defiance  and then because i could neither think nor speak in your presence
and because you were the person who really brought me up  this has had its repercussions throughout my life
it is altogether a remarkable mistake for you to believe i never complied with your wishes
"always contrary" was really not my basic principle where you were concerned  as you believe and as you reproach me
on the contrary  if i had obeyed you less  i am sure you would have been much better pleased with me
as it is  all your educational measures hit the mark exactly
there was no hold i tried to escape
as i now am  i am (apart  of course  from the fundamentals and the influence of life itself) the result of your upbringing and of my obedience
that this result is nevertheless distressing to you  indeed that you unconsciously refuse to acknowledge it as the result of your methods of upbringing  is due to the fact that your hand and the material i offered were so alien to each other
you would say  "not a word of contradiction " thinking that that was a way of silencing the oppositional forces in me that were disagreeable to you  but the effect of it was too strong for me  i was too docile  i became completely dumb  cringed away from you  hid from you  and only dared to stir when i was so far away from you that your power could no longer reach meâ€ at least not directly
but you were faced with all that  and it all seemed to you to be "contrary " whereas it was only the inevitable consequence of your strength and my weakness
your extremely effective rhetorical methods in bringing me up  which never failed to work with me  were  abuse  threats  irony  spiteful laughter  andâ€ oddly enoughâ€ self pity
i cannot recall your ever having abused me directly and in downright abusive terms nor was that necessary  you had so many other methods  and besides  in talk at home and particularly at the shop the words of abuse went flying around me in such swarms  as they were flung at other people's heads  that as a little boy i was sometimes almost stunned and had no reason not to apply them to myself too  for the people you were abusing were certainly no worse than i was and you were certainly not more displeased with them than with me and here again was your enigmatic innocence and inviolability  you cursed and swore without the slightest scruple  yet you condemned cursing and swearing in other people and would not have it
you reinforced abusiveness with threats and this applied to me too
how terrible for me was  for instance  that "i'll tear you apart like a fish " although i knew  of course  that nothing worse was to follow (admittedly  as a little child i didn't know that)  but it was almost exactly in accord with my notions of your power  and i saw you as being capable of doing this too
it was also terrible when you ran around the table  shouting  grabbing at one  obviously not really trying to grab  yet pretending to  and mother (finally) had to rescue one  as it seemed
once again one had  so it seemed to the child  remained alive through your mercy and bore one's life henceforth as an undeserved gift from you
this is also the place to mention the threats about the consequences of disobedience
when i began to do something you did not like and you threatened me with the prospect of failure  my veneration for your opinion was so great that the failure became inevitable  even though perhaps it happened only at some later time
i lost confidence in my own actions
i was wavering  doubtful
the older i became  the more material there was for you to bring up against me as evidence of my worthlessness  gradually you began really to be right in a certain respect
once again  i am careful not to assert that i became like this solely through you  you only intensified what was already there  but you intensified it greatly  simply because where i was concerned you were very powerful and you employed all your power to that end
you put special trust in bringing up children by means of irony  and this was most in keeping with your superiority over me
an admonition from you generally took this form  "can't you do it in such and such a way  that's too hard for you  i suppose
you haven't the time  of course " and so on
and each such question would be accompanied by malicious laughter and a malicious face
one was  so to speak  already punished before one even knew that one had done something bad
maddening were also those rebukes in which one was treated as a third person  in other words  considered not worthy even to be spoken to angrily  that is to say  when you would speak ostensibly to mother but actually to me  who was sitting right there
for instance  "of course  that's too much to expect of our worthy son " and the like
(this produced a corollary in that  for instance  i did not dare to ask you  and later from habit did not even really much think of asking  anything directly when mother was there
it was much less dangerous for the child to put questions to mother  sitting there beside you  and to ask mother  "how is father "â€ so guarding oneself against surprises ) there were  of course  also cases when one was entirely in agreement with even the worst irony  namely  when it referred to someone else  such as elli  with whom i was on bad terms for years there was an orgy of malice and spiteful delight for me when such things were said of her  as they were at almost every meal  "she has to sit ten feet back from the table  the big fat lump " and when you  morosely sitting on your chair without the slightest trace of pleasantness or good humor  a bitter enemy  would exaggeratedly imitate the way she sat  which you found utterly loathsome
how often such things happened  over and over again  and how little you really achieved as a result of them  i think the reason was that the expenditure of anger and malice seemed to be in no proper relation to the subject itself  one did not have the feeling that the anger was caused by this trifle of sitting some way back from the table  but that the whole bulk of it had already been present to begin with  then  only by chance  happened to settle on this matter as a pretext for breaking out
since one was convinced that a pretext would be found anyway  one did not try very hard  and one's feelings became dulled by these continued threats
one had gradually become pretty sure of not getting a beating  anyway
one became a glum  inattentive  disobedient child  always intent on escape  mainly within one's own self
so you suffered  and so we suffered
from your own point of view you were quite right when  clenching your teeth and with that gurgling laughter that gave the child its first notions of hell  you used to say bitterly (as you did only just recently in connection with a letter from constantinople)  "a nice crowd that is " what seemed to be quite incompatible with this attitude toward your children was  and it happened very often  that you openly lamented your situation
i confess that as a child (though probably somewhat later) i was completely callous about this and could not understand how you could possibly expect to get any sympathy from anyone
you were such a giant in every respect
what could you care for our pity or even our help  our help  indeed  you could not but despise  as you so often despised us ourselves
hence  i did not take these laments at their face value and looked for some hidden motive behind them
only later did i come to understand that you really suffered a great deal because of your children  but at that time  when these laments might under different circumstances still have met with a childish  candid sympathy  unhesitatingly ready to offer any help it could  to me they had to seem like overemphatic means of disciplining me and humiliating me  as such not in themselves very intense  but with the harmful side effect that the child became conditioned not to take very seriously the very things it should have taken seriously fortunately  there were exceptions to all this  mostly when you suffered in silence  and affection and kindliness by their own strength overcame all obstacles  and moved me immediately
rare as this was  it was wonderful
for instance  in earlier years  in hot summers  when you were tired after lunch  i saw you having a nap at the office  your elbow on the desk  or you joined us in the country  in the summer holidays  on sundays  worn out from work  or the time mother was gravely ill and you stood holding on to the bookcase  shaking with sobs  or when  during my last illness  you came tiptoeing to ottla's room to see me  stopping in the doorway  craning your neck to see me  and out of consideration only waved to me with your hand
at such times one would lie back and weep for happiness  and one weeps again now  writing it down
you have a particularly beautiful  very rare way of quietly  contentedly  approvingly smiling  a way of smiling that can make the person for whom it is meant entirely happy
i can't recall its ever having expressly been my lot in my childhood  but i dare say it may have happened  for why should you have refused it to me at a time when i still seemed blameless to you and was your great hope  yet in the long run even such friendly impressions brought about nothing but an increased sense of guilt  making the world still more incomprehensible to me
i would rather keep to the practical and permanent
in order to assert myself even a little in relation to you  and partly too from a kind of vengefulness  i soon began to observe little ridiculous things about you  to collect them and to exaggerate them
for instance  how easily you let yourself be dazzled by people who were only seemingly above you  how you would keep on talking about them  as of some imperial councilor or some such (on the other hand  such things also pained me  to see you  my father  believing you had any need of such trifling confirmations of your own value  and boasting about them)  or i would note your taste for indecent expressions  which you would produce in the loudest possible voice  laughing about them as though you had said something particularly good  while in point of fact it was only a banal little obscenity (at the same time this again was for me a humiliating manifestation of your vitality)
there were  of course  plenty of such observations
i was happy about them  they gave me occasion for whispering and joking  you sometimes noticed it and were angry about it  took it for malice and lack of respect  but believe me  it was for me nothing other than a meansâ€ moreover  a useless oneâ€ of attempted self preservation  they were jokes of the kind that are made about gods and kings  jokes that are not only compatible with the profoundest respect but are indeed part and parcel of it
incidentally  you too  in keeping with your similar position where i was concerned  tried a similar form of self defense
you were in the habit of pointing out how exaggeratedly well off i was and how well i had in fact been treated
that is correct but i don't believe it was of any real use to me under the prevailing circumstances it is true that mother was endlessly good to me  but for me all that was in relation to you  that is to say  in no good relation
mother unconsciously played the part of a beater during a hunt
even if your method of upbringing might in some unlikely case have set me on my own feet by means of producing defiance  dislike  or even hate in me  mother canceled that out again by kindness  by talking sensibly (in the confusion of my childhood she was the very prototype of good sense and reasonableness)  by pleading for me  and i was again driven back into your orbit  which i might perhaps otherwise have broken out of  to your advantage and to my own
or it happened that no real reconciliation came about  that mother merely shielded me from you in secret  secretly gave me something  or allowed me to do something  and then where you were concerned i was again the furtive creature  the cheat  the guilty one  who in his worthlessness could only pursue sneaky methods even to get the things he regarded as his right
of course  i became used to taking such a course also in quest of things to which  even in my own view  i had no right
this again meant an increase in the sense of guilt
it is also true that you hardly ever really gave me a beating
but the shouting  the way your face got red  the hasty undoing of the suspenders and laying them ready over the back of the chair  all that was almost worse for me
it is as if someone is going to be hanged
if he really is hanged  then he is dead and it is all over
but if he has to go through all the preliminaries to being hanged and he learns of his reprieve only when the noose is dangling before his face  he may suffer from it all his life
besides  from the many occasions on which i had  according to your clearly expressed opinion  deserved a beating but was let off at the last moment by your grace  i again accumulated only a huge sense of guilt
on every side i was to blame  i was in your debt
you have always reproached me (either alone or in front of others  since you have no feeling for the humiliation of the latter  and your children's affairs were always public) for living in peace and quiet  warmth and abundance  lacking nothing  thanks to your hard work
i think of remarks that must positively have worn grooves in my brain  such as  "when i was only seven i had to push a handcart from village to village " "we all had to sleep in one room " "we were glad when we got potatoes " "for years i had open sores on my legs because i did not have enough warm clothes " "i was only a little boy when i was sent to pisek to work in a store " "i got nothing from home  not even when i was in the army  but still i managed to send money home " "but for all that  for all thatâ€ father was always father to me
ah  nobody knows what that means these days  what do these children know  nobody's been through that  does any child understand such things today " under other conditions such stories might have been very educational  they might have been a way in encouraging one and strengthening one to endure torments and deprivations similar to those one's father had undergone
but that wasn't what you wanted at all  the situation had  after all  become quite different as a result of all your efforts  and there was no opportunity to distinguish oneself as you had done
such an opportunity would first of all have had to be created by violence and revolutions  it would have meant breaking away from home (assuming one had had the resolution and strength to do so and that mother wouldn't have worked against it  for her part  with other means) but that was not what you wanted at all  that you termed ingratitude  extravagance  disobedience  treachery  madness
and so  while on the one hand you tempted me to it by means of example  story  and humiliation  on the other hand you forbade it with the utmost severity
otherwise  for instance you ought to have been delighted with ottla's zã¼rau escapade*â€ apart from the accompanying circumstances she wanted to get back to the country from which you had come  she wanted work and hardship such as you had had  she did not want to depend on the fruits of your labor  just as you yourself were independent of your father
were those such dreadful intentions  was that so remote from your example and your precept  well  ottla's intentions finally came to nothing in practice  were indeed perhaps carried out in a somewhat ridiculous way  with too much fuss  and she did not have enough consideration for her parents
but was that exclusively her fault and not also the fault of the circumstances and  above all  of the fact that you were so estranged from her  was she any less estranged from you (as you later tried to convince yourself) in the business than afterward at zã¼rau  and would you not quite certainly have had the power (assuming you could have brought yourself to do so) to turn that escapade into something very good by means of encouragement  advice  and supervision  perhaps even merely by means of toleration  *refers to his sister ottla's taking over the management of a farm in the german bohemian town of zã¼rau kafka spent time with her there during his illness in 1917 18
(ed ) in connection with such experiences you used to say  in bitter jest  that we were too well off
but that joke is  in a sense  no joke at all
what you had to fight for we received from your hand  but the fight for external life  a fight that was instantly open to you and which we are  of course  not spared either  we now have to fight for only late in life  in our maturity but with only childish strength
i do not say that our situation is therefore inevitably less favorable than yours was  on the contrary  it is probably no better and no worse (although this is said without reference to our different natures)  only we have the disadvantage of not being able to boast of our wretchedness and not being able to humiliate anyone with it as you have done with your wretchedness nor do i deny that it might have been possible for me to really enjoy the fruits of your great and successful work  that i could have turned them to good account and  to your joy  continued to work with them  but here again  our estrangement stood in the way
i could enjoy what you gave  but only in humiliation  weariness  weakness  and with a sense of guilt
that was why i could be grateful to you for everything only as a beggar is  and could never show it by doing the right things
the next external result of this whole method of upbringing was that i fled everything that even remotely reminded me of you
first  the business
in itself  especially in my childhood  so long as it was still a simple shop  i ought to have liked it very much  it was so full of life  lit up in the evening  there was so much to see and hear  one was able to help now and then  to distinguish oneself  and  above all  to admire you for your magnificent commercial talents  for the way you sold things  managed people  made jokes  were untiring  in case of doubt knew how to make the right decision immediately  and so forth  even the way you wrapped a parcel or opened a crate was a spectacle worth watching  all this was certainly not the worst school for a child
but since you gradually began to terrify me on all sides and the business and you became one thing for me  the business too made me feel uneasy
things that had at first been a matter of course for me there now began to torment and shame me  particularly the way you treated the staff
i don't know  perhaps it was the same in most businesses (in the assicurazioni generali  for instance  in my time it was really similar  and the explanation i gave the director for my resignation was  though not strictly in accordance with the truth  still not entirely a lie  my not being able to bear the cursing and swearing  which incidentally had not actually been directed at me  it was something to which i had become too painfully sensitive from home)  but in my childhood other businesses did not concern me
but you i heard and saw shouting  cursing  and raging in the shop  in a way that in my opinion at that time had no equal anywhere in the world
and not only cursing  but other sorts of tyrannizing
for instance  the way you pushed goods you did not want to have mixed up with others off the counterâ€ only the thoughtlessness of your rage was some slight excuseâ€ and how the clerk had to pick them up
or your constant comment about a clerk who had tb  "the sooner that sick dog croaks the better " you called the employees "paid enemies " and that was what they were  but even before they became that  you seemed to me to be their "paying enemy " there  too  i learned the great lesson that you could be unjust  in my own case i would not have noticed it so soon  for there was too much accumulated sense of guilt in me ready to admit that you were right  but in the shop  in my childish viewâ€ which later  of course  became somewhat modified  although not too much soâ€ were strangers  who were after all  working for us and for that reason had to live in constant dread of you
of course i exaggerated  because i simply assumed you had as terrible an effect on these people as on me
if it had been so  they could not have lived at all  since  however they were grown up people  most of them with excellent nerves  they shook off this abuse without any trouble and in the end it did you much more harm than it did them
but it made the business insufferable to me  reminding me far too much of my relations with you  quite apart from your proprietary interest and apart from your mania for domination even as a businessman  you were so greatly superior to all those who ever came to learn the business from you that nothing they ever did could satisfy you  and you must  as i assumed  in the same way be forever dissatisfied with me too
that was why i could not help siding with the staff  i did it also  by the way  because from sheer nervousness i could not understand how anyone could be so abusive to a stranger  and thereforeâ€ from sheer nervousness and for no other reason than my own securityâ€ i tried to reconcile the staff  which must  i thought  be in a terrible state of indignation  with you and with our family
to this end it was not enough for me to behave in an ordinary decent way toward the staff  or even modestly  more than that  i had to be humble  not only be first to say "good morning" or "good evening " but if at all possible i had to forestall any return of the greeting
and even if i  insignificant creature that i was  down below  had licked their feet it would still have been no compensation for the way that you  the master  were lashing out at them up above
this relationship that i came to have toward my fellow man extended beyond the limits of the business and on into the future (something similar  but not so dangerous and deepâ€ going as in my case  is for instance ottla's taste for associating with poor people  sitting together with the maids  which annoys you so much  and the like)
in the end i was almost afraid of the business and  in any case  it had long ceased to be any concern of mine even before i went to the gymnasium and hence was taken even further away from it
besides  it seemed to be entirely beyond my resources and capacities since  as you said  it exhausted even yours
you then tried (today this seems to me both touching and shaming) to extract  nevertheless  some little sweetness for yourself from my dislike of the business  of your worldâ€ a dislike that was after all very distressing to youâ€ by asserting that i had no business sense  that i had loftier ideas in my head  and the like mother was  of course  delighted with this explanation that you wrung from yourself  and i too  in my vanity and wretchedness  let myself be influenced by it but if it had really been only or mainly "loftier ideas" that turned me against the business (which i now  but only now  have come really and honestly to hate)  they would have had to express themselves differently  instead of letting me float quickly and timidly through my schooling and my law studies until i finally landed at a clerk's desk if i was to escape from you  i had to escape from the family as well  even from mother
true  one could always get protection from her  but only in relation to you
she loved you too much and was too devoted and loyal to you to have been for long an independent spiritual force in the child's struggle
this was  incidentally  a correct instinct of the child  for with the passing of the years mother became ever more closely allied to you  while  where she herself was concerned  she always kept her independence  within the narrowest limits  delicately and beautifully  and without ever essentially hurting you  still  with the passing of the years she more and more completely  emotionally rather than intellectually  blindly adopted your judgments and your condemnations with regard to the children  particularly in the caseâ€ certainly a grave oneâ€ of ottla
of course  it must always be borne in mind how tormenting and utterly wearing mother's position in the family was
she toiled in the business and in the house  and doubly suffered all the family illnesses  but the culmination of all this was what she suffered in her position between us and you
you were always affectionate and considerate toward her  but in this respect  you spared her just as little as we spared her
we all hammered ruthlessly away at her  you from your side  we from ours
it was a diversion  nobody meant any harm  thinking of the battle that you were waging with us and that we were waging with you  and it was mother who got the brunt of all our wild feelings
nor was it at all a good contribution to the children's upbringing the way youâ€ of course  without being in the slightest to blame for it yourselfâ€  tormented her on our account
it even seemed to justify our otherwise unjustifiable behavior toward her
how she suffered from us on your accounts and from you on our account  even without counting those cases in which you were in the right because she was spoiling us  even though this "spoiling" may sometimes have been only a quiet  unconscious counterdemonstration against your system
of course  mother could not have borne all this if she had not drawn the strength to bear it from her love for us all and her happiness in that love
my sisters were only partly on my side
the one who was happiest in her relation to you was valli
being closest to mother  she fell in with your wishes in a similar way  without much effort and without suffering much harm
and because she reminded you of mother  you did accept her in a more friendly spirit  although there was little kafka material in her
but perhaps that was precisely what you wanted  where there was nothing of the kafka's  even you could not demand anything of the sort  nor did you feel  as with the rest of us  that something was getting lost which had to be saved by force
besides  it may be that you were never particularly fond of the kafka element as it manifested itself in women
valli's relationship to you would perhaps have become even friendlier if the rest of us had not disturbed it somewhat
elli is the only example of the almost complete success of a breaking away from your orbit
when she was a child she was the last person i should have expected it of
for she was such a clumsy  tired  timid  bad tempered  guilt ridden  overmeek  malicious  lazy  greedy  miserly child  i could hardly bring myself to look at her  certainly not to speak to her  so much did she remind me of myself  in so very much the same way was she under the same spell of our upbringing her miserliness was especially abhorrent to me  since i had it to an  if possible  even greater extent
miserliness is  after all  one of the most reliable signs of profound unhappiness  i was so unsure of everything that  in fact  i possessed only what i actually had in my hands or in my mouth or what was at least on the way there  and this was precisely what she  being in a similar situation  most enjoyed taking away from me
but all this changed when  at an early ageâ€ this is the most important thingâ€ she left home  married  had children  and became cheerful  carefree  brave  generous  unselfish  and hopeful
it is almost incredible how you did not really notice this change at all  or at any rate did not give it its due  blinded as you were by the grudge you have always borne elli and fundamentally still bear her to this day  only this grudge matters much less now  since elli no longer lives with us and  besides  your love for felix and your affection for karl have made it less important
only gerti sometimes has to suffer for it still
i scarcely dare write of ottla  i know that by doing so i jeopardize the whole effect i hope for from this letter
in ordinary circumstances  that is  so long as she is not in particular need or danger  all you feel is only hatred for her  you yourself have confessed to me that in your opinion she is always intentionally causing you suffering and annoyance and that while you are suffering on her account she is satisfied and pleased in other words  a sort of fiend
what an immense estrangement  greater still than that between you and me  must have come about between you and her  for such an immense misunderstanding to be possible
she is so remote from you that you scarcely see her any more  instead  you put a specter in the place where you suppose her to be
i grant you that you have had a particularly difficult time with her
i don't  of course  quite see to the bottom of this very complicated case  but at any rate here was something like a kind of lã¶wy  equipped with the best kafka weapons
between us there was no real struggle  i was soon finished off  what remained was flight  embitterment  melancholy  and inner struggle
but you twowere always in a fighting position  always fresh  always energetic
a sight as magnificent as it was desperate
at the very beginning you were  i am sure  very close to each other  because of the four of us ottla is even today perhaps the purest representation of the marriage between you and mother and of the forces it combined
i don't know what it was that deprived you both of the happiness of the harmony between father and child  but i can't help believing that the development in this case was similar to that in mine
on your side there was the tyranny of your own nature  on her side the lã¶wy defiance  touchiness  sense of justice  restlessness  and all that backed by the consciousness of the kafka vigor
doubtless i too influenced her  but scarcely of my own doing  simply through the fact of my existence
besides  as the last to arrive  she found herself in a situation in which the balance of power was already established  and was able to form her own judgment from the large amount of material at her disposal
i can even imagine that she may  in her inmost being  have wavered for some time as to whether she should fling herself into your arms or into those of the adversaries  and it is obvious that at that time there was something you failed to do and that you rebuffed her  but if it had been possible  the twoof you would have become a magnificently harmonious pair that way i should have lost an ally  but the sight of you twowould have richly compensated me  besides  the incredible happiness of finding complete contentment at least in one child would have changed you much to my advantage
all this  however  is today only a dream
ottla has no contact with her father and has to seek her way alone  like me  and the degree of confidence  self confidence  health  and ruthlessness by which she surpasses me makes her in your eyes more wicked and treacherous than i seem to you
i understand that
from your point of view she can't be different
indeed  she herself is capable of regarding herself with your eyes  of feeling what you suffer and of beingâ€ not desperate (despair is my business) but very sad
you do see us together often enough  in apparent contradiction to this  whispering and laughing  and now and then you hear us mentioning you
the impression you get is that of impudent conspirators
strange conspirators
you are  admittedly  a chief subject of our conversations  as of our thoughts ever since we can remember  but truly  not in order to plot against you do we sit together  but in order to discussâ€ with all our might and main  jokingly and seriously  in affection  defiance  anger  revulsion  submission  consciousness of guilt  with all the resources of our heads and heartsâ€ this terrible trial that is pending between us and you  to examine it in all its details  from all sides  on all occasions  from far and nearâ€ a trial in which you keep on claiming to be the judge  whereas  at least in the main (here i leave a margin for all the mistakes i may naturally make) you are a party too  just as weak and deluded as we are
an example of the effect of your methods of upbringing  one that is very instructive in the context of the whole situation  is the case of irma
on the one hand  she was  after all  a stranger  already grown up when she entered your business  and had to deal with you mainly as her employer  so that she was only partially exposed to your influence  and this at an age when she had already developed powers of resistance  yet  on the other hand  she was also a blood relation  venerating you as her father's brother  and the power you had over her was far greater than that of a mere employer
and despite all this she  who  with her frail body  was so efficient  intelligent  hard working  modest  trustworthy  unselfish  and loyal  who loved you as her uncle and admired you as her employer  she who proved herself in previous and in subsequent positions  was not a very good clerk to you
her relationship with you was  in fact  nearly that of one of your childrenâ€ pushed into that role  naturally  by us  tooâ€ and the power of your personality to bend others was  even in her case  so great that (admittedly only in relation to you and  it is to be hoped  without the deeper suffering of a child) she developed forgetfulness  carelessness  a sort of gallows humor  and perhaps even a shade of defiance  in so far as she was capable of that at all
and i do not even take into account that she was ailing  and not very happy in other respects either  and that she was burdened by a bleak home life
what was so illuminating to me in your relation to her  you yourself summed up in a remark that became classical for us  one that was almost blasphemous  but at the same time extraordinary evidence of the naã¯vetã© of your way of treating people  "the late lamented has left me quite a mess " i might go on to describe further orbits of your influence and of the struggle against it  but there i would be entering uncertain ground and would have to construct things and  apart from that  the farther you are away from your business and your family  the pleasanter you have always become  easier to get on with  better mannered  more considerate  and more sympathetic (i mean outwardly  too)  in exactly the same way as for instance an autocrat  when he happens to be outside the frontiers of his own country  has no reason to go on being tyrannical and is able to associate good humoredly even with the lowest of the low
in fact  in the group photographs taken at franzensbad  for instance  you always looked as big and jolly  among those sulky little people  as a king on his travels
this was something  i grant you  from which your children might have benefited too  if they had been capable of recognizing this even as little children  which was impossible  and if i  for one  had not had to live constantly within the inmost  strictest  binding ring of your influence  as  in fact  i did
not only did i lose my family feeling  as you say  on the contrary  i did indeed have a feeling about the family  mostly in a negative sense  concerned with the breaking away from you (which  of course could never be done completely)
relations with people outside the family  however  suffered possibly still more under your influence
you are entirely mistaken if you believe i do everything for other people out of affection and loyalty  and for you and the family nothing  out of coldness and betrayal
i repeat for the tenth time  even in other circumstances i should probably have become a shy and nervous person  but it is a long dark road from there to where i have really come (up to now i have intentionally passed over in silence relatively little in this letter  but now and later i shall have to keep silent about some things that are still too hard for me to confessâ€ to you and to myself
i say this in order that if the picture as a whole should be somewhat blurred here and there  you should not believe that this is due to lack of evidence  on the contrary  there is evidence that might well make the picture unbearably stark
it is not easy to find a middle way ) here  it is enough to remind you of early days
i had lost my self confidence where you were concerned  and in its place had developed a boundless sense of guilt
(in recollection of this boundlessness i once wrote of someone  accurately  "he is afraid the shame will outlive him ") i could not suddenly change when i was with other people  rather  i came to feel an even deeper sense of guilt with them  for  as i have already said  i had to make up to them for the wrongs you had done them in your business  wrongs in which i too had my share of responsibility
besides  you always had some objection to make  frankly or covertly  about everyone i associated with  and for this too i had to atone
the mistrust that you tried to instill into me toward most people  at business and at home (name a single person who was of importance to me in my childhood whom you didn't at least once tear to shreds with your criticism)  was  oddly enough  of no particular burden to you (you were strong enough to bear it  besides  it was perhaps really only a token of the autocrat)
this mistrust (which was nowhere confirmed in the eyes of the little boy  since everywhere i saw only people excellent beyond any hope of emulation) turned in me to mistrust of myself and perpetual anxiety about everything else
there  then  i was in general certain of not being able to escape from you
that you were mistaken on this point was perhaps due to your actually never learning anything about my association with other people  and mistrustfully and jealously (i don't deny  do i  that you are fond of me ) you assumed that i had to compensate elsewhere for the lack of a family life  since it must be impossible that away from home i should live in the same way
incidentally  in this respect  it was precisely in my childhood that i did find a certain comfort in my very mistrust of my own judgment
i would say to myself  "oh  you're exaggerating  you tend too much to feel trivialities as great exceptions  the way young people always do " but this comfort i later lost almost entirely  when i gained a clearer perspective of the world
i found just as little escape from you in judaism
here some measure of escape would have been thinkable in principle  moreover  it would have been thinkable that we might both have found each other in judaism or that we even might have begun from there in harmony
but what sort of judaism was it that i got from you  in the course of the years  i have taken roughly three different attitudes to it
as a child i reproached myself  in accord with you  for not going to the synagogue often enough  for not fasting  and so on
i thought that in this way i was doing a wrong not to myself but to you  and i was penetrated by a sense of guilt  which was  of course  always near at hand
later  as a young man  i could not understand how  with the insignificant scrap of judaism you yourself possessed  you could reproach me for not making an effort (for the sake of piety at least  as you put it) to cling to a similar  insignificant scrap
it was indeed  so far as i could see  a mere nothing  a jokeâ€ not even a joke
four days a year you went to the synagogue  where you were  to say the least  closer to the indifferent than to those who took it seriously  patiently went through the prayers as a formality  sometimes amazed me by being able to show me in the prayer book the passage that was being said at the moment  and for the rest  so long as i was present in the synagogue (and this was the main thing) i was allowed to hang around wherever i liked
and so i yawned and dozed through the many hours (i don't think i was ever again so bored  except later at dancing lessons) and did my best to enjoy the few little bits of variety there were  as for instance when the ark of the covenant was opened  which always reminded me of the shooting galleries where a cupboard door would open in the same way whenever one hit a bull's eye  except that there something interesting always came out and here it was always just the same old dolls without heads
incidentally  it was also very frightening for me there  not only  as goes without saying  because of all the people one came into close contact with  but also because you once mentioned in passing that i too might be called to the torah
that was something i dreaded for years
but otherwise i was not fundamentally disturbed in my boredom  unless it was by the bar mitzvah  but that demanded no more than some ridiculous memorizing  in other words  it led to nothing but some ridiculous passing of an examination  and  so far as you were concerned  by little  not very significant incidents  as when you were called to the torah and passed  in what to my way of feeling was a purely social event  or when you stayed on in the synagogue for the prayers for the dead  and i was sent away  which for a long timeâ€ obviously because of the being sent away and the lack of any deeper interestâ€  aroused in me the more or less unconscious feeling that something indecent was about to take place â€ that's how it was in the synagogue  at home it was  if possible  even poorer  being confined to the first seder  which more and more developed into a farce  with fits of hysterical laughter  admittedly under the influence of the growing children
(why did you have to give way to that influence  because you had brought it about ) this was the religious material that was handed on to me  to which may be added at most the outstretched hand pointing to "the sons of the millionaire fuchs " who attended the synagogue with their father on the high holy days how one could do anything better with that material than get rid of it as fast as possible  i could not understand  precisely the getting rid of it seemed to me to be the devotes action
still later  i did see it again differently and realized why it was possible for you to think that in this respect too i was malevolently betraying you
you really had brought some traces of judaism with you from the ghetto like village community  it was not much and it dwindled a little more in the city and during your military service  but still  the impressions and memories of your youth did just about suffice for some sort of jewish life  especially since you did not need much help of that kind  but came of robust stock and could personally scarcely be shaken by religious scruples unless they were strongly mixed with social scruples
basically the faith that ruled your life consisted in your believing in the unconditional rightness of the opinions of a certain class of jewish society  and hence actually  since these opinions were part and parcel of your own nature  in believing in yourself
even in this there was still judaism enough  but it was too little to be handed on to the child  it all dribbled away while you were passing it on
in part  it was youthful memories that could not be passed on to others  in part  it was your dreaded personality
it was also impossible to make a child  overacutely observant from sheer nervousness  understand that the few flimsy gestures you performed in the name of judaism  and with an indifference in keeping with their flimsiness  could have any higher meaning for you they had meaning as little souvenirs of earlier times  and that was why you wanted to pass them on to me  but since they no longer had any intrinsic value even for you could do this only through persuasion or threat  on the one hand  this could not be successful  and on the other  it had to make you very angry with me on account of my apparent obstinacy  since you did not recognize the weakness of your position in this
the whole thing is  of course  no isolated phenomenon
it was much the same with a large section of this transitional generation of jews  which had migrated from the still comparatively devout countryside to the cities
it happened automatically  only  it added to our relationship  which certainly did not lack in acrimony  one more sufficiently painful source for it
although you ought to believe  as i do  in your guiltlessness in this matter too  you ought to explain this guiltlessness by your nature and by the conditions of the times  not merely by external circumstances  that is  not by saying  for instance  that you had too much work and too many other worries to be able to bother with such things as well in this manner you tend to twist your undoubted guiltlessness into an unjust reproach to others
that can be very easily refuted everywhere and here too
it was not a matter of any sort of instruction you ought to have given your children  but of an exemplary life
had your judaism been stronger  your example would have been more compelling too  this goes without saying and is  again  by no means a reproach  but only a refutation of your reproaches
you have recently been reading franklin's memoirs of his youth
i really did purposely give you this book to read  though not  as you ironically commented  because of a little passage on vegetarianism  but because of the relationship between the author and his father  as it is there described  and of the relationship between the author and his son  as it is spontaneously revealed in these memoirs written for that son
i do not wish to dwell here on matters of detail
i have received a certain retrospective confirmation of this view of your judaism from your attitude in recent years  when it seemed to you that i was taking more interest in jewish matters
as you have in advance an aversion to every one of my activities and especially to the nature of my interest  so you have had it here too
but in spite of this  one could have expected that in this case you would make a little exception
it was  after all  judaism of your judaism that was coming to life here  and with it also the possibility of entering into a new relationship between us
i do not deny that  had you shown interest in them  these things might  for that very reason  have become suspect in my eyes
i do not even dream of asserting that i am in this respect any better than you are
but it never came to the test
through my intervention judaism became abhorrent to you  jewish writings unreadable  they "nauseated" you â€ this may have meant you insisted that only that judaism which you had shown me in my childhood was the right one  and beyond it there was nothing
yet that you should insist on it was really hardly thinkable
but then the "nausea" (apart from the fact that it was directed primarily not against judaism but against me personally) could only mean that unconsciously you did acknowledge the weakness of your judaism and of my jewish upbringing  did not wish to be reminded of it in any way  and reacted to any reminder with frank hatred
incidentally  your negative high esteem of my new judaism was much exaggerated  first of all  it bore your curse within it  and secondly in its development the fundamental relationship to one's fellow men was decisive  in my case that is to say fatal
you struck closer to home with your aversion to my writing and to everything that  unknown to you  was connected with it
here i had  in fact  got some distance away from you by my own efforts  even if it was slightly reminiscent of the worm that  when a foot treads on its tail end  breaks loose with its front part and drags itself aside
to a certain extent i was in safety  there was a chance to breathe freely
the aversion you naturally and immediately took to my writing was  for once  welcome to me
my vanity  my ambition did suffer under your soon proverbial way of hailing the arrival of my books  "put it on my bedside table " (usually you were playing cards when a book came)  but i was really quite glad of it  not only out of rebellious malice  not only out of delight at a new confirmation of my view of our relationship  but quite spontaneously  because to me that formula sounded something like  "now you are free " of course it was a delusion  i was not  or  to put it most optimistically  was not yet  free
my writing was all about you  all i did there  after all  was to bemoan what i could not bemoan upon your breast
it was an intentionally long and drawn out leave taking from you  yet  although it was enforced by you  it did take its course in the direction determined by me
but how little all this amounted to  it is only worth talking about because it happened in my life  otherwise it would not even be noted  and also because in my childhood it ruled my life as a premonition  later as a hope  and still later often as despair  and it dictatedâ€ yet again in your shape  it may be saidâ€ my few small decisions
for instance  the choice of a career
true  here you gave me complete freedom  in your magnanimous and  in this regard  even indulgent manner
although here again you were conforming to the general method of treating sons in the jewish middle class  which was the standard for you  or at least to the values of that class
finally  one of your misunderstandings concerning my person played a part in this too
in fact  out of paternal pride  ignorance of my real life  and conclusions drawn from my feebleness  you have always regarded me as particularly diligent
as a child i was  in your view  always studying  and later always writing
this does not even remotely correspond to the facts
it would be more correct  and much less exaggerated  to say that i studied little and learned nothing  that something did stick in my mind after those many years is  after all  not very remarkable  since i did have a moderately good memory and a not too inferior capacity for learning  but the sum total of knowledge and especially of a solid grounding of knowledge is extremely pitiable in comparison with the expenditure of time and money in the course of an outwardly untroubled  calm life  particularly also in comparison with almost all the people i know
it is pitiable  but to me understandable
ever since i could think  i have had such profound anxieties about asserting my spiritual and intellectual existence that i was indifferent to everything else
jewish schoolboys in our country often tend to be odd  among them one finds the most unlikely things  but something like my cold indifference  scarcely disguised  indestructible  childishly helpless  approaching the ridiculous  and brutishly complacent  the indifference of a self sufficient but coldly imaginative child  i have never found anywhere else  to be sure  it was the sole defense against destruction of the nerves by fear and by a sense of guilt
all that occupied my mind was worry about myself  and this in various ways
there was  for instance  the worry about my health  it began imperceptibly enough  with now and then a little anxiety about digestion  hair falling out  a spinal curvature  and so on  intensifying in innumerable gradations  it finally ended with a real illness
but since there was nothing at all i was certain of  since i needed to be provided at every instant with a new confirmation of my existence  since nothing was in my very own  undoubted  sole possession  determined unequivocally only by meâ€ in sober truth a disinherited sonâ€ naturally i became unsure even to the thing nearest to me  my own body
i shot up  tall and lanky  without knowing what to do with my lankiness  the burden was too heavy  the back became bent  i scarcely dared to move  certainly not to exercise  i remained weakly  i was amazed by everything i could still command as by a miracle  for instance  my good digestion  that sufficed to lose it  and now the way was open to every sort of hypochondria  until finally under the strain of the superhuman effort of wanting to marry (of this i shall speak later)  blood came from the lung  something in which the apartment in the schã¶nbornpalaisâ€ which  however  i needed only because i believed i needed it for my writing  so that even this belongs here under the same headingâ€ may have had a fair share
so all this did not come from excessive work  as you always imagine
there were years in which  in perfectly good health  i lazed away more time on the sofa than you in all your life  including all your illnesses
when i rushed away from you  frightfully busy  it was generally in order to lie down in my room
my total achievement in work done  both at the office (where laziness is  of course  not particularly striking  and besides  mine was kept in bounds by my anxiety) and at home  is minute  if you had any real idea of it  you would be aghast
probably i am constitutionally not lazy at all  but there was nothing for me to do
in the place where i lived i was spurned  condemned  fought to a standstill  and to escape to some other place was an enormous exertion  but that was not work  for it was something impossible  something that was  with small exceptions  unattainable for me
this was the state in which i was given the freedom of choice of a career
but was i still capable of making any use of such freedom  had i still any confidence in my own capacity to achieve a real career  my valuation of myself was much more dependent on you than on anything else  such as some external success
that was strengthening for a moment  nothing more  but on the other side your weight always dragged me down much more strongly
never shall i pass the first grade in grammar school  i thought  but i succeeded  i even got a prize  but i shall certainly not pass the entrance exam for the gymnasium  but i succeeded  but now i shall certainly fail in the first year at the gymnasium  no  i did not fail  and i went on and on succeeding
this did not produce any confidence  however  on the contrary  i was always convincedâ€  and i had positive proof of it in your forbidding expressionâ€ that the more i achieved  the worse the final outcome would inevitably be
often in my mind's eye i saw the terrible assembly of the teachers (the gymnasium is only the most obvious example  but it was the same all around me)  as they would meet  when i had passed the first class  and then in the second class  when i had passed that  and then in the third  and so on  meeting in order to examine this unique  outrageous case  to discover how i  the most incapable  or at least the most ignorant of all  had succeeded in creeping up so far as this class  which now  when everybody's attention had at last been focused on me  would of course instantly spew me out  to the jubilation of all the righteous liberated from this nightmare
to live with such fantasies is not easy for a child
in these circumstances  what could i care about my lessons  who was able to strike a spark of real interest in me  lessons  and not only lessons but everything around me  interested me as much  at that decisive age  as an embezzling bank clerk  still holding his job and trembling at the thought of discovery  is interested in the petty ongoing business of the bank  which he still has to deal with as a clerk that was how small and faraway everything was in comparison to the main thing
so it went on up to the qualifying exams which i really passed partly only through cheating  and then everything came to a standstill  for now i was free if i had been concerned only with myself up to now  despite the discipline of the gymnasium  how much more so now that i was free
so there was actually no such thing for me as freedom to choose my career  for i knew  compared to the main thing everything would be exactly as much a matter of indifference to me as all the subjects taught at school  and so it was a matter of finding a profession that would let me indulge this indifference without injuring my vanity too much
law was the obvious choice
little contrary attempts on the part of vanity  of senseless hope  such as a fortnight's study of chemistry  or six months' german studies  only reinforced that fundamental conviction
so i studied law
this meant that in the few months before the exams  and in a way that told severely on my nerves  i was positively living in an intellectual sense  on sawdust  which had moreover already been chewed for me in thousands of other people's mouths but in a certain sense this was exactly to my taste  as in a certain sense the gymnasium had been earlier  and later my job as a clerk  for it all suited my situation
at any rate  i did show astonishing foresight  even as a small child i had had fairly clear premonitions about my studies and my career
from this side i did not expect rescue  here i had given up long ago
but i showed no foresight at all concerning the significance and possibility of a marriage for me  this up to now greatest terror of my life has come upon me almost completely unexpectedly
the child had developed so slowly  these things were outwardly all too remote  now and then the necessity of thinking of them did arise  but the fact that here a permanent  decisive and indeed the most grimly bitter ordeal loomed was impossible to recognize
in reality  however  the marriage plans turned out to be the most grandiose and hopeful attempts at escape  and  consequently their failure was correspondingly grandiose
i am afraid that because in this sphere everything i try is a failure  i shall also fail to make these attempts to marry comprehensible to you
and yet the success of this whole letter depends on it  for in these attempts there was  on the one hand  concentrated everything i had at my disposal in the way of positive forces  and  on the other hand  there also accumulated  and with downright fury  all the negative forces that i have described as being the result in part of your method of upbringing  that is to say  the weakness  the lack of self confidence  the sense of guilt  and they positively drew a cordon between myself and marriage
the explanation will be hard for me also because i have spent so many days and nights thinking and burrowing through the whole thing over and over again that now even i myself am bewildered by the mere sight of it
the only thing that makes the explanation easier for me is yourâ€ in my opinionâ€ complete misunderstanding of the matter  to correct slightly so complete a misunderstanding does not seem excessively difficult
first of all you rank the failure of the marriages with the rest of my failures  i should have nothing against this provided you accepted my previous explanation of my failure as a whole
it does  in fact  form part of the same series  only you underrate the importance of the matter  underrating it to such an extent that whenever we talk of it we are actually talking about quite different things
i venture to say that nothing has happened to you in your whole life that had such importance for you as the attempts at marriage have had for me
by this i do not mean that you have not experienced anything in itself as important  on the contrary  your life was much richer and more care laden and more concentrated than mine  but for that very reason nothing of this sort has happened to you
it is as if one person had to climb five low steps and another person only one step  but one that is  at least for him  as high as all the other five put together  the first person will not only manage the five  but hundreds and thousands more as well  he will have led a great and very strenuous life  but none of the steps he has climbed will have been of such importance to him as for the second person that one  firstly high step  that step which it is impossible for him to climb even by exerting all his strength  that step which he cannot get up on and which he naturally cannot get past either
marrying  founding a family  accepting all the children that come  supporting them in this insecure world and perhaps even guiding them a little  is  i am convinced  the utmost a human being can succeed in doing at all
that so many seem to succeed in this is no evidence to the contrary  first of all  there are not many who do succeed  and second  these not many usually don't "do" it  it merely "happens" to them  although this is not that utmost  it is still very great and very honorable (particularly since "doing" and "happening" cannot be kept clearly distinct)
and finally  it is not a matter of this utmost at all  anyway  but only of some distant but decent approximation  it is  after all  not necessary to fly right into the middle of the sun  but it is necessary to crawl to a clean little spot on earth where the sun sometimes shines and one can warm oneself a little
how was i prepared for this  as badly as possible
this is apparent from what has been said up to now
in so far as any direct preparation of the individual and any direct creation of the general basic conditions exist  you did not intervene much outwardly
and it could not be otherwise  what is decisive here are the general sexual customs of class  nation  and time yet you did intervene here tooâ€ not much  for such intervention must presuppose great mutual trust  and both of us had been lacking in this even long before the decisive time cameâ€ and not very happily  because our needs were quite different  what grips me need hardly touch you at all  and vice versa  what is innocence in you may be guilt in me  and vice versa  what has no consequences for you may be the last nail in my coffin
i remember going for a walk one evening with you and mother  it was on josephsplatz near where the lander bank is today  and i began talking about these interesting things  in a stupidly boastful  superior  proud  detached (that was spurious)  cold (that was genuine)  and stammering manner  as indeed i usually talked to you  reproaching the twoof you with having left me uninstructed  with the fact that my schoolmates first had to take me in hand  that i had been close to great dangers (here i was brazenly lying  as was my way  in order to show myself brave  for as a consequence of my timidity i had  except for the usual sexual misdemeanors of city children  no very exact notion of these "great dangers")  but finally i hinted that now  fortunately  i knew everything  no longer needed any advice  and that everything was all right
i had begun talking about all this mainly because it gave me pleasure at least to talk about it  and also out of curiosity  and finally to avenge myself somehow on the twoof you for something or other
in keeping with your nature you took it quite simply  only saying something to the effect that you could give me advice about how i could go in for these things without danger
perhaps i did want to lure just such an answer out of you  it was in keeping with the prurience of a child overfed with meat and all good things  physically inactive  everlastingly occupied with himself  but still  my outward sense of shame was so hurt by thisâ€ or i believed it ought to be so hurtâ€ that against my will i could not go on talking to you about it and  with arrogant impudence  cut the conversation short it is not easy to judge the answer you gave me then  on the one hand  it had something staggeringly frank  sort of primeval  about it  on the other hand  as far as the lesson itself is concerned  it was uninhibited in a very modern way
i don't know how old i was at the time  certainly not much over sixteen
it was  nevertheless  a very remarkable answer for such a boy  and the distance between the twoof us is also shown in the fact that it was actually the first direct instruction bearing on real life i ever received from you
its real meaning  however  which sank into my mind even then  but which came partly to the surface of my consciousness only much later  was this  what you advised me to do was in your opinion and even more in my opinion at that time  the filthiest thing possible
that you wanted to see to it that i should not bring any of the physical filth home with me was unimportant  for you were only protecting yourself  your house
the important thing was rather that you yourself remained outside your own advice  a married man  a pure man  above such things  this was probably intensified for me at the time by the fact that even marriage seemed to me shameless  and hence it was impossible for me to apply to my parents the general information i had picked up about marriage
thus you became still purer  rose still higher
the thought that you might have given yourself similar advice before your marriage was to me utterly unthinkable
so there was hardly any smudge of earthly filth on you at all
and it was you who pushed me down into this filthâ€ just as though i were predestined to it with a few frank words
and so  if the world consisted only of me and you (a notion i was much inclined to have)  then this purity of the world came to an end with you and  by virtue of your advice  thc filth began with me
in itself it was  of course  incomprehensible that you should thus condemn me  only old guilt  and profoundest contempt on your side  could explain it to me
and so again i was seized in my innermost beingâ€ and very hard indeed
here perhaps both our guiltlessness becomes most evident
a gives b a piece of advice that is frank  in keeping with his attitude to life  not very lovely but still  even today perfectly usual in the city  a piece of advice that might prevent damage to health
this piece of advice is for b morally not very invigoratingâ€ but why should he not be able to work his way out of it  and repair the damage in the course of the years  besides  he does not even have to take the advice  and there is no reason why the advice itself should cause b's whole future world to come tumbling down
and yet something of this kind does happen  but only for the very reason that a is you and b is myself
this guiltlessness on both sides i can judge especially well because a similar clash between us occurred some twenty years later  in quite different circumstancesâ€  horrible in itself but much less damagingâ€ for what was there in me  the thirty six year old  that could still be damaged  i am referring to a brief discussion on one of those few tumultuous days that followed the announcement of my latest marriage plans you said to me something like this  "she probably put on a fancy blouse  something these prague jewesses are good at  and right away  of course  you decided to marry her
and that as fast as possible  in a week  tomorrow  today
i canâ€™t understand you  after all  you're a grown man  you live in the city  and you don't know what to do but marry the first girl who comes along
isn't there anything else you can do  if you're frightened  i'll go with you " you put it in more detail and more plainly  but i can no longer recall the details  perhaps too things became a little vague before my eyes  i paid almost more attention to mother who  though in complete agreement with you  took something from the table and left the room with it
you have hardly ever humiliated me more deeply with words and shown me your contempt more clearly
when you spoke to me in a similar way twenty years earlier  one might  looking at it through your eyes  have seen in it some respect for the precocious city boy  who in your opinion could already be initiated into life without more ado
today this consideration could only intensify the contempt  for the boy who was about to make his first start got stuck halfway and today does not seem richer by any experience  only more pitiable by twenty years
my choice of a girl meant nothing at all to you
you had (unconsciously) always suppressed my power of decision and now believed (unconsciously) that you knew what it was worth
of my attempts at escape in other directions you knew nothing  thus you could not know anything either of the thought processes that had led me to this attempt to marry  and had to try to guess at them  and in keeping with your general opinion of me  you interpreted them in the most abominable  crude  and ridiculous light
and you did not for a moment hesitate to tell me this in just such a manner
the shame you inflicted on me with this was nothing to you in comparison to the shame that i would  in your opinion  inflict on your name by this marriage
now  regarding my attempts at marriage there is much you can say in reply  and you have indeed done so  you could not have much respect for my decision since i had twice broken the engagement with f
and had twice renewed it  since i had needlessly dragged you and mother to berlin to celebrate the engagement  and the like
all this is trueâ€ but how did it come about  the fundamental thought behind both attempts at marriage was quite sound  to set up house  to become independent
an idea that does appeal to you  only in reality it always turns out like the children's game in which one holds and even grips the other's hand  calling out  "oh  go away  go away  why don't you go away " which in our case happens to be complicated by the fact that you have always honestly meant this "go away " and have always unknowingly held me  or rather held me down  only by the strength of your personality
although both girls were chosen by chance  they were extraordinarily well chosen
again a sign of your complete misunderstanding  that you can believe that iâ€ timid  hesitant  suspiciousâ€ can decide to marry in a flash  out of delight over a blouse
both marriages would rather have been commonsense marriages  in so far as that means that day and nightâ€ the first time for years  the second time for monthsâ€ all my power of thought was concentrated on the plan
neither of the girls disappointed me  only i disappointed both of them
my opinion of them is today exactly the same as when i wanted to marry them
it is not true either that in my second marriage attempt i disregarded the experience gained from the first attempt  that i was rash and careless
the cases were quite different  precisely the earlier experience held out a hope for the second case  which was altogether much more promising
i do not want to go into details here
why then did i not marry  there were certainly obstacles  as there always are  but then  life consists in confronting such obstacles
the essential obstacle  however  which is  unfortunately  independent of the individual case  is that obviously i am mentally incapable of marrying
this manifests itself in the fact that from the moment i make up my mind to marry i can no longer sleep  my head burns day and night  life can no longer be called life  i stagger about in despair
it is not actually worries that bring this about  true  in keeping with my sluggishness and pedantry countless worries are involved in all this  but they are not decisive  they do  like worms  complete the work on the corpse  but the decisive blow has come from elsewhere it is the general pressure of anxiety  of weakness  of self contempt
i will try to explain it in more detail
here  in the attempt to marry  twoseemingly antagonistic elements in my relations with you unite more intensely than anywhere else
marriage certainly is the pledge of the most acute form of self liberation and independence
i would have a family  in my opinion the highest one can achieve  and so too the highest you have achieved  i would be your equal  all old and even new shame and tyranny would be mere history
it would be like a fairy tale  but precisely there lies the questionable element
it is too much  so much cannot be achieved
it is as if a person were a prisoner  and he had not only the intention to escape  which would perhaps be attainable  but also  and indeed simultaneously  the intention to rebuild the prison as a pleasure dome for himself but if he escapes  he cannot rebuild  and if he rebuilds  he cannot escape
if i  in the particular unhappy relationship in which i stand to you  want to become independent  i must do something that will have  if possible  no connection with you at all  though marrying is the greatest thing of all and provides the most honorable independence  it also stands at the same time in the closest relation to you
to try to get out of this quandary has therefore a touch of madness about it  and every attempt is punished by being driven almost mad
it is precisely this close relation that partly lures me toward marrying
i picture the equality which would then arise between usâ€ and which you would be able to understand better than any other form of equalityâ€ as so beautiful because then i could be a free  grateful  guiltless  upright son  and you could be an untroubled untyrannical  sympathetic  contented father
but to this end everything that ever happened would have to be undone  that is  we ourselves should have to be canceled out
but we being what we are  marrying is barred to me because it is your very own domain
sometimes i imagine the map of the world spread out and you stretched diagonally across it and i feel as if i could consider living in only those regions that either are not covered by you or are not within your reach
and  in keeping with the conception i have of your magnitude  these are not many and not very comforting regionsâ€ and marriage is not among them
this very comparison proves that i certainly do not mean to say that you drove me away from marriage by your example  as you had driven me away from your business
quite the contrary  despite the remote similarity
in your marriage i had before me what was  in many ways  a model marriage  a model in constancy  mutual help  number of children  and even when the children grew up and increasingly disturbed the peace  the marriage as such remained undisturbed
perhaps i formed my high idea of marriage on this model  the desire for marriage was powerless for other reasons
those lay in your relation to your children  which is  after all  what this whole letter is about
there is a view according to which fear of marriage sometimes has its source in a fear that one's children would some day pay one back for the sins one has committed against one's own parents
this  i believe  has no very great significance in my case  for my sense of guilt actually originates in you  and is filled with such conviction of its uniquenessâ€ indeed  this feeling of uniqueness is an essential part of its tormenting natureâ€ that any repetition is unthinkable
all the same  i must say that i would find such a mute  glum  dry  doomed son unbearable  i daresay that  if there were no other possibility  i would flee from him  emigrate  as you had planned to do if i had married
and this may also have had some influence on my incapacity to marry
what is much more important in all this  however  is the anxiety about myself
this has to be understood as follows  i have already indicated that in my writing  and in everything connected with it  i have made some attempts at independence  attempts at escape  with the very smallest of success  they will scarcely lead any farther  much confirms this for me nevertheless it is my duty or  rather  the essence of my life  to watch over them  to let no danger that i can avert  indeed no possibility of such a danger  approach them
marriage bears the possibility of such a danger  though also the possibility of the greatest help  for me  however  it is enough that there is the possibility of a danger
what should i do if it did turn out to be a danger  how could i continue living in matrimony with the perhaps unprovable  but nevertheless irrefutable feeling that this danger existed  faced with this i may waver  but the final outcome is certain  i must renounce
the simile of the bird in the hand and the twoin the bush has only a fiery remote application here
in my hand i have nothing  in the bush is everything  and yetâ€ so it is decided by the conditions of battle and the exigency of lifeâ€ i must choose the nothing
i had to make a similar choice when i chose my profession
the most important obstacle to marriage  however  is the no longer eradicable conviction that what is essential to the support of a family and especially to its guidance  is what i have recognized in you  and indeed everything rolled into one  good and bad  as it is organically combined in youâ€ strength  and scorn of others  health  and a certain immoderation  eloquence and inadequacy  self confidence and dissatisfaction with everyone else  a worldly wisdom and tyranny  knowledge of human nature and mistrust of most people  then also good qualities without any drawback  such as industry  endurance  presence of mind  and fearlessness
by comparison i had almost nothing or very little of all this  and was it on this basis that i wanted to risk marrying  when i could see for myself that even you had to fight hard in marriage and  where the children were concerned  had even failed  of course  i did not put this question to myself in so many words and i did not answer it in so many words  otherwise everyday thinking would have taken over and shown me other men who are different from you (to name one  near at hand  who is very different from you  uncle richard) and yet have married and have at least not collapsed under the strain  which is in itself a great deal and would have been quite enough for me
but i did not ask this question  i lived it from childhood on
i tested myself not only when faced with marriage  but in the face of every trifle  in the face of every trifle you by your example and your method of upbringing convinced me  as i have tried to describe  of my incapacity  and what turned out to be true of every trifle and proved you right  had to be fearfully true of the greatest thing of all  of marriage
up to the time of my marriage attempts i grew up more or less like a businessman who lives from day to day  with worries and forebodings  but without keeping proper accounts
he makes a few small profitsâ€ which he constantly pampers and exaggerates in his imagination because of their rarityâ€ but otherwise he has daily losses
everything is entered  but never balanced
now comes the necessity of drawing a balance  that is  the attempt at marriage
and with the large sums that have to be taken into account here it is as though there had never been even the smallest profit  everything one single great liability and now marry without going mad  that is what my life with you has been like up to now  and these are the prospects inherent in it for the future
if you look at the reasons i offer for the fear i have of you  you might answer  "you maintain i make things easy for myself by explaining my relation to you simply as being your fault  but i believe that despite your outward effort  you do not make things more difficult for yourself  but much more profitable
at first you too repudiate all guilt and responsibility  in this our methods are the same
but whereas i then attribute the sole guilt to you as frankly as i mean it  you want to be 'overly clever' and 'overly affectionate' at the same time and acquit me also of all guilt
of course  in the latter you only seem to succeed (and more you do not even want)  and what appears between the lines  in spite of all the 'turns of phrase' about character and nature and antagonism and helplessness  is that actually i have been the aggressor  while everything you were up to was self defense
by now you would have achieved enough by your very insincerity  for you have proved three things  first  that you are not guilty  second  that i am the guilty one  and third  that out of sheer magnanimity you are ready not only to forgive me but (what is both more and less) also to prove and be willing to believe yourself thatâ€ contrary to the truthâ€ i also am not guilty
that ought to be enough for you now  but it is still not enough
you have put it into your head to live entirely off me
i admit that we fight with each other  but there are two kinds of combat
the chivalrous combat  in which independent opponents pit their strength against each other  each on his own  each losing on his own  each winning on his own
and there is the combat of vermin  which not only sting but  on top of it  suck your blood in order to sustain their own life
that's what the real professional soldier is  and that's what you are
you are unfit for life  to make life comfortable for yourself  without worries and without self reproaches  you prove that i have taken your fitness for life away from you and put it in my own pocket
why should it bother you that you are unfit for life  since i have the responsibility for it  while you calmly stretch out and let yourself be hauled through life  physically and mentally  by me for example  when you recently wanted to marry  you wantedâ€ and this you do  after all  admit in this letterâ€ at the same time not to marry  but in order not to have to exert yourself you wanted me to help you with this not marrying  by forbidding this marriage because of the 'disgrace' this union would bring upon my name
i did not dream of it
first  in this as in everything else i never wanted to be 'an obstacle to your happiness ' and second  i never want to have to hear such a reproach from my child
but did the self restraint with which i left the marriage up to you do me any good  not in the least
my aversion to your marriage would not have prevented it  on the contrary  it would have been an added incentive for you to marry the girl  for it would have made the 'attempt at escape ' as you put it  complete
and my consent to your marriage did not prevent your reproaches  for you prove that i am in any case to blame for your not marrying
basically  however  in this as in everything else you have only proved to me that all my reproaches were justified  and that one especially justified charge was still missing  namely  the charge of insincerity  obsequiousness and parasitism
if i am not very much mistaken  you are preying on me even with this letter itself " my answer to this is that  after all  this whole rejoinderâ€  which can partly also be turned against youâ€ does not come from you  but from me
not even your mistrust of others is as great as my self mistrust  which you have bred in me
i do not deny a certain justification for this rejoinder  which in itself contributes new material to the characterization of our relationship
naturally things cannot in reality fit together the way the evidence does in my letter  life is more than a chinese puzzle
but with the correction made by this rejoinderâ€ a correction i neither can nor will elaborate in detailâ€ in my opinion something has been achieved which so closely approximates the truth that it might reassure us both a little and make our living and our dying easier
