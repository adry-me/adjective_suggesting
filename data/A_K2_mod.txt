when alexey alexandrovitch reached the race course  anna was already sitting in the pavilion beside betsy  in that pavilion where all the highest society had gathered
she caught sight of her husband in the distance
two men  her husband and her lover  were the two centers of her existence  and unaided by her external senses she was aware of their nearness
she was aware of her husband approaching a long way off  and she could not help following him in the surging crowd in the midst of which he was moving
she watched his progress towards the pavilion  saw him now responding condescendingly to an ingratiating bow  now exchanging friendly  nonchalant greetings with his equals  now assiduously trying to catch the eye of some great one of this world  and taking off his big round hat that squeezed the tips of his ears
all these ways of his she knew  and all were hateful to her
 nothing but ambition  nothing but the desire to get on  that s all there is in his soul   she thought   as for these lofty ideals  love of culture  religion  they are only so many tools for getting on   anna karenina 454 of 1759 from his glances towards the ladies  pavilion (he was staring straight at her  but did not distinguish his wife in the sea of muslin  ribbons  feathers  parasols and flowers) she saw that he was looking for her  but she purposely avoided noticing him
 alexey alexandrovitch   princess betsy called to him   i m sure you don t see your wife  here she is   he smiled his chilly smile
 there s so much splendor here that one s eyes are dazzled   he said  and he went into the pavilion
he smiled to his wife as a man should smile on meeting his wife after only just parting from her  and greeted the princess and other acquaintances  giving to each what was due that is to say  jesting with the ladies and dealing out friendly greetings among the men
below  near the pavilion  was standing an adjutant general of whom alexey alexandrovitch had a high opinion  noted for his intelligence and culture
alexey alexandrovitch entered into conversation with him
there was an interval between the races  and so nothing hindered conversation
the adjutant general expressed his disapproval of races
alexey alexandrovitch replied defending them
anna heard his high  measured anna karenina 455 of 1759 tones  not losing one word  and every word struck her as false  and stabbed her ears with pain
when the three mile steeplechase was beginning  she bent forward and gazed with fixed eyes at vronsky as he went up to his horse and mounted  and at the same time she heard that loathsome  never ceasing voice of her husband
she was in an agony of terror for vronsky  but a still greater agony was the never ceasing  as it seemed to her  stream of her husband s shrill voice with its familiar intonations
 i m a wicked woman  a lost woman   she thought   but i don t like lying  i can t endure falsehood  while as for him (her husband) it s the breath of his life falsehood
he knows all about it  he sees it all  what does he care if he can talk so calmly  if he were to kill me  if he were to kill vronsky  i might respect him
no  all he wants is falsehood and propriety   anna said to herself  not considering exactly what it was she wanted of her husband  and how she would have liked to see him behave
she did not understand either that alexey alexandrovitch s peculiar loquacity that day  so exasperating to her  was merely the expression of his inward distress and uneasiness
as a child that has been hurt skips about  putting all his muscles into movement to anna karenina 456 of 1759 drown the pain  in the same way alexey alexandrovitch needed mental exercise to drown the thoughts of his wife that in her presence and in vronsky s  and with the continual iteration of his name  would force themselves on his attention and it was as natural for him to talk well and cleverly  as it is natural for a child to skip about
he was saying   danger in the races of officers  of cavalry men  is an essential element in the race
if england can point to the most brilliant feats of cavalry in military history  it is simply owing to the fact that she has historically developed this force both in beasts and in men
sport has  in my opinion  a great value  and as is always the case  we see nothing but what is most superficial    it s not superficial   said princess tverskaya
 one of the officers  they say  has broken two ribs   alexey alexandrovitch smiled his smile  which uncovered his teeth  but revealed nothing more
 we ll admit  princess  that that s not superficial   he said   but internal
but that s not the point   and he turned again to the general with whom he was talking seriously   we mustn t forget that those who are taking part in the race are military men  who have chosen that career  and one must allow that every calling has its disagreeable side
anna karenina 457 of 1759 it forms an integral part of the duties of an officer low sports  such as prizefighting or spanish bull fights  are a sign of barbarity
but specialized trials of skill are a sign of development    no  i shan t come another time  it s too upsetting   said princess betsy
 isn t it  anna    it is upsetting  but one can t tear oneself away   said another lady
 if i d been a roman woman i should never have missed a single circus   anna said nothing  and keeping her opera glass up  gazed always at the same spot
at that moment a tall general walked through the pavilion
breaking off what he was saying  alexey alexandrovitch got up hurriedly  though with dignity  and bowed low to the general
 you re not racing   the officer asked  chaffing him
 my race is a harder one   alexey alexandrovitch responded deferentially
and though the answer meant nothing  the general looked as though he had heard a witty remark from a witty man  and fully relished la pointe de la sauce
 there are two aspects   alexey alexandrovitch resumed   those who take part and those who look on  anna karenina 458 of 1759 and love for such spectacles is an unmistakable proof of a low degree of development in the spectator  i admit  but     princess  bets   sounded stepan arkadyevitch s voice from below
addressing betsy
 who s your favorite    anna and i are for kuzovlev   replied betsy
 i m for vronsky
a pair of gloves    done    but it is a pretty sight  isn t it   alexey alexandrovitch paused while there was talking about him  but he began again directly
 i admit that manly sports do not     he was continuing
but at that moment the racers started  and all conversation ceased
alexey alexandrovitch too was silent  and everyone stood up and turned towards the stream
alexey alexandrovitch took no interest in the race  and so he did not watch the racers  but fell listlessly to scanning the spectators with his weary eyes
his eyes rested upon anna
her face was white and set
she was obviously seeing nothing and no one but one man
her hand had convulsively clutched her fan  and she held her breath
he looked at her and hastily turned away  scrutinizing other faces
anna karenina 459 of 1759  but here s this lady too  and others very much moved as well  it s very natural   alexey alexandrovitch told himself he tried not to look at her  but unconsciously his eyes were drawn to her
he examined that face again  trying not to read what was so plainly written on it  and against his own will  with horror read on it what he did not want to know
the first fall kuzovlev s  at the stream agitated everyone  but alexey alexandrovitch saw distinctly on anna s pale  triumphant face that the man she was watching had not fallen
when  after mahotin and vronsky had cleared the worst barrier  the next officer had been thrown straight on his head at it and fatally injured  and a shudder of horror passed over the whole public  alexey alexandrovitch saw that anna did not even notice it  and had some difficulty in realizing what they were talking of about her
but more and more often  and with greater persistence  he watched her
anna  wholly engrossed as she was with the race  became aware of her husband s cold eyes fixed upon her from one side
she glanced round for an instant  looked inquiringly at him  and with a slight frown turned away again
 ah  i don t care   she seemed to say to him  and she did not once glance at him again
anna karenina 460 of 1759 the race was an unlucky one  and of the seventeen officers who rode in it more than half were thrown and hurt
towards the end of the race everyone was in a state of agitation  which was intensified by the fact that the tsar was displeased
anna karenina 461 of 1759 everyone was loudly expressing disapprobation  everyone was repeating a phrase some one had uttered   the lions and gladiators will be the next thing   and everyone was feeling horrified  so that when vronsky fell to the ground  and anna moaned aloud  there was nothing very out of the way in it
but afterwards a change came over anna s face which really was beyond decorum
she utterly lost her head
she began fluttering like a caged bird  at one moment would have got up and moved away  at the next turned to betsy
 let us go  let us go   she said
but betsy did not hear her
she was bending down  talking to a general who had come up to her
alexey alexandrovitch went up to anna and courteously offered her his arm
 let us go  if you like   he said in french  but anna was listening to the general and did not notice her husband
 he s broken his leg too  so they say   the general was saying
 this is beyond everything   without answering her husband  anna lifted her opera glass and gazed towards the place where vronsky had anna karenina 462 of 1759 fallen  but it was so far off  and there was such a crowd of people about it  that she could make out nothing
she laid down the opera glass  and would have moved away  but at that moment an officer galloped up and made some announcement to the tsar
anna craned forward  listening
 stiva  stiva   she cried to her brother
but her brother did not hear her
again she would have moved away
 once more i offer you my arm if you want to be going   said alexey alexandrovitch  reaching towards her hand
she drew back from him with aversion  and without looking in his face answered   no  no  let me be  i ll stay   she saw now that from the place of vronsky s accident an officer was running across the course towards the pavilion
betsy waved her handkerchief to him
the officer brought the news that the rider was not killed  but the horse had broken its back
on hearing this anna sat down hurriedly  and hid her face in her fan
alexey alexandrovitch saw that she was weeping  and could not control her tears  nor even the sobs that were shaking her bosom
alexey alexandrovitch anna karenina 463 of 1759 stood so as to screen her  giving her time to recover herself
 for the third time i offer you my arm   he said to her after a little time  turning to her
anna gazed at him and did not know what to say
princess betsy came to her rescue
 no  alexey alexandrovitch  i brought anna and i promised to take her home   put in betsy
 excuse me  princess   he said  smiling courteously but looking her very firmly in the face   but i see that anna s not very well  and i wish her to come home with me   anna looked about her in a frightened way  got up submissively  and laid her hand on her husband s arm
 i ll send to him and find out  and let you know   betsy whispered to her
as they left the pavilion  alexey alexandrovitch  as always  talked to those he met  and anna had  as always  to talk and answer  but she was utterly beside herself  and moved hanging on her husband s arm as though in a dream
 is he killed or not  is it true  will he come or not  shall i see him today   she was thinking
she took her seat in her husband s carriage in silence  and in silence drove out of the crowd of carriages
i spite anna karenina 464 of 1759 of all he had seen  alexey alexandrovitch still did not allow himself to consider his wife s real condition he merely saw the outward symptoms he saw that she was behaving unbecomingly  and considered it his duty to tell her so
but it was very difficult for him not to say more  to tell her nothing but that
he opened his mouth to tell her she had behaved unbecomingly  but he could not help saying something utterly different
 what an inclination we all have  though  for these cruel spectacles   he said
 i observe     eh  i don t understand   said anna contemptuously
he was offended  and at once began to say what he had meant to say
 i am obliged to tell you   he began
 so now we are to have it out   she thought  and she felt frightened
 i am obliged to tell you that your behavior has been unbecoming today   he said to her in french
 in what way has my behavior been unbecoming   she said aloud  turning her head swiftly and looking him straight in the face  not with the bright expression that seemed covering something  but with a look of determination  under which she concealed with difficulty the dismay she was feeling
anna karenina 465 of 1759  mind   he said  pointing to the open window opposite the coachman
he got up and pulled up the window
 what did you consider unbecoming   she repeated
 the despair you were unable to conceal at the accident to one of the riders   he waited for her to answer  but she was silent  looking straight before her
 i have already begged you so to conduct yourself in society that even malicious tongues can find nothing to say against you
there was a time when i spoke of your inward attitude  but i am not speaking of that now
now i speak only of your external attitude
you have behaved improperly  and i would wish it not to occur again   she did not hear half of what he was saying  she felt panic stricken before him  and was thinking whether it was true that vronsky was not killed
was it of him they were speaking when they said the rider was unhurt  but the horse had broken its back  she merely smiled with a pretense of irony when he finished  and made no reply  because she had not heard what he said
alexey alexandrovitch had begun to speak boldly  but as he realized plainly what he was speaking of  the dismay she anna karenina 466 of 1759 was feeling infected him too
he saw the smile  and a strange misapprehension came over him
 she is smiling at my suspicions
yes  she will tell me directly what she told me before  that there is no foundation for my suspicions  that it s absurd   at that moment  when the revelation of everything was hanging over him  there was nothing he expected so much as that she would answer mockingly as before that his suspicions were absurd and utterly groundless
so terrible to him was that he knew that now he was ready to believe anything
but the expression of her face  scared and gloomy  did not now promise even deception
 possibly i was mistaken   said he
 if so  i beg your pardon    no  you were not mistaken   she said deliberately  looking desperately into his cold face
 you were not mistaken
i was  and i could not help being in despair
i hear you  but i am thinking of him
i love him  i am his mistress  i can t bear you  i m afraid of you  and i hate you   
you can do what you like to me   and dropping back into the corner of the carriage  she broke into sobs  hiding her face in her hands
alexey alexandrovitch did not stir  and kept looking straight before him
but his whole face suddenly bore the solemn anna karenina 467 of 1759 rigidity of the dead  and his expression did not change during the whole time of the drive home
on reaching the house he turned his head to her  still with the same expression
 very well  but i expect a strict observance of the external forms of propriety till such time  his voice shook  as i may take measures to secure my honor and communicate them to you   he got out first and helped her to get out before the servants he pressed her hand  took his seat in the carriage  and drove back to petersburg
immediately afterwards a footman came from princess betsy and brought anna a note
 i sent to alexey to find out how he is  and he writes me he is quite well and unhurt  but in despair    so he will be here   she thought
 what a good thing i told him all   she glanced at her watch
she had still three hours to wait  and the memories of their last meeting set her blood in flame
 my god  how light it is  it s dreadful  but i do love to see his face  and i do love this fantastic light   
my husband  oh  yes   
well  thank god  everything s over with him   anna karenina 468 of 1759 in the little german watering place to which the shtcherbatskys had betaken themselves  as in all places indeed where people are gathered together  the usual process  as it were  of the crystallization of society went on  assigning to each member of that society a definite and unalterable place just as the particle of water in frost  definitely and unalterably  takes the special form of the crystal of snow  so each new person that arrived at the springs was at once placed in his special place
fuerst shtcherbatsky  sammt gemahlin und tochter  by the apartments they took  and from their name and from the friends they made  were immediately crystallized into a definite place marked out for them
there was visiting the watering place that year a real german fuerstin  in consequence of which the crystallizing process went on more vigorously than ever
princess shtcherbatskaya wished  above everything  to present her daughter to this german princess  and the day after their arrival she duly performed this rite
kitty made a low and graceful curtsey in the very simple  that is to say  very elegant frock that had been ordered her from paris
anna karenina 469 of 1759 the german princess said   i hope the roses will soon come back to this pretty little face   and for the shtcherbatskys certain definite lines of existence were at once laid down from which there was no departing
the shtcherbatskys made the acquaintance too of the family of an english lady somebody  and of a german countess and her son  wounded in the last war  and of a learned swede  and of m
canut and his sister
but yet inevitably the shtcherbatskys were thrown most into the society of a moscow lady  marya yevgenyevna rtishtcheva and her daughter  whom kitty disliked  because she had fallen ill  like herself  over a love affair  and a moscow colonel  whom kitty had known from childhood  and always seen in uniform and epaulets  and who now  with his little eyes and his open neck and flowered cravat  was uncommonly ridiculous and tedious  because there was no getting rid of him
when all this was so firmly established  kitty began to be very much bored  especially as the prince went away to carlsbad and she was left alone with her mother
she took no interest in the people she knew  feeling that nothing fresh would come of them
her chief mental interest in the watering place consisted in watching and making theories about the people she did not know
it was characteristic of kitty that she always imagined anna karenina 470 of 1759 everything in people in the most favorable light possible  especially so in those she did not know
and now as she made surmises as to who people were  what were their relations to one another  and what they were like  kitty endowed them with the most marvelous and noble characters  and found confirmation of her idea in her observations
of these people the one that attracted her most was a russian girl who had come to the watering place with an invalid russian lady  madame stahl  as everyone called her
madame stahl belonged to the highest society  but she was so ill that she could not walk  and only on exceptionally fine days made her appearance at the springs in an invalid carriage
but it was not so much from illhealth as from pride so princess shtcherbatskaya interpreted it that madame stahl had not made the acquaintance of anyone among the russians there
the russian girl looked after madame stahl  and besides that  she was  as kitty observed  on friendly terms with all the invalids who were seriously ill  and there were many of them at the springs  and looked after them in the most natural way this russian girl was not  as kitty gathered  related to madame stahl  nor was she a paid attendant
madame stahl called her varenka  and other people called anna karenina 471 of 1759 her  mademoiselle varenka   apart from the interest kitty took in this girl s relations with madame stahl and with other unknown persons  kitty  as often happened  felt an inexplicable attraction to mademoiselle varenka  and was aware when their eyes met that she too liked her
of mademoiselle varenka one would not say that she had passed her first youth  but she was  as it were  a creature without youth  she might have been taken for nineteen or for thirty
if her features were criticized separately  she was handsome rather than plain  in spite of the sickly hue of her face
she would have been a good figure  too  if it had not been for her extreme thinness and the size of her head  which was too large for her medium height
but she was not likely to be attractive to men
she was like a fine flower  already past its bloom and without fragrance  though the petals were still unwithered
moreover  she would have been unattractive to men also from the lack of just what kitty had too much of of the suppressed fire of vitality  and the consciousness of her own attractiveness
she always seemed absorbed in work about which there could be no doubt  and so it seemed she could not take interest in anything outside it
it was just this contrast with her own position that was for kitty the great anna karenina 472 of 1759 attraction of mademoiselle varenka
kitty felt that in her  in her manner of life  she would find an example of what she was now so painfully seeking  interest in life  a dignity in life apart from the worldly relations of girls with men  which so revolted kitty  and appeared to her now as a shameful hawking about of goods in search of a purchaser
the more attentively kitty watched her unknown friend  the more convinced she was this girl was the perfect creature she fancied her  and the more eagerly she wished to make her acquaintance
the two girls used to meet several times a day  and every time they met  kitty s eyes said   who are you  what are you  are you really the exquisite creature i imagine you to be  but for goodness  sake don t suppose   her eyes added   that i would force my acquaintance on you  i simply admire you and like you    i like you too  and you re very  very sweet
and i should like you better still  if i had time   answered the eyes of the unknown girl
kitty saw indeed  that she was always busy
either she was taking the children of a russian family home from the springs  or fetching a shawl for a sick lady  and wrapping her up in it  or trying to interest an irritable invalid  or selecting and buying cakes for tea for someone anna karenina 473 of 1759 soon after the arrival of the shtcherbatskys there appeared in the morning crowd at the springs two persons who attracted universal and unfavorable attention
these were a tall man with a stooping figure  and huge hands  in an old coat too short for him  with black  simple  and yet terrible eyes  and a pockmarked  kind looking woman  very badly and tastelessly dressed
recognizing these persons as russians  kitty had already in her imagination begun constructing a delightful and touching romance about them
but the princess  having ascertained from the visitors  list that this was nikolay levin and marya nikolaevna  explained to kitty what a bad man this levin was  and all her fancies about these two people vanished
not so much from what her mother told her  as from the fact that it was konstantin s brother  this pair suddenly seemed to kitty intensely unpleasant
this levin  with his continual twitching of his head  aroused in her now an irrepressible feeling of disgust
it seemed to her that his big  terrible eyes  which persistently pursued her  expressed a feeling of hatred and contempt  and she tried to avoid meeting him
anna karenina 474 of 1759 it was a wet day  it had been raining all the morning  and the invalids  with their parasols  had flocked into the arcades
kitty was walking there with her mother and the moscow colonel  smart and jaunty in his european coat  bought ready made at frankfort
they were walking on one side of the arcade  trying to avoid levin  who was walking on the other side
varenka  in her dark dress  in a black hat with a turndown brim  was walking up and down the whole length of the arcade with a blind frenchwoman  and  every time she met kitty  they exchanged friendly glances
 mamma  couldn t i speak to her   said kitty  watching her unknown friend  and noticing that she was going up to the spring  and that they might come there together
 oh  if you want to so much  i ll find out about her first and make her acquaintance myself   answered her mother
 what do you see in her out of the way  a companion  she must be
if you like  i ll make acquaintance with madame stahl  i used to know her belle seur   added the princess  lifting her head haughtily
anna karenina 475 of 1759 kitty knew that the princess was offended that madame stahl had seemed to avoid making her acquaintance
kitty did not insist
 how wonderfully sweet she is   she said  gazing at varenka just as she handed a glass to the frenchwoman
 look how natural and sweet it all is    it s so funny to see your engouements   said the princess
 no  we d better go back   she added  noticing levin coming towards them with his companion and a german doctor  to whom he was talking very noisily and angrily
they turned to go back  when suddenly they heard  not noisy talk  but shouting
levin  stopping short  was shouting at the doctor  and the doctor  too  was excited
a crowd gathered about them
the princess and kitty beat a hasty retreat  while the colonel joined the crowd to find out what was the matter
a few minutes later the colonel overtook them
 what was it   inquired the princess
 scandalous and disgraceful   answered the colonel
 the one thing to be dreaded is meeting russians abroad
that tall gentleman was abusing the doctor  flinging all sorts of insults at him because he wasn t treating him quite anna karenina 476 of 1759 as he liked  and he began waving his stick at him
it s simply a scandal    oh  how unpleasant   said the princess
 well  and how did it end    luckily at that point that   the one in the mushroom hat  
intervened
a russian lady  i think she is   said the colonel
 mademoiselle varenka   asked kitty
 yes  yes
she came to the rescue before anyone  she took the man by the arm and led him away    there  mamma   said kitty   you wonder that i m enthusiastic about her   the next day  as she watched her unknown friend  kitty noticed that mademoiselle varenka was already on the same terms with levin and his companion as with her other proteges she went up to them  entered into conversation with them  and served as interpreter for the woman  who could not speak any foreign language
kitty began to entreat her mother still more urgently to let her make friends with varenka
and  disagreeable as it was to the princess to seem to take the first step in wishing to make the acquaintance of madame stahl who thought fit to give herself airs  she made inquiries about varenka  and  having ascertained particulars about her tending to anna karenina 477 of 1759 prove that there could be no harm though little good in the acquaintance  she herself approached varenka and made acquaintance with her
choosing a time when her daughter had gone to the spring  while varenka had stopped outside the baker s  the princess went up to her
 allow me to make your acquaintance   she said  with her dignified smile
 my daughter has lost her heart to you   she said
 possibly you do not know me
i am     that feeling is more than reciprocal  princess   varenka answered hurriedly
 what a good deed you did yesterday to our poor compatriot   said the princess
varenka flushed a little
 i don t remember
i don t think i did anything   she said
 why  you saved that levin from disagreeable consequences    yes  sa compagne called me  and i tried to pacify him  he s very ill and was dissatisfied with the doctor
i m used to looking after such invalids    yes  i ve heard you live at mentone with your aunt i think  madame stahl  i used to know her belle soeur   anna karenina 478 of 1759  no  she s not my aunt
i call her mamma  but i am not related to her  i was brought up by her   answered varenka  flushing a little again
this was so simply said  and so sweet was the truthful and candid expression of her face  that the princess saw why kitty had taken such a fancy to varenka
 well  and what s this levin going to do   asked the princess
 he s going away   answered varenka
at that instant kitty came up from the spring beaming with delight that her mother had become acquainted with her unknown friend
 well  see  kitty  your intense desire to make friends with mademoiselle

    varenka   varenka put in smiling   that s what everyone calls me   kitty blushed with pleasure  and slowly  without speaking  pressed her new friend s hand  which did not respond to her pressure  but lay motionless in her hand
the hand did not respond to her pressure  but the face of mademoiselle varenka glowed with a soft  glad  though rather mournful smile  that showed large but handsome teeth
 i have long wished for this too   she said
anna karenina 479 of 1759  but you are so busy    oh  no  i m not at all busy   answered varenka  but at that moment she had to leave her new friends because two little russian girls  children of an invalid  ran up to her
 varenka  mamma s calling   they cried
and varenka went after them
anna karenina 480 of 1759 the particulars which the princess had learned in regard to varenka s past and her relations with madame stahl were as follows  madame stahl  of whom some people said that she had worried her husband out of his life  while others said it was he who had made her wretched by his immoral behavior  had always been a woman of weak health and enthusiastic temperament when  after her separation from her husband  she gave birth to her only child  the child had died almost immediately  and the family of madame stahl  knowing her sensibility  and fearing the news would kill her  had substituted another child  a baby born the same night and in the same house in petersburg  the daughter of the chief cook of the imperial household
this was varenka
madame stahl learned later on that varenka was not her own child  but she went on bringing her up  especially as very soon afterwards varenka had not a relation of her own living
madame stahl had now been living more than ten years continuously abroad  in the south  never leaving her couch
and some people said that madame stahl had made her social position as a anna karenina 481 of 1759 philanthropic  highly religious woman  other people said she really was at heart the highly ethical being  living for nothing but the good of her fellow creatures  which she represented herself to be
no one knew what her faith was catholic  protestant  or orthodox
but one fact was indubitable she was in amicable relations with the highest dignitaries of all the churches and sects
varenka lived with her all the while abroad  and everyone who knew madame stahl knew and liked mademoiselle varenka  as everyone called her
having learned all these facts  the princess found nothing to object to in her daughter s intimacy with varenka  more especially as varenka s breeding and education were of the best she spoke french and english extremely well and what was of the most weight  brought a message from madame stahl expressing her regret that she was prevented by her ill health from making the acquaintance of the princess
after getting to know varenka  kitty became more and more fascinated by her friend  and every day she discovered new virtues in her
the princess  hearing that varenka had a good voice  asked her to come and sing to them in the evening
anna karenina 482 of 1759  kitty plays  and we have a piano  not a good one  it s true  but you will give us so much pleasure   said the princess with her affected smile  which kitty disliked particularly just then  because she noticed that varenka had no inclination to sing
varenka came  however  in the evening and brought a roll of music with her
the princess had invited marya yevgenyevna and her daughter and the colonel
varenka seemed quite unaffected by there being persons present she did not know  and she went directly to the piano
she could not accompany herself  but she could sing music at sight very well
kitty  who played well  accompanied her
 you have an extraordinary talent   the princess said to her after varenka had sung the first song extremely well
marya yevgenyevna and her daughter expressed their thanks and admiration
 look   said the colonel  looking out of the window   what an audience has collected to listen to you   there actually was quite a considerable crowd under the windows
 i am very glad it gives you pleasure   varenka answered simply
anna karenina 483 of 1759 kitty looked with pride at her friend
she was enchanted by her talent  and her voice and her face  but most of all by her manner  by the way varenka obviously thought nothing of her singing and was quite unmoved by their praises
she seemed only to be asking   am i to sing again  or is that enough    if it had been i   thought kitty   how proud i should have been  how delighted i should have been to see that crowd under the windows  but she s utterly unmoved by it
her only motive is to avoid refusing and to please mamma
what is there in her  what is it gives her the power to look down on everything  to be calm independently of everything  how i should like to know it and to learn it of her   thought kitty  gazing into her serene face
the princess asked varenka to sing again  and varenka sang another song  also smoothly  distinctly  and well  standing erect at the piano and beating time on it with her thin  dark skinned hand
the next song in the book was an italian one
kitty played the opening bars  and looked round at varenka
 let s skip that   said varenka  flushing a little
kitty let her eyes rest on varenka s face  with a look of dismay and inquiry
anna karenina 484 of 1759  very well  the next one   she said hurriedly  turning over the pages  and at once feeling that there was something connected with the song
 no   answered varenka with a smile  laying her hand on the music   no  let s have that one   and she sang it just as quietly  as coolly  and as well as the others
when she had finished  they all thanked her again  and went off to tea
kitty and varenka went out into the little garden that adjoined the house
 am i right  that you have some reminiscences connected with that song   said kitty
 don t tell me   she added hastily   only say if i m right    no  why not  i ll tell you simply   said varenka  and  without waiting for a reply  she went on   yes  it brings up memories  once painful ones
i cared for someone once  and i used to sing him that song   kitty with big  wide open eyes gazed silently  sympathetically at varenka
 i cared for him  and he cared for me  but his mother did not wish it  and he married another girl
he s living now not far from us  and i see him sometimes
you didn t think i had a love story too   she said  and there was a faint gleam in her handsome face of that fire which kitty felt must once have glowed all over her
anna karenina 485 of 1759  i didn t think so  why  if i were a man  i could never care for anyone else after knowing you
only i can t understand how he could  to please his mother  forget you and make you unhappy  he had no heart    oh  no  he s a very good man  and i m not unhappy  quite the contrary  i m very happy
well  so we shan t be singing any more now   she added  turning towards the house
 how good you are  how good you are   cried kitty  and stopping her  she kissed her
 if i could only be even a little like you    why should you be like anyone  you re nice as you are   said varenka  smiling her gentle  weary smile
 no  i m not nice at all
come  tell me   
stop a minute  let s sit down   said kitty  making her sit down again beside her
 tell me  isn t it humiliating to think that a man has disdained your love  that he hasn t cared for it      but he didn t disdain it  i believe he cared for me  but he was a dutiful son     yes  but if it hadn t been on account of his mother  if it had been his own doing      said kitty  feeling she was giving away her secret  and that her face  burning with the flush of shame  had betrayed her already
anna karenina 486 of 1759  i that case he would have done wrong  and i should not have regretted him   answered varenka  evidently realizing that they were now talking not of her  but of kitty
 but the humiliation   said kitty   the humiliation one can never forget  can never forget   she said  remembering her look at the last ball during the pause in the music
 where is the humiliation  why  you did nothing wrong    worse than wrong shameful   varenka shook her head and laid her hand on kitty s hand
 why  what is there shameful   she said
 you didn t tell a man  who didn t care for you  that you loved him  did you    of course not  i never said a word  but he knew it
no  no  there are looks  there are ways  i can t forget it  if i live a hundred years    why so  i don t understand
the whole point is whether you love him now or not   said varenka  who called everything by its name
 i hate him  i can t forgive myself    why  what for    the shame  the humiliation   anna karenina 487 of 1759  oh  if everyone were as sensitive as you are   said varenka
 there isn t a girl who hasn t been through the same
and it s all so unimportant    why  what is important   said kitty  looking into her face with inquisitive wonder
 oh  there s so much that s important   said varenka  smiling
 why  what    oh  so much that s more important   answered varenka  not knowing what to say
but at that instant they heard the princess s voice from the window
 kitty  it s cold  either get a shawl  or come indoors    it really is time to go in   said varenka  getting up
 i have to go on to madame berthe s  she asked me to   kitty held her by the hand  and with passionate curiosity and entreaty her eyes asked her   what is it  what is this of such importance that gives you such tranquillity  you know  tell me   but varenka did not even know what kitty s eyes were asking her
she merely thought that she had to go to see madame berthe too that evening  and to make haste home in time for maman s tea at twelve o clock
she went indoors  collected her music  and saying good bye to everyone  was about to go
 allow me to see you home   said the colonel
anna karenina 488 of 1759  yes  how can you go alone at night like this   chimed in the princess
 anyway  i ll send parasha   kitty saw that varenka could hardly restrain a smile at the idea that she needed an escort
 no  i always go about alone and nothing ever happens to me   she said  taking her hat
and kissing kitty once more  without saying what was important  she stepped out courageously with the music under her arm and vanished into the twilight of the summer night  bearing away with her her secret of what was important and what gave her the calm and dignity so much to be envied
anna karenina 489 of 1759 kitty made the acquaintance of madame stahl too  and this acquaintance  together with her friendship with varenka  did not merely exercise a great influence on her  it also comforted her in her mental distress
she found this comfort through a completely new world being opened to her by means of this acquaintance  a world having nothing in common with her past  an exalted  noble world  from the height of which she could contemplate her past calmly
it was revealed to her that besides the instinctive life to which kitty had given herself up hitherto there was a spiritual life
this life was disclosed in religion  but a religion having nothing in common with that one which kitty had known from childhood  and which found expression in litanies and all night services at the widow s home  where one might meet one s friends  and in learning by heart slavonic texts with the priest
this was a lofty  mysterious religion connected with a whole series of noble thoughts and feelings  which one could do more than merely believe because one was told to  which one could love
anna karenina 490 of 1759 kitty found all this out not from words
madame stahl talked to kitty as to a charming child that one looks on with pleasure as on the memory of one s youth  and only once she said in passing that in all human sorrows nothing gives comfort but love and faith  and that in the sight of christ s compassion for us no sorrow is trifling and immediately talked of other things
but in every gesture of madame stahl  in every word  in every heavenly as kitty called it look  and above all in the whole story of her life  which she heard from varenka  kitty recognized that something  that was important   of which  till then  she had known nothing
yet  elevated as madame stahl s character was  touching as was her story  and exalted and moving as was her speech  kitty could not help detecting in her some traits which perplexed her
she noticed that when questioning her about her family  madame stahl had smiled contemptuously  which was not in accord with christian meekness
she noticed  too  that when she had found a catholic priest with her  madame stahl had studiously kept her face in the shadow of the lamp shade and had smiled in a peculiar way
trivial as these two observations were  they perplexed her  and she had her doubts as to madame stahl
but on the other hand anna karenina 491 of 1759 varenka  alone in the world  without friends or relations  with a melancholy disappointment in the past  desiring nothing  regretting nothing  was just that perfection of which kitty dared hardly dream
in varenka she realized that one has but to forget oneself and love others  and one will be calm  happy  and noble
and that was what kitty longed to be
seeing now clearly what was the most important  kitty was not satisfied with being enthusiastic over it  she at once gave herself up with her whole soul to the new life that was opening to her
from varenka s accounts of the doings of madame stahl and other people whom she mentioned  kitty had already constructed the plan of her own future life
she would  like madame stahl s niece  aline  of whom varenka had talked to her a great deal  seek out those who were in trouble  wherever she might be living  help them as far as she could  give them the gospel  read the gospel to the sick  the criminals  to the dying
the idea of reading the gospel to criminals  as aline did  particularly fascinated kitty
but all these were secret dreams  of which kitty did not talk either to her mother or to varenka while awaiting the time for carrying out her plans on a large scale  however  kitty  even then at the springs  where there were so many people ill and unhappy  readily anna karenina 492 of 1759 found a chance for practicing her new principles in imitation of varenka
at first the princess noticed nothing but that kitty was much under the influence of her engouement  as she called it  for madame stahl  and still more for varenka
she saw that kitty did not merely imitate varenka in her conduct  but unconsciously imitated her in her manner of walking  of talking  of blinking her eyes
but later on the princess noticed that  apart from this adoration  some kind of serious spiritual change was taking place in her daughter
the princess saw that in the evenings kitty read a french testament that madame stahl had given her a thing she had never done before  that she avoided society acquaintances and associated with the sick people who were under varenka s protection  and especially one poor family  that of a sick painter  petrov
kitty was unmistakably proud of playing the part of a sister of mercy in that family
all this was well enough  and the princess had nothing to say against it  especially as petrov s wife was a perfectly nice sort of woman  and that the german princess  noticing kitty s devotion  praised her  calling her an angel of consolation
all this would have been very well  if there had been no exaggeration
but the princess anna karenina 493 of 1759 saw that her daughter was rushing into extremes  and so indeed she told her
 il ne faut jamais rien outrer   she said to her
her daughter made her no reply  only in her heart she thought that one could not talk about exaggeration where christianity was concerned
what exaggeration could there be in the practice of a doctrine wherein one was bidden to turn the other cheek when one was smitten  and give one s cloak if one s coat were taken  but the princess disliked this exaggeration  and disliked even more the fact that she felt her daughter did not care to show her all her heart
kitty did in fact conceal her new views and feelings from her mother
she concealed them not because she did not respect or did not love her mother  but simply because she was her mother
she would have revealed them to anyone sooner than to her mother
 how is it anna pavlovna s not been to see us for so long   the princess said one day of madame petrova
 i ve asked her  but she seems put out about something    no  i ve not noticed it  maman   said kitty  flushing hotly  is it long since you went to see them    we re meaning to make an expedition to the mountains tomorrow   answered kitty  anna karenina 494 of 1759  well  you can go   answered the princess  gazing at her daughter s embarrassed face and trying to guess the cause of her embarrassment
that day varenka came to dinner and told them that anna pavlovna had changed her mind and given up the expedition for the morrow
and the princess noticed again that kitty reddened
 kitty  haven t you had some misunderstanding with the petrovs   said the princess  when they were left alone
 why has she given up sending the children and coming to see us   kitty answered that nothing had happened between them  and that she could not tell why anna pavlovna seemed displeased with her
kitty answered perfectly truly
she did not know the reason anna pavlovna had changed to her  but she guessed it
she guessed at something which she could not tell her mother  which she did not put into words to herself
it was one of those things which one knows but which one can never speak of even to oneself so terrible and shameful would it be to be mistaken
again and again she went over in her memory all her relations with the family
she remembered the simple delight expressed on the round  good humored face of anna pavlovna at their meetings  she remembered their anna karenina 495 of 1759 secret confabulations about the invalid  their plots to draw him away from the work which was forbidden him  and to get him out of doors  the devotion of the youngest boy  who used to call her  my kitty   and would not go to bed without her
how nice it all was  then she recalled the thin  terribly thin figure of petrov  with his long neck  in his brown coat  his scant  curly hair  his questioning blue eyes that were so terrible to kitty at first  and his painful attempts to seem hearty and lively in her presence
she recalled the efforts she had made at first to overcome the repugnance she felt for him  as for all consumptive people  and the pains it had cost her to think of things to say to him
she recalled the timid  softened look with which he gazed at her  and the strange feeling of compassion and awkwardness  and later of a sense of her own goodness  which she had felt at it
how nice it all was  but all that was at first
now  a few days ago  everything was suddenly spoiled
anna pavlovna had met kitty with affected cordiality  and had kept continual watch on her and on her husband
could that touching pleasure he showed when she came near be the cause of anna pavlovna s coolness   yes   she mused   there was something unnatural about anna pavlovna  and utterly unlike her good nature  when anna karenina 496 of 1759 she said angrily the day before yesterday   there  he will keep waiting for you  he wouldn t drink his coffee without you  though he s grown so dreadfully weak      yes  perhaps  too  she didn t like it when i gave him the rug
it was all so simple  but he took it so awkwardly  and was so long thanking me  that i felt awkward too
and then that portrait of me he did so well
and most of all that look of confusion and tenderness  yes  yes  that s it   kitty repeated to herself with horror
 no  it can t be  it oughtn t to be  he s so much to be pitied   she said to herself directly after
this doubt poisoned the charm of her new life
anna karenina 497 of 1759 before the end of the course of drinking the waters  prince shtcherbatsky  who had gone on from carlsbad to baden and kissingen to russian friends to get a breath of russian air  as he said came back to his wife and daughter
the views of the prince and of the princess on life abroad were completely opposed
the princess thought everything delightful  and in spite of her established position in russian society  she tried abroad to be like a european fashionable lady  which she was not for the simple reason that she was a typical russian gentlewoman  and so she was affected  which did not altogether suit her
the prince  on the contrary  thought everything foreign detestable  got sick of european life  kept to his russian habits  and purposely tried to show himself abroad less european than he was in reality the prince returned thinner  with the skin hanging in loose bags on his cheeks  but in the most cheerful frame of mind
his good humor was even greater when he saw kitty completely recovered
the news of kitty s friendship with madame stahl and varenka  and the reports the anna karenina 498 of 1759 princess gave him of some kind of change she had noticed in kitty  troubled the prince and aroused his habitual feeling of jealousy of everything that drew his daughter away from him  and a dread that his daughter might have got out of the reach of his influence into regions inaccessible to him
but these unpleasant matters were all drowned in the sea of kindliness and good humor which was always within him  and more so than ever since his course of carlsbad waters
the day after his arrival the prince  in his long overcoat  with his russian wrinkles and baggy cheeks propped up by a starched collar  set off with his daughter to the spring in the greatest good humor
it was a lovely morning  the bright  cheerful houses with their little gardens  the sight of the red faced  redarmed  beer drinking german waitresses  working away merrily  did the heart good
but the nearer they got to the springs the oftener they met sick people  and their appearance seemed more pitiable than ever among the everyday conditions of prosperous german life
kitty was no longer struck by this contrast
the bright sun  the brilliant green of the foliage  the strains of the music were for her the natural setting of all these familiar faces  with their changes to greater emaciation or to convalescence  anna karenina 499 of 1759 for which she watched
but to the prince the brightness and gaiety of the june morning  and the sound of the orchestra playing a gay waltz then in fashion  and above all  the appearance of the healthy attendants  seemed something unseemly and monstrous  in conjunction with these slowly moving  dying figures gathered together from all parts of europe
in spite of his feeling of pride and  as it were  of the return of youth  with his favorite daughter on his arm  he felt awkward  and almost ashamed of his vigorous step and his sturdy  stout limbs
he felt almost like a man not dressed in a crowd
 present me to your new friends   he said to his daughter  squeezing her hand with his elbow
 i like even your horrid soden for making you so well again
only it s melancholy  very melancholy here
who s that   kitty mentioned the names of all the people they met  with some of whom she was acquainted and some not
at the entrance of the garden they met the blind lady  madame berthe  with her guide  and the prince was delighted to see the old frenchwoman s face light up when she heard kitty s voice
she at once began talking to him with french exaggerated politeness  applauding him for having such a delightful daughter  extolling kitty to anna karenina 500 of 1759 the skies before her face  and calling her a treasure  a pearl  and a consoling angel
 well  she s the second angel  then   said the prince  smiling
 she calls mademoiselle varenka angel number one    oh  mademoiselle varenka  she s a real angel  allez   madame berthe assented
in the arcade they met varenka herself
she was walking rapidly towards them carrying an elegant red bag
 here is papa come   kitty said to her
varenka made simply and naturally as she did everything a movement between a bow and curtsey  and immediately began talking to the prince  without shyness  naturally  as she talked to everyone
 of course i know you  i know you very well   the prince said to her with a smile  in which kitty detected with joy that her father liked her friend
 where are you off to in such haste    maman s here   she said  turning to kitty
 she has not slept all night  and the doctor advised her to go out
i m taking her her work    so that s angel number one   said the prince when varenka had gone on
anna karenina 501 of 1759 kitty saw that her father had meant to make fun of varenka  but that he could not do it because he liked her
 come  so we shall see all your friends   he went on   even madame stahl  if she deigns to recognize me    why  did you know her  papa   kitty asked apprehensively  catching the gleam of irony that kindled in the prince s eyes at the mention of madame stahl
 i used to know her husband  and her too a little  before she d joined the pietists    what is a pietist  papa   asked kitty  dismayed to find that what she prized so highly in madame stahl had a name
 i don t quite know myself
i only know that she thanks god for everything  for every misfortune  and thanks god too that her husband died
and that s rather droll  as they didn t get on together    who s that  what a piteous face   he asked  noticing a sick man of medium height sitting on a bench  wearing a brown overcoat and white trousers that fell in strange folds about his long  fleshless legs
this man lifted his straw hat  showed his scanty curly hair and high forehead  painfully reddened by the pressure of the hat
 that s petrov  an artist   answered kitty  blushing
 and that s his wife   she added  indicating anna pavlovna  anna karenina 502 of 1759 who  as though on purpose  at the very instant they approached walked away after a child that had run off along a path
 poor fellow  and what a nice face he has   said the prince
 why don t you go up to him  he wanted to speak to you    well  let us go  then   said kitty  turning round resolutely
 how are you feeling today   she asked petrov
petrov got up  leaning on his stick  and looked shyly at the prince
 this is my daughter   said the prince
 let me introduce myself   the painter bowed and smiled  showing his strangely dazzling white teeth
 we expected you yesterday  princess   he said to kitty
he staggered as he said this  and then repeated the motion  trying to make it seem as if it had been intentional
 i meant to come  but varenka said that anna pavlovna sent word you were not going    not going   said petrov  blushing  and immediately beginning to cough  and his eyes sought his wife
 anita  anita   he said loudly  and the swollen veins stood out like cords on his thin white neck
anna pavlovna came up
anna karenina 503 of 1759  so you sent word to the princess that we weren t going   he whispered to her angrily  losing his voice
 good morning  princess   said anna pavlovna  with an assumed smile utterly unlike her former manner
 very glad to make your acquaintance   she said to the prince
 you ve long been expected  prince    what did you send word to the princess that we weren t going for   the artist whispered hoarsely once more  still more angrily  obviously exasperated that his voice failed him so that he could not give his words the expression he would have liked to
 oh  mercy on us  i thought we weren t going   his wife answered crossly
 what  when      he coughed and waved his hand
the prince took off his hat and moved away with his daughter
 ah  ah   he sighed deeply
 oh  poor things    yes  papa   answered kitty
 and you must know they ve three children  no servant  and scarcely any means
he gets something from the academy   she went on briskly  trying to drown the distress that the queer change in anna pavlovna s manner to her had aroused in her
 oh  here s madame stahl   said kitty  indicating an invalid carriage  where  propped on pillows  something in gray and blue was lying under a sunshade
this was anna karenina 504 of 1759 madame stahl
behind her stood the gloomy  healthylooking german workman who pushed the carriage
close by was standing a flaxen headed swedish count  whom kitty knew by name
several invalids were lingering near the low carriage  staring at the lady as though she were some curiosity
the prince went up to her  and kitty detected that disconcerting gleam of irony in his eyes
he went up to madame stahl  and addressed her with extreme courtesy and affability in that excellent french that so few speak nowadays
 i don t know if you remember me  but i must recall myself to thank you for your kindness to my daughter   he said  taking off his hat and not putting it on again
 prince alexander shtcherbatsky   said madame stahl  lifting upon him her heavenly eyes  in which kitty discerned a look of annoyance
 delighted  i have taken a great fancy to your daughter    you are still in weak health    yes  i m used to it   said madame stahl  and she introduced the prince to the swedish count
 you are scarcely changed at all   the prince said to her
 it s ten or eleven years since i had the honor of seeing you   anna karenina 505 of 1759  yes  god sends the cross and sends the strength to bear it
often one wonders what is the goal of this life   
the other side   she said angrily to varenka  who had rearranged the rug over her feet not to her satisfaction
 to do good  probably   said the prince with a twinkle in his eye
 that is not for us to judge   said madame stahl  perceiving the shade of expression on the prince s face
 so you will send me that book  dear count  i m very grateful to you   she said to the young swede
 ah   cried the prince  catching sight of the moscow colonel standing near  and with a bow to madame stahl he walked away with his daughter and the moscow colonel  who joined them
 that s our aristocracy  prince   the moscow colonel said with ironical intention
he cherished a grudge against madame stahl for not making his acquaintance
 she s just the same   replied the prince
 did you know her before her illness  prince that s to say before she took to her bed    yes
she took to her bed before my eyes   said the prince
 they say it s ten years since she has stood on her feet   anna karenina 506 of 1759  she doesn t stand up because her legs are too short
she s a very bad figure    papa  it s not possible   cried kitty
 that s what wicked tongues say  my darling
and your varenka catches it too   he added
 oh  these invalid ladies    oh  no  papa   kitty objected warmly
 varenka worships her
and then she does so much good  ask anyone  everyone knows her and aline stahl    perhaps so   said the prince  squeezing her hand with his elbow   but it s better when one does good so that you may ask everyone and no one knows   kitty did not answer  not because she had nothing to say  but because she did not care to reveal her secret thoughts even to her father
but  strange to say  although she had so made up her mind not to be influenced by her father s views  not to let him into her inmost sanctuary  she felt that the heavenly image of madame stahl  which she had carried for a whole month in her heart  had vanished  never to return  just as the fantastic figure made up of some clothes thrown down at random vanishes when one sees that it is only some garment lying there
all that was left was a woman with short legs  who lay down because she had a bad figure  and worried patient varenka anna karenina 507 of 1759 for not arranging her rug to her liking
and by no effort of the imagination could kitty bring back the former madame stahl
anna karenina 508 of 1759 the prince communicated his good humor to his own family and his friends  and even to the german landlord in whose rooms the shtcherbatskys were staying on coming back with kitty from the springs  the prince  who had asked the colonel  and marya yevgenyevna  and varenka all to come and have coffee with them  gave orders for a table and chairs to be taken into the garden under the chestnut tree  and lunch to be laid there
the landlord and the servants  too  grew brisker under the influence of his good spirits
they knew his open handedness  and half an hour later the invalid doctor from hamburg  who lived on the top floor  looked enviously out of the window at the merry party of healthy russians assembled under the chestnut tree
in the trembling circles of shadow cast by the leaves  at a table  covered with a white cloth  and set with coffeepot  breadand butter  cheese  and cold game  sat the princess in a high cap with lilac ribbons  distributing cups and breadand butter
at the other end sat the prince  eating heartily  and talking loudly and merrily
the prince had spread out near him his purchases  carved boxes  and knick knacks  anna karenina 509 of 1759 paper knives of all sorts  of which he bought a heap at every watering place  and bestowed them upon everyone  including lieschen  the servant girl  and the landlord  with whom he jested in his comically bad german  assuring him that it was not the water had cured kitty  but his splendid cookery  especially his plum soup
the princess laughed at her husband for his russian ways  but she was more lively and good humored than she had been all the while she had been at the waters
the colonel smiled  as he always did  at the prince s jokes  but as far as regards europe  of which he believed himself to be making a careful study  he took the princess s side the simplehearted marya yevgenyevna simply roared with laughter at everything absurd the prince said  and his jokes made varenka helpless with feeble but infectious laughter  which was something kitty had never seen before
kitty was glad of all this  but she could not be lighthearted
she could not solve the problem her father had unconsciously set her by his goodhumored view of her friends  and of the life that had so attracted her
to this doubt there was joined the change in her relations with the petrovs  which had been so conspicuously and unpleasantly marked that morning
everyone was good humored  but kitty could not feel good humored  and this anna karenina 510 of 1759 increased her distress
she felt a feeling such as she had known in childhood  when she had been shut in her room as a punishment  and had heard her sisters  merry laughter outside
 well  but what did you buy this mass of things for   said the princess  smiling  and handing her husband a cup of coffee
 one goes for a walk  one looks in a shop  and they ask you to buy
 erlaucht  durchlaucht   directly they say  durchlaucht   i can t hold out
i lose ten thalers    it s simply from boredom   said the princess
 of course it is
such boredom  my dear  that one doesn t know what to do with oneself    how can you be bored  prince  there s so much that s interesting now in germany   said marya yevgenyevna
 but i know everything that s interesting  the plum soup i know  and the pea sausages i know
i know everything    no  you may say what you like  prince  there s the interest of their institutions   said the colonel
 but what is there interesting about it  they re all as pleased as brass halfpence
they ve conquered everybody  and why am i to be pleased at that  i haven t conquered anyone  and i m obliged to take off my own boots  yes  anna karenina 511 of 1759 and put them away too  in the morning  get up and dress at once  and go to the dining room to drink bad tea  how different it is at home  you get up in no haste  you get cross  grumble a little  and come round again
you ve time to think things over  and no hurry    but time s money  you forget that   said the colonel
 time  indeed  that depends  why  there s time one would give a month of for sixpence  and time you wouldn t give half an hour of for any money
isn&#x2019 t that so  katinka  what is it  why are you so depressed    i m not depressed    where are you off to  stay a little longer   he said to varenka
 i must be going home   said varenka  getting up  and again she went off into a giggle
when she had recovered  she said good bye  and went into the house to get her hat
kitty followed her
even varenka struck her as different
she was not worse  but different from what she had fancied her before
 oh  dear  it s a long while since i ve laughed so much   said varenka  gathering up her parasol and her bag
 how nice he is  your father   kitty did not speak
anna karenina 512 of 1759  when shall i see you again   asked varenka
 mamma meant to go and see the petrovs
won t you be there   said kitty  to try varenka
 yes   answered varenka
 they re getting ready to go away  so i promised to help them pack    well  i ll come too  then    no  why should you    why not  why not  why not   said kitty  opening her eyes wide  and clutching at varenka s parasol  so as not to let her go
 no  wait a minute  why not    oh  nothing  your father has come  and besides  they will feel awkward at your helping    no  tell me why you don t want me to be often at the petrovs 
you don t want me to why not    i didn t say that   said varenka quietly
 no  please tell me    tell you everything   asked varenka
 everything  everything   kitty assented
 well  there s really nothing of any consequence  only that mihail alexeyevitch  (that was the artist s name)  had meant to leave earlier  and now he doesn t want to go away   said varenka  smiling
 well  well   kitty urged impatiently  looking darkly at varenka
anna karenina 513 of 1759  well  and for some reason anna pavlovna told him that he didn t want to go because you are here
of course  that was nonsense  but there was a dispute over it over you
you know how irritable these sick people are   kitty  scowling more than ever  kept silent  and varenka went on speaking alone  trying to soften or soothe her  and seeing a storm coming she did not know whether of tears or of words
 so you d better not go   
you understand  you won t be offended      and it serves me right  and it serves me right   kitty cried quickly  snatching the parasol out of varenka s hand  and looking past her friend s face
varenka felt inclined to smile  looking at her childish fury  but she was afraid of wounding her
 how does it serve you right  i don t understand   she said
 it serves me right  because it was all sham  because it was all done on purpose  and not from the heart
what business had i to interfere with outsiders  and so it s come about that i m a cause of quarrel  and that i ve done what nobody asked me to do
because it was all a sham  a sham  a sham 

    a sham  with what object   said varenka gently
anna karenina 514 of 1759  oh  it s so idiotic  so hateful  there was no need whatever for me   
nothing but sham   she said  opening and shutting the parasol
 but with what object    to seem better to people  to myself  to god  to deceive everyone
no  now i won t descend to that
i ll be bad  but anyway not a liar  a cheat    but who is a cheat   said varenka reproachfully
 you speak as if    but kitty was in one of her gusts of fury  and she would not let her finish
 i don t talk about you  not about you at all
you re perfection
yes  yes  i know you re all perfection  but what am i to do if i m bad  this would never have been if i weren t bad
so let me be what i am
i won t be a sham
what have i to do with anna pavlovna  let them go their way  and me go mine
i can t be different   
and yet it s not that  it s not that    what is not that   asked varenka in bewilderment
 everything
i can t act except from the heart  and you act from principle
i liked you simply  but you most likely only wanted to save me  to improve me    you are unjust   said varenka
anna karenina 515 of 1759  but i m not speaking of other people  i m speaking of myself    kitty   they heard her mother s voice   come here  show papa your necklace   kitty  with a haughty air  without making peace with her friend  took the necklace in a little box from the table and went to her mother
 what s the matter  why are you so red   her mother and father said to her with one voice
 nothing   she answered
 i ll be back directly   and she ran back
 she s still here   she thought
 what am i to say to her  oh  dear  what have i done  what have i said  why was i rude to her  what am i to do  what am i to say to her   thought kitty  and she stopped in the doorway
varenka in her hat and with the parasol in her hands was sitting at the table examining the spring which kitty had broken
she lifted her head
 varenka  forgive me  do forgive me   whispered kitty  going up to her
 i don t remember what i said
i     i really didn t mean to hurt you   said varenka  smiling
peace was made
but with her father s coming all the world in which she had been living was transformed for anna karenina 516 of 1759 kitty
she did not give up everything she had learned  but she became aware that she had deceived herself in supposing she could be what she wanted to be
her eyes were  it seemed  opened  she felt all the difficulty of maintaining herself without hypocrisy and self conceit on the pinnacle to which she had wished to mount
moreover  she became aware of all the dreariness of the world of sorrow  of sick and dying people  in which she had been living
the efforts she had made to like it seemed to her intolerable  and she felt a longing to get back quickly into the fresh air  to russia  to ergushovo  where  as she knew from letters  her sister dolly had already gone with her children
but her affection for varenka did not wane
as she said good bye  kitty begged her to come to them in russia
 i ll come when you get married   said varenka
 i shall never marry    well  then  i shall never come    well  then  i shall be married simply for that
mind now  remember your promise   said kitty
the doctor s prediction was fulfilled
kitty returned home to russia cured
she was not so gay and thoughtless as before  but she was serene
her moscow troubles had become a memory to her
anna karenina 517 of 1759 part three anna karenina 518 of 1759 sergey ivanovitch koznishev wanted a rest from mental work  and instead of going abroad as he usually did  he came towards the end of may to stay in the country with his brother
in his judgment the best sort of life was a country life
he had come now to enjoy such a life at his brother s
konstantin levin was very glad to have him  especially as he did not expect his brother nikolay that summer
but in spite of his affection and respect for sergey ivanovitch  konstantin levin was uncomfortable with his brother in the country
it made him uncomfortable  and it positively annoyed him to see his brother s attitude to the country
to konstantin levin the country was the background of life  that is of pleasures  endeavors  labor
to sergey ivanovitch the country meant on one hand rest from work  on the other a valuable antidote to the corrupt influences of town  which he took with satisfaction and a sense of its utility
to konstantin levin the country was good first because it afforded a field for labor  of the usefulness of which there could be no doubt
to sergey ivanovitch the country was particularly good  because there it was possible and fitting to do nothing
moreover  sergey ivanovitch s attitude to the anna karenina 519 of 1759 peasants rather piqued konstantin
sergey ivanovitch used to say that he knew and liked the peasantry  and he often talked to the peasants  which he knew how to do without affectation or condescension  and from every such conversation he would deduce general conclusions in favor of the peasantry and in confirmation of his knowing them
konstantin levin did not like such an attitude to the peasants
to konstantin the peasant was simply the chief partner in their common labor  and in spite of all the respect and the love  almost like that of kinship  he had for the peasant  sucked in probably  as he said himself  with the milk of his peasant nurse still as a fellow worker with him  while sometimes enthusiastic over the vigor  gentleness  and justice of these men  he was very often  when their common labors called for other qualities  exasperated with the peasant for his carelessness  lack of method  drunkenness  and lying if he had been asked whether he liked or didn t like the peasants  konstantin levin would have been absolutely at a loss what to reply
he liked and did not like the peasants  just as he liked and did not like men in general
of course  being a goodhearted man  he liked men rather than he disliked them  and so too with the peasants
but like or dislike  the people  as something apart he could not  not only because anna karenina 520 of 1759 he lived with  the people   and all his interests were bound up with theirs  but also because he regarded himself as a part of  the people   did not see any special qualities or failings distinguishing himself and  the people   and could not contrast himself with them moreover  although he had lived so long in the closest relations with the peasants  as farmer and arbitrator  and what was more  as adviser (the peasants trusted him  and for thirty miles round they would come to ask his advice)  he had no definite views of  the people   and would have been as much at a loss to answer the question whether he knew  the people  as the question whether he liked them
for him to say he knew the peasantry would have been the same as to say he knew men
he was continually watching and getting to know people of all sorts  and among them peasants  whom he regarded as good and interesting people  and he was continually observing new points in them  altering his former views of them and forming new ones
with sergey ivanovitch it was quite the contrary
just as he liked and praised a country life in comparison with the life he did not like  so too he liked the peasantry in contradistinction to the class of men he did not like  and so too he knew the peasantry as something distinct from and opposed to men generally
in his methodical brain there were distinctly anna karenina 521 of 1759 formulated certain aspects of peasant life  deduced partly from that life itself  but chiefly from contrast with other modes of life
he never changed his opinion of the peasantry and his sympathetic attitude towards them
in the discussions that arose between the brothers on their views of the peasantry  sergey ivanovitch always got the better of his brother  precisely because sergey ivanovitch had definite ideas about the peasant his character  his qualities  and his tastes
konstantin levin had no definite and unalterable idea on the subject  and so in their arguments konstantin was readily convicted of contradicting himself i sergey ivanovitch s eyes his younger brother was a capital fellow  with his heart in the right place (as he expressed it in french)  but with a mind which  though fairly quick  was too much influenced by the impressions of the moment  and consequently filled with contradictions
with all the condescension of an elder brother he sometimes explained to him the true import of things  but he derived little satisfaction from arguing with him because he got the better of him too easily
konstantin levin regarded his brother as a man of immense intellect and culture  as generous in the highest sense of the word  and possessed of a special faculty for anna karenina 522 of 1759 working for the public good
but in the depths of his heart  the older he became  and the more intimately he knew his brother  the more and more frequently the thought struck him that this faculty of working for the public good  of which he felt himself utterly devoid  was possibly not so much a quality as a lack of something   not a lack of good  honest  noble desires and tastes  but a lack of vital force  of what is called heart  of that impulse which drives a man to choose someone out of the innumerable paths of life  and to care only for that one the better he knew his brother  the more he noticed that sergey ivanovitch  and many other people who worked for the public welfare  were not led by an impulse of the heart to care for the public good  but reasoned from intellectual considerations that it was a right thing to take interest in public affairs  and consequently took interest in them
levin was confirmed in this generalization by observing that his brother did not take questions affecting the public welfare or the question of the immortality of the soul a bit more to heart than he did chess problems  or the ingenious construction of a new machine besides this  konstantin levin was not at his ease with his brother  because in summer in the country levin was continually busy with work on the land  and the long anna karenina 523 of 1759 summer day was not long enough for him to get through all he had to do  while sergey ivanovitch was taking a holiday
but though he was taking a holiday now  that is to say  he was doing no writing  he was so used to intellectual activity that he liked to put into concise and eloquent shape the ideas that occurred to him  and liked to have someone to listen to him
his most usual and natural listener was his brother
and so in spite of the friendliness and directness of their relations  konstantin felt an awkwardness in leaving him alone
sergey ivanovitch liked to stretch himself on the grass in the sun  and to lie so  basking and chatting lazily  you wouldn t believe   he would say to his brother   what a pleasure this rural laziness is to me not an idea in one s brain  as empty as a drum   but konstantin levin found it dull sitting and listening to him  especially when he knew that while he was away they would be carting dung onto the fields not ploughed ready for it  and heaping it all up anyhow  and would not screw the shares in the ploughs  but would let them come off and then say that the new ploughs were a silly invention  and there was nothing like the old andreevna plough  and so on
anna karenina 524 of 1759  come  you ve done enough trudging about in the heat   sergey ivanovitch would say to him
 no  i must just run round to the counting house for a minute   levin would answer  and he would run off to the fields
anna karenina 525 of 1759 early in june it happened that agafea mihalovna  the old nurse and housekeeper  in carrying to the cellar a jar of mushrooms she had just pickled  slipped  fell  and sprained her wrist the district doctor  a talkative young medical student  who had just finished his studies  came to see her
he examined the wrist  said it was not broken  was delighted at a chance of talking to the celebrated sergey ivanovitch koznishev  and to show his advanced views of things told him all the scandal of the district  complaining of the poor state into which the district council had fallen
sergey ivanovitch listened attentively  asked him questions  and  roused by a new listener  he talked fluently  uttered a few keen and weighty observations  respectfully appreciated by the young doctor  and was soon in that eager frame of mind his brother knew so well  which always  with him  followed a brilliant and eager conversation
after the departure of the doctor  he wanted to go with a fishing rod to the river
sergey ivanovitch was fond of angling  and was  it seemed  proud of being able to care for such a stupid occupation
anna karenina 526 of 1759 konstantin levin  whose presence was needed in the plough land and meadows  had come to take his brother in the trap
it was that time of the year  the turning point of summer  when the crops of the present year are a certainty  when one begins to think of the sowing for next year  and the mowing is at hand  when the rye is all in ear  though its ears are still light  not yet full  and it waves in gray green billows in the wind  when the green oats  with tufts of yellow grass scattered here and there among it  droop irregularly over the late sown fields  when the early buckwheat is already out and hiding the ground  when the fallow lands  trodden hard as stone by the cattle  are half ploughed over  with paths left untouched by the plough  when from the dry dung heaps carted onto the fields there comes at sunset a smell of manure mixed with meadowsweet  and on the low lying lands the riverside meadows are a thick sea of grass waiting for the mowing  with blackened heaps of the stalks of sorrel among it
it was the time when there comes a brief pause in the toil of the fields before the beginning of the labors of harvest every year recurring  every year straining every nerve of the peasants
the crop was a splendid one  and anna karenina 527 of 1759 bright  hot summer days had set in with short  dewy nights
the brothers had to drive through the woods to reach the meadows
sergey ivanovitch was all the while admiring the beauty of the woods  which were a tangled mass of leaves  pointing out to his brother now an old lime tree on the point of flowering  dark on the shady side  and brightly spotted with yellow stipules  now the young shoots of this year s saplings brilliant with emerald
konstantin levin did not like talking and hearing about the beauty of nature
words for him took away the beauty of what he saw
he assented to what his brother said  but he could not help beginning to think of other things
when they came out of the woods  all his attention was engrossed by the view of the fallow land on the upland  in parts yellow with grass  in parts trampled and checkered with furrows  in parts dotted with ridges of dung  and in parts even ploughed
a string of carts was moving across it
levin counted the carts  and was pleased that all that were wanted had been brought  and at the sight of the meadows his thoughts passed to the mowing
he always felt something special moving him to the quick at the haymaking
on reaching the meadow levin stopped the horse
anna karenina 528 of 1759 the morning dew was still lying on the thick undergrowth of the grass  and that he might not get his feet wet  sergey ivanovitch asked his brother to drive him in the trap up to the willow tree from which the carp was caught
sorry as konstantin levin was to crush down his mowing grass  he drove him into the meadow
the high grass softly turned about the wheels and the horse s legs  leaving its seeds clinging to the wet axles and spokes of the wheels
his brother seated himself under a bush  arranging his tackle  while levin led the horse away  fastened him up  and walked into the vast gray green sea of grass unstirred by the wind the silky grass with its ripe seeds came almost to his waist in the dampest spots
crossing the meadow  konstantin levin came out onto the road  and met an old man with a swollen eye  carrying a skep on his shoulder
 what  taken a stray swarm  fomitch   he asked
 no  indeed  konstantin mitritch  all we can do to keep our own  this is the second swarm that has flown away   
luckily the lads caught them
they were ploughing your field
they unyoked the horses and galloped after them    well  what do you say  fomitch start mowing or wait a bit   anna karenina 529 of 1759  eh  well
our way s to wait till st
peter s day
but you always mow sooner
well  to be sure  please god  the hay s good
there ll be plenty for the beasts    what do you think about the weather    that s in god s hands
maybe it will be fine   levin went up to his brother
sergey ivanovitch had caught nothing  but he was not bored  and seemed in the most cheerful frame of mind
levin saw that  stimulated by his conversation with the doctor  he wanted to talk
levin  on the other hand  would have liked to get home as soon as possible to give orders about getting together the mowers for next day  and to set at rest his doubts about the mowing  which greatly absorbed him
 well  let s be going   he said
 why be in such a hurry  let s stay a little
but how wet you are  even though one catches nothing  it s nice
that s the best thing about every part of sport  that one has to do with nature
how exquisite this steely water is   said sergey ivanovitch
 these riverside banks always remind me of the riddle do you know it   the grass says to the water  we quiver and we quiver     i don t know the riddle   answered levin wearily
anna karenina 530 of 1759  do you know i ve been thinking about you   said sergey ivanovitch
 it s beyond everything what s being done in the district  according to what this doctor tells me
he s a very intelligent fellow
and as i ve told you before  i tell you again  it s not right for you not to go to the meetings  and altogether to keep out of the district business
if decent people won t go into it  of course it s bound to go all wrong
we pay the money  and it all goes in salaries  and there are no schools  nor district nurses  nor midwives  nor drugstores  nothing    well  i did try  you know   levin said slowly and unwillingly
 i can t  and so there s no help for it    but why can t you  i must own i can t make it out
idifference  incapacity i won t admit  surely it s not simply laziness    none of those things
i ve tried  and i see i can do nothing   said levin
he had hardly grasped what his brother was saying
looking towards the plough land across the river  he made out something black  but he could not distinguish whether it was a horse or the bailiff on horseback
anna karenina 531 of 1759  why is it you can do nothing  you made an attempt and didn t succeed  as you think  and you give in
how can you have so little self respect    self respect   said levin  stung to the quick by his brother s words   i don t understand
if they d told me at college that other people understood the integral calculus  and i didn t  then pride would have come in
but in this case one wants first to be convinced that one has certain qualifications for this sort of business  and especially that all this business is of great importance    what  do you mean to say it s not of importance   said sergey ivanovitch  stung to the quick too at his brother s considering anything of no importance that interested him  and still more at his obviously paying little attention to what he was saying
 i don t think it important  it does not take hold of me  i can t help it   answered levin  making out that what he saw was the bailiff  and that the bailiff seemed to be letting the peasants go off the ploughed land
they were turning the plough over
 can they have finished ploughing   he wondered
 come  really though   said the elder brother  with a frown on his handsome  clever face   there s a limit to everything
it s very well to be original and genuine  and anna karenina 532 of 1759 to dislike everything conventional i know all about that  but really  what you re saying either has no meaning  or it has a very wrong meaning
how can you think it a matter of no importance whether the peasant  whom you love as you assert     i never did assert it   thought konstantin levin
    dies without help  the ignorant peasant women starve the children  and the people stagnate in darkness  and are helpless in the hands of every village clerk  while you have at your disposal a means of helping them  and don t help them because to your mind it s of no importance   and sergey ivanovitch put before him the alternative  either you are so undeveloped that you can t see all that you can do  or you won t sacrifice your ease  your vanity  or whatever it is  to do it
konstantin levin felt that there was no course open to him but to submit  or to confess to a lack of zeal for the public good
and this mortified him and hurt his feelings
 it s both   he said resolutely   i don t see that it was possible     what  was it impossible  if the money were properly laid out  to provide medical aid   anna karenina 533 of 1759  impossible  as it seems to me    for the three thousand square miles of our district  what with our thaws  and the storms  and the work in the fields  i don t see how it is possible to provide medical aid all over and besides  i don t believe in medicine    oh  well  that s unfair   i can quote to you thousands of instances   
but the schools  anyway    why have schools    what do you mean  can there be two opinions of the advantage of education  if it s a good thing for you  it s a good thing for everyone   konstantin levin felt himself morally pinned against a wall  and so he got hot  and unconsciously blurted out the chief cause of his indifference to public business  perhaps it may all be very good  but why should i worry myself about establishing dispensaries which i shall never make use of  and schools to which i shall never send my children  to which even the peasants don t want to send their children  and to which i ve no very firm faith that they ought to send them   said he
sergey ivanovitch was for a minute surprised at this unexpected view of the subject  but he promptly made a new plan of attack
he was silent for a little  drew out a hook  threw it in again  and turned to his brother smiling
anna karenina 534 of 1759  come  now   
in the first place  the dispensary is needed
we ourselves sent for the district doctor for agafea mihalovna    oh  well  but i fancy her wrist will never be straight again    that remains to be proved   
next  the peasant who can read and write is as a workman of more use and value to you    no  you can ask anyone you like   konstantin levin answered with decision   the man that can read and write is much inferior as a workman
and mending the highroads is an impossibility  and as soon as they put up bridges they re stolen    still  that s not the point   said sergey ivanovitch  frowning
he disliked contradiction  and still more  arguments that were continually skipping from one thing to another  introducing new and disconnected points  so that there was no knowing to which to reply
 do you admit that education is a benefit for the people    yes  i admit it   said levin without thinking  and he was conscious immediately that he had said what he did not think
he felt that if he admitted that  it would be proved that he had been talking meaningless rubbish
how it would be proved he could not tell  but he knew that anna karenina 535 of 1759 this would inevitably be logically proved to him  and he awaited the proofs
the argument turned out to be far simpler than he had expected
 if you admit that it is a benefit   said sergey ivanovitch   then  as an honest man  you cannot help caring about it and sympathizing with the movement  and so wishing to work for it    but i still do not admit this movement to be just   said konstantin levin  reddening a little
 what  but you said just now     that s to say  i don t admit it s being either good or possible    that you can t tell without making the trial    well  supposing that s so   said levin  though he did not suppose so at all   supposing that is so  still i don t see  all the same  what i m to worry myself about it for    how so    no  since we are talking  explain it to me from the philosophical point of view   said levin
 i can t see where philosophy comes in   said sergey ivanovitch  in a tone  levin fancied  as though he did not admit his brother s right to talk about philosophy
and that irritated levin
anna karenina 536 of 1759  i ll tell you  then   he said with heat   i imagine the mainspring of all our actions is  after all  self interest
now in the local institutions i  as a nobleman  see nothing that could conduce to my prosperity  and the roads are not better and could not be better  my horses carry me well enough over bad ones
doctors and dispensaries are no use to me
an arbitrator of disputes is no use to me
i never appeal to him  and never shall appeal to him
the schools are no good to me  but positively harmful  as i told you
for me the district institutions simply mean the liability to pay fourpence halfpenny for every three acres  to drive into the town  sleep with bugs  and listen to all sorts of idiocy and loathsomeness  and self interest offers me no inducement    excuse me   sergey ivanovitch interposed with a smile   self interest did not induce us to work for the emancipation of the serfs  but we did work for it    no   konstantin levin broke in with still greater heat   the emancipation of the serfs was a different matter
there self interest did come in
one longed to throw off that yoke that crushed us  all decent people among us
but to be a town councilor and discuss how many dustmen are needed  and how chimneys shall be constructed in the town in which i don t live to serve on a jury and try a anna karenina 537 of 1759 peasant who s stolen a flitch of bacon  and listen for six hours at a stretch to all sorts of jabber from the counsel for the defense and the prosecution  and the president crossexamining my old half witted alioshka   do you admit  prisoner in the dock  the fact of the removal of the bacon    eh    konstantin levin had warmed to his subject  and began mimicking the president and the half witted alioshka  it seemed to him that it was all to the point but sergey ivanovitch shrugged his shoulders
 well  what do you mean to say  then    i simply mean to say that those rights that touch me   my interest  i shall always defend to the best of my ability  that when they made raids on us students  and the police read our letters  i was ready to defend those rights to the utmost  to defend my rights to education and freedom
i can understand compulsory military service  which affects my children  my brothers  and myself  i am ready to deliberate on what concerns me  but deliberating on how to spend forty thousand roubles of district council money  or judging the half witted alioshka i don t understand  and i can t do it   konstantin levin spoke as though the floodgates of his speech had burst open
sergey ivanovitch smiled
anna karenina 538 of 1759  but tomorrow it ll be your turn to be tried  would it have suited your tastes better to be tried in the old criminal tribunal    i m not going to be tried
i shan t murder anybody  and i ve no need of it
well  i tell you what   he went on  flying off again to a subject quite beside the point   our district self government and all the rest of it it s just like the birch branches we stick in the ground on trinity day  for instance  to look like a copse which has grown up of itself in europe  and i can t gush over these birch branches and believe in them   sergey ivanovitch merely shrugged his shoulders  as though to express his wonder how the birch branches had come into their argument at that point  though he did really understand at once what his brother meant
 excuse me  but you know one really can t argue in that way   he observed
but konstantin levin wanted to justify himself for the failing  of which he was conscious  of lack of zeal for the public welfare  and he went on  i imagine   he said   that no sort of activity is likely to be lasting if it is not founded on self interest  that s a universal principle  a philosophical principle   he said  repeating the word  philosophical  with determination  as anna karenina 539 of 1759 though wishing to show that he had as much right as any one else to talk of philosophy
sergey ivanovitch smiled
 he too has a philosophy of his own at the service of his natural tendencies   he thought
 come  you d better let philosophy alone   he said
 the chief problem of the philosophy of all ages consists just in finding the indispensable connection which exists between individual and social interests
but that s not to the point  what is to the point is a correction i must make in your comparison
the birches are not simply stuck in  but some are sown and some are planted  and one must deal carefully with them
it s only those peoples that have an intuitive sense of what s of importance and significance in their institutions  and know how to value them  that have a future before them it s only those peoples that one can truly call historical   and sergey ivanovitch carried the subject into the regions of philosophical history where konstantin levin could not follow him  and showed him all the incorrectness of his view
 as for your dislike of it  excuse my saying so  that s simply our russian sloth and old serf owner s ways  and anna karenina 540 of 1759 i m convinced that in you it s a temporary error and will pass   konstantin was silent
he felt himself vanquished on all sides  but he felt at the same time that what he wanted to say was unintelligible to his brother only he could not make up his mind whether it was unintelligible because he was not capable of expressing his meaning clearly  or because his brother would not or could not understand him
but he did not pursue the speculation  and without replying  he fell to musing on a quite different and personal matter
sergey ivanovitch wound up the last line  untied the horse  and they drove off
anna karenina 541 of 1759 the personal matter that absorbed levin during his conversation with his brother was this
once in a previous year he had gone to look at the mowing  and being made very angry by the bailiff he had recourse to his favorite means for regaining his temper   he took a scythe from a peasant and began mowing
he liked the work so much that he had several times tried his hand at mowing since
he had cut the whole of the meadow in front of his house  and this year ever since the early spring he had cherished a plan for mowing for whole days together with the peasants
ever since his brother s arrival  he had been in doubt whether to mow or not
he was loath to leave his brother alone all day long  and he was afraid his brother would laugh at him about it
but as he drove into the meadow  and recalled the sensations of mowing  he came near deciding that he would go mowing
after the irritating discussion with his brother  he pondered over this intention again
 i must have physical exercise  or my temper ll certainly be ruined   he thought  and he determined he would go anna karenina 542 of 1759 mowing  however awkward he might feel about it with his brother or the peasants
towards evening konstantin levin went to his counting house  gave directions as to the work to be done  and sent about the village to summon the mowers for the morrow  to cut the hay in kalinov meadow  the largest and best of his grass lands
 and send my scythe  please  to tit  for him to set it  and bring it round tomorrow
i shall maybe do some mowing myself too   he said trying not to be embarrassed
the bailiff smiled and said   yes  sir   at tea the same evening levin said to his brother   i fancy the fine weather will last
tomorrow i shall start mowing    i m so fond of that form of field labor   said sergey ivanovitch
 i m awfully fond of it
i sometimes mow myself with the peasants  and tomorrow i want to try mowing the whole day   sergey ivanovitch lifted his head  and looked with interest at his brother
 how do you mean  just like one of the peasants  all day long    yes  it s very pleasant   said levin
anna karenina 543 of 1759  it s splendid as exercise  only you ll hardly be able to stand it   said sergey ivanovitch  without a shade of irony
 i ve tried it
it s hard work at first  but you get into it
i dare say i shall manage to keep it up     really  what an idea  but tell me  how do the peasants look at it  i suppose they laugh in their sleeves at their master s being such a queer fish    no  i don t think so  but it s so delightful  and at the same time such hard work  that one has no time to think about it    but how will you do about dining with them  to send you a bottle of lafitte and roast turkey out there would be a little awkward    no  i ll simply come home at the time of their noonday rest   next morning konstantin levin got up earlier than usual  but he was detained giving directions on the farm  and when he reached the mowing grass the mowers were already at their second row
from the uplands he could get a view of the shaded cut part of the meadow below  with its grayish ridges of cut grass  and the black heaps of coats  taken off by the mowers at the place from which they had started cutting
anna karenina 544 of 1759 gradually  as he rode towards the meadow  the peasants came into sight  some in coats  some in their shirts mowing  one behind another in a long string  swinging their scythes differently
he counted forty two of them
they were mowing slowly over the uneven  low lying parts of the meadow  where there had been an old dam
levin recognized some of his own men
here was old yermil in a very long white smock  bending forward to swing a scythe  there was a young fellow  vaska  who had been a coachman of levin s  taking every row with a wide sweep
here  too  was tit  levin s preceptor in the art of mowing  a thin little peasant
he was in front of all  and cut his wide row without bending  as though playing with the scythe
levin got off his mare  and fastening her up by the roadside went to meet tit  who took a second scythe out of a bush and gave it to him
 it s ready  sir  it s like a razor  cuts of itself   said tit  taking off his cap with a smile and giving him the scythe
levin took the scythe  and began trying it
as they finished their rows  the mowers  hot and good humored  came out into the road one after another  and  laughing a little  greeted the master
they all stared at him  but no one made any remark  till a tall old man  with a wrinkled  anna karenina 545 of 1759 beardless face  wearing a short sheepskin jacket  came out into the road and accosted him
 look ee now  master  once take hold of the rope there s no letting it go   he said  and levin heard smothered laughter among the mowers
 i ll try not to let it go   he said  taking his stand behind tit  and waiting for the time to begin
 mind ee   repeated the old man
tit made room  and levin started behind him
the grass was short close to the road  and levin  who had not done any mowing for a long while  and was disconcerted by the eyes fastened upon him  cut badly for the first moments  though he swung his scythe vigorously
behind him he heard voices   it s not set right  handle s too high  see how he has to stoop to it   said one
 press more on the heel   said another
 never mind  he ll get on all right   the old man resumed
 he s made a start   
you swing it too wide  you ll tire yourself out   
the master  sure  does his best for himself  but see the grass missed out  for such work us fellows would catch it   anna karenina 546 of 1759 the grass became softer  and levin  listening without answering  followed tit  trying to do the best he could they moved a hundred paces
tit kept moving on  without stopping  not showing the slightest weariness  but levin was already beginning to be afraid he would not be able to keep it up  he was so tired
he felt as he swung his scythe that he was at the very end of his strength  and was making up his mind to ask tit to stop
but at that very moment tit stopped of his own accord  and stooping down picked up some grass  rubbed his scythe  and began whetting it
levin straightened himself  and drawing a deep breath looked round behind him came a peasant  and he too was evidently tired  for he stopped at once without waiting to mow up to levin  and began whetting his scythe
tit sharpened his scythe and levin s  and they went on
the next time it was just the same
tit moved on with sweep after sweep of his scythe  not stopping or showing signs of weariness
levin followed him  trying not to get left behind  and he found it harder and harder  the moment came when he felt he had no strength left  but at that very moment tit stopped and whetted the scythes
so they mowed the first row
and this long row seemed particularly hard work to levin  but when the end anna karenina 547 of 1759 was reached and tit  shouldering his scythe  began with deliberate stride returning on the tracks left by his heels in the cut grass  and levin walked back in the same way over the space he had cut  in spite of the sweat that ran in streams over his face and fell in drops down his nose  and drenched his back as though he had been soaked in water  he felt very happy what delighted him particularly was that now he knew he would be able to hold out
his pleasure was only disturbed by his row not being well cut
 i will swing less with my arm and more with my whole body   he thought  comparing tit s row  which looked as if it had been cut with a line  with his own unevenly and irregularly lying grass
the first row  as levin noticed  tit had mowed specially quickly  probably wishing to put his master to the test  and the row happened to be a long one
the next rows were easier  but still levin had to strain every nerve not to drop behind the peasants
he thought of nothing  wished for nothing  but not to be left behind the peasants  and to do his work as well as possible
he heard nothing but the swish of scythes  and saw before him tit s upright figure mowing away  the crescent shaped curve of the cut grass  the grass and flower heads slowly and rhythmically falling before the blade of anna karenina 548 of 1759 his scythe  and ahead of him the end of the row  where would come the rest
suddenly  in the midst of his toil  without understanding what it was or whence it came  he felt a pleasant sensation of chill on his hot  moist shoulders
he glanced at the sky in the interval for whetting the scythes
a heavy  lowering storm cloud had blown up  and big raindrops were falling
some of the peasants went to their coats and put them on  others just like levin himself  merely shrugged their shoulders  enjoying the pleasant coolness of it another row  and yet another row  followed long rows and short rows  with good grass and with poor grass
levin lost all sense of time  and could not have told whether it was late or early now
a change began to come over his work  which gave him immense satisfaction
in the midst of his toil there were moments during which he forgot what he was doing  and it came all easy to him  and at those same moments his row was almost as smooth and well cut as tit s
but so soon as he recollected what he was doing  and began trying to do better  he was at once conscious of all the difficulty of his task  and the row was badly mown
anna karenina 549 of 1759 on finishing yet another row he would have gone back to the top of the meadow again to begin the next  but tit stopped  and going up to the old man said something in a low voice to him
they both looked at the sun
 what are they talking about  and why doesn t he go back   thought levin  not guessing that the peasants had been mowing no less than four hours without stopping  and it was time for their lunch
 lunch  sir   said the old man
 is it really time  that s right  lunch  then   levin gave his scythe to tit  and together with the peasants  who were crossing the long stretch of mown grass  slightly sprinkled with rain  to get their bread from the heap of coats  he went towards his house only then he suddenly awoke to the fact that he had been wrong about the weather and the rain was drenching his hay
 the hay will be spoiled   he said
 not a bit of it  sir  mow in the rain  and you ll rake in fine weather   said the old man
levin untied his horse and rode home to his coffee
sergey ivanovitch was only just getting up
when he had drunk his coffee  levin rode back again to the mowing before sergey ivanovitch had had time to dress and come down to the dining room
anna karenina 550 of 1759 after lunch levin was not in the same place in the string of mowers as before  but stood between the old man who had accosted him jocosely  and now invited him to be his neighbor  and a young peasant  who had only been married in the autumn  and who was mowing this summer for the first time
the old man  holding himself erect  moved in front  with his feet turned out  taking long  regular strides  and with a precise and regular action which seemed to cost him no more effort than swinging one s arms in walking  as though it were in play  he laid down the high  even row of grass it was as though it were not he but the sharp scythe of itself swishing through the juicy grass
behind levin came the lad mishka
his pretty  boyish face  with a twist of fresh grass bound round his hair  was all working with effort  but whenever anyone looked at him he smiled
he would clearly have died sooner than own it was hard work for him
levin kept between them
in the very heat of the day the mowing did not seem such hard work to him
the perspiration with which he was drenched cooled him  anna karenina 551 of 1759 while the sun  that burned his back  his head  and his arms  bare to the elbow  gave a vigor and dogged energy to his labor  and more and more often now came those moments of unconsciousness  when it was possible not to think what one was doing the scythe cut of itself
these were happy moments
still more delightful were the moments when they reached the stream where the rows ended  and the old man rubbed his scythe with the wet  thick grass  rinsed its blade in the fresh water of the stream  ladled out a little in a tin dipper  and offered levin a drink
 what do you say to my home brew  eh  good  eh   said he  winking
and truly levin had never drunk any liquor so good as this warm water with green bits floating in it  and a taste of rust from the tin dipper
and immediately after this came the delicious  slow saunter  with his hand on the scythe  during which he could wipe away the streaming sweat  take deep breaths of air  and look about at the long string of mowers and at what was happening around in the forest and the country
the longer levin mowed  the oftener he felt the moments of unconsciousness in which it seemed not his hands that swung the scythe  but the scythe mowing of itself  a body full of life and consciousness of its own  and anna karenina 552 of 1759 as though by magic  without thinking of it  the work turned out regular and well finished of itself
these were the most blissful moments
it was only hard work when he had to break off the motion  which had become unconscious  and to think  when he had to mow round a hillock or a tuft of sorrel
the old man did this easily
when a hillock came he changed his action  and at one time with the heel  and at another with the tip of his scythe  clipped the hillock round both sides with short strokes
and while he did this he kept looking about and watching what came into his view  at one moment he picked a wild berry and ate it or offered it to levin  then he flung away a twig with the blade of the scythe  then he looked at a quail s nest  from which the bird flew just under the scythe  or caught a snake that crossed his path  and lifting it on the scythe as though on a fork showed it to levin and threw it away
for both levin and the young peasant behind him  such changes of position were difficult
both of them  repeating over and over again the same strained movement  were in a perfect frenzy of toil  and were incapable of shifting their position and at the same time watching what was before them
anna karenina 553 of 1759 levin did not notice how time was passing
if he had been asked how long he had been working he would have said half an hour  and it was getting on for dinner time
as they were walking back over the cut grass  the old man called levin s attention to the little girls and boys who were coming from different directions  hardly visible through the long grass  and along the road towards the mowers  carrying sacks of bread dragging at their little hands and pitchers of the sour rye beer  with cloths wrapped round them
 look ee  the little emmets crawling   he said  pointing to them  and he shaded his eyes with his hand to look at the sun
they mowed two more rows  the old man stopped
 come  master  dinner time   he said briskly
and on reaching the stream the mowers moved off across the lines of cut grass towards their pile of coats  where the children who had brought their dinners were sitting waiting for them
the peasants gathered into groups those further away under a cart  those nearer under a willow bush
levin sat down by them  he felt disinclined to go away
all constraint with the master had disappeared long ago
the peasants got ready for dinner
some washed  the young lads bathed in the stream  others made a place anna karenina 554 of 1759 comfortable for a rest  untied their sacks of bread  and uncovered the pitchers of rye beer
the old man crumbled up some bread in a cup  stirred it with the handle of a spoon  poured water on it from the dipper  broke up some more bread  and having seasoned it with salt  he turned to the east to say his prayer
 come  master  taste my sop   said he  kneeling down before the cup
the sop was so good that levin gave up the idea of going home
he dined with the old man  and talked to him about his family affairs  taking the keenest interest in them  and told him about his own affairs and all the circumstances that could be of interest to the old man he felt much nearer to him than to his brother  and could not help smiling at the affection he felt for this man
when the old man got up again  said his prayer  and lay down under a bush  putting some grass under his head for a pillow  levin did the same  and in spite of the clinging flies that were so persistent in the sunshine  and the midges that tickled his hot face and body  he fell asleep at once and only waked when the sun had passed to the other side of the bush and reached him
the old man had been awake a long while  and was sitting up whetting the scythes of the younger lads
anna karenina 555 of 1759 levin looked about him and hardly recognized the place  everything was so changed
the immense stretch of meadow had been mown and was sparkling with a peculiar fresh brilliance  with its lines of already sweetsmelling grass in the slanting rays of the evening sun and the bushes about the river had been cut down  and the river itself  not visible before  now gleaming like steel in its bends  and the moving  ascending peasants  and the sharp wall of grass of the unmown part of the meadow  and the hawks hovering over the stripped meadow all was perfectly new
raising himself  levin began considering how much had been cut and how much more could still be done that day the work done was exceptionally much for forty two men
they had cut the whole of the big meadow  which had  in the years of serf labor  taken thirty scythes two days to mow
only the corners remained to do  where the rows were short
but levin felt a longing to get as much mowing done that day as possible  and was vexed with the sun sinking so quickly in the sky
he felt no weariness  all he wanted was to get his work done more and more quickly and as much done as possible
 could you cut mashkin upland too  what do you think   he said to the old man
anna karenina 556 of 1759  as god wills  the sun s not high
a little vodka for the lads   at the afternoon rest  when they were sitting down again  and those who smoked had lighted their pipes  the old man told the men that  mashkin upland s to be cut  there ll be some vodka    why not cut it  come on  tit  we ll look sharp  we can eat at night
come on   cried voices  and eating up their bread  the mowers went back to work
 come  lads  keep it up   said tit  and ran on ahead almost at a trot
 get along  get along   said the old man  hurrying after him and easily overtaking him   i ll mow you down  look out   and young and old mowed away  as though they were racing with one another
but however fast they worked  they did not spoil the grass  and the rows were laid just as neatly and exactly
the little piece left uncut in the corner was mown in five minutes
the last of the mowers were just ending their rows while the foremost snatched up their coats onto their shoulders  and crossed the road towards mashkin upland
the sun was already sinking into the trees when they went with their jingling dippers into the wooded ravine of anna karenina 557 of 1759 mashkin upland
the grass was up to their waists in the middle of the hollow  soft  tender  and feathery  spotted here and there among the trees with wild heart s ease
after a brief consultation whether to take the rows lengthwise or diagonally prohor yermilin  also a renowned mower  a huge  black haired peasant  went on ahead
he went up to the top  turned back again and started mowing  and they all proceeded to form in line behind him  going downhill through the hollow and uphill right up to the edge of the forest
the sun sank behind the forest
the dew was falling by now  the mowers were in the sun only on the hillside  but below  where a mist was rising  and on the opposite side  they mowed into the fresh  dewy shade
the work went rapidly
the grass cut with a juicy sound  and was at once laid in high  fragrant rows
the mowers from all sides  brought closer together in the short row  kept urging one another on to the sound of jingling dipper and clanging scythes  and the hiss of the whetstones sharpening them  and good humored shouts
levin still kept between the young peasant and the old man
the old man  who had put on his short sheepskin jacket  was just as good humored  jocose  and free in his movements
among the trees they were continually anna karenina 558 of 1759 cutting with their scythes the so called  birch mushrooms   swollen fat in the succulent grass but the old man bent down every time he came across a mushroom  picked it up and put it in his bosom
 another present for my old woman   he said as he did so
easy as it was to mow the wet  soft grass  it was hard work going up and down the steep sides of the ravine
but this did not trouble the old man
swinging his scythe just as ever  and moving his feet in their big  plaited shoes with firm  little steps  he climbed slowly up the steep place  and though his breeches hanging out below his smock  and his whole frame trembled with effort  he did not miss one blade of grass or one mushroom on his way  and kept making jokes with the peasants and levin
levin walked after him and often thought he must fall  as he climbed with a scythe up a steep cliff where it would have been hard work to clamber without anything
but he climbed up and did what he had to do
he felt as though some external force were moving him
anna karenina 559 of 1759 mashkin upland was mown  the last row finished  the peasants had put on their coats and were gaily trudging home
levin got on his horse and  parting regretfully from the peasants  rode homewards
on the hillside he looked back  he could not see them in the mist that had risen from the valley  he could only hear rough  good humored voices  laughter  and the sound of clanking scythes
sergey ivanovitch had long ago finished dinner  and was drinking iced lemon and water in his own room  looking through the reviews and papers which he had only just received by post  when levin rushed into the room  talking merrily  with his wet and matted hair sticking to his forehead  and his back and chest grimed and moist
 we mowed the whole meadow  oh  it is nice  delicious  and how have you been getting on   said levin  completely forgetting the disagreeable conversation of the previous day
 mercy  what do you look like   said sergey ivanovitch  for the first moment looking round with some anna karenina 560 of 1759 dissatisfaction
 and the door  do shut the door   he cried
 you must have let in a dozen at least   sergey ivanovitch could not endure flies  and in his own room he never opened the window except at night  and carefully kept the door shut
 not one  on my honor
but if i have  i ll catch them
you wouldn t believe what a pleasure it is  how have you spent the day    very well
but have you really been mowing the whole day  i expect you re as hungry as a wolf
kouzma has got everything ready for you    no  i don t feel hungry even
i had something to eat there
but i ll go and wash    yes  go along  go along  and i ll come to you directly   said sergey ivanovitch  shaking his head as he looked at his brother
 go along  make haste   he added smiling  and gathering up his books  he prepared to go too
he  too  felt suddenly good humored and disinclined to leave his brother s side
 but what did you do while it was raining    rain  why  there was scarcely a drop
i ll come directly
so you had a nice day too  that s first rate   and levin went off to change his clothes
five minutes later the brothers met in the dining room
although it seemed to levin that he was not hungry  and anna karenina 561 of 1759 he sat down to dinner simply so as not to hurt kouzma s feelings  yet when he began to eat the dinner struck him as extraordinarily good
sergey ivanovitch watched him with a smile
 oh  by the way  there s a letter for you   said he
 kouzma  bring it down  please
and mind you shut the doors   the letter was from oblonsky
levin read it aloud
oblonsky wrote to him from petersburg   i have had a letter from dolly  she s at ergushovo  and everything seems going wrong there do ride over and see her  please  help her with advice  you know all about it
she will be so glad to see you
she s quite alone  poor thing
my mother in law and all of them are still abroad    that s capital  i will certainly ride over to her   said levin
 or we ll go together
she s such a splendid woman  isn t she    they re not far from here  then    twenty five miles
or perhaps it is thirty
but a capital road
capital  we ll drive over    i shall be delighted   said sergey ivanovitch  still smiling
the sight of his younger brother s appearance had immediately put him in a good humor
anna karenina 562 of 1759  well  you have an appetite   he said  looking at his dark red  sunburnt face and neck bent over the plate
 splendid  you can t imagine what an effectual remedy it is for every sort of foolishness
i want to enrich medicine with a new word  arbeitskur    well  but you don t need it  i should fancy    no  but for all sorts of nervous invalids    yes  it ought to be tried
i had meant to come to the mowing to look at you  but it was so unbearably hot that i got no further than the forest
i sat there a little  and went on by the forest to the village  met your old nurse  and sounded her as to the peasants  view of you
as far as i can make out  they don t approve of this
she said   it s not a gentleman s work   altogether  i fancy that in the people s ideas there are very clear and definite notions of certain  as they call it   gentlemanly  lines of action
and they don t sanction the gentry s moving outside bounds clearly laid down in their ideas    maybe so  but anyway it s a pleasure such as i have never known in my life
and there s no harm in it  you know
is there   answered levin
 i can t help it if they don t like it
though i do believe it s all right
eh    altogether   pursued sergey ivanovitch   you re satisfied with your day   anna karenina 563 of 1759  quite satisfied
we cut the whole meadow
and such a splendid old man i made friends with there  you can t fancy how delightful he was    well  so you re content with your day
and so am i
first  i solved two chess problems  and one a very pretty one a pawn opening i ll show it you
and then i thought over our conversation yesterday    eh  our conversation yesterday   said levin  blissfully dropping his eyelids and drawing deep breaths after finishing his dinner  and absolutely incapable of recalling what their conversation yesterday was about
 i think you are partly right
our difference of opinion amounts to this  that you make the mainspring selfinterest  while i suppose that interest in the common weal is bound to exist in every man of a certain degree of advancement
possibly you are right too  that action founded on material interest would be more desirable
you are altogether  as the french say  too primesautiere a nature  you must have intense  energetic action  or nothing   levin listened to his brother and did not understand a single word  and did not want to understand
he was only afraid his brother might ask him some question which would make it evident he had not heard
anna karenina 564 of 1759  so that s what i think it is  my dear boy   said sergey ivanovitch  touching him on the shoulder
 yes  of course
but  do you know  i won t stand up for my view   answered levin  with a guilty  childlike smile
 whatever was it i was disputing about   he wondered
 of course  i m right  and he s right  and it s all first rate
only i must go round to the counting house and see to things   he got up  stretching and smiling sergey ivanovitch smiled too
 if you want to go out  let s go together   he said  disinclined to be parted from his brother  who seemed positively breathing out freshness and energy
 come  we ll go to the counting house  if you have to go there    oh  heavens   shouted levin  so loudly that sergey ivanovitch was quite frightened
 what  what is the matter    how s agafea mihalovna s hand   said levin  slapping himself on the head  i d positively forgotten her even    it s much better    well  anyway i ll run down to her
before you ve time to get your hat on  i ll be back   and he ran downstairs  clattering with his heels like a spring rattle
anna karenina 565 of 1759 stephan arkadyevitch had gone to petersburg to perform the most natural and essential official duty so familiar to everyone in the government service  though incomprehensible to outsiders  that duty  but for which one could hardly be in government service  of reminding the ministry of his existence and having  for the due performance of this rite  taken all the available cash from home  was gaily and agreeably spending his days at the races and in the summer villas
meanwhile dolly and the children had moved into the country  to cut down expenses as much as possible
she had gone to ergushovo  the estate that had been her dowry  and the one where in spring the forest had been sold
it was nearly forty miles from levin s pokrovskoe
the big  old house at ergushovo had been pulled down long ago  and the old prince had had the lodge done up and built on to
twenty years before  when dolly was a child  the lodge had been roomy and comfortable  though  like all lodges  it stood sideways to the entrance avenue  and faced the south
but by now this lodge was old and dilapidated
when stepan arkadyevitch had gone down in the spring to sell the anna karenina 566 of 1759 forest  dolly had begged him to look over the house and order what repairs might be needed
stepan arkadyevitch  like all unfaithful husbands indeed  was very solicitous for his wife s comfort  and he had himself looked over the house  and given instructions about everything that he considered necessary what he considered necessary was to cover all the furniture with cretonne  to put up curtains  to weed the garden  to make a little bridge on the pond  and to plant flowers
but he forgot many other essential matters  the want of which greatly distressed darya alexandrovna later on
in spite of stepan arkadyevitch s efforts to be an attentive father and husband  he never could keep in his mind that he had a wife and children
he had bachelor tastes  and it was in accordance with them that he shaped his life
on his return to moscow he informed his wife with pride that everything was ready  that the house would be a little paradise  and that he advised her most certainly to go
his wife s staying away in the country was very agreeable to stepan arkadyevitch from every point of view  it did the children good  it decreased expenses  and it left him more at liberty
darya alexandrovna regarded staying in the country for the summer as essential for the children  especially for the little girl  who had not anna karenina 567 of 1759 succeeded in regaining her strength after the scarlatina  and also as a means of escaping the petty humiliations  the little bills owing to the wood merchant  the fishmonger  the shoemaker  which made her miserable
besides this  she was pleased to go away to the country because she was dreaming of getting her sister kitty to stay with her there
kitty was to be back from abroad in the middle of the summer  and bathing had been prescribed for her
kitty wrote that no prospect was so alluring as to spend the summer with dolly at ergushovo  full of childish associations for both of them
the first days of her existence in the country were very hard for dolly
she used to stay in the country as a child  and the impression she had retained of it was that the country was a refuge from all the unpleasantness of the town  that life there  though not luxurious dolly could easily make up her mind to that was cheap and comfortable  that there was plenty of everything  everything was cheap  everything could be got  and children were happy
but now coming to the country as the head of a family  she perceived that it was all utterly unlike what she had fancied
the day after their arrival there was a heavy fall of rain and in the night the water came through in the corridor anna karenina 568 of 1759 and in the nursery  so that the beds had to be carried into the drawing room
there was no kitchen maid to be found  of the nine cows  it appeared from the words of the cowherd woman that some were about to calve  others had just calved  others were old  and others again harduddered  there was not butter nor milk enough even for the children
there were no eggs
they could get no fowls  old  purplish  stringy cocks were all they had for roasting and boiling
impossible to get women to scrub the floors all were potato hoeing
driving was out of the question  because one of the horses was restive  and bolted in the shafts
there was no place where they could bathe  the whole of the river bank was trampled by the cattle and open to the road  even walks were impossible  for the cattle strayed into the garden through a gap in the hedge  and there was one terrible bull  who bellowed  and therefore might be expected to gore somebody
there were no proper cupboards for their clothes  what cupboards there were either would not close at all  or burst open whenever anyone passed by them
there were no pots and pans  there was no copper in the washhouse  nor even an ironing board in the maids  room
finding instead of peace and rest all these  from her point of view  fearful calamities  darya alexandrovna was anna karenina 569 of 1759 at first in despair
she exerted herself to the utmost  felt the hopelessness of the position  and was every instant suppressing the tears that started into her eyes
the bailiff  a retired quartermaster  whom stepan arkadyevitch had taken a fancy to and had appointed bailiff on account of his handsome and respectful appearance as a hall porter  showed no sympathy for darya alexandrovna s woes
he said respectfully   nothing can be done  the peasants are such a wretched lot   and did nothing to help her the position seemed hopeless
but in the oblonskys  household  as in all families indeed  there was one inconspicuous but most valuable and useful person  marya philimonovna
she soothed her mistress  assured her that everything would come round (it was her expression  and matvey had borrowed it from her)  and without fuss or hurry proceeded to set to work herself
she had immediately made friends with the bailiff s wife  and on the very first day she drank tea with her and the bailiff under the acacias  and reviewed all the circumstances of the position very soon marya philimonovna had established her club  so to say  under the acacias  and there it was  in this club  consisting of the bailiff s wife  the village elder  and the counting house clerk  that the difficulties of existence were gradually smoothed away  anna karenina 570 of 1759 and in a week s time everything actually had come round
the roof was mended  a kitchen maid was found a crony of the village elder s hens were bought  the cows began giving milk  the garden hedge was stopped up with stakes  the carpenter made a mangle  hooks were put in the cupboards  and they ceased to burst open spontaneously  and an ironing board covered with army cloth was placed across from the arm of a chair to the chest of drawers  and there was a smell of flatirons in the maids  room
 just see  now  and you were quite in despair   said marya philimonovna  pointing to the ironing board
they even rigged up a bathing shed of straw hurdles
lily began to bathe  and darya alexandrovna began to realize  if only in part  her expectations  if not of a peaceful  at least of a comfortable  life in the country
peaceful with six children darya alexandrovna could not be
one would fall ill  another might easily become so  a third would be without something necessary  a fourth would show symptoms of a bad disposition  and so on rare indeed were the brief periods of peace
but these cares and anxieties were for darya alexandrovna the sole happiness possible
had it not been for them  she would have been left alone to brood over her husband who did not love her
and anna karenina 571 of 1759 besides  hard though it was for the mother to bear the dread of illness  the illnesses themselves  and the grief of seeing signs of evil propensities in her children the children themselves were even now repaying her in small joys for her sufferings those joys were so small that they passed unnoticed  like gold in sand  and at bad moments she could see nothing but the pain  nothing but sand  but there were good moments too when she saw nothing but the joy  nothing but gold
now in the solitude of the country  she began to be more and more frequently aware of those joys
often  looking at them  she would make every possible effort to persuade herself that she was mistaken  that she as a mother was partial to her children
all the same  she could not help saying to herself that she had charming children  all six of them in different ways  but a set of children such as is not often to be met with  and she was happy in them  and proud of them
anna karenina 572 of 1759 towards the end of may  when everything had been more or less satisfactorily arranged  she received her husband s answer to her complaints of the disorganized state of things in the country
he wrote begging her forgiveness for not having thought of everything before  and promised to come down at the first chance
this chance did not present itself  and till the beginning of june darya alexandrovna stayed alone in the country
on the sunday in st
peter s week darya alexandrovna drove to mass for all her children to take the sacrament
darya alexandrovna in her intimate  philosophical talks with her sister  her mother  and her friends very often astonished them by the freedom of her views in regard to religion
she had a strange religion of transmigration of souls all her own  in which she had firm faith  troubling herself little about the dogmas of the church
but in her family she was strict in carrying out all that was required by the church and not merely in order to set an example  but with all her heart in it
the fact that the children had not been at the sacrament for nearly a year worried her extremely  and with the full approval and anna karenina 573 of 1759 sympathy of marya philimonovna she decided that this should take place now in the summer
for several days before  darya alexandrovna was busily deliberating on how to dress all the children
frocks were made or altered and washed  seams and flounces were let out  buttons were sewn on  and ribbons got ready one dress  tanya s  which the english governess had undertaken  cost darya alexandrovna much loss of temper
the english governess in altering it had made the seams in the wrong place  had taken up the sleeves too much  and altogether spoilt the dress it was so narrow on tanya s shoulders that it was quite painful to look at her
but marya philimonovna had the happy thought of putting in gussets  and adding a little shoulder cape
the dress was set right  but there was nearly a quarrel with the english governess
on the morning  however  all was happily arranged  and towards ten o clock the time at which they had asked the priest to wait for them for the mass the children in their new dresses  with beaming faces stood on the step before the carriage waiting for their mother
to the carriage  instead of the restive raven  they had harnessed  thanks to the representations of marya philimonovna  the bailiff s horse  brownie  and darya anna karenina 574 of 1759 alexandrovna  delayed by anxiety over her own attire  came out and got in  dressed in a white muslin gown
darya alexandrovna had done her hair  and dressed with care and excitement
in the old days she had dressed for her own sake to look pretty and be admired
later on  as she got older  dress became more and more distasteful to her
she saw that she was losing her good looks
but now she began to feel pleasure and interest in dress again
now she did not dress for her own sake  not for the sake of her own beauty  but simply that as the mother of those exquisite creatures she might not spoil the general effect
and looking at herself for the last time in the looking glass she was satisfied with herself
she looked nice
not nice as she would have wished to look nice in old days at a ball  but nice for the object which she now had in view
in the church there was no one but the peasants  the servants and their women folk
but darya alexandrovna saw  or fancied she saw  the sensation produced by her children and her
the children were not only beautiful to look at in their smart little dresses  but they were charming in the way they behaved
aliosha  it is true  did not stand quite correctly  he kept turning round  trying to look at his little jacket from behind  but all the same he was wonderfully sweet
tanya behaved like a grownup person  anna karenina 575 of 1759 and looked after the little ones
and the smallest  lily  was bewitching in her naive astonishment at everything  and it was difficult not to smile when  after taking the sacrament  she said in english   please  some more   on the way home the children felt that something solemn had happened  and were very sedate
everything went happily at home too  but at lunch grisha began whistling  and  what was worse  was disobedient to the english governess  and was forbidden to have any tart
darya alexandrovna would not have let things go so far on such a day had she been present  but she had to support the english governess s authority  and she upheld her decision that grisha should have no tart
this rather spoiled the general good humor
grisha cried  declaring that nikolinka had whistled too  and he was not punished  and that he wasn t crying for the tart he didn t care but at being unjustly treated
this was really too tragic  and darya alexandrovna made up her mind to persuade the english governess to forgive grisha  and she went to speak to her
but on the way  as she passed the drawing room  she beheld a scene  filling her heart with such pleasure that the tears came into her eyes  and she forgave the delinquent herself
anna karenina 576 of 1759 the culprit was sitting at the window in the corner of the drawing room  beside him was standing tanya with a plate
on the pretext of wanting to give some dinner to her dolls  she had asked the governess s permission to take her share of tart to the nursery  and had taken it instead to her brother
while still weeping over the injustice of his punishment  he was eating the tart  and kept saying through his sobs   eat yourself  let s eat it together   together   tanya had at first been under the influence of her pity for grisha  then of a sense of her noble action  and tears were standing in her eyes too  but she did not refuse  and ate her share
on catching sight of their mother they were dismayed  but  looking into her face  they saw they were not doing wrong
they burst out laughing  and  with their mouths full of tart  they began wiping their smiling lips with their hands  and smearing their radiant faces all over with tears and jam
 mercy  your new white frock  tanya  grisha   said their mother  trying to save the frock  but with tears in her eyes  smiling a blissful  rapturous smile
the new frocks were taken off  and orders were given for the little girls to have their blouses put on  and the anna karenina 577 of 1759 boys their old jackets  and the wagonette to be harnessed  with brownie  to the bailiff s annoyance  again in the shafts  to drive out for mushroom picking and bathing
a roar of delighted shrieks arose in the nursery  and never ceased till they had set off for the bathing place
they gathered a whole basketful of mushrooms  even lily found a birch mushroom it had always happened before that miss hoole found them and pointed them out to her  but this time she found a big one quite of herself  and there was a general scream of delight   lily has found a mushroom   then they reached the river  put the horses under the birch trees  and went to the bathing place
the coachman  terenty  fastened the horses  who kept whisking away the flies  to a tree  and  treading down the grass  lay down in the shade of a birch and smoked his shag  while the neverceasing shrieks of delight of the children floated across to him from the bathing place
though it was hard work to look after all the children and restrain their wild pranks  though it was difficult too to keep in one s head and not mix up all the stockings  little breeches  and shoes for the different legs  and to undo and to do up again all the tapes and buttons  darya alexandrovna  who had always liked bathing herself  and anna karenina 578 of 1759 believed it to be very good for the children  enjoyed nothing so much as bathing with all the children
to go over all those fat little legs  pulling on their stockings  to take in her arms and dip those little naked bodies  and to hear their screams of delight and alarm  to see the breathless faces with wide open  scared  and happy eyes of all her splashing cherubs  was a great pleasure to her when half the children had been dressed  some peasant women in holiday dress  out picking herbs  came up to the bathing shed and stopped shyly
marya philimonovna called one of them and handed her a sheet and a shirt that had dropped into the water for her to dry them  and darya alexandrovna began to talk to the women
at first they laughed behind their hands and did not understand her questions  but soon they grew bolder and began to talk  winning darya alexandrovna s heart at once by the genuine admiration of the children that they showed
 my  what a beauty  as white as sugar   said one  admiring tanitchka  and shaking her head   but thin     yes  she has been ill    and so they ve been bathing you too   said another to the baby
 no  he s only three months old   answered darya alexandrovna with pride
anna karenina 579 of 1759  you don t say so    and have you any children    i ve had four  i ve two living a boy and a girl
i weaned her last carnival    how old is she    why  two years old    why did you nurse her so long    it s our custom  for three fasts    and the conversation became most interesting to darya alexandrovna
what sort of time did she have  what was the matter with the boy  where was her husband  did it often happen  darya alexandrovna felt disinclined to leave the peasant women  so interesting to her was their conversation  so completely identical were all their interests
what pleased her most of all was that she saw clearly what all the women admired more than anything was her having so many children  and such fine ones
the peasant women even made darya alexandrovna laugh  and offended the english governess  because she was the cause of the laughter she did not understand
one of the younger women kept staring at the englishwoman  who was dressing after all the rest  and when she put on her third petticoat she could not refrain from the remark   my  she anna karenina 580 of 1759 keeps putting on and putting on  and she ll never have done   she said  and they all went off into roars
anna karenina 581 of 1759 on the drive home  as darya alexandrovna  with all her children round her  their heads still wet from their bath  and a kerchief tied over her own head  was getting near the house  the coachman said   there s some gentleman coming  the master of pokrovskoe  i do believe   darya alexandrovna peeped out in front  and was delighted when she recognized in the gray hat and gray coat the familiar figure of levin walking to meet them
she was glad to see him at any time  but at this moment she was specially glad he should see her in all her glory
no one was better able to appreciate her grandeur than levin
seeing her  he found himself face to face with one of the pictures of his daydream of family life  you re like a hen with your chickens  darya alexandrovna    ah  how glad i am to see you   she said  holding out her hand to him
anna karenina 582 of 1759  glad to see me  but you didn t let me know
my brother s staying with me
i got a note from stiva that you were here    from stiva   darya alexandrovna asked with surprise
 yes  he writes that you are here  and that he thinks you might allow me to be of use to you   said levin  and as he said it he became suddenly embarrassed  and  stopping abruptly  he walked on in silence by the wagonette  snapping off the buds of the lime trees and nibbling them
he was embarrassed through a sense that darya alexandrovna would be annoyed by receiving from an outsider help that should by rights have come from her own husband
darya alexandrovna certainly did not like this little way of stepan arkadyevitch s of foisting his domestic duties on others
and she was at once aware that levin was aware of this
it was just for this fineness of perception  for this delicacy  that darya alexandrovna liked levin
 i know  of course   said levin   that that simply means that you would like to see me  and i m exceedingly glad
though i can fancy that  used to town housekeeping as you are  you must feel in the wilds here  and if there s anything wanted  i m altogether at your disposal   anna karenina 583 of 1759  oh  no   said dolly
 at first things were rather uncomfortable  but now we ve settled everything capitally  thanks to my old nurse   she said  indicating marya philimonovna  who  seeing that they were speaking of her  smiled brightly and cordially to levin
she knew him  and knew that he would be a good match for her young lady  and was very keen to see the matter settled
 won t you get in  sir  we ll make room this side   she said to him
 no  i ll walk
children  who d like to race the horses with me   the children knew levin very little  and could not remember when they had seen him  but they experienced in regard to him none of that strange feeling of shyness and hostility which children so often experience towards hypocritical  grown up people  and for which they are so often and miserably punished
hypocrisy in anything whatever may deceive the cleverest and most penetrating man  but the least wide awake of children recognizes it  and is revolted by it  however ingeniously it may be disguised
whatever faults levin had  there was not a trace of hypocrisy in him  and so the children showed him the same friendliness that they saw in their mother s face
on his invitation  the two elder ones at once jumped out to him and ran with him as simply as anna karenina 584 of 1759 they would have done with their nurse or miss hoole or their mother
lily  too  began begging to go to him  and her mother handed her to him  he sat her on his shoulder and ran along with her
 don t be afraid  don t be afraid  darya alexandrovna   he said  smiling good humoredly to the mother   there s no chance of my hurting or dropping her   and  looking at his strong  agile  assiduously careful and needlessly wary movements  the mother felt her mind at rest  and smiled gaily and approvingly as she watched him
here  in the country  with children  and with darya alexandrovna  with whom he was in sympathy  levin was in a mood not infrequent with him  of childlike lightheartedness that she particularly liked in him
as he ran with the children  he taught them gymnastic feats  set miss hoole laughing with his queer english accent  and talked to darya alexandrovna of his pursuits in the country
after dinner  darya alexandrovna  sitting alone with him on the balcony  began to speak of kitty
 you know  kitty s coming here  and is going to spend the summer with me    really   he said  flushing  and at once  to change the conversation  he said   then i ll send you two cows  shall anna karenina 585 of 1759 i  if you insist on a bill you shall pay me five roubles a month  but it s really too bad of you    no  thank you
we can manage very well now    oh  well  then  i ll have a look at your cows  and if you ll allow me  i ll give directions about their food
everything depends on their food   and levin  to turn the conversation  explained to darya alexandrovna the theory of cow keeping  based on the principle that the cow is simply a machine for the transformation of food into milk  and so on
he talked of this  and passionately longed to hear more of kitty  and  at the same time  was afraid of hearing it
he dreaded the breaking up of the inward peace he had gained with such effort
 yes  but still all this has to be looked after  and who is there to look after it   darya alexandrovna responded  without interest
she had by now got her household matters so satisfactorily arranged  thanks to marya philimonovna  that she was disinclined to make any change in them  besides  she had no faith in levin s knowledge of farming
general principles  as to the cow being a machine for the production of milk  she looked on with suspicion
it seemed to her that such principles could only be a anna karenina 586 of 1759 hindrance in farm management
it all seemed to her a far simpler matter  all that was needed  as marya philimonovna had explained  was to give brindle and whitebreast more food and drink  and not to let the cook carry all the kitchen slops to the laundry maid s cow
that was clear
but general propositions as to feeding on meal and on grass were doubtful and obscure
and  what was most important  she wanted to talk about kitty
anna karenina 587 of 1759  kitty writes to me that there s nothing she longs for so much as quiet and solitude   dolly said after the silence that had followed
 and how is she better   levin asked in agitation
 thank god  she s quite well again
i never believed her lungs were affected    oh  i m very glad   said levin  and dolly fancied she saw something touching  helpless  in his face as he said this and looked silently into her face
 let me ask you  konstantin dmitrievitch   said darya alexandrovna  smiling her kindly and rather mocking smile   why is it you are angry with kitty    i  i m not angry with her   said levin
 yes  you are angry
why was it you did not come to see us nor them when you were in moscow    darya alexandrovna   he said  blushing up to the roots of his hair   i wonder really that with your kind heart you don t feel this
how it is you feel no pity for me  if nothing else  when you know     what do i know   anna karenina 588 of 1759  you know i made an offer and that i was refused   said levin  and all the tenderness he had been feeling for kitty a minute before was replaced by a feeling of anger for the slight he had suffered
 what makes you suppose i know    because everybody knows it     that s just where you are mistaken  i did not know it  though i had guessed it was so    well  now you know it    all i knew was that something had happened that made her dreadfully miserable  and that she begged me never to speak of it
and if she would not tell me  she would certainly not speak of it to anyone else
but what did pass between you  tell me    i have told you    when was it    when i was at their house the last time    do you know that   said darya alexandrovna   i am awfully  awfully sorry for her
you suffer only from pride      perhaps so   said levin   but    she interrupted him
 but she  poor girl   i am awfully  awfully sorry for her
now i see it all   anna karenina 589 of 1759  well  darya alexandrovna  you must excuse me   he said  getting up
 good bye  darya alexandrovna  till we meet again    no  wait a minute   she said  clutching him by the sleeve
 wait a minute  sit down    please  please  don t let us talk of this   he said  sitting down  and at the same time feeling rise up and stir within his heart a hope he had believed to be buried
 if i did not like you   she said  and tears came into her eyes   if i did not know you  as i do know you

   the feeling that had seemed dead revived more and more  rose up and took possession of levin s heart
 yes  i understand it all now   said darya alexandrovna
 you can t understand it  for you men  who are free and make your own choice  it s always clear whom you love
but a girl s in a position of suspense  with all a woman s or maiden s modesty  a girl who sees you men from afar  who takes everything on trust   a girl may have  and often has  such a feeling that she cannot tell what to say    yes  if the heart does not speak     no  the heart does speak  but just consider  you men have views about a girl  you come to the house  you make friends  you criticize  you wait to see if you have found anna karenina 590 of 1759 what you love  and then  when you are sure you love her  you make an offer      well  that s not quite it    anyway you make an offer  when your love is ripe or when the balance has completely turned between the two you are choosing from
but a girl is not asked
she is expected to make her choice  and yet she cannot choose  she can only answer  yes  or  no     yes  to choose between me and vronsky   thought levin  and the dead thing that had come to life within him died again  and only weighed on his heart and set it aching
 darya alexandrovna   he said   that s how one chooses a new dress or some purchase or other  not love
the choice has been made  and so much the better   
and there can be no repeating it    ah  pride  pride   said darya alexandrovna  as though despising him for the baseness of this feeling in comparison with that other feeling which only women know
 at the time when you made kitty an offer she was just in a position in which she could not answer
she was in doubt
doubt between you and vronsky
him she was seeing every day  and you she had not seen for a long while
supposing she had been older   i  for instance  in her place anna karenina 591 of 1759 could have felt no doubt
i always disliked him  and so it has turned out   levin recalled kitty s answer
she had said   no  that cannot be     darya alexandrovna   he said dryly   i appreciate your confidence in me  i believe you are making a mistake
but whether i am right or wrong  that pride you so despise makes any thought of katerina alexandrovna out of the question for me   you understand  utterly out of the question    i will only say one thing more  you know that i am speaking of my sister  whom i love as i love my own children
i don t say she cared for you  all i meant to say is that her refusal at that moment proves nothing    i don t know   said levin  jumping up
 if you only knew how you are hurting me
it s just as if a child of yours were dead  and they were to say to you  he would have been like this and like that  and he might have lived  and how happy you would have been in him
but he s dead  dead  dead      how absurd you are   said darya alexandrovna  looking with mournful tenderness at levin s excitement
 yes  i see it all more and more clearly   she went on anna karenina 592 of 1759 musingly
 so you won t come to see us  then  when kitty s here    no  i shan t come
of course i won t avoid meeting katerina alexandrovna  but as far as i can  i will try to save her the annoyance of my presence    you are very  very absurd   repeated darya alexandrovna  looking with tenderness into his face
 very well then  let it be as though we had not spoken of this
what have you come for  tanya   she said in french to the little girl who had come in
 where s my spade  mamma    i speak french  and you must too   the little girl tried to say it in french  but could not remember the french for spade  the mother prompted her  and then told her in french where to look for the spade
and this made a disagreeable impression on levin
everything in darya alexandrovna s house and children struck him now as by no means so charming as a little while before
 and what does she talk french with the children for   he thought   how unnatural and false it is  and the children feel it so  learning french and unlearning sincerity   he thought to himself  unaware that darya alexandrovna had thought all that over twenty times already  and yet  even at the cost of some loss of anna karenina 593 of 1759 sincerity  believed it necessary to teach her children french in that way  but why are you going  do stay a little   levin stayed to tea  but his good humor had vanished  and he felt ill at ease
after tea he went out into the hall to order his horses to be put in  and  when he came back  he found darya alexandrovna greatly disturbed  with a troubled face  and tears in her eyes
while levin had been outside  an incident had occurred which had utterly shattered all the happiness she had been feeling that day  and her pride in her children
grisha and tanya had been fighting over a ball
darya alexandrovna  hearing a scream in the nursery  ran in and saw a terrible sight
tanya was pulling grisha s hair  while he  with a face hideous with rage  was beating her with his fists wherever he could get at her
something snapped in darya alexandrovna s heart when she saw this
it was as if darkness had swooped down upon her life  she felt that these children of hers  that she was so proud of  were not merely most ordinary  but positively bad  ill bred children  with coarse  brutal propensities wicked children
she could not talk or think of anything else  and she could not speak to levin of her misery
anna karenina 594 of 1759 levin saw she was unhappy and tried to comfort her  saying that it showed nothing bad  that all children fight  but  even as he said it  he was thinking in his heart   no  i won t be artificial and talk french with my children  but my children won t be like that
all one has to do is not spoil children  not to distort their nature  and they ll be delightful
no  my children won t be like that   he said good bye and drove away  and she did not try to keep him
anna karenina 595 of 1759 in the middle of july the elder of the village on levin s sister s estate  about fifteen miles from pokrovskoe  came to levin to report on how things were going there and on the hay
the chief source of income on his sister s estate was from the riverside meadows
in former years the hay had been bought by the peasants for twenty roubles the three acres
when levin took over the management of the estate  he thought on examining the grasslands that they were worth more  and he fixed the price at twenty five roubles the three acres
the peasants would not give that price  and  as levin suspected  kept off other purchasers
then levin had driven over himself  and arranged to have the grass cut  partly by hired labor  partly at a payment of a certain proportion of the crop his own peasants put every hindrance they could in the way of this new arrangement  but it was carried out  and the first year the meadows had yielded a profit almost double
the previous year which was the third year the peasants had maintained the same opposition to the arrangement  and the hay had been cut on the same system
this year the peasants were doing all the mowing for a third of the hay crop  and the village anna karenina 596 of 1759 elder had come now to announce that the hay had been cut  and that  fearing rain  they had invited the countinghouse clerk over  had divided the crop in his presence  and had raked together eleven stacks as the owner s share
from the vague answers to his question how much hay had been cut on the principal meadow  from the hurry of the village elder who had made the division  not asking leave  from the whole tone of the peasant  levin perceived that there was something wrong in the division of the hay  and made up his mind to drive over himself to look into the matter arriving for dinner at the village  and leaving his horse at the cottage of an old friend of his  the husband of his brother s wet nurse  levin went to see the old man in his bee house  wanting to find out from him the truth about the hay
parmenitch  a talkative  comely old man  gave levin a very warm welcome  showed him all he was doing  told him everything about his bees and the swarms of that year  but gave vague and unwilling answers to levin s inquiries about the mowing this confirmed levin still more in his suspicions
he went to the hay fields and examined the stacks
the haystacks could not possibly contain fifty wagon loads each  and to convict the peasants levin ordered the wagons that had carried the hay to be anna karenina 597 of 1759 brought up directly  to lift one stack  and carry it into the barn
there turned out to be only thirty two loads in the stack
in spite of the village elder s assertions about the compressibility of hay  and its having settled down in the stacks  and his swearing that everything had been done in the fear of god  levin stuck to his point that the hay had been divided without his orders  and that  therefore  he would not accept that hay as fifty loads to a stack
after a prolonged dispute the matter was decided by the peasants taking these eleven stacks  reckoning them as fifty loads each
the arguments and the division of the haycocks lasted the whole afternoon
when the last of the hay had been divided  levin  intrusting the superintendence of the rest to the counting house clerk  sat down on a haycock marked off by a stake of willow  and looked admiringly at the meadow swarming with peasants
in front of him  in the bend of the river beyond the marsh  moved a bright colored line of peasant women  and the scattered hay was being rapidly formed into gray winding rows over the pale green stubble
after the women came the men with pitchforks  and from the gray rows there were growing up broad  high  soft haycocks
to the left  carts were rumbling over the meadow that had been already cleared  and one after another the haycocks anna karenina 598 of 1759 vanished  flung up in huge forkfuls  and in their place there were rising heavy cartloads of fragrant hay hanging over the horses  hind quarters
 what weather for haying  what hay it ll be   said an old man  squatting down beside levin
 it s tea  not hay  it s like scattering grain to the ducks  the way they pick it up   he added  pointing to the growing haycocks
 since dinnertime they ve carried a good half of it    the last load  eh   he shouted to a young peasant  who drove by  standing in the front of an empty cart  shaking the cord reins
 the last  dad   the lad shouted back  pulling in the horse  and  smiling  he looked round at a bright  rosychecked peasant girl who sat in the cart smiling too  and drove on
 who s that  your son   asked levin
 my baby   said the old man with a tender smile
 what a fine fellow    the lad s all right    married already    yes  it s two years last st
philip s day    any children    children indeed  why  for over a year he was innocent as a babe himself  and bashful too   answered the anna karenina 599 of 1759 old man  well  the hay  it s as fragrant as tea   he repeated  wishing to change the subject
levin looked more attentively at ivan parmenov and his wife
they were loading a haycock onto the cart not far from him
ivan parmenov was standing on the cart  taking  laying in place  and stamping down the huge bundles of hay  which his pretty young wife deftly handed up to him  at first in armfuls  and then on the pitchfork
the young wife worked easily  merrily  and dexterously
the close packed hay did not once break away off her fork
first she gathered it together  stuck the fork into it  then with a rapid  supple movement leaned the whole weight of her body on it  and at once with a bend of her back under the red belt she drew herself up  and arching her full bosom under the white smock  with a smart turn swung the fork in her arms  and flung the bundle of hay high onto the cart ivan  obviously doing his best to save her every minute of unnecessary labor  made haste  opening his arms to clutch the bundle and lay it in the cart as she raked together what was left of the hay  the young wife shook off the bits of hay that had fallen on her neck  and straightening the red kerchief that had dropped forward over her white brow  not browned like her face by the sun  she crept under the cart to tie up the load
anna karenina 600 of 1759 ivan directed her how to fasten the cord to the crosspiece  and at something she said he laughed aloud
in the expressions of both faces was to be seen vigorous  young  freshly awakened love
anna karenina 601 of 1759 the load was tied on
ivan jumped down and took the quiet  sleek horse by the bridle
the young wife flung the rake up on the load  and with a bold step  swinging her arms  she went to join the women  who were forming a ring for the haymakers  dance ivan drove off to the road and fell into line with the other loaded carts
the peasant women  with their rakes on their shoulders  gay with bright flowers  and chattering with ringing  merry voices  walked behind the hay cart
one wild untrained female voice broke into a song  and sang it alone through a verse  and then the same verse was taken up and repeated by half a hundred strong healthy voices  of all sorts  coarse and fine  singing in unison
the women  all singing  began to come close to levin  and he felt as though a storm were swooping down upon him with a thunder of merriment
the storm swooped down  enveloped him and the haycock on which he was lying  and the other haycocks  and the wagon loads  and the whole meadow and distant fields all seemed to be shaking and singing to the measures of this wild merry song with its shouts and whistles and clapping
levin felt anna karenina 602 of 1759 envious of this health and mirthfulness  he longed to take part in the expression of this joy of life
but he could do nothing  and had to lie and look on and listen
when the peasants  with their singing  had vanished out of sight and hearing  a weary feeling of despondency at his own isolation  his physical inactivity  his alienation from this world  came over levin
some of the very peasants who had been most active in wrangling with him over the hay  some whom he had treated with contumely  and who had tried to cheat him  those very peasants had greeted him goodhumoredly  and evidently had not  were incapable of having any feeling of rancor against him  any regret  any recollection even of having tried to deceive him
all that was drowned in a sea of merry common labor
god gave the day  god gave the strength
and the day and the strength were consecrated to labor  and that labor was its own reward
for whom the labor  what would be its fruits  these were idle considerations  beside the point
often levin had admired this life  often he had a sense of envy of the men who led this life  but today for the first time  especially under the influence of what he had seen in the attitude of ivan parmenov to his young wife  the idea presented itself definitely to his mind that it was in his anna karenina 603 of 1759 power to exchange the dreary  artificial  idle  and individualistic life he was leading for this laborious  pure  and socially delightful life
the old man who had been sitting beside him had long ago gone home  the people had all separated
those who lived near had gone home  while those who came from far were gathered into a group for supper  and to spend the night in the meadow
levin  unobserved by the peasants  still lay on the haycock  and still looked on and listened and mused
the peasants who remained for the night in the meadow scarcely slept all the short summer night
at first there was the sound of merry talk and laughing all together over the supper  then singing again and laughter
all the long day of toil had left no trace in them but lightness of heart
before the early dawn all was hushed
nothing was to be heard but the night sounds of the frogs that never ceased in the marsh  and the horses snorting in the mist that rose over the meadow before the morning
rousing himself  levin got up from the haycock  and looking at the stars  he saw that the night was over  well  what am i going to do  how am i to set about it   he said to himself  trying to express to himself all the thoughts and feelings he had passed through in that brief night all the thoughts and feelings he had passed through anna karenina 604 of 1759 fell into three separate trains of thought
one was the renunciation of his old life  of his utterly useless education
this renunciation gave him satisfaction  and was easy and simple
another series of thoughts and mental images related to the life he longed to live now
the simplicity  the purity  the sanity of this life he felt clearly  and he was convinced he would find in it the content  the peace  and the dignity  of the lack of which he was so miserably conscious
but a third series of ideas turned upon the question how to effect this transition from the old life to the new
and there nothing took clear shape for him
 have a wife  have work and the necessity of work  leave pokrovskoe  buy land  become a member of a peasant community  marry a peasant girl  how am i to set about it   he asked himself again  and could not find an answer  i haven t slept all night  though  and i can t think it out clearly   he said to himself  i ll work it out later
one thing s certain  this night has decided my fate
all my old dreams of home life were absurd  not the real thing   he told himself  it s all ever so much simpler and better     how beautiful   he thought  looking at the strange  as it were  mother of pearl shell of white fleecy cloudless resting right over his head in the middle of the sky
 how exquisite it all is in this exquisite night  and when was anna karenina 605 of 1759 there time for that cloud shell to form  just now i looked at the sky  and there was nothing in it only two white streaks
yes  and so imperceptibly too my views of life changed   he went out of the meadow and walked along the highroad towards the village
a slight wind arose  and the sky looked gray and sullen
the gloomy moment had come that usually precedes the dawn  the full triumph of light over darkness
shrinking from the cold  levin walked rapidly  looking at the ground
 what s that  someone coming   he thought  catching the tinkle of bells  and lifting his head
forty paces from him a carriage with four horses harnessed abreast was driving towards him along the grassy road on which he was walking
the shaft horses were tilted against the shafts by the ruts  but the dexterous driver sitting on the box held the shaft over the ruts  so that the wheels ran on the smooth part of the road
this was all levin noticed  and without wondering who it could be  he gazed absently at the coach
in the coach was an old lady dozing in one corner  and at the window  evidently only just awake  sat a young girl holding in both hands the ribbons of a white cap
with a face full of light and thought  full of a subtle  complex anna karenina 606 of 1759 inner life  that was remote from levin  she was gazing beyond him at the glow of the sunrise
at the very instant when this apparition was vanishing  the truthful eyes glanced at him
she recognized him  and her face lighted up with wondering delight
he could not be mistaken
there were no other eyes like those in the world
there was only one creature in the world that could concentrate for him all the brightness and meaning of life
it was she
it was kitty
he understood that she was driving to ergushovo from the railway station
and everything that had been stirring levin during that sleepless night  all the resolutions he had made  all vanished at once
he recalled with horror his dreams of marrying a peasant girl there only  in the carriage that had crossed over to the other side of the road  and was rapidly disappearing  there only could he find the solution of the riddle of his life  which had weighed so agonizingly upon him of late
she did not look out again
the sound of the carriagesprings was no longer audible  the bells could scarcely be heard
the barking of dogs showed the carriage had reached the village  and all that was left was the empty fields all round  the village in front  and he himself isolated anna karenina 607 of 1759 and apart from it all  wandering lonely along the deserted highroad he glanced at the sky  expecting to find there the cloud shell he had been admiring and taking as the symbol of the ideas and feelings of that night
there was nothing in the sky in the least like a shell
there  in the remote heights above  a mysterious change had been accomplished
there was no trace of shell  and there was stretched over fully half the sky an even cover of tiny and ever tinier cloudlets the sky had grown blue and bright  and with the same softness  but with the same remoteness  it met his questioning gaze
 no   he said to himself   however good that life of simplicity and toil may be  i cannot go back to it i love her   anna karenina 608 of 1759 none but those who were most intimate with alexey alexandrovitch knew that  while on the surface the coldest and most reasonable of men  he had one weakness quite opposed to the general trend of his character
alexey alexandrovitch could not hear or see a child or woman crying without being moved
the sight of tears threw him into a state of nervous agitation  and he utterly lost all power of reflection
the chief secretary of his department and his private secretary were aware of this  and used to warn women who came with petitions on no account to give way to tears  if they did not want to ruin their chances
 he will get angry  and will not listen to you   they used to say
and as a fact  in such cases the emotional disturbance set up in alexey alexandrovitch by the sight of tears found expression in hasty anger
 i can do nothing
kindly leave the room   he would commonly cry in such cases
when returning from the races anna had informed him of her relations with vronsky  and immediately afterwards had burst into tears  hiding her face in her hands  alexey alexandrovitch  for all the fury aroused in him against her  anna karenina 609 of 1759 was aware at the same time of a rush of that emotional disturbance always produced in him by tears
conscious of it  and conscious that any expression of his feelings at that minute would be out of keeping with the position  he tried to suppress every manifestation of life in himself  and so neither stirred nor looked at her this was what had caused that strange expression of deathlike rigidity in his face which had so impressed anna
when they reached the house he helped her to get out of the carriage  and making an effort to master himself  took leave of her with his usual urbanity  and uttered that phrase that bound him to nothing  he said that tomorrow he would let her know his decision his wife s words  confirming his worst suspicions  had sent a cruel pang to the heart of alexey alexandrovitch
that pang was intensified by the strange feeling of physical pity for her set up by her tears
but when he was all alone in the carriage alexey alexandrovitch  to his surprise and delight  felt complete relief both from this pity and from the doubts and agonies of jealousy
he experienced the sensations of a man who has had a tooth out after suffering long from toothache
after a fearful agony and a sense of something huge  bigger than the head itself  being torn out of his jaw  the sufferer  anna karenina 610 of 1759 hardly able to believe in his own good luck  feels all at once that what has so long poisoned his existence and enchained his attention  exists no longer  and that he can live and think again  and take interest in other things besides his tooth
this feeling alexey alexandrovitch was experiencing
the agony had been strange and terrible  but now it was over  he felt that he could live again and think of something other than his wife
 no honor  no heart  no religion  a corrupt woman
i always knew it and always saw it  though i tried to deceive myself to spare her   he said to himself and it actually seemed to him that he always had seen it  he recalled incidents of their past life  in which he had never seen anything wrong before now these incidents proved clearly that she had always been a corrupt woman
 i made a mistake in linking my life to hers  but there was nothing wrong in my mistake  and so i cannot be unhappy
it s not i that am to blame   he told himself   but she but i have nothing to do with her
she does not exist for me    everything relating to her and her son  towards whom his sentiments were as much changed as towards her  ceased to interest him
the only thing that interested him now was the question of in what way he could best  with most propriety and comfort for himself  and thus with anna karenina 611 of 1759 most justice  extricate himself from the mud with which she had spattered him in her fall  and then proceed along his path of active  honorable  and useful existence  i cannot be made unhappy by the fact that a contemptible woman has committed a crime
i have only to find the best way out of the difficult position in which she has placed me
and i shall find it   he said to himself  frowning more and more  i m not the first nor the last   and to say nothing of historical instances dating from the  fair helen  of menelaus  recently revived in the memory of all  a whole list of contemporary examples of husbands with unfaithful wives in the highest society rose before alexey alexandrovitch s imagination
 daryalov  poltavsky  prince karibanov  count paskudin  dram   
yes  even dram  such an honest  capable fellow   semyonov  tchagin  sigonin   alexey alexandrovitch remembered
 admitting that a certain quite irrational ridicule falls to the lot of these men  yet i never saw anything but a misfortune in it  and always felt sympathy for it   alexey alexandrovitch said to himself  though indeed this was not the fact  and he had never felt sympathy for misfortunes of that kind  but the more frequently he had heard of instances of unfaithful wives betraying their husbands  the more highly he had thought anna karenina 612 of 1759 of himself  it is a misfortune which may befall anyone
and this misfortune has befallen me
the only thing to be done is to make the best of the position   and he began passing in review the methods of proceeding of men who had been in the same position that he was in
 daryalov fought a duel     the duel had particularly fascinated the thoughts of alexey alexandrovitch in his youth  just because he was physically a coward  and was himself well aware of the fact alexey alexandrovitch could not without horror contemplate the idea of a pistol aimed at himself  and never made use of any weapon in his life this horror had in his youth set him pondering on dueling  and picturing himself in a position in which he would have to expose his life to danger having attained success and an established position in the world  he had long ago forgotten this feeling  but the habitual bent of feeling reasserted itself  and dread of his own cowardice proved even now so strong that alexey alexandrovitch spent a long while thinking over the question of dueling in all its aspects  and hugging the idea of a duel  though he was fully aware beforehand that he would never under any circumstances fight one anna karenina 613 of 1759  there s no doubt our society is still so barbarous (it s not the same in england) that very many  and among these were those whose opinion alexey alexandrovitch particularly valued  look favorably on the duel  but what result is attained by it  suppose i call him out   alexey alexandrovitch went on to himself  and vividly picturing the night he would spend after the challenge  and the pistol aimed at him  he shuddered  and knew that he never would do it  suppose i call him out suppose i am taught   he went on musing   to shoot  i press the trigger   he said to himself  closing his eyes   and it turns out i have killed him   alexey alexandrovitch said to himself  and he shook his head as though to dispel such silly ideas  what sense is there in murdering a man in order to define one s relation to a guilty wife and son  i should still just as much have to decide what i ought to do with her
but what is more probable and what would doubtless occur i should be killed or wounded
i  the innocent person  should be the victim killed or wounded
it s even more senseless
but apart from that  a challenge to fight would be an act hardly honest on my side
don t i know perfectly well that my friends would never allow me to fight a duel  would never allow the life of a statesman  needed by russia  to be exposed to danger  knowing perfectly well anna karenina 614 of 1759 beforehand that the matter would never come to real danger  it would amount to my simply trying to gain a certain sham reputation by such a challenge
that would be dishonest  that would be false  that would be deceiving myself and others
a duel is quite irrational  and no one expects it of me
my aim is simply to safeguard my reputation  which is essential for the uninterrupted pursuit of my public duties   official duties  which had always been of great consequence in alexey alexandrovitch s eyes  seemed of special importance to his mind at this moment
considering and rejecting the duel  alexey alexandrovitch turned to divorce another solution selected by several of the husbands he remembered
passing in mental review all the instances he knew of divorces (there were plenty of them in the very highest society with which he was very familiar)  alexey alexandrovitch could not find a single example in which the object of divorce was that which he had in view
in all these instances the husband had practically ceded or sold his unfaithful wife  and the very party which  being in fault  had not the right to contract a fresh marriage  had formed counterfeit  pseudo matrimonial ties with a selfstyled husband
in his own case  alexey alexandrovitch saw that a legal divorce  that is to say  one in which only anna karenina 615 of 1759 the guilty wife would be repudiated  was impossible of attainment
he saw that the complex conditions of the life they led made the coarse proofs of his wife s guilt  required by the law  out of the question  he saw that a certain refinement in that life would not admit of such proofs being brought forward  even if he had them  and that to bring forward such proofs would damage him in the public estimation more than it would her
an attempt at divorce could lead to nothing but a public scandal  which would be a perfect godsend to his enemies for calumny and attacks on his high position in society
his chief object  to define the position with the least amount of disturbance possible  would not be attained by divorce either
moreover  in the event of divorce  or even of an attempt to obtain a divorce  it was obvious that the wife broke off all relations with the husband and threw in her lot with the lover
and in spite of the complete  as he supposed  contempt and indifference he now felt for his wife  at the bottom of his heart  alexey alexandrovitch still had one feeling left in regard to her a disinclination to see her free to throw in her lot with vronsky  so that her crime would be to her advantage
the mere notion of this so exasperated alexey alexandrovitch  that directly it rose to his mind he anna karenina 616 of 1759 groaned with inward agony  and got up and changed his place in the carriage  and for a long while after  he sat with scowling brows  wrapping his numbed and bony legs in the fleecy rug
 apart from formal divorce  one might still do like karibanov  paskudin  and that good fellow dram that is  separate from one s wife   he went on thinking  when he had regained his composure
but this step too presented the same drawback of public scandal as a divorce  and what was more  a separation  quite as much as a regular divorce  flung his wife into the arms of vronsky  no  it s out of the question  out of the question   he said again  twisting his rug about him again
 i cannot be unhappy  but neither she nor he ought to be happy   the feeling of jealousy  which had tortured him during the period of uncertainty  had passed away at the instant when the tooth had been with agony extracted by his wife s words
but that feeling had been replaced by another  the desire  not merely that she should not be triumphant  but that she should get due punishment for her crime
he did not acknowledge this feeling  but at the bottom of his heart he longed for her to suffer for having destroyed his peace of mind his honor
and going once again over the conditions inseparable from a duel  a anna karenina 617 of 1759 divorce  a separation  and once again rejecting them  alexey alexandrovitch felt convinced that there was only one solution  to keep her with him  concealing what had happened from the world  and using every measure in his power to break off the intrigue  and still more though this he did not admit to himself to punish her  i must inform her of my conclusion  that thinking over the terrible position in which she has placed her family  all other solutions will be worse for both sides than an external status quo  and that such i agree to retain  on the strict condition of obedience on her part to my wishes  that is to say  cessation of all intercourse with her lover   when this decision had been finally adopted  another weighty consideration occurred to alexey alexandrovitch in support of it
 by such a course only shall i be acting in accordance with the dictates of religion   he told himself  in adopting this course  i am not casting off a guilty wife  but giving her a chance of amendment  and  indeed  difficult as the task will be to me  i shall devote part of my energies to her reformation and salvation   though alexey alexandrovitch was perfectly aware that he could not exert any moral influence over his wife  that such an attempt at reformation could lead to nothing anna karenina 618 of 1759 but falsity  though in passing through these difficult moments he had not once thought of seeking guidance in religion  yet now  when his conclusion corresponded  as it seemed to him  with the requirements of religion  this religious sanction to his decision gave him complete satisfaction  and to some extent restored his peace of mind
he was pleased to think that  even in such an important crisis in life  no one would be able to say that he had not acted in accordance with the principles of that religion whose banner he had always held aloft amid the general coolness and indifference
as he pondered over subsequent developments  alexey alexandrovitch did not see  indeed  why his relations with his wife should not remain practically the same as before
no doubt  she could never regain his esteem  but there was not  and there could not be  any sort of reason that his existence should be troubled  and that he should suffer because she was a bad and faithless wife
 yes  time will pass  time  which arranges all things  and the old relations will be reestablished   alexey alexandrovitch told himself   so far reestablished  that is  that i shall not be sensible of a break in the continuity of my life she is bound to be unhappy  but i am not to blame  and so i cannot be unhappy   anna karenina 619 of 1759 as he neared petersburg  alexey alexandrovitch not only adhered entirely to his decision  but was even composing in his head the letter he would write to his wife
going into the porter s room  alexey alexandrovitch glanced at the letters and papers brought from his office  and directed that they should be brought to him in his study
 the horses can be taken out and i will see no one   he said in answer to the porter  with a certain pleasure  indicative of his agreeable frame of mind  emphasizing the words   see no one   in his study alexey alexandrovitch walked up and down twice  and stopped at an immense writing table  on which six candles had already been lighted by the valet who had preceded him
he cracked his knuckles and sat down  sorting out his writing appurtenances
putting his elbows on the table  he bent his head on one side  thought a minute  and began to write  without pausing for a second
he wrote without using any form of address to her  and wrote in french  making use of the plural  vous   anna karenina 620 of 1759 which has not the same note of coldness as the corresponding russian form
 at our last conversation  i notified you of my intention to communicate to you my decision in regard to the subject of that conversation
having carefully considered everything  i am writing now with the object of fulfilling that promise
my decision is as follows
whatever your conduct may have been  i do not consider myself justified in breaking the ties in which we are bound by a higher power
the family cannot be broken up by a whim  a caprice  or even by the sin of one of the partners in the marriage  and our life must go on as it has done in the past
this is essential for me  for you  and for our son
i am fully persuaded that you have repented and do repent of what has called forth the present letter  and that you will cooperate with me in eradicating the cause of our estrangement  and forgetting the past
in the contrary event  you can conjecture what awaits you and your son
all this i hope to discuss more in detail in a personal interview
as the season is drawing to a close  i would beg you to return to petersburg as quickly as possible  not later than tuesday
all necessary preparations shall be made for your arrival here
i beg you to note that i attach particular significance to compliance with this request
anna karenina 621 of 1759 a
karenin  p s  i enclose the money which may be needed for your expenses   he read the letter through and felt pleased with it  and especially that he had remembered to enclose money  there was not a harsh word  not a reproach in it  nor was there undue indulgence
most of all  it was a golden bridge for return
folding the letter and smoothing it with a massive ivory knife  and putting it in an envelope with the money  he rang the bell with the gratification it always afforded him to use the well arranged appointments of his writing table
 give this to the courier to be delivered to anna arkadyevna tomorrow at the summer villa   he said  getting up
 certainly  your excellency  tea to be served in the study   alexey alexandrovitch ordered tea to be brought to the study  and playing with the massive paper knife  he moved to his easy chair  near which there had been placed ready for him a lamp and the french work on egyptian hieroglyphics that he had begun
over the easy chair there hung in a gold frame an oval portrait of anna  a fine painting by a celebrated artist
alexey alexandrovitch anna karenina 622 of 1759 glanced at it
the unfathomable eyes gazed ironically and insolently at him
insufferably insolent and challenging was the effect in alexey alexandrovitch s eyes of the black lace about the head  admirably touched in by the painter  the black hair and handsome white hand with one finger lifted  covered with rings
after looking at the portrait for a minute  alexey alexandrovitch shuddered so that his lips quivered and he uttered the sound  brrr   and turned away
he made haste to sit down in his easy chair and opened the book
he tried to read  but he could not revive the very vivid interest he had felt before in egyptian hieroglyphics
he looked at the book and thought of something else
he thought not of his wife  but of a complication that had arisen in his official life  which at the time constituted the chief interest of it
he felt that he had penetrated more deeply than ever before into this intricate affair  and that he had originated a leading idea  he could say it without self flattery calculated to clear up the whole business  to strengthen him in his official career  to discomfit his enemies  and thereby to be of the greatest benefit to the government
directly the servant had set the tea and left the room  alexey alexandrovitch got up and went to the writing table
moving into the middle of the table a portfolio of papers  with a scarcely perceptible smile anna karenina 623 of 1759 of self satisfaction  he took a pencil from a rack and plunged into the perusal of a complex report relating to the present complication
the complication was of this nature  alexey alexandrovitch s characteristic quality as a politician  that special individual qualification that every rising functionary possesses  the qualification that with his unflagging ambition  his reserve  his honesty  and with his self confidence had made his career  was his contempt for red tape  his cutting down of correspondence  his direct contact  wherever possible  with the living fact  and his economy
it happened that the famous commission of the 2nd of june had set on foot an inquiry into the irrigation of lands in the zaraisky province  which fell under alexey alexandrovitch s department  and was a glaring example of fruitless expenditure and paper reforms alexey alexandrovitch was aware of the truth of this
the irrigation of these lands in the zaraisky province had been initiated by the predecessor of alexey alexandrovitch s predecessor
and vast sums of money had actually been spent and were still being spent on this business  and utterly unproductively  and the whole business could obviously lead to nothing whatever alexey alexandrovitch had perceived this at once on entering office  and would have liked to lay hands on the board of anna karenina 624 of 1759 irrigation
but at first  when he did not yet feel secure in his position  he knew it would affect too many interests  and would be injudicious
later on he had been engrossed in other questions  and had simply forgotten the board of irrigation
it went of itself  like all such boards  by the mere force of inertia
(many people gained their livelihood by the board of irrigation  especially one highly conscientious and musical family  all the daughters played on stringed instruments  and alexey alexandrovitch knew the family and had stood godfather to one of the elder daughters ) the raising of this question by a hostile department was in alexey alexandrovitch s opinion a dishonorable proceeding  seeing that in every department there were things similar and worse  which no one inquired into  for well known reasons of official etiquette
however  now that the glove had been thrown down to him  he had boldly picked it up and demanded the appointment of a special commission to investigate and verify the working of the board of irrigation of the lands in the zaraisky province
but in compensation he gave no quarter to the enemy either
he demanded the appointment of another special commission to inquire into the question of the native tribes organization committee
the question of the native tribes had been anna karenina 625 of 1759 brought up incidentally in the commission of the 2nd of june  and had been pressed forward actively by alexey alexandrovitch as one admitting of no delay on account of the deplorable condition bf the native tribes
in the commission this question had been a ground of contention between several departments
the department hostile to alexey alexandrovitch proved that the condition of the native tribes was exceedingly flourishing  that the proposed reconstruction might be the ruin of their prosperity  and that if there were anything wrong  it arose mainly from the failure on the part of alexey alexandrovitch s department to carry out the measures prescribed by law
now alexey alexandrovitch intended to demand  first  that a new commission should be formed which should be empowered to investigate the condition of the native tribes on the spot  secondly  if it should appear that the condition of the native tribes actually was such as it appeared to be from the official documents in the hands of the committee  that another new scientific commission should be appointed to investigate the deplorable condition of the native tribes from the (1) political  (2) administrative  (3) economic  (4) ethnographical  (5) material  and (6) religious points of view  thirdly  that evidence should be required from the anna karenina 626 of 1759 rival department of the measures that had been taken during the last ten years by that department for averting the disastrous conditions in which the native tribes were now placed  and fourthly and finally  that that department explain why it had  as appeared from the evidence before the committee  from no
17 015 and 18 038  from december 5  1863  and june 7  1864  acted in direct contravention of the intent of the law t   act 18  and the note to act 36
a flash of eagerness suffused the face of alexey alexandrovitch as he rapidly wrote out a synopsis of these ideas for his own benefit
having filled a sheet of paper  he got up  rang  and sent a note to the chief secretary of his department to look up certain necessary facts for him
getting up and walking about the room  he glanced again at the portrait  frowned  and smiled contemptuously
after reading a little more of the book on egyptian hieroglyphics  and renewing his interest in it  alexey alexandrovitch went to bed at eleven o clock  and recollecting as he lay in bed the incident with his wife  he saw it now in by no means such a gloomy light
anna karenina 627 of 1759 though anna had obstinately and with exasperation contradicted vronsky when he told her their position was impossible  at the bottom of her heart she regarded her own position as false and dishonorable  and she longed with her whole soul to change it
on the way home from the races she had told her husband the truth in a moment of excitement  and in spite of the agony she had suffered in doing so  she was glad of it
after her husband had left her  she told herself that she was glad  that now everything was made clear  and at least there would be no more lying and deception
it seemed to her beyond doubt that her position was now made clear forever
it might be bad  this new position  but it would be clear  there would be no indefiniteness or falsehood about it
the pain she had caused herself and her husband in uttering those words would be rewarded now by everything being made clear  she thought
that evening she saw vronsky  but she did not tell him of what had passed between her and her husband  though  to make the position definite  it was necessary to tell him
anna karenina 628 of 1759 when she woke up next morning the first thing that rose to her mind was what she had said to her husband  and those words seemed to her so awful that she could not conceive now how she could have brought herself to utter those strange  coarse words  and could not imagine what would come of it
but the words were spoken  and alexey alexandrovitch had gone away without saying anything
 i saw vronsky and did not tell him
at the very instant he was going away i would have turned him back and told him  but i changed my mind  because it was strange that i had not told him the first minute
why was it i wanted to tell him and did not tell him   and in answer to this question a burning blush of shame spread over her face
she knew what had kept her from it  she knew that she had been ashamed
her position  which had seemed to her simplified the night before  suddenly struck her now as not only not simple  but as absolutely hopeless
she felt terrified at the disgrace  of which she had not ever thought before
directly she thought of what her husband would do  the most terrible ideas came to her mind
she had a vision of being turned out of the house  of her shame being proclaimed to all the world
she asked herself where she should go when she was turned out of the house  and she could not find an answer
anna karenina 629 of 1759 when she thought of vronsky  it seemed to her that he did not love her  that he was already beginning to be tired of her  that she could not offer herself to him  and she felt bitter against him for it
it seemed to her that the words that she had spoken to her husband  and had continually repeated in her imagination  she had said to everyone  and everyone had heard them
she could not bring herself to look those of her own household in the face
she could not bring herself to call her maid  and still less go downstairs and see her son and his governess
the maid  who had been listening at her door for a long while  came into her room of her own accord
anna glanced inquiringly into her face  and blushed with a scared look
the maid begged her pardon for coming in  saying that she had fancied the bell rang
she brought her clothes and a note
the note was from betsy
betsy reminded her that liza merkalova and baroness shtoltz were coming to play croquet with her that morning with their adorers  kaluzhsky and old stremov
 come  if only as a study in morals
i shall expect you   she finished
anna read the note and heaved a deep sigh
 nothing  i need nothing   she said to annushka  who was rearranging the bottles and brushes on the dressing anna karenina 630 of 1759 table
 you can go
i ll dress at once and come down
i need nothing   annushka went out  but anna did not begin dressing  and sat in the same position  her head and hands hanging listlessly  and every now and then she shivered all over  seemed as though she would make some gesture  utter some word  and sank back into lifelessness again
she repeated continually   my god  my god   but neither  god  nor  my  had any meaning to her
the idea of seeking help in her difficulty in religion was as remote from her as seeking help from alexey alexandrovitch himself  although she had never had doubts of the faith in which she had been brought up she knew that the support of religion was possible only upon condition of renouncing what made up for her the whole meaning of life
she was not simply miserable  she began to feel alarm at the new spiritual condition  never experienced before  in which she found herself
she felt as though everything were beginning to be double in her soul  just as objects sometimes appear double to over tired eyes
she hardly knew at times what it was she feared  and what she hoped for
whether she feared or desired what had happened  or what was going to happen  and exactly what she longed for  she could not have said
anna karenina 631 of 1759  ah  what am i doing   she said to herself  feeling a sudden thrill of pain in both sides of her head
when she came to herself  she saw that she was holding her hair in both hands  each side of her temples  and pulling it
she jumped up  and began walking about
 the coffee is ready  and mademoiselle and seryozha are waiting   said annushka  coming back again and finding anna in the same position
 seryozha  what about seryozha   anna asked  with sudden eagerness  recollecting her son s existence for the first time that morning
 he s been naughty  i think   answered annushka with a smile
 in what way    some peaches were lying on the table in the corner room
i think he slipped in and ate one of them on the sly   the recollection of her son suddenly roused anna from the helpless condition in which she found herself
she recalled the partly sincere  though greatly exaggerated  role of the mother living for her child  which she had taken up of late years  and she felt with joy that in the plight in which she found herself she had a support  quite apart from her relation to her husband or to vronsky
this anna karenina 632 of 1759 support was her son
in whatever position she might be placed  she could not lose her son
her husband might put her to shame and turn her out  vronsky might grow cold to her and go on living his own life apart (she thought of him again with bitterness and reproach)  she could not leave her son
she had an aim in life
and she must act  act to secure this relation to her son  so that he might not be taken from her
quickly indeed  as quickly as possible  she must take action before he was taken from her
she must take her son and go away
here was the one thing she had to do now
she needed consolation
she must be calm  and get out of this insufferable position
the thought of immediate action binding her to her son  of going away somewhere with him  gave her this consolation
she dressed quickly  went downstairs  and with resolute steps walked into the drawing room  where she found  as usual  waiting for her  the coffee  seryozha  and his governess
seryozha  all in white  with his back and head bent  was standing at a table under a looking glass  and with an expression of intense concentration which she knew well  and in which he resembled his father  he was doing something to the flowers he carried
the governess had a particularly severe expression
seryozha screamed shrilly  as he often did   ah  mamma   anna karenina 633 of 1759 and stopped  hesitating whether to go to greet his mother and put down the flowers  or to finish making the wreath and go with the flowers
the governess  after saying good morning  began a long and detailed account of seryozha s naughtiness  but anna did not hear her  she was considering whether she would take her with her or not
 no  i won t take her   she decided
 i ll go alone with my child    yes  it s very wrong   said anna  and taking her son by the shoulder she looked at him  not severely  but with a timid glance that bewildered and delighted the boy  and she kissed him
 leave him to me   she said to the astonished governess  and not letting go of her son  she sat down at the table  where coffee was set ready for her
 mamma  i   i   didn t     he said  trying to make out from her expression what was in store for him in regard to the peaches
 seryozha   she said  as soon as the governess had left the room   that was wrong  but you ll never do it again  will you   
you love me   she felt that the tears were coming into her eyes
 can i help loving him   she said to herself  looking deeply into his scared and at the same time delighted eyes
 and can he ever join his father in punishing me  is it possible he anna karenina 634 of 1759 will not feel for me   tears were already flowing down her face  and to hide them she got up abruptly and almost ran out on to the terrace
after the thunder showers of the last few days  cold  bright weather had set in
the air was cold in the bright sun that filtered through the freshly washed leaves
she shivered  both from the cold and from the inward horror which had clutched her with fresh force in the open air
 run along  run along to mariette   she said to seryozha  who had followed her out  and she began walking up and down on the straw matting of the terrace
 can it be that they won t forgive me  won t understand how it all couldn t be helped   she said to herself
standing still  and looking at the tops of the aspen trees waving in the wind  with their freshly washed  brightly shining leaves in the cold sunshine  she knew that they would not forgive her  that everyone and everything would be merciless to her now as was that sky  that green
and again she felt that everything was split in two in her soul
 i mustn t  mustn t think   she said to herself
 i must get ready
to go where  when  whom to take with me  yes  to moscow by the evening train
annushka and seryozha  and only the most necessary things
but first i anna karenina 635 of 1759 must write to them both   she went quickly indoors into her boudoir  sat down at the table  and wrote to her husband   after what has happened  i cannot remain any longer in your house
i am going away  and taking my son with me
i don t know the law  and so i don t know with which of the parents the son should remain  but i take him with me because i cannot live without him
be generous  leave him to me   up to this point she wrote rapidly and naturally  but the appeal to his generosity  a quality she did not recognize in him  and the necessity of winding up the letter with something touching  pulled her up
 of my fault and my remorse i cannot speak  because    she stopped again  finding no connection in her ideas  no   she said to herself   there s no need of anything   and tearing up the letter  she wrote it again  leaving out the allusion to generosity  and sealed it up
another letter had to be written to vronsky
 i have told my husband   she wrote  and she sat a long while unable to write more
it was so coarse  so unfeminine
 and what more am i to write him   she said to herself
again a flush of shame spread over her face  she recalled his composure  and a feeling of anger against him impelled her to tear the sheet with the phrase she had written into anna karenina 636 of 1759 tiny bits
 no need of anything   she said to herself  and closing her blotting case she went upstairs  told the governess and the servants that she was going that day to moscow  and at once set to work to pack up her things
anna karenina 637 of 1759 all the rooms of the summer villa were full of porters  gardeners  and footmen going to and fro carrying out things cupboards and chests were open  twice they had sent to the shop for cord  pieces of newspaper were tossing about on the floor
two trunks  some bags and strappedup rugs  had been carried down into the hall
the carriage and two hired cabs were waiting at the steps
anna  forgetting her inward agitation in the work of packing  was standing at a table in her boudoir  packing her traveling bag  when annushka called her attention to the rattle of some carriage driving up
anna looked out of the window and saw alexey alexandrovitch s courier on the steps  ringing at the front door bell
 run and find out what it is   she said  and with a calm sense of being prepared for anything  she sat down in a low chair  folding her hands on her knees
a footman brought in a thick packet directed in alexey alexandrovitch s hand
 the courier had orders to wait for an answer   he said
 very well   she said  and as soon as he had left the room she tore open the letter with trembling fingers
a anna karenina 638 of 1759 roll of unfolded notes done up in a wrapper fell out of it
she disengaged the letter and began reading it at the end
 preparations shall be made for your arrival here   i attach particular significance to compliance     she read
she ran on  then back  read it all through  and once more read the letter all through again from the beginning
when she had finished  she felt that she was cold all over  and that a fearful calamity  such as she had not expected  had burst upon her
in the morning she had regretted that she had spoken to her husband  and wished for nothing so much as that those words could be unspoken
and here this letter regarded them as unspoken  and gave her what she had wanted
but now this letter seemed to her more awful than anything she had been able to conceive
 he s right   she said   of course  he s always right  he s a christian  he s generous  yes  vile  base creature  and no one understands it except me  and no one ever will  and i can t explain it
they say he s so religious  so highprincipled  so upright  so clever  but they don t see what i ve seen
they don t know how he has crushed my life for eight years  crushed everything that was living in me  he has not once even thought that i m a live woman who must have love
they don t know how at every step he s anna karenina 639 of 1759 humiliated me  and been just as pleased with himself haven t i striven  striven with all my strength  to find something to give meaning to my life  haven t i struggled to love him  to love my son when i could not love my husband  but the time came when i knew that i couldn t cheat myself any longer  that i was alive  that i was not to blame  that god has made me so that i must love and live
and now what does he do  if he d killed me  if he d killed him  i could have borne anything  i could have forgiven anything  but  no  he   
how was it i didn t guess what he would do  he s doing just what s characteristic of his mean character
he ll keep himself in the right  while me  in my ruin  he ll drive still lower to worse ruin yet    she recalled the words from the letter  you can conjecture what awaits you and your son       that s a threat to take away my child  and most likely by their stupid law he can
but i know very well why he says it
he doesn t believe even in my love for my child  or he despises it (just as he always used to ridicule it)
he despises that feeling in me  but he knows that i won t abandon my child  that i can t abandon my child  that there could be no life for me without my child  even with him whom i love  but that if i abandoned my child and ran away from him  i should be acting like the most anna karenina 640 of 1759 infamous  basest of women
he knows that  and knows that i am incapable of doing that   she recalled another sentence in the letter
 our life must go on as it has done in the past       that life was miserable enough in the old days  it has been awful of late
what will it be now  and he knows all that  he knows that i can t repent that i breathe  that i love  he knows that it can lead to nothing but lying and deceit  but he wants to go on torturing me
i know him  i know that he s at home and is happy in deceit  like a fish swimming in the water
no  i won t give him that happiness
i ll break through the spiderweb of lies in which he wants to catch me  come what may
anything s better than lying and deceit
 but how  my god  my god  was ever a woman so miserable as i am      no  i will break through it  i will break through it   she cried  jumping up and keeping back her tears
and she went to the writing table to write him another letter
but at the bottom of her heart she felt that she was not strong enough to break through anything  that she was not strong enough to get out of her old position  however false and dishonorable it might be
anna karenina 641 of 1759 she sat down at the writing table  but instead of writing she clasped her hands on the table  and  laying her head on them  burst into tears  with sobs and heaving breast like a child crying
she was weeping that her dream of her position being made clear and definite had been annihilated forever
she knew beforehand that everything would go on in the old way  and far worse  indeed  than in the old way
she felt that the position in the world that she enjoyed  and that had seemed to her of so little consequence in the morning  that this position was precious to her  that she would not have the strength to exchange it for the shameful position of a woman who has abandoned husband and child to join her lover  that however much she might struggle  she could not be stronger than herself
she would never know freedom in love  but would remain forever a guilty wife  with the menace of detection hanging over her at every instant  deceiving her husband for the sake of a shameful connection with a man living apart and away from her  whose life she could never share
she knew that this was how it would be  and at the same time it was so awful that she could not even conceive what it would end in
and she cried without restraint  as children cry when they are punished
anna karenina 642 of 1759 the sound of the footman s steps forced her to rouse herself  and hiding her face from him  she pretended to be writing
 the courier asks if there s an answer   the footman announced
 an answer  yes   said anna
 let him wait
i ll ring    what can i write   she thought
 what can i decide upon alone  what do i know  what do i want  what is there i care for   again she felt that her soul was beginning to be split in two
she was terrified again at this feeling  and clutched at the first pretext for doing something which might divert her thoughts from herself
 i ought to see alexey  (so she called vronsky in her thoughts)   no one but he can tell me what i ought to do
i ll go to betsy s  perhaps i shall see him there   she said to herself  completely forgetting that when she had told him the day before that she was not going to princess tverskaya s  he had said that in that case he should not go either
she went up to the table  wrote to her husband   i have received your letter
 a    and  ringing the bell  gave it to the footman
 we are not going   she said to annushka  as she came in
 not going at all   anna karenina 643 of 1759  no  don t unpack till tomorrow  and let the carriage wait
i m going to the princess s    which dress am i to get ready   anna karenina 644 of 1759 the croquet party to which the princess tverskaya had invited anna was to consist of two ladies and their adorers
these two ladies were the chief representatives of a select new petersburg circle  nicknamed  in imitation of some imitation  les sept merveilles du monde
these ladies belonged to a circle which  though of the highest society  was utterly hostile to that in which anna moved
moreover  stremov  one of the most influential people in petersburg  and the elderly admirer of liza merkalova  was alexey alexandrovitch s enemy in the political world
from all these considerations anna had not meant to go  and the hints in princess tverskaya s note referred to her refusal
but now anna was eager to go  in the hope of seeing vronsky
anna arrived at princess tverskaya s earlier than the other guests
at the same moment as she entered  vronsky s footman  with side  whiskers combed out like a kammerjunker  went in too
he stopped at the door  and  taking off his cap  let her pass
anna recognized him  and only then recalled that vronsky had told her the day anna karenina 645 of 1759 before that he would not come
most likely he was sending a note to say so
as she took off her outer garment in the hall  she heard the footman  pronouncing his  r s  even like a kammerjunker  say   from the count for the princess   and hand the note
she longed to question him as to where his master was
she longed to turn back and send him a letter to come and see her  or to go herself to see him
but neither the first nor the second nor the third course was possible
already she heard bells ringing to announce her arrival ahead of her  and princess tverskaya s footman was standing at the open door waiting for her to go forward into the inner rooms  the princess is in the garden  they will inform her immediately
would you be pleased to walk into the garden   announced another footman in another room
the position of uncertainty  of indecision  was still the same as at home worse  in fact  since it was impossible to take any step  impossible to see vronsky  and she had to remain here among outsiders  in company so uncongenial to her present mood
but she was wearing a dress that she knew suited her
she was not alone  all around was that luxurious setting of idleness that she was used to  and she anna karenina 646 of 1759 felt less wretched than at home she was not forced to think what she was to do
everything would be done of itself
on meeting betsy coming towards her in a white gown that struck her by its elegance  anna smiled at her just as she always did
princess tverskaya was walking with tushkevitch and a young lady  a relation  who  to the great joy of her parents in the provinces  was spending the summer with the fashionable princess
there was probably something unusual about anna  for betsy noticed it at once
 i slept badly   answered anna  looking intently at the footman who came to meet them  and  as she supposed  brought vronsky s note
 how glad i am you ve come   said betsy
 i m tired  and was just longing to have some tea before they come
you might go   she turned to tushkevitch  with masha  and try the croquet ground over there where they ve been cutting it
we shall have time to talk a little over tea  we ll have a cozy chat  eh   she said in english to anna  with a smile  pressing the hand with which she held a parasol
 yes  especially as i can t stay very long with you
i m forced to go on to old madame vrede
i ve been promising to go for a century   said anna  to whom lying  anna karenina 647 of 1759 alien as it was to her nature  had become not merely simple and natural in society  but a positive source of satisfaction
why she said this  which she had not thought of a second before  she could not have explained
she had said it simply from the reflection that as vronsky would not be here  she had better secure her own freedom  and try to see him somehow
but why she had spoken of old madame vrede  whom she had to go and see  as she had to see many other people  she could not have explained  and yet  as it afterwards turned out  had she contrived the most cunning devices to meet vronsky  she could have thought of nothing better
 no
i m not going to let you go for anything   answered betsy  looking intently into anna s face
 really  if i were not fond of you  i should feel offended
one would think you were afraid my society would compromise you
tea in the little dining room  please   she said  half closing her eyes  as she always did when addressing the footman
taking the note from him  she read it
 alexey s playing us false   she said in french   he writes that he can t come   she added in a tone as simple and natural as though it could never enter her head that vronsky could mean anything more to anna than a game anna karenina 648 of 1759 of croquet
anna knew that betsy knew everything  but  hearing how she spoke of vronsky before her  she almost felt persuaded for a minute that she knew nothing
 ah   said anna indifferently  as though not greatly interested in the matter  and she went on smiling   how can you or your friends compromise anyone   this playing with words  this hiding of a secret  had a great fascination for anna  as  indeed  it has for all women
and it was not the necessity of concealment  not the aim with which the concealment was contrived  but the process of concealment itself which attracted her
 i can t be more catholic than the pope   she said
 stremov and liza merkalova  why  they re the cream of the cream of society
besides  they re received everywhere  and i  she laid special stress on the i  have never been strict and intolerant
it s simply that i haven t the time    no  you don t care  perhaps  to meet stremov  let him and alexey alexandrovitch tilt at each other in the committee  that s no affair of ours
but in the world  he s the most amiable man i know  and a devoted croquet player
you shall see
and  in spite of his absurd position as liza s lovesick swain at his age  you ought to see how he carries off the absurd position
he s very nice
sappho anna karenina 649 of 1759 shtoltz you don t know  oh  that s a new type  quite new   betsy said all this  and  at the same time  from her good humored  shrewd glance  anna felt that she partly guessed her plight  and was hatching something for her benefit
they were in the little boudoir
 i must write to alexey though   and betsy sat down to the table  scribbled a few lines  and put the note in an envelope
 i m telling him to come to dinner
i ve one lady extra to dinner with me  and no man to take her in
look what i ve said  will that persuade him  excuse me  i must leave you for a minute
would you seal it up  please  and send it off   she said from the door   i have to give some directions   without a moment s thought  anna sat down to the table with betsy s letter  and  without reading it  wrote below   it s essential for me to see you
come to the vrede garden
i shall be there at six o clock   she sealed it up  and  betsy coming back  in her presence handed the note to be taken
at tea  which was brought them on a little tea table in the cool little drawing room  the cozy chat promised by princess tverskaya before the arrival of her visitors really anna karenina 650 of 1759 did come off between the two women
they criticized the people they were expecting  and the conversation fell upon liza merkalova
 she s very sweet  and i always liked her   said anna
 you ought to like her
she raves about you
yesterday she came up to me after the races and was in despair at not finding you
she says you re a real heroine of romance  and that if she were a man she would do all sorts of mad things for your sake
stremov says she does that as it is    but do tell me  please  i never could make it out   said anna  after being silent for some time  speaking in a tone that showed she was not asking an idle question  but that what she was asking was of more importance to her than it should have been   do tell me  please  what are her relations with prince kaluzhsky  mishka  as he s called  i ve met them so little
what does it mean   betsy smiled with her eyes  and looked intently at anna
 it s a new manner   she said
 they ve all adopted that manner
they ve flung their caps over the windmills
but there are ways and ways of flinging them    yes  but what are her relations precisely with kaluzhsky   anna karenina 651 of 1759 betsy broke into unexpectedly mirthful and irrepressible laughter  a thing which rarely happened with her
 you re encroaching on princess myakaya s special domain now
that s the question of an enfant terrible   and betsy obviously tried to restrain herself  but could not  and went off into peals of that infectious laughter that people laugh who do not laugh often
 you d better ask them   she brought out  between tears of laughter
 no  you laugh   said anna  laughing too in spite of herself   but i never could understand it
i can t understand the husband s role in it    the husband  liza merkalova s husband carries her shawl  and is always ready to be of use
but anything more than that in reality  no one cares to inquire
you know in decent society one doesn t talk or think even of certain details of the toilet
that s how it is with this    will you be at madame rolandak s fete   asked anna  to change the conversation
 i don t think so   answered betsy  and  without looking at her friend  she began filling the little transparent cups with fragrant tea
putting a cup before anna  she took out a cigarette  and  fitting it into a silver holder  she lighted it
anna karenina 652 of 1759  it s like this  you see  i m in a fortunate position   she began  quite serious now  as she took up her cup
 i understand you  and i understand liza
liza now is one of those naive natures that  like children  don t know what s good and what s bad
anyway  she didn t comprehend it when she was very young
and now she s aware that the lack of comprehension suits her
now  perhaps  she doesn t know on purpose   said betsy  with a subtle smile
 but  anyway  it suits her
the very same thing  don t you see  may be looked at tragically  and turned into a misery  or it may be looked at simply and even humorously
possibly you are inclined to look at things too tragically    how i should like to know other people just as i know myself   said anna  seriously and dreamily
 am i worse than other people  or better  i think i m worse    enfant terrible  enfant terrible   repeated betsy
 but here they are   anna karenina 653 of 1759 they heard the sound of steps and a man s voice  then a woman s voice and laughter  and immediately thereafter there walked in the expected guests  sappho shtoltz  and a young man beaming with excess of health  the so called vaska
it was evident that ample supplies of beefsteak  truffles  and burgundy never failed to reach him at the fitting hour
vaska bowed to the two ladies  and glanced at them  but only for one second
he walked after sappho into the drawing room  and followed her about as though he were chained to her  keeping his sparkling eyes fixed on her as though he wanted to eat her
sappho shtoltz was a blonde beauty with black eyes
she walked with smart little steps in high heeled shoes  and shook hands with the ladies vigorously like a man
anna had never met this new star of fashion  and was struck by her beauty  the exaggerated extreme to which her dress was carried  and the boldness of her manners
on her head there was such a superstructure of soft  golden hair her own and false mixed that her head was equal in size to the elegantly rounded bust  of which so much was exposed in front
the impulsive abruptness of her anna karenina 654 of 1759 movements was such that at every step the lines of her knees and the upper part of her legs were distinctly marked under her dress  and the question involuntarily rose to the mind where in the undulating  piled up mountain of material at the back the real body of the woman  so small and slender  so naked in front  and so hidden behind and below  really came to an end
betsy made haste to introduce her to anna
 only fancy  we all but ran over two soldiers   she began telling them at once  using her eyes  smiling and twitching away her tail  which she flung back at one stroke all on one side
 i drove here with vaska   
ah  to be sure  you don t know each other   and mentioning his surname she introduced the young man  and reddening a little  broke into a ringing laugh at her mistake that is at her having called him vaska to a stranger
vaska bowed once more to anna  but he said nothing to her
he addressed sappho   you ve lost your bet
we got here first
pay up   said he  smiling
sappho laughed still more festively
 not just now   said she
 oh  all right  i ll have it later    very well  very well
oh  yes   she turned suddenly to princess betsy   i am a nice person   i positively forgot it  
anna karenina 655 of 1759 i ve brought you a visitor
and here he comes   the unexpected young visitor  whom sappho had invited  and whom she had forgotten  was  however  a personage of such consequence that  in spite of his youth  both the ladies rose on his entrance
he was a new admirer of sappho s
he now dogged her footsteps  like vaska
soon after prince kaluzhsky arrived  and liza merkalova with stremov
liza merkalova was a thin brunette  with an oriental  languid type of face  and as everyone used to say exquisite enigmatic eyes
the tone of her dark dress (anna immediately observed and appreciated the fact) was in perfect harmony with her style of beauty
liza was as soft and enervated as sappho was smart and abrupt
but to anna s taste liza was far more attractive
betsy had said to anna that she had adopted the pose of an innocent child  but when anna saw her  she felt that this was not the truth
she really was both innocent and corrupt  but a sweet and passive woman
it is true that her tone was the same as sappho s  that like sappho  she had two men  one young and one old  tacked onto her  and devouring her with their eyes
but there was something in her higher than what surrounded her
there was in her anna karenina 656 of 1759 the glow of the real diamond among glass imitations
this glow shone out in her exquisite  truly enigmatic eyes
the weary  and at the same time passionate  glance of those eyes  encircled by dark rings  impressed one by its perfect sincerity
everyone looking into those eyes fancied he knew her wholly  and knowing her  could not but love her
at the sight of anna  her whole face lighted up at once with a smile of delight
 ah  how glad i am to see you   she said  going up to her
 yesterday at the races all i wanted was to get to you  but you d gone away
i did so want to see you  yesterday especially
wasn t it awful   she said  looking at anna with eyes that seemed to lay bare all her soul
 yes  i had no idea it would be so thrilling   said anna  blushing
the company got up at this moment to go into the garden
 i m not going   said liza  smiling and settling herself close to anna
 you won t go either  will you  who wants to play croquet    oh  i like it   said anna
anna karenina 657 of 1759  there  how do you manage never to be bored by things  it s delightful to look at you
you re alive  but i m bored    how can you be bored  why  you live in the liveliest set in petersburg   said anna
 possibly the people who are not of our set are even more bored  but we i certainly are not happy  but awfully  awfully bored   sappho smoking a cigarette went off into the garden with the two young men
betsy and stremov remained at the tea table
 what  bored   said betsy
 sappho says they did enjoy themselves tremendously at your house last night    ah  how dreary it all was   said liza merkalova  we all drove back to my place after the races
and always the same people  always the same
always the same thing
we lounged about on sofas all the evening
what is there to enjoy in that  no  do tell me how you manage never to be bored   she said  addressing anna again
 one has but to look at you and one sees  here s a woman who may be happy or unhappy  but isn t bored
tell me how you do it    i do nothing   answered anna  blushing at these searching questions
anna karenina 658 of 1759  that s the best way   stremov put it
stremov was a man of fifty  partly gray  but still vigorous looking  very ugly  but with a characteristic and intelligent face
liza merkalova was his wife s niece  and he spent all his leisure hours with her
on meeting anna karenina  as he was alexey alexandrovitch s enemy in the government  he tried  like a shrewd man and a man of the world  to be particularly cordial with her  the wife of his enemy
  nothing    he put in with a subtle smile   that s the very best way
i told you long ago   he said  turning to liza merkalova   that if you don t want to be bored  you mustn t think you re going to be bored
it s just as you mustn t be afraid of not being able to fall asleep  if you re afraid of sleeplessness
that s just what anna arkadyevna has just said    i should be very glad if i had said it  for it s not only clever but true   said anna  smiling
 no  do tell me why it is one can t go to sleep  and one can t help being bored    to sleep well one ought to work  and to enjoy oneself one ought to work too    what am i to work for when my work is no use to anybody  and i can t and won t knowingly make a pretense about it   anna karenina 659 of 1759  you re incorrigible   said stremov  not looking at her  and he spoke again to anna
as he rarely met anna  he could say nothing but commonplaces to her  but he said those commonplaces as to when she was returning to petersburg  and how fond countess lidia ivanovna was of her  with an expression which suggested that he longed with his whole soul to please her and show his regard for her and even more than that
tushkevitch came in  announcing that the party were awaiting the other players to begin croquet
 no  don t go away  please don t   pleaded liza merkalova  hearing that anna was going
stremov joined in her entreaties
 it s too violent a transition   he said   to go from such company to old madame vrede
and besides  you will only give her a chance for talking scandal  while here you arouse none but such different feelings of the highest and most opposite kind   he said to her
anna pondered for an instant in uncertainty
this shrewd man s flattering words  the naive  childlike affection shown her by liza merkalova  and all the social atmosphere she was used to   it was all so easy  and what was in store for her was so difficult  that she was for a minute in uncertainty whether to remain  whether to put anna karenina 660 of 1759 off a little longer the painful moment of explanation
but remembering what was in store for her alone at home  if she did not come to some decision  remembering that gesture terrible even in memory when she had clutched her hair in both hands she said good bye and went away
anna karenina 661 of 1759 in spite of vronsky s apparently frivolous life in society  he was a man who hated irregularity
in early youth in the corps of pages  he had experienced the humiliation of a refusal  when he had tried  being in difficulties  to borrow money  and since then he had never once put himself in the same position again in order to keep his affairs in some sort of order  he used about five times a year (more or less frequently  according to circumstances) to shut himself up alone and put all his affairs into definite shape this he used to call his day of reckoning or faire la lessive
on waking up the day after the races  vronsky put on a white linen coat  and without shaving or taking his bath  he distributed about the table moneys  bills  and letters  and set to work
petritsky  who knew he was ill tempered on such occasions  on waking up and seeing his comrade at the writing table  quietly dressed and went out without getting in his way every man who knows to the minutest details all the complexity of the conditions surrounding him  cannot help imagining that the complexity of these conditions  anna karenina 662 of 1759 and the difficulty of making them clear  is something exceptional and personal  peculiar to himself  and never supposes that others are surrounded by just as complicated an array of personal affairs as he is so indeed it seemed to vronsky
and not with out inward pride  and not without reason  he thought that any other man would long ago have been in difficulties  would have been forced to some dishonorable course  if he had found himself in such a difficult position but vronsky felt that now especially it was essential for him to clear up and define his position if he were to avoid getting into difficulties
what vronsky attacked first as being the easiest was his pecuniary position
writing out on note paper in his minute hand all that he owed  he added up the amount and found that his debts amounted to seventeen thousand and some odd hundreds  which he left out for the sake of clearness
reckoning up his money and his bank book  he found that he had left one thousand eight hundred roubles  and nothing coming in before the new year
reckoning over again his list of debts  vronsky copied it  dividing it into three classes
in the first class he put the debts which he would have to pay at once  or for which he must in any case have the money ready so that on demand for payment there could not be a moment s delay anna karenina 663 of 1759 in paying
such debts amounted to about four thousand  one thousand five hundred for a horse  and two thousand five hundred as surety for a young comrade  venovsky  who had lost that sum to a cardsharper in vronsky s presence vronsky had wanted to pay the money at the time (he had that amount then)  but venovsky and yashvin had insisted that they would pay and not vronsky  who had not played
that was so far well  but vronsky knew that in this dirty business  though his only share in it was undertaking by word of mouth to be surety for venovsky  it was absolutely necessary for him to have the two thousand five hundred roubles so as to be able to fling it at the swindler  and have no more words with him
and so for this first and most important division he must have four thousand roubles
the second class eight thousand roubles consisted of less important debts
these were principally accounts owing in connection with his race horses  to the purveyor of oats and hay  the english saddler  and so on
he would have to pay some two thousand roubles on these debts too  in order to be quite free from anxiety
the last class of debts to shops  to hotels  to his tailor were such as need not be considered
so that he needed at least six thousand roubles for current expenses  and he only had one thousand eight hundred
anna karenina 664 of 1759 for a man with one hundred thousand roubles of revenue  which was what everyone fixed as vronsky s income  such debts  one would suppose  could hardly be embarrassing  but the fact was that he was far from having one hundred thousand
his father s immense property  which alone yielded a yearly income of two hundred thousand  was left undivided between the brothers
at the time when the elder brother  with a mass of debts  married princess varya tchirkova  the daughter of a decembrist without any fortune whatever  alexey had given up to his elder brother almost the whole income from his father s estate  reserving for himself only twenty five thousand a year from it alexey had said at the time to his brother that that sum would be sufficient for him until he married  which he probably never would do
and his brother  who was in command of one of the most expensive regiments  and was only just married  could not decline the gift
his mother  who had her own separate property  had allowed alexey every year twenty thousand in addition to the twenty five thousand he had reserved  and alexey had spent it all
of late his mother  incensed with him on account of his love affair and his leaving moscow  had given up sending him the money
and in consequence of this  vronsky  who had been in the habit of living on the anna karenina 665 of 1759 scale of forty five thousand a year  having only received twenty thousand that year  found himself now in difficulties to get out of these difficulties  he could not apply to his mother for money
her last letter  which he had received the day before  had particularly exasperated him by the hints in it that she was quite ready to help him to succeed in the world and in the army  but not to lead a life which was a scandal to all good society
his mother s attempt to buy him stung him to the quick and made him feel colder than ever to her
but he could not draw back from the generous word when it was once uttered  even though he felt now  vaguely foreseeing certain eventualities in his intrigue with madame karenina  that this generous word had been spoken thoughtlessly  and that even though he were not married he might need all the hundred thousand of income
but it was impossible to draw back
he had only to recall his brother s wife  to remember how that sweet  delightful varya sought  at every convenient opportunity  to remind him that she remembered his generosity and appreciated it  to grasp the impossibility of taking back his gift
it was as impossible as beating a woman  stealing  or lying
one thing only could and ought to be done  and vronsky determined upon it without an instant s hesitation  to borrow money from a anna karenina 666 of 1759 money lender  ten thousand roubles  a proceeding which presented no difficulty  to cut down his expenses generally  and to sell his race horses
resolving on this  he promptly wrote a note to rolandak  who had more than once sent to him with offers to buy horses from him
then he sent for the englishman and the money lender  and divided what money he had according to the accounts he intended to pay
having finished this business  he wrote a cold and cutting answer to his mother
then he took out of his notebook three notes of anna s  read them again  burned them  and remembering their conversation on the previous day  he sank into meditation
anna karenina 667 of 1759 vronsky s life was particularly happy in that he had a code of principles  which defined with unfailing certitude what he ought and what he ought not to do
this code of principles covered only a very small circle of contingencies  but then the principles were never doubtful  and vronsky  as he never went outside that circle  had never had a moment s hesitation about doing what he ought to do
these principles laid down as invariable rules  that one must pay a cardsharper  but need not pay a tailor  that one must never tell a lie to a man  but one may to a woman  that one must never cheat anyone  but one may a husband  that one must never pardon an insult  but one may give one and so on
these principles were possibly not reasonable and not good  but they were of unfailing certainty  and so long as he adhered to them  vronsky felt that his heart was at peace and he could hold his head up
only quite lately in regard to his relations with anna  vronsky had begun to feel that his code of principles did not fully cover all possible contingencies  and to foresee in the future difficulties and perplexities for which he could find no guiding clue
anna karenina 668 of 1759 his present relation to anna and to her husband was to his mind clear and simple
it was clearly and precisely defined in the code of principles by which he was guided
she was an honorable woman who had bestowed her love upon him  and he loved her  and therefore she was in his eyes a woman who had a right to the same  or even more  respect than a lawful wife
he would have had his hand chopped off before he would have allowed himself by a word  by a hint  to humiliate her  or even to fall short of the fullest respect a woman could look for his attitude to society  too  was clear
everyone might know  might suspect it  but no one might dare to speak of it
if any did so  he was ready to force all who might speak to be silent and to respect the nonexistent honor of the woman he loved
his attitude to the husband was the clearest of all
from the moment that anna loved vronsky  he had regarded his own right over her as the one thing unassailable
her husband was simply a superfluous and tiresome person
no doubt he was in a pitiable position  but how could that be helped  the one thing the husband had a right to was to demand satisfaction with a weapon in his hand  and vronsky was prepared for this at any minute
anna karenina 669 of 1759 but of late new inner relations had arisen between him and her  which frightened vronsky by their indefiniteness
only the day before she had told him that she was with child
and he felt that this fact and what she expected of him called for something not fully defined in that code of principles by which he had hitherto steered his course in life
and he had been indeed caught unawares  and at the first moment when she spoke to him of her position  his heart had prompted him to beg her to leave her husband
he had said that  but now thinking things over he saw clearly that it would be better to manage to avoid that  and at the same time  as he told himself so  he was afraid whether it was not wrong  if i told her to leave her husband  that must mean uniting her life with mine  am i prepared for that  how can i take her away now  when i have no money  supposing i could arrange   
but how can i take her away while i m in the service  if i say that i ought to be prepared to do it  that is  i ought to have the money and to retire from the army   and he grew thoughtful
the question whether to retire from the service or not brought him to the other and perhaps the chief though hidden interest of his life  of which none knew but he
anna karenina 670 of 1759 ambition was the old dream of his youth and childhood  a dream which he did not confess even to himself  though it was so strong that now this passion was even doing battle with his love his first steps in the world and in the service had been successful  but two years before he had made a great mistake
anxious to show his independence and to advance  he had refused a post that had been offered him  hoping that this refusal would heighten his value  but it turned out that he had been too bold  and he was passed over
and having  whether he liked or not  taken up for himself the position of an independent man  he carried it off with great tact and good sense  behaving as though he bore no grudge against anyone  did not regard himself as injured in any way  and cared for nothing but to be left alone since he was enjoying himself in reality he had ceased to enjoy himself as long ago as the year before  when he went away to moscow he felt that this independent attitude of a man who might have done anything  but cared to do nothing was already beginning to pall  that many people were beginning to fancy that he was not really capable of anything but being a straightforward  good natured fellow
his connection with madame karenina  by creating so much sensation and attracting general attention  had given anna karenina 671 of 1759 him a fresh distinction which soothed his gnawing worm of ambition for a while  but a week before that worm had been roused up again with fresh force
the friend of his childhood  a man of the same set  of the same coterie  his comrade in the corps of pages  serpuhovskoy  who had left school with him and had been his rival in class  in gymnastics  in their scrapes and their dreams of glory  had come back a few days before from central asia  where he had gained two steps up in rank  and an order rarely bestowed upon generals so young as soon as he arrived in petersburg  people began to talk about him as a newly risen star of the first magnitude a schoolfellow of vronsky s and of the same age  he was a general and was expecting a command  which might have influence on the course of political events  while vronsky  independent and brilliant and beloved by a charming woman though he was  was simply a cavalry captain who was readily allowed to be as independent as ever he liked
 of course i don t envy serpuhovskoy and never could envy him  but his advancement shows me that one has only to watch one s opportunity  and the career of a man like me may be very rapidly made
three years ago he was in just the same position as i am
if i retire  i burn my ships
if i remain in the army  i lose nothing
she said anna karenina 672 of 1759 herself she did not wish to change her position
and with her love i cannot feel envious of serpuhovskoy   and slowly twirling his mustaches  he got up from the table and walked about the room
his eyes shone particularly brightly  and he felt in that confident  calm  and happy frame of mind which always came after he had thoroughly faced his position
everything was straight and clear  just as after former days of reckoning
he shaved  took a cold bath  dressed and went out
anna karenina 673 of 1759  we ve come to fetch you your lessive lasted a good time today   said petritsky
 well  is it over    it is over   answered vronsky  smiling with his eyes only  and twirling the tips of his mustaches as circumspectly as though after the perfect order into which his affairs had been brought any over bold or rapid movement might disturb it  you re always just as if you d come out of a bath after it   said petritsky
 i ve come from gritsky s  (that was what they called the colonel)   they re expecting you   vronsky  without answering  looked at his comrade  thinking of something else  yes  is that music at his place   he said  listening to the familiar sounds of polkas and waltzes floating across to him
 what s the fete    serpuhovskoy s come    aha   said vronsky   why  i didn t know   the smile in his eyes gleamed more brightly than ever
having once made up his mind that he was happy in his love  that he sacrificed his ambition to it having anyway taken up this position  vronsky was incapable of anna karenina 674 of 1759 feeling either envious of serpuhovskoy or hurt with him for not coming first to him when he came to the regiment
serpuhovskoy was a good friend  and he was delighted he had come
 ah  i m very glad   the colonel  demin  had taken a large country house
the whole party were in the wide lower balcony
in the courtyard the first objects that met vronsky s eyes were a band of singers in white linen coats  standing near a barrel of vodka  and the robust  good humored figure of the colonel surrounded by officers
he had gone out as far as the first step of the balcony and was loudly shouting across the band that played offenbach s quadrille  waving his arms and giving some orders to a few soldiers standing on one side a group of soldiers  a quartermaster  and several subalterns came up to the balcony with vronsky
the colonel returned to the table  went out again onto the steps with a tumbler in his hand  and proposed the toast   to the health of our former comrade  the gallant general  prince serpuhovskoy hurrah   the colonel was followed by serpuhovskoy  who came out onto the steps smiling  with a glass in his hand
 you always get younger  bondarenko   he said to the rosy checked  smart looking quartermaster standing just anna karenina 675 of 1759 before him  still youngish looking though doing his second term of service
it was three years since vronsky had seen serpuhovskoy
he looked more robust  had let his whiskers grow  but was still the same graceful creature  whose face and figure were even more striking from their softness and nobility than their beauty
the only change vronsky detected in him was that subdued  continual radiance of beaming content which settles on the faces of men who are successful and are sure of the recognition of their success by everyone
vronsky knew that radiant air  and immediately observed it in serpuhovskoy
as serpuhovskoy came down the steps he saw vronsky
a smile of pleasure lighted up his face
he tossed his head upwards and waved the glass in his hand  greeting vronsky  and showing him by the gesture that he could not come to him before the quartermaster  who stood craning forward his lips ready to be kissed
 here he is   shouted the colonel
 yashvin told me you were in one of your gloomy tempers   serpuhovskoy kissed the moist  fresh lips of the gallantlooking quartermaster  and wiping his mouth with his handkerchief  went up to vronsky
anna karenina 676 of 1759  how glad i am   he said  squeezing his hand and drawing him on one side
 you look after him   the colonel shouted to yashvin  pointing to vronsky  and he went down below to the soldiers
 why weren t you at the races yesterday  i expected to see you there   said vronsky  scrutinizing serpuhovskoy
 i did go  but late
i beg your pardon   he added  and he turned to the adjutant   please have this divided from me  each man as much as it runs to   and he hurriedly took notes for three hundred roubles from his pocketbook  blushing a little
 vronsky  have anything to eat or drink   asked yashvin
 hi  something for the count to eat  ah  here it is  have a glass   the fete at the colonel s lasted a long while
there was a great deal of drinking
they tossed serpuhovskoy in the air and caught him again several times
then they did the same to the colonel
then  to the accompaniment of the band  the colonel himself danced with petritsky then the colonel  who began to show signs of feebleness  sat down on a bench in the courtyard and began demonstrating to yashvin the superiority of russia over poland  especially in cavalry attack  and there was a lull in the revelry for a anna karenina 677 of 1759 moment
serpuhovskoy went into the house to the bathroom to wash his hands and found vronsky there  vronsky was drenching his head with water
he had taken off his coat and put his sunburnt  hairy neck under the tap  and was rubbing it and his head with his hands
when he had finished  vronsky sat down by serpuhovskoy
they both sat down in the bathroom on a lounge  and a conversation began which was very interesting to both of them
 i ve always been hearing about you through my wife   said serpuhovskoy
 i m glad you ve been seeing her pretty often    she s friendly with varya  and they re the only women in petersburg i care about seeing   answered vronsky  smiling
he smiled because he foresaw the topic the conversation would turn on  and he was glad of it
 the only ones   serpuhovskoy queried  smiling
 yes  and i heard news of you  but not only through your wife   said vronsky  checking his hint by a stern expression of face
 i was greatly delighted to hear of your success  but not a bit surprised
i expected even more   serpuhovskoy smiled
such an opinion of him was obviously agreeable to him  and he did not think it necessary to conceal it
anna karenina 678 of 1759  well  i on the contrary expected less i ll own frankly
but i m glad  very glad
i m ambitious  that s my weakness  and i confess to it    perhaps you wouldn t confess to it if you hadn t been successful   said vronsky
 i don t suppose so   said serpuhovskoy  smiling again
 i won t say life wouldn t be worth living without it  but it would be dull
of course i may be mistaken  but i fancy i have a certain capacity for the line i ve chosen  and that power of any sort in my hands  if it is to be  will be better than in the hands of a good many people i know   said serpuhovskoy  with beaming consciousness of success   and so the nearer i get to it  the better pleased i am    perhaps that is true for you  but not for everyone
i used to think so too  but here i live and think life worth living not only for that    there it s out  here it comes   said serpuhovskoy  laughing
 ever since i heard about you  about your refusal  i began   
of course  i approved of what you did
but there are ways of doing everything
and i think your action was good in itself  but you didn t do it quite in the way you ought to have done   anna karenina 679 of 1759  what s done can t be undone  and you know i never go back on what i ve done
and besides  i m very well off    very well off for the time
but you re not satisfied with that
i wouldn t say this to your brother
he s a nice child  like our host here
there he goes   he added  listening to the roar of  hurrah    and he s happy  but that does not satisfy you    i didn t say it did satisfy me    yes  but that s not the only thing
such men as you are wanted    by whom    by whom  by society  by russia
russia needs men  she needs a party  or else everything goes and will go to the dogs    how do you mean  bertenev s party against the russian communists    no   said serpuhovskoy  frowning with vexation at being suspected of such an absurdity
 tout ca est une blague
that s always been and always will be
there are no communists
but intriguing people have to invent a noxious  dangerous party
it s an old trick
no  what s wanted is a powerful party of independent men like you and me   anna karenina 680 of 1759  but why so   vronsky mentioned a few men who were in power
 why aren t they independent men    simply because they have not  or have not had from birth  an independent fortune  they ve not had a name  they ve not been close to the sun and center as we have
they can be bought either by money or by favor
and they have to find a support for themselves in inventing a policy and they bring forward some notion  some policy that they don t believe in  that does harm  and the whole policy is really only a means to a government house and so much income
cela n est pas plus fin que ca  when you get a peep at their cards
i may be inferior to them  stupider perhaps  though i don t see why i should be inferior to them
but you and i have one important advantage over them for certain  in being more difficult to buy
and such men are more needed than ever   vronsky listened attentively  but he was not so much interested by the meaning of the words as by the attitude of serpuhovskoy who was already contemplating a struggle with the existing powers  and already had his likes and dislikes in that higher world  while his own interest in the governing world did not go beyond the interests of his regiment
vronsky felt  too  how powerful serpuhovskoy might become through his unmistakable faculty for anna karenina 681 of 1759 thinking things out and for taking things in  through his intelligence and gift of words  so rarely met with in the world in which he moved
and  ashamed as he was of the feeling  he felt envious
 still i haven t the one thing of most importance for that   he answered   i haven t the desire for power
i had it once  but it s gone    excuse me  that s not true   said serpuhovskoy  smiling
 yes  it is true  it is true   now   vronsky added  to be truthful
 yes  it s true now  that s another thing  but that now won t last forever    perhaps   answered vronsky
 you say perhaps   serpuhovskoy went on  as though guessing his thoughts   but i say for certain
and that s what i wanted to see you for
your action was just what it should have been
i see that  but you ought not to keep it up
i only ask you to give me carte blanche
i m not going to offer you my protection   though  indeed  why shouldn t i protect you   you ve protected me often enough  i should hope our friendship rises above all that sort of thing
yes   he said  smiling to him as anna karenina 682 of 1759 tenderly as a woman   give me carte blanche  retire from the regiment  and i ll draw you upwards imperceptibly    but you must understand that i want nothing   said vronsky   except that all should be as it is   serpuhovskoy got up and stood facing him
 you say that all should be as it is
i understand what that means
but listen  we re the same age  you ve known a greater number of women perhaps than i have   serpohovskoy s smile and gestures told vronsky that he mustn t be afraid  that he would be tender and careful in touching the sore place
 but i m married  and believe me  in getting to know thoroughly one s wife  if one loves her  as someone has said  one gets to know all women better than if one knew thousands of them    we re coming directly   vronsky shouted to an officer  who looked into the room and called them to the colonel
vronsky was longing now to hear to the end and know what serpuhovskey would say to him
 and here s my opinion for you
women are the chief stumbling block in a man s career
it s hard to love a woman and do anything
there s only one way of having love conveniently without its being a hindrance that s marriage
how  how am i to tell you what i mean   said serpuhovskoy  who liked similes
 wait a minute  wait a anna karenina 683 of 1759 minute  yes  just as you can only carry a fardeau and do something with your hands  when the fardeau is tied on your back  and that s marriage
and that s what i felt when i was married
my hands were suddenly set free
but to drag that fardeau about with you without marriage  your hands will always be so full that you can do nothing
look at mazankov  at krupov
they ve ruined their careers for the sake of women    what women   said vronsky  recalling the frenchwoman and the actress with whom the two men he had mentioned were connected
 the firmer the woman s footing in society  the worse it is
that s much the same as not merely carrying the fardeau in your arms but tearing it away from someone else    you have never loved   vronsky said softly  looking straight before him and thinking of anna  perhaps
but you remember what i ve said to you
and another thing  women are all more materialistic than men
we make something immense out of love  but they are always terre a terre    directly  directly   he cried to a footman who came in
but the footman had not come to call them again  as he supposed
the footman brought vronsky a note
anna karenina 684 of 1759  a man brought it from princess tverskaya   vronsky opened the letter  and flushed crimson  my head s begun to ache  i m going home   he said to serpuhovskoy
 oh  good bye then
you give me carte blanche    we ll talk about it later on  i ll look you up in petersburg   anna karenina 685 of 1759 it was six o clock already  and so  in order to be there quickly  and at the same time not to drive with his own horses  known to everyone  vronsky got into yashvin s hired fly  and told the driver to drive as quickly as possible
it was a roomy  old fashioned fly  with seats for four
he sat in one corner  stretched his legs out on the front seat  and sank into meditation a vague sense of the order into which his affairs had been brought  a vague recollection of the friendliness and flattery of serpuhovskoy  who had considered him a man that was needed  and most of all  the anticipation of the interview before him all blended into a general  joyous sense of life
this feeling was so strong that he could not help smiling
he dropped his legs  crossed one leg over the other knee  and taking it in his hand  felt the springy muscle of the calf  where it had been grazed the day before by his fall  and leaning back he drew several deep breaths
 i m happy  very happy   he said to himself he had often before had this sense of physical joy in his own body  but he had never felt so fond of himself  of his own anna karenina 686 of 1759 body  as at that moment he enjoyed the slight ache in his strong leg  he enjoyed the muscular sensation of movement in his chest as he breathed
the bright  cold august day  which had made anna feel so hopeless  seemed to him keenly stimulating  and refreshed his face and neck that still tingled from the cold water
the scent of brilliantine on his whiskers struck him as particularly pleasant in the fresh air
everything he saw from the carriage window  everything in that cold pure air  in the pale light of the sunset  was as fresh  and gay  and strong as he was himself  the roofs of the houses shining in the rays of the setting sun  the sharp outlines of fences and angles of buildings  the figures of passers by  the carriages that met him now and then  the motionless green of the trees and grass  the fields with evenly drawn furrows of potatoes  and the slanting shadows that fell from the houses  and trees  and bushes  and even from the rows of potatoes everything was bright like a pretty landscape just finished and freshly varnished  get on  get on   he said to the driver  putting his head out of the window  and pulling a three rouble note out of his pocket he handed it to the man as he looked round
the driver s hand fumbled with something at the lamp  anna karenina 687 of 1759 the whip cracked  and the carriage rolled rapidly along the smooth highroad
 i want nothing  nothing but this happiness   he thought  staring at the bone button of the bell in the space between the windows  and picturing to himself anna just as he had seen her last time  and as i go on  i love her more and more
here s the garden of the vrede villa
whereabouts will she be  where  how  why did she fix on this place to meet me  and why does she write in betsy s letter   he thought  wondering now for the first time at it
but there was now no time for wonder
he called to the driver to stop before reaching the avenue  and opening the door  jumped out of the carriage as it was moving  and went into the avenue that led up to the house
there was no one in the avenue  but looking round to the right he caught sight of her
her face was hidden by a veil  but he drank in with glad eyes the special movement in walking  peculiar to her alone  the slope of the shoulders  and the setting of the head  and at once a sort of electric shock ran all over him
with fresh force  he felt conscious of himself from the springy motions of his legs to the movements of his lungs as he breathed  and something set his lips twitching joining him  she pressed his hand tightly
anna karenina 688 of 1759  you re not angry that i sent for you  i absolutely had to see you   she said  and the serious and set line of her lips  which he saw under the veil  transformed his mood at once
 i angry  but how have you come  where from    never mind   she said  laying her hand on his   come along  i must talk to you   he saw that something had happened  and that the interview would not be a joyous one
in her presence he had no will of his own  without knowing the grounds of her distress  he already felt the same distress unconsciously passing over him
 what is it  what   he asked her  squeezing her hand with his elbow  and trying to read her thoughts in her face
she walked on a few steps in silence  gathering up her courage  then suddenly she stopped
 i did not tell you yesterday   she began  breathing quickly and painfully   that coming home with alexey alexandrovitch i told him everything   told him i could not be his wife  that   and told him everything   he heard her  unconsciously bending his whole figure down to her as though hoping in this way to soften the hardness of her position for her
but directly she had said anna karenina 689 of 1759 this he suddenly drew himself up  and a proud and hard expression came over his face  yes  yes  that s better  a thousand times better  i know how painful it was   he said
but she was not listening to his words  she was reading his thoughts from the expression of his face
she could not guess that that expression arose from the first idea that presented itself to vronsky that a duel was now inevitable
the idea of a duel had never crossed her mind  and so she put a different interpretation on this passing expression of hardness
when she got her husband s letter  she knew then at the bottom of her heart that everything would go on in the old way  that she would not have the strength of will to forego her position  to abandon her son  and to join her lover
the morning spent at princess tverskaya s had confirmed her still more in this
but this interview was still of the utmost gravity for her
she hoped that this interview would transform her position  and save her
if on hearing this news he were to say to her resolutely  passionately  without an instant s wavering   throw up everything and come with me   she would give up her son and go away with him
but this news had not produced what she had expected in him  he simply seemed as though he were resenting some affront
anna karenina 690 of 1759  it was not in the least painful to me
it happened of itself   she said irritably   and see     she pulled her husband s letter out of her glove
 i understand  i understand   he interrupted her  taking the letter  but not reading it  and trying to soothe her
 the one thing i longed for  the one thing i prayed for  was to cut short this position  so as to devote my life to your happiness    why do you tell me that   she said
 do you suppose i can doubt it  if i doubted     who s that coming   said vronsky suddenly  pointing to two ladies walking towards them
 perhaps they know us   and he hurriedly turned off  drawing her after him into a side path
 oh  i don t care   she said
her lips were quivering
and he fancied that her eyes looked with strange fury at him from under the veil
 i tell you that s not the point i can t doubt that  but see what he writes to me
read it   she stood still again
again  just as at the first moment of hearing of her rupture with her husband  vronsky  on reading the letter  was unconsciously carried away by the natural sensation aroused in him by his own relation to the betrayed husband
now while he held his letter in his hands  he anna karenina 691 of 1759 could not help picturing the challenge  which he would most likely find at home today or tomorrow  and the duel itself in which  with the same cold and haughty expression that his face was assuming at this moment he would await the injured husband s shot  after having himself fired into the air and at that instant there flashed across his mind the thought of what serpuhovskoy had just said to him  and what he had himself been thinking in the morning  that it was better not to bind himself  and he knew that this thought he could not tell her having read the letter  he raised his eyes to her  and there was no determination in them
she saw at once that he had been thinking about it before by himself she knew that whatever he might say to her  he would not say all he thought
and she knew that her last hope had failed her
this was not what she had been reckoning on
 you see the sort of man he is   she said  with a shaking voice   he     forgive me  but i rejoice at it   vronsky interrupted
 for god s sake  let me finish   he added  his eyes imploring her to give him time to explain his words
 i rejoice  because things cannot  cannot possibly remain as he supposes   anna karenina 692 of 1759  why can t they   anna said  restraining her tears  and obviously attaching no sort of consequence to what he said
she felt that her fate was sealed
vronsky meant that after the duel inevitable  he thought  things could not go on as before  but he said something different
 it can t go on
i hope that now you will leave him
i hope   he was confused  and reddened  that you will let me arrange and plan our life
tomorrow     he was beginning
she did not let him go on
 but my child   she shrieked
 you see what he writes  i should have to leave him  and i can t and won t do that    but  for god s sake  which is better  leave your child  or keep up this degrading position    to whom is it degrading    to all  and most of all to you    you say degrading   don t say that
those words have no meaning for me   she said in a shaking voice
she did not want him now to say what was untrue
she had nothing left her but his love  and she wanted to love him
 don t you understand that from the day i loved you everything has changed for me  for me there is one thing  and one thing only your love
if that s mine  i feel so anna karenina 693 of 1759 exalted  so strong  that nothing can be humiliating to me
i am proud of my position  because   proud of being  
proud      she could not say what she was proud of
tears of shame and despair choked her utterance
she stood still and sobbed
he felt  too  something swelling in his throat and twitching in his nose  and for the first time in his life he felt on the point of weeping
he could not have said exactly what it was touched him so
he felt sorry for her  and he felt he could not help her  and with that he knew that he was to blame for her wretchedness  and that he had done something wrong  is not a divorce possible   he said feebly
she shook her head  not answering
 couldn t you take your son  and still leave him    yes  but it all depends on him
now i must go to him   she said shortly
her presentiment that all would again go on in the old way had not deceived her
 on tuesday i shall be in petersburg  and everything can be settled    yes   she said
 but don t let us talk any more of it   anna s carriage  which she had sent away  and ordered to come back to the little gate of the vrede garden  drove up
anna said good bye to vronsky  and drove home
anna karenina 694 of 1759 on monday there was the usual sitting of the commission of the 2nd of june
alexey alexandrovitch walked into the hall where the sitting was held  greeted the members and the president  as usual  and sat down in his place  putting his hand on the papers laid ready before him
among these papers lay the necessary evidence and a rough outline of the speech he intended to make
but he did not really need these documents
he remembered every point  and did not think it necessary to go over in his memory what he would say
he knew that when the time came  and when he saw his enemy facing him  and studiously endeavoring to assume an expression of indifference  his speech would flow of itself better than he could prepare it now
he felt that the import of his speech was of such magnitude that every word of it would have weight
meantime  as he listened to the usual report  he had the most innocent and inoffensive air
no one  looking at his white hands  with their swollen veins and long fingers  so softly stroking the edges of the white paper that lay before him  and at the air of weariness with which his head drooped on one side  would have suspected that anna karenina 695 of 1759 in a few minutes a torrent of words would flow from his lips that would arouse a fearful storm  set the members shouting and attacking one another  and force the president to call for order
when the report was over  alexey alexandrovitch announced in his subdued  delicate voice that he had several points to bring before the meeting in regard to the commission for the reorganization of the native tribes
all attention was turned upon him
alexey alexandrovitch cleared his throat  and not looking at his opponent  but selecting  as he always did while he was delivering his speeches  the first person sitting opposite him  an inoffensive little old man  who never had an opinion of any sort in the commission  began to expound his views
when he reached the point about the fundamental and radical law  his opponent jumped up and began to protest
stremov  who was also a member of the commission  and also stung to the quick  began defending himself  and altogether a stormy sitting followed  but alexey alexandrovitch triumphed  and his motion was carried  three new commissions were appointed  and the next day in a certain petersburg circle nothing else was talked of but this sitting alexey alexandrovitch s success had been even greater than he had anticipated
anna karenina 696 of 1759 next morning  tuesday  alexey alexandrovitch  on waking up  recollected with pleasure his triumph of the previous day  and he could not help smiling  though he tried to appear indifferent  when the chief secretary of his department  anxious to flatter him  informed him of the rumors that had reached him concerning what had happened in the commission
absorbed in business with the chief secretary  alexey alexandrovitch had completely forgotten that it was tuesday  the day fixed by him for the return of anna arkadyevna  and he was surprised and received a shock of annoyance when a servant came in to inform him of her arrival
anna had arrived in petersburg early in the morning  the carriage had been sent to meet her in accordance with her telegram  and so alexey alexandrovitch might have known of her arrival
but when she arrived  he did not meet her
she was told that he had not yet gone out  but was busy with his secretary
she sent word to her husband that she had come  went to her own room  and occupied herself in sorting out her things  expecting he would come to her
but an hour passed  he did not come
she went into the dining room on the pretext of giving some directions  and spoke loudly on purpose  expecting him to anna karenina 697 of 1759 come out there  but he did not come  though she heard him go to the door of his study as he parted from the chief secretary
she knew that he usually went out quickly to his office  and she wanted to see him before that  so that their attitude to one another might be defined
she walked across the drawing room and went resolutely to him
when she went into his study he was in official uniform  obviously ready to go out  sitting at a little table on which he rested his elbows  looking dejectedly before him
she saw him before he saw her  and she saw that he was thinking of her
on seeing her  he would have risen  but changed his mind  then his face flushed hotly a thing anna had never seen before  and he got up quickly and went to meet her  looking not at her eyes  but above them at her forehead and hair
he went up to her  took her by the hand  and asked her to sit down
 i am very glad you have come   he said  sitting down beside her  and obviously wishing to say something  he stuttered
several times he tried to begin to speak  but stopped
in spite of the fact that  preparing herself for meeting him  she had schooled herself to despise and reproach him  she did not know what to say to him  and she felt sorry for him
and so the silence lasted for some anna karenina 698 of 1759 time
 is seryozha quite well   he said  and not waiting for an answer  he added   i shan t be dining at home today  and i have got to go out directly    i had thought of going to moscow   she said
 no  you did quite  quite right to come   he said  and was silent again
seeing that he was powerless to begin the conversation  she began herself
 alexey alexandrovitch   she said  looking at him and not dropping her eyes under his persistent gaze at her hair   i m a guilty woman  i m a bad woman  but i am the same as i was  as i told you then  and i have come to tell you that i can change nothing    i have asked you no question about that   he said  all at once  resolutely and with hatred looking her straight in the face   that was as i had supposed   under the influence of anger he apparently regained complete possession of all his faculties
 but as i told you then  and have written to you   he said in a thin  shrill voice   i repeat now  that i am not bound to know this
i ignore it
not all wives are so kind as you  to be in such a hurry to communicate such agreeable news to their husbands   he laid special emphasis on the word  agreeable    i shall ignore it so long as the world knows nothing of it  so long as my name is not anna karenina 699 of 1759 disgraced
and so i simply inform you that our relations must be just as they have always been  and that only in the event of your compromising me i shall be obliged to take steps to secure my honor    but our relations cannot be the same as always   anna began in a timid voice  looking at him with dismay
when she saw once more those composed gestures  heard that shrill  childish  and sarcastic voice  her aversion for him extinguished her pity for him  and she felt only afraid  but at all costs she wanted to make clear her position
 i cannot be your wife while i     she began
he laughed a cold and malignant laugh
 the manner of life you have chosen is reflected  i suppose  in your ideas
i have too much respect or contempt  or both   i respect your past and despise your present   that i was far from the interpretation you put on my words   anna sighed and bowed her head
 though indeed i fail to comprehend how  with the independence you show   he went on  getting hot     announcing your infidelity to your husband and seeing nothing reprehensible in it  apparently you can see anna karenina 700 of 1759 anything reprehensible in performing a wife s duties in relation to your husband    alexey alexandrovitch  what is it you want of me    i want you not to meet that man here  and to conduct yourself so that neither the world nor the servants can reproach you   not to see him
that s not much  i think
and in return you will enjoy all the privileges of a faithful wife without fulfilling her duties
that s all i have to say to you
now it s time for me to go
i m not dining at home   he got up and moved towards the door
anna got up too
bowing in silence  he let her pass before him
anna karenina 701 of 1759 the night spent by levin on the haycock did not pass without result for him
the way in which he had been managing his land revolted him and had lost all attraction for him
in spite of the magnificent harvest  never had there been  or  at least  never it seemed to him  had there been so many hindrances and so many quarrels between him and the peasants as that year  and the origin of these failures and this hostility was now perfectly comprehensible to him
the delight he had experienced in the work itself  and the consequent greater intimacy with the peasants  the envy he felt of them  of their life  the desire to adopt that life  which had been to him that night not a dream but an intention  the execution of which he had thought out in detail  all this had so transformed his view of the farming of the land as he had managed it  that he could not take his former interest in it  and could not help seeing that unpleasant relation between him and the workspeople which was the foundation of it all
the herd of improved cows such as pava  the whole land ploughed over and enriched  the nine level fields surrounded with hedges  the two hundred and forty acres heavily manured  anna karenina 702 of 1759 the seed sown in drills  and all the rest of it it was all splendid if only the work had been done for themselves  or for themselves and comrades  people in sympathy with them but he saw clearly now (his work on a book of agriculture  in which the chief element in husbandry was to have been the laborer  greatly assisted him in this) that the sort of farming he was carrying on was nothing but a cruel and stubborn struggle between him and the laborers  in which there was on one side his side a continual intense effort to change everything to a pattern he considered better  on the other side  the natural order of things and in the struggle he saw that with immense expenditure of force on his side  and with no effort or even intention on the other side  all that was attained was that the work did not go to the liking of either side  and that splendid tools  splendid cattle and land were spoiled with no good to anyone
worst of all  the energy expended on this work was not simply wasted
he could not help feeling now  since the meaning of this system had become clear to him  that the aim of his energy was a most unworthy one
in reality  what was the struggle about  he was struggling for every farthing of his share (and he could not help it  for he had only to relax his efforts  and he would not have had the money to pay his anna karenina 703 of 1759 laborers  wages)  while they were only struggling to be able to do their work easily and agreeably  that is to say  as they were used to doing it
it was for his interests that every laborer should work as hard as possible  and that while doing so he should keep his wits about him  so as to try not to break the winnowing machines  the horse rakes  the thrashing machines  that he should attend to what he was doing
what the laborer wanted was to work as pleasantly as possible  with rests  and above all  carelessly and heedlessly  without thinking
that summer levin saw this at every step
he sent the men to mow some clover for hay  picking out the worst patches where the clover was overgrown with grass and weeds and of no use for seed  again and again they mowed the best acres of clover  justifying themselves by the pretense that the bailiff had told them to  and trying to pacify him with the assurance that it would be splendid hay  but he knew that it was owing to those acres being so much easier to mow he sent out a hay machine for pitching the hay it was broken at the first row because it was dull work for a peasant to sit on the seat in front with the great wings waving above him
and he was told   don t trouble  your honor  sure  the womenfolks will pitch it quick enough   the ploughs were practically useless  because it never anna karenina 704 of 1759 occurred to the laborer to raise the share when he turned the plough  and forcing it round  he strained the horses and tore up the ground  and levin was begged not to mind about it
the horses were allowed to stray into the wheat because not a single laborer would consent to be night watchman  and in spite of orders to the contrary  the laborers insisted on taking turns for night duty  and ivan  after working all day long  fell asleep  and was very penitent for his fault  saying   do what you will to me  your honor   they killed three of the best calves by letting them into the clover aftermath without care as to their drinking  and nothing would make the men believe that they had been blown out by the clover  but they told him  by way of consolation  that one of his neighbors had lost a hundred and twelve head of cattle in three days
all this happened  not because anyone felt ill will to levin or his farm  on the contrary  he knew that they liked him  thought him a simple gentleman (their highest praise)  but it happened simply because all they wanted was to work merrily and carelessly  and his interests were not only remote and incomprehensible to them  but fatally opposed to their most just claims long before  levin had felt dissatisfaction with his own position in regard to the land
he saw where anna karenina 705 of 1759 his boat leaked  but he did not look for the leak  perhaps purposely deceiving himself (nothing would be left him if he lost faith in it ) but now he could deceive himself no longer the farming of the land  as he was managing it  had become not merely unattractive but revolting to him  and he could take no further interest in it
to this now was joined the presence  only twenty five miles off  of kitty shtcherbatskaya  whom he longed to see and could not see
darya alexandrovna oblonskaya had invited him  when he was over there  to come  to come with the object of renewing his offer to her sister  who would  so she gave him to understand  accept him now
levin himself had felt on seeing kitty shtcherbatskaya that he had never ceased to love her  but he could not go over to the oblonskys   knowing she was there the fact that he had made her an offer  and she had refused him  had placed an insuperable barrier between her and him
 i can t ask her to be my wife merely because she can t be the wife of the man she wanted to marry   he said to himself the thought of this made him cold and hostile to her
 i should not be able to speak to her without a feeling of reproach  i could not look at her without resentment  and she will only hate me all the more  as she s bound to
and besides  how can i now  after what anna karenina 706 of 1759 darya alexandrovna told me  go to see them  can i help showing that i know what she told me  and me to go magnanimously to forgive her  and have pity on her  me go through a performance before her of forgiving  and deigning to bestow my love on her   
what induced darya alexandrovna to tell me that  by chance i might have seen her  then everything would have happened of itself  but  as it is  it s out of the question  out of the question   darya alexandrovna sent him a letter  asking him for a side saddle for kitty s use
 i m told you have a sidesaddle   she wrote to him   i hope you will bring it over yourself   this was more than he could stand
how could a woman of any intelligence  of any delicacy  put her sister in such a humiliating position  he wrote ten notes  and tore them all up  and sent the saddle without any reply
to write that he would go was impossible  because he could not go  to write that he could not come because something prevented him  or that he would be away  that was still worse
he sent the saddle without an answer  and with a sense of having done something shameful  he handed over all the now revolting business of the estate to the bailiff  and set off next day to a remote district to see anna karenina 707 of 1759 his friend sviazhsky  who had splendid marshes for grouse in his neighborhood  and had lately written to ask him to keep a long standing promise to stay with him
the grouse marsh  in the surovsky district  had long tempted levin  but he had continually put off this visit on account of his work on the estate
now he was glad to get away from the neighborhood of the shtcherbatskys  and still more from his farm work  especially on a shooting expedition  which always in trouble served as the best consolation
anna karenina 708 of 1759 in the surovsky district there was no railway nor service of post horses  and levin drove there with his own horses in his big  old fashioned carriage
he stopped halfway at a well to do peasant s to feed his horses
a bald  well preserved old man  with a broad  red beard  gray on his cheeks  opened the gate  squeezing against the gatepost to let the three horses pass
directing the coachman to a place under the shed in the big  clean  tidy yard  with charred  old fashioned ploughs in it  the old man asked levin to come into the parlor
a cleanly dressed young woman  with clogs on her bare feet  was scrubbing the floor in the new outer room
she was frightened of the dog  that ran in after levin  and uttered a shriek  but began laughing at her own fright at once when she was told the dog would not hurt her
pointing levin with her bare arm to the door into the parlor  she bent down again  hiding her handsome face  and went on scrubbing
 would you like the samovar   she asked
 yes  please   anna karenina 709 of 1759 the parlor was a big room  with a dutch stove  and a screen dividing it into two
under the holy pictures stood a table painted in patterns  a bench  and two chairs
near the entrance was a dresser full of crockery
the shutters were closed  there were few flies  and it was so clean that levin was anxious that laska  who had been running along the road and bathing in puddles  should not muddy the floor  and ordered her to a place in the corner by the door
after looking round the parlor  levin went out in the back yard
the good looking young woman in clogs  swinging the empty pails on the yoke  ran on before him to the well for water
 look sharp  my girl   the old man shouted after her  good humoredly  and he went up to levin
 well  sir  are you going to nikolay ivanovitch sviazhsky  his honor comes to us too   he began  chatting  leaning his elbows on the railing of the steps
in the middle of the old man s account of his acquaintance with sviazhsky  the gates creaked again  and laborers came into the yard from the fields  with wooden ploughs and harrows
the horses harnessed to the ploughs and harrows were sleek and fat
the laborers were obviously of the household  two were young men in cotton shirts and caps  the two others were hired laborers in homespun shirts  one an old man  the anna karenina 710 of 1759 other a young fellow
moving off from the steps  the old man went up to the horses and began unharnessing them
 what have they been ploughing   asked levin
 ploughing up the potatoes
we rent a bit of land too
fedot  don t let out the gelding  but take it to the trough  and we ll put the other in harness    oh  father  the ploughshares i ordered  has he brought them along   asked the big  healthy looking fellow  obviously the old man s son
 there   in the outer room   answered the old man  bundling together the harness he had taken off  and flinging it on the ground
 you can put them on  while they have dinner   the good looking young woman came into the outer room with the full pails dragging at her shoulders
more women came on the scene from somewhere  young and handsome  middle aged  old and ugly  with children and without children
the samovar was beginning to sing  the laborers and the family  having disposed of the horses  came in to dinner
levin  getting his provisions out of his carriage  invited the old man to take tea with him
anna karenina 711 of 1759  well  i have had some today already   said the old man  obviously accepting the invitation with pleasure
 but just a glass for company   over their tea levin heard all about the old man s farming
ten years before  the old man had rented three hundred acres from the lady who owned them  and a year ago he had bought them and rented another three hundred from a neighboring landowner
a small part of the land the worst part he let out for rent  while a hundred acres of arable land he cultivated himself with his family and two hired laborers the old man complained that things were doing badly
but levin saw that he simply did so from a feeling of propriety  and that his farm was in a flourishing condition
if it had been unsuccessful he would not have bought land at thirty five roubles the acre  he would not have married his three sons and a nephew  he would not have rebuilt twice after fires  and each time on a larger scale
in spite of the old man s complaints  it was evident that he was proud  and justly proud  of his prosperity  proud of his sons  his nephew  his sons  wives  his horses and his cows  and especially of the fact that he was keeping all this farming going
from his conversation with the old man  levin thought he was not averse to new methods either
he had planted a great many potatoes  and anna karenina 712 of 1759 his potatoes  as levin had seen driving past  were already past flowering and beginning to die down  while levin s were only just coming into flower
he earthed up his potatoes with a modern plough borrowed from a neighboring landowner
he sowed wheat
the trifling fact that  thinning out his rye  the old man used the rye he thinned out for his horses  specially struck levin
how many times had levin seen this splendid fodder wasted  and tried to get it saved  but always it had turned out to be impossible
the peasant got this done  and he could not say enough in praise of it as food for the beasts
 what have the wenches to do  they carry it out in bundles to the roadside  and the cart brings it away    well  we landowners can t manage well with our laborers   said levin  handing him a glass of tea
 thank you   said the old man  and he took the glass  but refused sugar  pointing to a lump he had left
 they re simple destruction   said he
 look at sviazhsky s  for instance
we know what the land s like first rate  yet there s not much of a crop to boast of
it s not looked after enough that s all it is    but you work your land with hired laborers   anna karenina 713 of 1759  we re all peasants together
we go into everything ourselves
if a man s no use  he can go  and we can manage by ourselves    father finogen wants some tar   said the young woman in the clogs  coming in
 yes  yes  that s how it is  sir   said the old man  getting up  and crossing himself deliberately  he thanked levin and went out when levin went into the kitchen to call his coachman he saw the whole family at dinner
the women were standing up waiting on them
the young  sturdylooking son was telling something funny with his mouth full of pudding  and they were all laughing  the woman in the clogs  who was pouring cabbage soup into a bowl  laughing most merrily of all
very probably the good looking face of the young woman in the dogs had a good deal to do with the impression of well being this peasant household made upon levin  but the impression was so strong that levin could never get rid of it
and all the way from the old peasant s to sviazhsky s he kept recalling this peasant farm as though there were something in this impression that demanded his special attention
anna karenina 714 of 1759 sviazhsky was the marshal of his district
he was five years older than levin  and had long been married
his sister in law  a young girl levin liked very much  lived in his house  and levin knew that sviazhsky and his wife would have greatly liked to marry the girl to him
he knew this with certainty  as so called eligible young men always know it  though he could never have brought himself to speak of it to anyone  and he knew too that  although he wanted to get married  and although by every token this very attractive girl would make an excellent wife  he could no more have married her  even if he had not been in love with kitty shtcherbatskaya  than he could have flown up to the sky and this knowledge poisoned the pleasure he had hoped to find in the visit to sviazhsky
on getting sviazhsky s letter with the invitation for shooting  levin had immediately thought of this  but in spite of it he had made up his mind that sviazhsky s having such views for him was simply his own groundless supposition  and so he would go  all the same
besides  at the bottom of his heart he had a desire to try himself  put anna karenina 715 of 1759 himself to the test in regard to this girl the sviazhskys  home life was exceedingly pleasant  and sviazhsky himself  the best type of man taking part in local affairs that levin knew  was very interesting to him sviazhsky was one of those people  always a source of wonder to levin  whose convictions  very logical though never original  go one way by themselves  while their life  exceedingly definite and firm in its direction  goes its way quite apart and almost always in direct contradiction to their convictions sviazhsky was an extremely advanced man
he despised the nobility  and believed the mass of the nobility to be secretly in favor of serfdom  and only concealing their views from cowardice
he regarded russia as a ruined country  rather after the style of turkey  and the government of russia as so bad that he never permitted himself to criticize its doings seriously  and yet he was a functionary of that government and a model marshal of nobility  and when he drove about he always wore the cockade of office and the cap with the red band he considered human life only tolerable abroad  and went abroad to stay at every opportunity  and at the same time he carried on a complex and improved system of agriculture in russia  and with extreme interest followed everything and knew everything that was being done in anna karenina 716 of 1759 russia
he considered the russian peasant as occupying a stage of development intermediate between the ape and the man  and at the same time in the local assemblies no one was readier to shake hands with the peasants and listen to their opinion
he believed neither in god nor the devil  but was much concerned about the question of the improvement of the clergy and the maintenance of their revenues  and took special trouble to keep up the church in his village
on the woman question he was on the side of the extreme advocates of complete liberty for women  and especially their right to labor
but he lived with his wife on such terms that their affectionate childless home life was the admiration of everyone  and arranged his wife s life so that she did nothing and could do nothing but share her husband s efforts that her time should pass as happily and as agreeably as possible if it had not been a characteristic of levin s to put the most favorable interpretation on people  sviazhsky s character would have presented no doubt or difficulty to him  he would have said to himself   a fool or a knave   and everything would have seemed clear but he could not say  a fool   because sviazhsky was unmistakably clever  and moreover  a highly cultivated man  who was anna karenina 717 of 1759 exceptionally modest over his culture
there was not a subject he knew nothing of
but he did not display his knowledge except when he was compelled to do so
still less could levin say that he was a knave  as sviazhsky was unmistakably an honest  good hearted  sensible man  who worked good humoredly  keenly  and perseveringly at his work  he was held in high honor by everyone about him  and certainly he had never consciously done  and was indeed incapable of doing  anything base
levin tried to understand him  and could not understand him  and looked at him and his life as at a living enigma
levin and he were very friendly  and so levin used to venture to sound sviazhsky  to try to get at the very foundation of his view of life  but it was always in vain
every time levin tried to penetrate beyond the outer chambers of sviazhsky s mind  which were hospitably open to all  he noticed that sviazhsky was slightly disconcerted  faint signs of alarm were visible in his eyes  as though he were afraid levin would understand him  and he would give him a kindly  good humored repulse
just now  since his disenchantment with farming  levin was particularly glad to stay with sviazhsky
apart from the fact that the sight of this happy and affectionate anna karenina 718 of 1759 couple  so pleased with themselves and everyone else  and their well ordered home had always a cheering effect on levin  he felt a longing  now that he was so dissatisfied with his own life  to get at that secret in sviazhsky that gave him such clearness  definiteness  and good courage in life moreover  levin knew that at sviazhsky s he should meet the landowners of the neighborhood  and it was particularly interesting for him just now to hear and take part in those rural conversations concerning crops  laborers  wages  and so on  which  he was aware  are conventionally regarded as something very low  but which seemed to him just now to constitute the one subject of importance
 it was not  perhaps  of importance in the days of serfdom  and it may not be of importance in england
in both cases the conditions of agriculture are firmly established  but among us now  when everything has been turned upside down and is only just taking shape  the question what form these conditions will take is the one question of importance in russia   thought levin
the shooting turned out to be worse than levin had expected
the marsh was dry and there were no grouse at all
he walked about the whole day and only brought back three birds  but to make up for that he brought back  as he always did from shooting  an excellent anna karenina 719 of 1759 appetite  excellent spirits  and that keen  intellectual mood which with him always accompanied violent physical exertion
and while out shooting  when he seemed to be thinking of nothing at all  suddenly the old man and his family kept coming back to his mind  and the impression of them seemed to claim not merely his attention  but the solution of some question connected with them
in the evening at tea  two landowners who had come about some business connected with a wardship were of the party  and the interesting conversation levin had been looking forward to sprang up
levin was sitting beside his hostess at the tea table  and was obliged to keep up a conversation with her and her sister  who was sitting opposite him
madame sviazhskaya was a round faced  fair haired  rather short woman  all smiles and dimples
levin tried through her to get a solution of the weighty enigma her husband presented to his mind  but he had not complete freedom of ideas  because he was in an agony of embarrassment
this agony of embarrassment was due to the fact that the sister in law was sitting opposite to him  in a dress  specially put on  as he fancied  for his benefit  cut particularly open  in the shape of a trapeze  on her white bosom
this quadrangular opening  in spite of the bosom s being very white  or just anna karenina 720 of 1759 because it was very white  deprived levin of the full use of his faculties
he imagined  probably mistakenly  that this low necked bodice had been made on his account  and felt that he had no right to look at it  and tried not to look at it  but he felt that he was to blame for the very fact of the low necked bodice having been made
it seemed to levin that he had deceived someone  that he ought to explain something  but that to explain it was impossible  and for that reason he was continually blushing  was ill at ease and awkward
his awkwardness infected the pretty sister in law too
but their hostess appeared not to observe this  and kept purposely drawing her into the conversation
 you say   she said  pursuing the subject that had been started   that my husband cannot be interested in what s russian
it s quite the contrary  he is always in cheerful spirits abroad  but not as he is here
here  he feels in his proper place
he has so much to do  and he has the faculty of interesting himself in everything oh  you ve not been to see our school  have you    i ve seen it   
the little house covered with ivy  isn t it    yes  that s nastia s work   she said  indicating her sister
anna karenina 721 of 1759  you teach in it yourself   asked levin  trying to look above the open neck  but feeling that wherever he looked in that direction he should see it
 yes  i used to teach in it myself  and do teach still  but we have a first rate schoolmistress now
and we ve started gymnastic exercises    no  thank you  i won t have any more tea   said levin  and conscious of doing a rude thing  but incapable of continuing the conversation  he got up  blushing
 i hear a very interesting conversation   he added  and walked to the other end of the table  where sviazhsky was sitting with the two gentlemen of the neighborhood
sviazhsky was sitting sideways  with one elbow on the table  and a cup in one hand  while with the other hand he gathered up his beard  held it to his nose and let it drop again  as though he were smelling it
his brilliant black eyes were looking straight at the excited country gentleman with gray whiskers  and apparently he derived amusement from his remarks
the gentleman was complaining of the peasants
it was evident to levin that sviazhsky knew an answer to this gentleman s complaints  which would at once demolish his whole contention  but that in his position he could not give utterance to this anna karenina 722 of 1759 answer  and listened  not without pleasure  to the landowner s comic speeches
the gentleman with the gray whiskers was obviously an inveterate adherent of serfdom and a devoted agriculturist  who had lived all his life in the country
levin saw proofs of this in his dress  in the old fashioned threadbare coat  obviously not his everyday attire  in his shrewd deep set eyes  in his idiomatic  fluent russian  in the imperious tone that had become habitual from long use  and in the resolute gestures of his large  red  sunburnt hands  with an old betrothal ring on the little finger
anna karenina 723 of 1759  if i d only the heart to throw up what s been set going   such a lot of trouble wasted   i d turn my back on the whole business  sell up  go off like nikolay ivanovitch   to hear la belle helene   said the landowner  a pleasant smile lighting up his shrewd old face
 but you see you don t throw it up   said nikolay ivanovitch sviazhsky   so there must be something gained    the only gain is that i live in my own house  neither bought nor hired
besides  one keeps hoping the people will learn sense
though  instead of that  you d never believe it the drunkenness  the immorality  they keep chopping and changing their bits of land
not a sight of a horse or a cow
the peasant s dying of hunger  but just go and take him on as a laborer  he ll do his best to do you a mischief  and then bring you up before the justice of the peace    but then you make complaints to the justice too   said sviazhsky
 i lodge complaints  not for anything in the world  such a talking  and such a to do  that one would have anna karenina 724 of 1759 cause to regret it
at the works  for instance  they pocketed the advance money and made off
what did the justice do  why  acquitted them
nothing keeps them in order but their own communal court and their village elder
he ll flog them in the good old style  but for that there d be nothing for it but to give it all up and run away   obviously the landowner was chaffing sviazhsky  who  far from resenting it  was apparently amused by it
 but you see we manage our land without such extreme measures   said he  smiling   levin and i and this gentleman   he indicated the other landowner
 yes  the thing s done at mihail petrovitch s  but ask him how it s done
do you call that a rational system   said the landowner  obviously rather proud of the word  rational    my system s very simple   said mihail petrovitch   thank god
all my management rests on getting the money ready for the autumn taxes  and the peasants come to me   father  master  help us   well  the peasants are all one s neighbors  one feels for them
so one advances them a third  but one says   remember  lads  i have helped you  and you must help me when i need it whether it s the anna karenina 725 of 1759 sowing of the oats  or the haycutting  or the harvest   and well  one agrees  so much for each taxpayer though there are dishonest ones among them too  it s true   levin  who had long been familiar with these patriarchal methods  exchanged glances with sviazhsky and interrupted mihail petrovitch  turning again to the gentleman with the gray whiskers
 then what do you think   he asked   what system is one to adopt nowadays    why  manage like mihail petrovitch  or let the land for half the crop or for rent to the peasants  that one can do only that s just how the general prosperity of the country is being ruined
where the land with serf labor and good management gave a yield of nine to one  on the half crop system it yields three to one
russia has been ruined by the emancipation   sviazhsky looked with smiling eyes at levin  and even made a faint gesture of irony to him  but levin did not think the landowner s words absurd  he understood them better than he did sviazhsky
a great deal more of what the gentleman with the gray whiskers said to show in what way russia was ruined by the emancipation struck him indeed as very true  new to him  and quite incontestable
the landowner unmistakably spoke his own individual anna karenina 726 of 1759 thought a thing that very rarely happens and a thought to which he had been brought not by a desire of finding some exercise for an idle brain  but a thought which had grown up out of the conditions of his life  which he had brooded over in the solitude of his village  and had considered in every aspect
 the point is  don t you see  that progress of every sort is only made by the use of authority   he said  evidently wishing to show he was not without culture
 take the reforms of peter  of catherine  of alexander take european history
and progress in agriculture more than anything else the potato  for instance  that was introduced among us by force
the wooden plough too wasn t always used
it was introduced maybe in the days before the empire  but it was probably brought in by force
now  in our own day  we landowners in the serf times used various improvements in our husbandry  drying machines and thrashing machines  and carting manure and all the modern implements all that we brought into use by our authority  and the peasants opposed it at first  and ended by imitating us
now by the abolition of serfdom we have been deprived of our authority  and so our husbandry  where it had been raised to a high level  is anna karenina 727 of 1759 bound to sink to the most savage primitive condition
that s how i see it    but why so  if it s rational  you ll be able to keep up the same system with hired labor   said sviazhsky
 we ve no power over them
with whom am i going to work the system  allow me to ask    there it is the labor force the chief element in agriculture   thought levin
 with laborers    the laborers won t work well  and won t work with good implements
our laborer can do nothing but get drunk like a pig  and when he s drunk he ruins everything you give him
he makes the horses ill with too much water  cuts good harness  barters the tires of the wheels for drink  drops bits of iron into the thrashing machine  so as to break it
he loathes the sight of anything that s not after his fashion
and that s how it is the whole level of husbandry has fallen
lands gone out of cultivation  overgrown with weeds  or divided among the peasants  and where millions of bushels were raised you get a hundred thousand  the wealth of the country has decreased
if the same thing had been done  but with care that    anna karenina 728 of 1759 and he proceeded to unfold his own scheme of emancipation by means of which these drawbacks might have been avoided
this did not interest levin  but when he had finished  levin went back to his first position  and  addressing sviazhsky  and trying to draw him into expressing his serious opinion    that the standard of culture is falling  and that with our present relations to the peasants there is no possibility of famling on a rational system to yield a profit that s perfectly true   said he
 i don t believe it   sviazhsky replied quite seriously   all i see is that we don t know how to cultivate the land  and that our system of agriculture in the serf days was by no means too high  but too low
we have no machines  no good stock  no efficient supervision  we don t even know how to keep accounts
ask any landowner  he won t be able to tell you what crop s profitable  and what s not    italian bookkeeping   said the gentleman of the gray whiskers ironically
 you may keep your books as you like  but if they spoil everything for you  there won t be any profit    why do they spoil things  a poor thrashing machine  or your russian presser  they will break  but my steam anna karenina 729 of 1759 press they don t break
a wretched russian nag they ll ruin  but keep good dray horses they won t ruin them and so it is all round
we must raise our farming to a higher level    oh  if one only had the means to do it  nikolay ivanovitch  it s all very well for you  but for me  with a son to keep at the university  lads to be educated at the high school how am i going to buy these dray horses    well  that s what the land banks are for    to get what s left me sold by auction  no  thank you    i don t agree that it s necessary or possible to raise the level of agriculture still higher   said levin
 i devote myself to it  and i have means  but i can do nothing
as to the banks  i don t know to whom they re any good
for my part  anyway  whatever i ve spent money on in the way of husbandry  it has been a loss  stock a loss  machinery a loss    that s true enough   the gentleman with the gray whiskers chimed in  positively laughing with satisfaction
 and i m not the only one   pursued levin
 i mix with all the neighboring landowners  who are cultivating their land on a rational system  they all  with rare exceptions  are doing so at a loss
come  tell us how does your land do does it pay   said levin  and at once in sviazhsky s anna karenina 730 of 1759 eyes he detected that fleeting expression of alarm which he had noticed whenever he had tried to penetrate beyond the outer chambers of sviazhsky s mind
moreover  this question on levin s part was not quite in good faith
madame sviazhskaya had just told him at tea that they had that summer invited a gemman expert in bookkeeping from moscow  who for a consideration of five hundred roubles had investigated the management of their property  and found that it was costing them a loss of three thousand odd roubles
she did not remember the precise sum  but it appeared that the gemman had worked it out to the fraction of a farthing
the gray whiskered landowner smiled at the mention of the profits of sviazhsky s famling  obviously aware how much gain his neighbor and marshal was likely to be making
 possibly it does not pay   answered sviazhsky
 that merely proves either that i m a bad manager  or that i ve sunk my capital for the increase of my rents    oh  rent   levin cried with horror
 rent there may be in europe  where land has been improved by the labor put into it  but with us all the land is deteriorating from the labor put into it in other words they re working it out  so there s no question of rent   anna karenina 731 of 1759  how no rent  it s a law    then we re outside the law  rent explains nothing for us  but simply muddles us
no  tell me how there can be a theory of rent      will you have some junket  masha  pass us some junket or raspberries   he turned to his wife
 extraordinarily late the raspberries are lasting this year   and in the happiest frame of mind sviazhsky got up and walked off  apparently supposing the conversation to have ended at the very point when to levin it seemed that it was only just beginning
having lost his antagonist  levin continued the conversation with the gray whiskered landowner  trying to prove to him that all the difficulty arises from the fact that we don t find out the peculiarities and habits of our laborer  but the landowner  like all men who think independently and in isolation  was slow in taking in any other person s idea  and particularly partial to his own
he stuck to it that the russian peasant is a swine and likes swinishness  and that to get him out of his swinishness one must have authority  and there is none  one must have the stick  and we have become so liberal that we have all of a sudden replaced the stick that served us for a thousand years by lawyers and model prisons  where the worthless  anna karenina 732 of 1759 stinking peasant is fed on good soup and has a fixed allowance of cubic feet of air
 what makes you think   said levin  trying to get back to the question   that it s impossible to find some relation to the laborer in which the labor would become productive    that never could be so with the russian peasantry  we ve no power over them   answered the landowner
 how can new conditions be found   said sviazhsky
having eaten some junket and lighted a cigarette  he came back to the discussion
 all possible relations to the labor force have been defined and studied   he said
 the relic of barbarism  the primitive commune with each guarantee for all  will disappear of itself  serfdom has been abolished there remains nothing but free labor  and its fomms are fixed and ready made  and must be adopted permanent hands  day laborers  rammers you can t get out of those forms    but europe is dissatisfied with these forms    dissatisfied  and seeking new ones and will find them  in all probability    that s just what i was meaning   answered levin
 why shouldn t we seek them for ourselves   anna karenina 733 of 1759  because it would be just like inventing afresh the means for constructing railways
they are ready  invented    but if they don t do for us  if they re stupid   said levin
and again he detected the expression of alarm in the eyes of sviazhsky
 oh  yes  we ll bury the world under our caps  we ve found the secret europe was seeking for  i ve heard all that  but  excuse me  do you know all that s been done in europe on the question of the organization of labor    no  very little    that question is now absorbing the best minds in europe
the schulze delitsch movement   
and then all this enormous literature of the labor question  the most liberal lassalle movement   the mulhausen experiment  that s a fact by now  as you re probably aware    i have some idea of it  but very vague    no  you only say that  no doubt you know all about it as well as i do
i m not a professor of sociology  of course  but it interested me  and really  if it interests you  you ought to study it    but what conclusion have they come to    excuse me    anna karenina 734 of 1759 the two neighbors had risen  and sviazhsky  once more checking levin in his inconvenient habit of peeping into what was beyond the outer chambers of his mind  went to see his guests out
anna karenina 735 of 1759 levin was insufferably bored that evening with the ladies  he was stirred as he had never been before by the idea that the dissatisfaction he was feeling with his system of managing his land was not an exceptional case  but the general condition of things in russia  that the organization of some relation of the laborers to the soil in which they would work  as with the peasant he had met half way to the sviazhskys   was not a dream  but a problem which must be solved
and it seemed to him that the problem could be solved  and that he ought to try and solve it
after saying good night to the ladies  and promising to stay the whole of the next day  so as to make an expedition on horseback with them to see an interesting ruin in the crown forest  levin went  before going to bed  into his host s study to get the books on the labor question that sviazhsky had offered him
sviazhsky s study was a huge room  surrounded by bookcases and with two tables in it one a massive writing table  standing in the middle of the room  and the other a round table  covered with recent numbers of reviews and journals in different languages  ranged like the rays of a star round the lamp
anna karenina 736 of 1759 on the writing table was a stand of drawers marked with gold lettering  and full of papers of various sorts
sviazhsky took out the books  and sat down in a rocking chair
 what are you looking at there   he said to levin  who was standing at the round table looking through the reviews
 oh  yes  there s a very interesting article here   said sviazhsky of the review levin was holding in his hand
 it appears   he went on  with eager interest   that friedrich was not  after all  the person chiefly responsible for the partition of poland
it is proved    and with his characteristic clearness  he summed up those new  very important  and interesting revelations
although levin was engrossed at the moment by his ideas about the problem of the land  he wondered  as he heard sviazhsky   what is there inside of him  and why  why is he interested in the partition of poland   when sviazhsky had finished  levin could not help asking   well  and what then   but there was nothing to follow
it was simply interesting that it had been proved to be so and so
but sviazhsky did not explain  and saw no need to explain why it was interesting to him
anna karenina 737 of 1759  yes  but i was very much interested by your irritable neighbor   said levin  sighing
 he s a clever fellow  and said a lot that was true    oh  get along with you  an inveterate supporter of serfdom at heart  like all of them   said sviazhsky
 whose marshal you are    yes  only i marshal them in the other direction   said sviazhsky  laughing
 i ll tell you what interests me very much   said levin
 he s right that our system  that s to say of rational farming  doesn t answer  that the only thing that answers is the money lender system  like that meek looking gentleman s  or else the very simplest   
whose fault is it    our own  of course
besides  it s not true that it doesn t answer
it answers with vassiltchikov    a factory     but i really don t know what it is you are surprised at
the people are at such a low stage of rational and moral development  that it s obvious they re bound to oppose everything that s strange to them
in europe  a rational system answers because the people are educated  it follows that we must educate the people that s all    but how are we to educate the people   anna karenina 738 of 1759  to educate the people three things are needed  schools  and schools  and schools
 but you said yourself the people are at such a low stage of material development  what help are schools for that    do you know  you remind me of the story of the advice given to the sick man you should try purgative medicine
taken  worse
try leeches
tried them  worse
well  then  there s nothing left but to pray to god
tried it  worse
that s just how it is with us
i say political economy  you say worse
i say socialism  worse
education  worse    but how do schools help matters    they give the peasant fresh wants    well  that s a thing i ve never understood   levin replied with heat
 in what way are schools going to help the people to improve their material position  you say schools  education  will give them fresh wants
so much the worse  since they won t be capable of satisfying them
and in what way a knowledge of addition and subtraction and the catechism is going to improve their material condition  i never could make out
the day before yesterday  i met a peasant woman in the evening with a little baby  and asked her where she was going
she said she was going to the wise woman  her boy had screaming anna karenina 739 of 1759 fits  so she was taking him to be doctored
i asked   why  how does the wise woman cure screaming fits    she puts the child on the hen roost and repeats some charm         well  you re saying it yourself  what s wanted to prevent her taking her child to the hen roost to cure it of screaming fits is just     sviazhsky said  smiling goodhumoredly
 oh  no   said levin with annoyance   that method of doctoring i merely meant as a simile for doctoring the people with schools
the people are poor and ignorant  that we see as surely as the peasant woman sees the baby is ill because it screams but in what way this trouble of poverty and ignorance is to be cured by schools is as incomprehensible as how the hen roost affects the screaming
what has to be cured is what makes him poor    well  in that  at least  you re in agreement with spencer  whom you dislike so much
he says  too  that education may be the consequence of greater prosperity and comfort  of more frequent washing  as he says  but not of being able to read and write     well  then  i m very glad or the contrary  very sorry  that i m in agreement with spencer  only i ve known it a long while
schools can do no good  what will do good is an economic organization in which the people will anna karenina 740 of 1759 become richer  will have more leisure and then there will be schools    still  all over europe now schools are obligatory    and how far do you agree with spencer yourself about it   asked levin
but there was a gleam of alarm in sviazhsky s eyes  and he said smiling   no  that screaming story is positively capital  did you really hear it yourself   levin saw that he was not to discover the connection between this man s life and his thoughts
obviously he did not care in the least what his reasoning led him to  all he wanted was the process of reasoning
and he did not like it when the process of reasoning brought him into a blind alley
that was the only thing he disliked  and avoided by changing the conversation to something agreeable and amusing
all the impressions of the day  beginning with the impression made by the old peasant  which served  as it were  as the fundamental basis of all the conceptions and ideas of the day  threw levin into violent excitement
this dear good sviazhsky  keeping a stock of ideas simply for social purposes  and obviously having some other principles hidden from levin  while with the crowd  anna karenina 741 of 1759 whose name is legion  he guided public opinion by ideas he did not share  that irascible country gentleman  perfectly correct in the conclusions that he had been worried into by life  but wrong in his exasperation against a whole class  and that the best class in russia  his own dissatisfaction with the work he had been doing  and the vague hope of finding a remedy for all this all was blended in a sense of inward turmoil  and anticipation of some solution near at hand
left alone in the room assigned him  lying on a spring mattress that yielded unexpectedly at every movement of his arm or his leg  levin did not fall asleep for a long while
not one conversation with sviazhsky  though he had said a great deal that was clever  had interested levin  but the conclusions of the irascible landowner required consideration
levin could not help recalling every word he had said  and in imagination amending his own replies
 yes  i ought to have said to him  you say that our husbandry does not answer because the peasant hates improvements  and that they must be forced on him by authority
if no system of husbandry answered at all without these improvements  you would be quite right
but the only system that does answer is where laborer is working in accordance with his habits  just as on the old anna karenina 742 of 1759 peasant s land half way here
your and our general dissatisfaction with the system shows that either we are to blame or the laborers
we have gone our way the european way a long while  without asking ourselves about the qualities of our labor force
let us try to look upon the labor force not as an abstract force  but as the russian peasant with his instincts  and we shall arrange our system of culture in accordance with that
imagine  i ought to have said to him  that you have the same system as the old peasant has  that you have found means of making your laborers take an interest in the success of the work  and have found the happy mean in the way of improvements which they will admit  and you will  without exhausting the soil  get twice or three times the yield you got before
divide it in halves  give half as the share of labor  the surplus left you will be greater  and the share of labor will be greater too
and to do this one must lower the standard of husbandry and interest the laborers in its success
how to do this  that s a matter of detail  but undoubtedly it can be done   this idea threw levin into a great excitement
he did not sleep half the night  thinking over in detail the putting of his idea into practice
he had not intended to go away next day  but he now determined to go home early in the anna karenina 743 of 1759 morning
besides  the sister in law with her low necked bodice aroused in him a feeling akin to shame and remorse for some utterly base action
most important of all he must get back without delay  he would have to make haste to put his new project to the peasants before the sowing of the winter wheat  so that the sowing might be undertaken on a new basis
he had made up his mind to revolutionize his whole system
anna karenina 744 of 1759 the carrying out of levin s plan presented many difficulties  but he struggled on  doing his utmost  and attained a result which  though not what he desired  was enough to enable him  without self deception  to believe that the attempt was worth the trouble
one of the chief difficulties was that the process of cultivating the land was in full swing  that it was impossible to stop everything and begin it all again from the beginning  and the machine had to be mended while in motion
when on the evening that he arrived home he informed the bailiff of his plans  the latter with visible pleasure agreed with what he said so long as he was pointing out that all that had been done up to that time was stupid and useless
the bailiff said that he had said so a long while ago  but no heed had been paid him
but as for the proposal made by levin to take a part as shareholder with his laborers in each agricultural undertaking  at this the bailiff simply expressed a profound despondency  and offered no definite opinion  but began immediately talking of the urgent necessity of carrying the remaining sheaves of rye the next day  and of sending the men out for the anna karenina 745 of 1759 second ploughing  so that levin felt that this was not the time for discussing it
on beginning to talk to the peasants about it  and making a proposition to cede them the land on new terms  he came into collision with the same great difficulty that they were so much absorbed by the current work of the day  that they had not time to consider the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed scheme the simple hearted ivan  the cowherd  seemed completely to grasp levin s proposal that he should with his family take a share of the profits of the cattle yard  and he was in complete sympathy with the plan
but when levin hinted at the future advantages  ivan s face expressed alarm and regret that he could not hear all he had to say  and he made haste to find himself some task that would admit of no delay  he either snatched up the fork to pitch the hay out of the pens  or ran to get water or to clear out the dung another difficulty lay in the invincible disbelief of the peasant that a landowner s object could be anything else than a desire to squeeze all he could out of them
they were firmly convinced that his real aim (whatever he might say to them) would always be in what he did not say to them
and they themselves  in giving their opinion  anna karenina 746 of 1759 said a great deal but never said what was their real object moreover (levin felt that the irascible landowner had been right) the peasants made their first and unalterable condition of any agreement whatever that they should not be forced to any new methods of tillage of any kind  nor to use new implements
they agreed that the modern plough ploughed better  that the scarifier did the work more quickly  but they found thousands of reasons that made it out of the question for them to use either of them  and though he had accepted the conviction that he would have to lower the standard of cultivation  he felt sorry to give up improved methods  the advantages of which were so obvious
but in spite of all these difficulties he got his way  and by autumn the system was working  or at least so it seemed to him
at first levin had thought of giving up the whole farming of the land just as it was to the peasants  the laborers  and the bailiff on new conditions of partnership  but he was very soon convinced that this was impossible  and determined to divide it up
the cattle yard  the garden  hay fields  and arable land  divided into several parts  had to be made into separate lots
the simplehearted cowherd  ivan  who  levin fancied  understood the matter better than any of them  collecting together a anna karenina 747 of 1759 gang of workers to help him  principally of his own family  became a partner in the cattle yard
a distant part of the estate  a tract of waste land that had lain fallow for eight years  was with the help of the clever carpenter  fyodor ryezunov  taken by six families of peasants on new conditions of partnership  and the peasant shuraev took the management of all the vegetable gardens on the same terms the remainder of the land was still worked on the old system  but these three associated partnerships were the first step to a new organization of the whole  and they completely took up levin s time
it is true that in the cattle yard things went no better than before  and ivan strenuously opposed warm housing for the cows and butter made of fresh cream  affirming that cows require less food if kept cold  and that butter is more profitable made from sour cream  and he asked for wages just as under the old system  and took not the slightest interest in the fact that the money he received was not wages but an advance out of his future share in the profits
it is true that fyodor ryezunov s company did not plough over the ground twice before sowing  as had been agreed  justifying themselves on the plea that the time was too short it is true that the peasants of the same company  anna karenina 748 of 1759 though they had agreed to work the land on new conditions  always spoke of the land  not as held in partnership  but as rented for half the crop  and more than once the peasants and ryezunov himself said to levin   if you would take a rent for the land  it would save you trouble  and we should be more free   moreover the same peasants kept putting off  on various excuses  the building of a cattleyard and barn on the land as agreed upon  and delayed doing it till the winter it is true that shuraev would have liked to let out the kitchen gardens he had undertaken in small lots to the peasants
he evidently quite misunderstood  and apparently intentionally misunderstood  the conditions upon which the land had been given to him
often  too  talking to the peasants and explaining to them all the advantages of the plan  levin felt that the peasants heard nothing but the sound of his voice  and were firmly resolved  whatever he might say  not to let themselves be taken in he felt this especially when he talked to the cleverest of the peasants  ryezunov  and detected the gleam in ryezunov s eyes which showed so plainly both ironical amusement at levin  and the firm conviction that  if any one were to be taken in  it would not be he  ryezunov
but in spite of all this levin anna karenina 749 of 1759 thought the system worked  and that by keeping accounts strictly and insisting on his own way  he would prove to them in the future the advantages of the arrangement  and then the system would go of itself
these matters  together with the management of the land still left on his hands  and the indoor work over his book  so engrossed levin the whole summer that he scarcely ever went out shooting
at the end of august he heard that the oblonskys had gone away to moscow  from their servant who brought back the side saddle
he felt that in not answering darya alexandrovna s letter he had by his rudeness  of which he could not think without a flush of shame  burned his ships  and that he would never go and see them again
he had been just as rude with the sviazhskys  leaving them without saying goodbye
but he would never go to see them again either
he did not care about that now
the business of reorganizing the farming of his land absorbed him as completely as though there would never be anything else in his life
he read the books lent him by sviazhsky  and copying out what he had not got  he read both the economic and socialistic books on the subject  but  as he had anticipated  found nothing bearing on the scheme he had undertaken
in the books on political economy in mill  for instance  anna karenina 750 of 1759 whom he studied first with great ardor  hoping every minute to find an answer to the questions that were engrossing him he found laws deduced from the condition of land culture in europe  but he did not see why these laws  which did not apply in russia  must be general
he saw just the same thing in the socialistic books  either they were the beautiful but impracticable fantasies which had fascinated him when he was a student  or they were attempts at improving  rectifying the economic position in which europe was placed  with which the system of land tenure in russia had nothing in common
political economy told him that the laws by which the wealth of europe had been developed  and was developing  were universal and unvarying
socialism told him that development along these lines leads to ruin
and neither of them gave an answer  or even a hint  in reply to the question what he  levin  and all the russian peasants and landowners  were to do with their millions of hands and millions of acres  to make them as productive as possible for the common weal
having once taken the subject up  he read conscientiously everything bearing on it  and intended in the autumn to go abroad to study land systems on the spot  in order that he might not on this question be anna karenina 751 of 1759 confronted with what so often met him on various subjects often  just as he was beginning to understand the idea in the mind of anyone he was talking to  and was beginning to explain his own  he would suddenly be told   but kauffmann  but jones  but dubois  but michelli  you haven t read them  they ve thrashed that question out thoroughly   he saw now distinctly that kauffmann and michelli had nothing to tell him
he knew what he wanted
he saw that russia has splendid land  splendid laborers  and that in certain cases  as at the peasant s on the way to sviazhsky s  the produce raised by the laborers and the land is great in the majority of cases when capital is applied in the european way the produce is small  and that this simply arises from the fact that the laborers want to work and work well only in their own peculiar way  and that this antagonism is not incidental but invariable  and has its roots in the national spirit
he thought that the russian people whose task it was to colonize and cultivate vast tracts of unoccupied land  consciously adhered  till all their land was occupied  to the methods suitable to their purpose  and that their methods were by no means so bad as was generally supposed
and he wanted to prove this theoretically in his book and practically on his land
anna karenina 752 of 1759 at the end of september the timber had been carted for building the cattleyard on the land that had been allotted to the association of peasants  and the butter from the cows was sold and the profits divided
in practice the system worked capitally  or  at least  so it seemed to levin
in order to work out the whole subject theoretically and to complete his book  which  in levin s daydreams  was not merely to effect a revolution in political economy  but to annihilate that science entirely and to lay the foundation of a new science of the relation of the people to the soil  all that was left to do was to make a tour abroad  and to study on the spot all that had been done in the same direction  and to collect conclusive evidence that all that had been done there was not what was wanted levin was only waiting for the delivery of his wheat to receive the money for it and go abroad
but the rains began  preventing the harvesting of the corn and potatoes left in the fields  and putting a stop to all work  even to the delivery of the wheat
the mud was impassable along the roads  two mills were carried away  and the weather got worse and worse
anna karenina 753 of 1759 on the 30th of september the sun came out in the morning  and hoping for fine weather  levin began making final preparations for his journey
he gave orders for the wheat to be delivered  sent the bailiff to the merchant to get the money owing him  and went out himself to give some final directions on the estate before setting off having finished all his business  soaked through with the streams of water which kept running down the leather behind his neck and his gaiters  but in the keenest and most confident temper  levin returned homewards in the evening the weather had become worse than ever towards evening  the hail lashed the drenched mare so cruelly that she went along sideways  shaking her head and ears  but levin was all right under his hood  and he looked cheerfully about him at the muddy streams running under the wheels  at the drops hanging on every bare twig  at the whiteness of the patch of unmelted hailstones on the planks of the bridge  at the thick layer of still juicy  fleshy leaves that lay heaped up about the stripped elm tree in spite of the gloominess of nature around him  he felt peculiarly eager
the talks he had been having with the peasants in the further village had shown that they were beginning to get used to their new position
the old anna karenina 754 of 1759 servant to whose hut he had gone to get dry evidently approved of levin s plan  and of his own accord proposed to enter the partnership by the purchase of cattle
 i have only to go stubbornly on towards my aim  and i shall attain my end   thought levin   and it s something to work and take trouble for
this is not a matter of myself individually  the question of the public welfare comes into it
the whole system of culture  the chief element in the condition of the people  must be completely transformed
instead of poverty  general prosperity and content  instead of hostility  harmony and unity of interests
in short  a bloodless revolution  but a revolution of the greatest magnitude  beginning in the little circle of our district  then the province  then russia  the whole world
because a just idea cannot but be fruitful
yes  it s an aim worth working for
and it s being me  kostya levin  who went to a ball in a black tie  and was refused by the shtcherbatskaya girl  and who was intrinsically such a pitiful  worthless creature that proves nothing  i feel sure franklin felt just as worthless  and he too had no faith in himself  thinking of himself as a whole that means nothing
and he too  most likely  had an agafea mihalovna to whom he confided his secrets   anna karenina 755 of 1759 musing on such thoughts levin reached home in the darkness
the bailiff  who had been to the merchant  had come back and brought part of the money for the wheat
an agreement had been made with the old servant  and on the road the bailiff had learned that everywhere the corn was still standing in the fields  so that his one hundred and sixty shocks that had not been carried were nothing in comparison with the losses of others
after dinner levin was sitting  as he usually did  in an easy chair with a book  and as he read he went on thinking of the journey before him in connection with his book
today all the significance of his book rose before him with special distinctness  and whole periods ranged themselves in his mind in illustration of his theories  i must write that down   he thought
 that ought to form a brief introduction  which i thought unnecessary before   he got up to go to his writing table  and laska  lying at his feet  got up too  stretching and looking at him as though to inquire where to go but he had not time to write it down  for the head peasants had come round  and levin went out into the hall to them
after his levee  that is to say  giving directions about the labors of the next day  and seeing all the peasants who anna karenina 756 of 1759 had business with him  levin went back to his study and sat down to work
laska lay under the table  agafea mihalovna settled herself in her place with her stocking
after writing for a little while  levin suddenly thought with exceptional vividness of kitty  her refusal  and their last meeting
he got up and began walking about the room
 what s the use of being dreary   said agafea mihalovna
 come  why do you stay on at home  you ought to go to some warm springs  especially now you re ready for the journey    well  i am going away the day after tomorrow  agafea mihalovna  i must finish my work    there  there  your work  you say  as if you hadn t done enough for the peasants  why  as  tis  they re saying   your master will be getting some honor from the tsar for it   indeed and it is a strange thing  why need you worry about the peasants    i m not worrying about them  i m doing it for my own good   agafea mihalovna knew every detail of levin s plans for his land
levin often put his views before her in all their complexity  and not uncommonly he argued with anna karenina 757 of 1759 her and did not agree with her comments
but on this occasion she entirely misinterpreted what he had said
 of one s soul s salvation we all know and must think before all else   she said with a sigh
 parfen denisitch now  for all he was no scholar  he died a death that god grant every one of us the like   she said  referring to a servant who had died recently
 took the sacrament and all    that s not what i mean   said he
 i mean that i m acting for my own advantage
it s all the better for me if the peasants do their work better    well  whatever you do  if he s a lazy good for nought  everything ll be at sixes and sevens
if he has a conscience  he ll work  and if not  there s no doing anything    oh  come  you say yourself ivan has begun looking after the cattle better    all i say is   answered agafea mihalovna  evidently not speaking at random  but in strict sequence of idea   that you ought to get married  that s what i say   agafea mihalovna s allusion to the very subject he had only just been thinking about  hurt and stung him
levin scowled  and without answering her  he sat down again to his work  repeating to himself all that he had been thinking of the real significance of that work only at anna karenina 758 of 1759 intervals he listened in the stillness to the click of agafea mihalovna s needles  and recollecting what he did not want to remember  he frowned again
at nine o clock they heard the bell and the faint vibration of a carriage over the mud
 well  here s visitors come to us  and you won t be dull   said agafea mihalovna  getting up and going to the door
but levin overtook her
his work was not going well now  and he was glad of a visitor  whoever it might be
anna karenina 759 of 1759 running halfway down the staircase  levin caught a sound he knew  a familiar cough in the hall
but he heard it indistinctly through the sound of his own footsteps  and hoped he was mistaken
then he caught sight of a long  bony  familiar figure  and now it seemed there was no possibility of mistake  and yet he still went on hoping that this tall man taking off his fur cloak and coughing was not his brother nikolay
levin loved his brother  but being with him was always a torture
just now  when levin  under the influence of the thoughts that had come to him  and agafea mihalovna s hint  was in a troubled and uncertain humor  the meeting with his brother that he had to face seemed particularly difficult
instead of a lively  healthy visitor  some outsider who would  he hoped  cheer him up in his uncertain humor  he had to see his brother  who knew him through and through  who would call forth all the thoughts nearest his heart  would force him to show himself fully and that he was not disposed to do
angry with himself for so base a feeling  levin ran into the hall  as soon as he had seen his brother close  this anna karenina 760 of 1759 feeling of selfish disappointment vanished instantly and was replaced by pity terrible as his brother nikolay had been before in his emaciation and sickliness  now he looked still more emaciated  still more wasted
he was a skeleton covered with skin
he stood in the hall  jerking his long thin neck  and pulling the scarf off it  and smiled a strange and pitiful smile
when he saw that smile  submissive and humble  levin felt something clutching at his throat
 you see  i ve come to you   said nikolay in a thick voice  never for one second taking his eyes off his brother s face
 i ve been meaning to a long while  but i ve been unwell all the time
now i m ever so much better   he said  rubbing his beard with his big thin hands
 yes  yes   answered levin
and he felt still more frightened when  kissing him  he felt with his lips the dryness of his brother s skin and saw close to him his big eyes  full of a strange light
a few weeks before  konstantin levin had written to his brother that through the sale of the small part of the property  that had remained undivided  there was a sum of about two thousand roubles to come to him as his share
nikolay said that he had come now to take this money and  what was more important  to stay a while in the old anna karenina 761 of 1759 nest  to get in touch with the earth  so as to renew his strength like the heroes of old for the work that lay before him
in spite of his exaggerated stoop  and the emaciation that was so striking from his height  his movements were as rapid and abrupt as ever
levin led him into his study
his brother dressed with particular care a thing he never used to do combed his scanty  lank hair  and  smiling  went upstairs
he was in the most affectionate and good humored mood  just as levin often remembered him in childhood
he even referred to sergey ivanovitch without rancor
when he saw agafea mihalovna  he made jokes with her and asked after the old servants
the news of the death of parfen denisitch made a painful impression on him
a look of fear crossed his face  but he regained his serenity immediately
 of course he was quite old   he said  and changed the subject
 well  i ll spend a month or two with you  and then i m off to moscow
do you know  myakov has promised me a place there  and i m going into the service
now i m going to arrange my life quite differently   he went on
 you know i got rid of that woman    marya nikolaevna  why  what for   anna karenina 762 of 1759  oh  she was a horrid woman  she caused me all sorts of worries   but he did not say what the annoyances were
he could not say that he had cast off marya nikolaevna because the tea was weak  and  above all  because she would look after him  as though he were an invalid
 besides  i want to turn over a new leaf completely now
i ve done silly things  of course  like everyone else  but money s the last consideration  i don t regret it
so long as there s health  and my health  thank god  is quite restored   levin listened and racked his brains  but could think of nothing to say
nikolay probably felt the same  he began questioning his brother about his affairs  and levin was glad to talk about himself  because then he could speak without hypocrisy he told his brother of his plans and his doings
his brother listened  but evidently he was not interested by it
these two men were so akin  so near each other  that the slightest gesture  the tone of voice  told both more than could be said in words
both of them now had only one thought the illness of nikolay and the nearness of his death which stifled all else
but neither of them dared to speak of it  and so anna karenina 763 of 1759 whatever they said  not uttering the one thought that filled their minds was all falsehood
never had levin been so glad when the evening was over and it was time to go to bed
never with any outside person  never on any official visit had he been so unnatural and false as he was that evening
and the consciousness of this unnaturalness  and the remorse he felt at it  made him even more unnatural
he wanted to weep over his dying  dearly loved brother  and he had to listen and keep on talking of how he meant to live
as the house was damp  and only one bedroom had been kept heated  levin put his brother to sleep in his own bedroom behind a screen
his brother got into bed  and whether he slept or did not sleep  tossed about like a sick man  coughed  and when he could not get his throat clear  mumbled something
sometimes when his breathing was painful  he said   oh  my god   sometimes when he was choking he muttered angrily   ah  the devil   levin could not sleep for a long while  hearing him
his thoughts were of the most various  but the end of all his thoughts was the same  death
death  the inevitable end of all  for the first time presented itself to him with irresistible force
and death  which was here in this loved brother  groaning half asleep anna karenina 764 of 1759 and from habit calling without distinction on god and the devil  was not so remote as it had hitherto seemed to him
it was in himself too  he felt that if not today  tomorrow  if not tomorrow  in thirty years  wasn t it all the same  and what was this inevitable death he did not know  had never thought about it  and what was more  had not the power  had not the courage to think about it
 i work  i want to do something  but i had forgotten it must all end  i had forgotten death   he sat on his bed in the darkness  crouched up  hugging his knees  and holding his breath from the strain of thought  he pondered
but the more intensely he thought  the clearer it became to him that it was indubitably so  that in reality  looking upon life  he had forgotten one little fact that death will come  and all ends  that nothing was even worth beginning  and that there was no helping it anyway
yes  it was awful  but it was so
 but i am alive still
now what s to be done  what s to be done   he said in despair
he lighted a candle  got up cautiously and went to the looking glass  and began looking at his face and hair
yes  there were gray hairs about his temples
he opened his mouth
his back teeth were beginning to decay
he bared his muscular arms anna karenina 765 of 1759 yes  there was strength in them
but nikolay  who lay there breathing with what was left of lungs  had had a strong  healthy body too
and suddenly he recalled how they used to go to bed together as children  and how they only waited till fyodor bogdanitch was out of the room to fling pillows at each other and laugh  laugh irrepressibly  so that even their awe of fyodor bogdanitch could not check the effervescing  overbrimming sense of life and happiness
 and now that bent  hollow chest   and i  not knowing what will become of me  or wherefore     k   ha  k   ha  damnation  why do you keep fidgeting  why don t you go to sleep   his brother s voice called to him
 oh  i don t know  i m not sleepy    i have had a good sleep  i m not in a sweat now
just see  feel my shirt  it s all wet  isn t it   levin felt  withdrew behind the screen  and put out the candle  but for a long while he could not sleep
the question how to live had hardly begun to grow a little clearer to him  when a new  insoluble question presented itself death
 why  he s dying yes  he ll die in the spring  and how help him  what can i say to him  what do i know about it  i d even forgotten that it was at all   anna karenina 766 of 1759 levin had long before made the observation that when one is uncomfortable with people from their being excessively amenable and meek  one is apt very soon after to find things intolerable from their touchiness and irritability
he felt that this was how it would be with his brother
and his brother nikolay s gentleness did in fact not last out for long
the very next morning he began to be irritable  and seemed doing his best to find fault with his brother  attacking him on his tenderest points
levin felt himself to blame  and could not set things right he felt that if they had both not kept up appearances  but had spoken  as it is called  from the heart that is to say  had said only just what they were thinking and feeling they would simply have looked into each other s faces  and konstantin could only have said   you re dying  you re dying   and nikolay could only have answered   i know i m dying  but i m afraid  i m afraid  i m afraid   and they could have said nothing more  if they had said only what was in their hearts
but life like that was impossible  and so konstantin tried to do what he had been trying to do all his life  and never could learn to anna karenina 767 of 1759 do  though  as far as he could observe  many people knew so well how to do it  and without it there was no living at all
he tried to say what he was not thinking  but he felt continually that it had a ring of falsehood  that his brother detected him in it  and was exasperated at it
the third day nikolay induced his brother to explain his plan to him again  and began not merely attacking it  but intentionally confounding it with communism
 you ve simply borrowed an idea that s not your own  but you ve distorted it  and are trying to apply it where it s not applicable    but i tell you it s nothing to do with it
they deny the justice of property  of capital  of inheritance  while i do not deny this chief stimulus   (levin felt disgusted himself at using such expressions  but ever since he had been engrossed by his work  he had unconsciously come more and more frequently to use words not russian )  all i want is to regulate labor    which means  you ve borrowed an idea  stripped it of all that gave it its force  and want to make believe that it s something new   said nikolay  angrily tugging at his necktie  but my idea has nothing in common    anna karenina 768 of 1759  that  anyway   said nikolay levin  with an ironical smile  his eyes flashing malignantly   has the charm of  what s one to call it  geometrical symmetry  of clearness  of definiteness
it may be a utopia
but if once one allows the possibility of making of all the past a tabula rasa no property  no family  then labor would organize itself
but you gain nothing     why do you mix things up  i ve never been a communist    but i have  and i consider it s premature  but rational  and it has a future  just like christianity in its first ages    all that i maintain is that the labor force ought to be investigated from the point of view of natural science  that is to say  it ought to be studied  its qualities ascertained     but that s utter waste of time
that force finds a certain form of activity of itself  according to the stage of its development
there have been slaves first everywhere  then metayers  and we have the half crop system  rent  and day laborers
what are you trying to find   levin suddenly lost his temper at these words  because at the bottom of his heart he was afraid that it was true  true that he was trying to hold the balance even between communism and the familiar forms  and that this was hardly possible anna karenina 769 of 1759  i am trying to find means of working productively for myself and for the laborers
i want to organize     he answered hotly
 you don t want to organize anything  it s simply just as you ve been all your life  that you want to be original to pose as not exploiting the peasants simply  but with some idea in view    oh  all right  that s what you think and let me alone   answered levin  feeling the muscles of his left cheek twitching uncontrollably
 you ve never had  and never have  convictions  all you want is to please your vanity    oh  very well  then let me alone    and i will let you alone  and it s high time i did  and go to the devil with you  and i m very sorry i ever came   in spite of all levin s efforts to soothe his brother afterwards  nikolay would listen to nothing he said  declaring that it was better to part  and konstantin saw that it simply was that life was unbearable to him
nikolay was just getting ready to go  when konstantin went in to him again and begged him  rather unnaturally  to forgive him if he had hurt his feelings in any way
anna karenina 770 of 1759  ah  generosity   said nikolay  and he smiled
 if you want to be right  i can give you that satisfaction
you re in the right  but i m going all the same   it was only just at parting that nikolay kissed him  and said  looking with sudden strangeness and seriousness at his brother   anyway  don t remember evil against me  kostya   and his voice quivered
these were the only words that had been spoken sincerely between them
levin knew that those words meant   you see  and you know  that i m in a bad way  and maybe we shall not see each other again   levin knew this  and the tears gushed from his eyes
he kissed his brother once more  but he could not speak  and knew not what to say
three days after his brother s departure  levin too set off for his foreign tour
happening to meet shtcherbatsky  kitty s cousin  in the railway train  levin greatly astonished him by his depression
 what s the matter with you   shtcherbatsky asked him
 oh  nothing  there s not much happiness in life    not much  you come with me to paris instead of to mulhausen
you shall see how to be happy    no  i ve done with it all
it s time i was dead   anna karenina 771 of 1759  well  that s a good one   said shtcherbatsky  laughing   why  i m only just getting ready to begin    yes  i thought the same not long ago  but now i know i shall soon be dead   levin said what he had genuinely been thinking of late
he saw nothing but death or the advance towards death in everything
but his cherished scheme only engrossed him the more
life had to be got through somehow till death did come
darkness had fallen upon everything for him  but just because of this darkness he felt that the one guiding clue in the darkness was his work  and he clutched it and clung to it with all his strength
anna karenina 772 of 1759 part four anna karenina 773 of 1759 the karenins  husband and wife  continued living in the same house  met every day  but were complete strangers to one another
alexey alexandrovitch made it a rule to see his wife every day  so that the servants might have no grounds for suppositions  but avoided dining at home
vronsky was never at alexey alexandrovitch s house  but anna saw him away from home  and her husband was aware of it
the position was one of misery for all three  and not one of them would have been equal to enduring this position for a single day  if it had not been for the expectation that it would change  that it was merely a temporary painful ordeal which would pass over
alexey alexandrovitch hoped that this passion would pass  as everything does pass  that everyone would forget about it  and his name would remain unsullied
anna  on whom the position depended  and for whom it was more miserable than for anyone  endured it because she not merely hoped  but firmly believed  that it would all very soon be settled and come right
she had not the least idea what would settle the position  but she firmly believed that something would very soon turn up now
vronsky  anna karenina 774 of 1759 against his own will or wishes  followed her lead  hoped too that something  apart from his own action  would be sure to solve all difficulties
in the middle of the winter vronsky spent a very tiresome week
a foreign prince  who had come on a visit to petersburg  was put under his charge  and he had to show him the sights worth seeing
vronsky was of distinguished appearance  he possessed  moreover  the art of behaving with respectful dignity  and was used to having to do with such grand personages that was how he came to be put in charge of the prince
but he felt his duties very irksome
the prince was anxious to miss nothing of which he would be asked at home  had he seen that in russia  and on his own account he was anxious to enjoy to the utmost all russian forms of amusement vronsky was obliged to be his guide in satisfying both these inclinations
the mornings they spent driving to look at places of interest  the evenings they passed enjoying the national entertainments
the prince rejoiced in health exceptional even among princes
by gymnastics and careful attention to his health he had brought himself to such a point that in spite of his excess in pleasure he looked as fresh as a big glossy green dutch cucumber the prince had traveled a great deal  and considered one of the anna karenina 775 of 1759 chief advantages of modern facilities of communication was the accessibility of the pleasures of all nations
he had been in spain  and there had indulged in serenades and had made friends with a spanish girl who played the mandolin
in switzerland he had killed chamois
in england he had galloped in a red coat over hedges and killed two hundred pheasants for a bet
in turkey he had got into a harem  in india he had hunted on an elephant  and now in russia he wished to taste all the specially russian forms of pleasure vronsky  who was  as it were  chief master of the ceremonies to him  was at great pains to arrange all the russian amusements suggested by various persons to the prince
they had race horses  and russian pancakes and bear hunts and three horse sledges  and gypsies and drinking feasts  with the russian accompaniment of broken crockery
and the prince with surprising ease fell in with the russian spirit  smashed trays full of crockery  sat with a gypsy girl on his knee  and seemed to be asking what more  and does the whole russian spirit consist in just this  in reality  of all the russian entertainments the prince liked best french actresses and ballet dancers and whiteseal champagne
vronsky was used to princes  but  either anna karenina 776 of 1759 because he had himself changed of late  or that he was in too close proximity to the prince  that week seemed fearfully wearisome to him the whole of that week he experienced a sensation such as a man might have set in charge of a dangerous madman  afraid of the madman  and at the same time  from being with him  fearing for his own reason
vronsky was continually conscious of the necessity of never for a second relaxing the tone of stern official respectfulness  that he might not himself be insulted the prince s manner of treating the very people who  to vronsky s surprise  were ready to descend to any depths to provide him with russian amusements  was contemptuous
his criticisms of russian women  whom he wished to study  more than once made vronsky crimson with indignation the chief reason why the prince was so particularly disagreeable to vronsky was that he could not help seeing himself in him and what he saw in this mirror did not gratify his self esteem
he was a very stupid and very self satisfied and very healthy and very well washed man  and nothing else
he was a gentleman that was true  and vronsky could not deny it
he was equable and not cringing with his superiors  was free and ingratiating in his behavior with his equals  and was contemptuously indulgent with his inferiors
vronsky anna karenina 777 of 1759 was himself the same  and regarded it as a great merit to be so but for this prince he was an inferior  and his contemptuous and indulgent attitude to him revolted him
 brainless beef  can i be like that   he thought
be that as it might  when  on the seventh day  he parted from the prince  who was starting for moscow  and received his thanks  he was happy to be rid of his uncomfortable position and the unpleasant reflection of himself he said good bye to him at the station on their return from a bear hunt  at which they had had a display of russian prowess kept up all night
anna karenina 778 of 1759 when he got home  vronsky found there a note from anna
she wrote   i am ill and unhappy
i cannot come out  but i cannot go on longer without seeing you
come in this evening
alexey alexandrovitch goes to the council at seven and will be there till ten   thinking for an instant of the strangeness of her bidding him come straight to her  in spite of her husband s insisting on her not receiving him  he decided to go
vronsky had that winter got his promotion  was now a colonel  had left the regimental quarters  and was living alone
after having some lunch  he lay down on the sofa immediately  and in five minutes memories of the hideous scenes he had witnessed during the last few days were confused together and joined on to a mental image of anna and of the peasant who had played an important part in the bear hunt  and vronsky fell asleep
he waked up in the dark  trembling with horror  and made haste to light a candle
 what was it  what  what was the dreadful thing i dreamed  yes  yes  i think a little dirty man with a disheveled beard was stooping down doing something  and all of a sudden he began saying some strange words in anna karenina 779 of 1759 french
yes  there was nothing else in the dream   he said to himself  but why was it so awful   he vividly recalled the peasant again and those incomprehensible french words the peasant had uttered  and a chill of horror ran down his spine
 what nonsense   thought vronsky  and glanced at his watch
it was half past eight already
he rang up his servant  dressed in haste  and went out onto the steps  completely forgetting the dream and only worried at being late
as he drove up to the karenins  entrance he looked at his watch and saw it was ten minutes to nine
a high  narrow carriage with a pair of grays was standing at the entrance
he recognized anna s carriage
 she is coming to me   thought vronsky   and better she should
i don t like going into that house
but no matter  i can t hide myself   he thought  and with that manner peculiar to him from childhood  as of a man who has nothing to be ashamed of  vronsky got out of his sledge and went to the door
the door opened  and the hall porter with a rug on his arm called the carriage
vronsky  though he did not usually notice details  noticed at this moment the amazed expression with which the porter glanced at him
in the very doorway vronsky almost ran up against alexey anna karenina 780 of 1759 alexandrovitch
the gas jet threw its full light on the bloodless  sunken face under the black hat and on the white cravat  brilliant against the beaver of the coat
karenin s fixed  dull eyes were fastened upon vronsky s face
vronsky bowed  and alexey alexandrovitch  chewing his lips  lifted his hand to his hat and went on
vronsky saw him without looking round get into the carriage  pick up the rug and the opera glass at the window and disappear
vronsky went into the hall
his brows were scowling  and his eyes gleamed with a proud and angry light in them
 what a position   he thought
 if he would fight  would stand up for his honor  i could act  could express my feelings  but this weakness or baseness   
he puts me in the position of playing false  which i never meant and never mean to do   vronsky s ideas had changed since the day of his conversation with anna in the vrede garden
unconsciously yielding to the weakness of anna who had surrendered herself up to him utterly  and simply looked to him to decide her fate  ready to submit to anything he had long ceased to think that their tie might end as he had thought then
his ambitious plans had retreated into the background again  and feeling that he anna karenina 781 of 1759 had got out of that circle of activity in which everything was definite  he had given himself entirely to his passion  and that passion was binding him more and more closely to her he was still in the hall when he caught the sound of her retreating footsteps
he knew she had been expecting him  had listened for him  and was now going back to the drawing room
 no   she cried  on seeing him  and at the first sound of her voice the tears came into her eyes
 no  if things are to go on like this  the end will come much  much too soon    what is it  dear one    what  i ve been waiting in agony for an hour  two hours   no  i won t   i can t quarrel with you
of course you couldn t come
no  i won t   she laid her two hands on his shoulders  and looked a long while at him with a profound  passionate  and at the same time searching look
she was studying his face to make up for the time she had not seen him
she was  every time she saw him  making the picture of him in her imagination (incomparably superior  impossible in reality) fit with him as he really was
anna karenina 782 of 1759  you met him   she asked  when they had sat down at the table in the lamplight
 you re punished  you see  for being late    yes  but how was it  wasn t he to be at the council    he had been and come back  and was going out somewhere again
but that s no matter
don t talk about it
where have you been  with the prince still   she knew every detail of his existence
he was going to say that he had been up all night and had dropped asleep  but looking at her thrilled and rapturous face  he was ashamed
and he said he had had to go to report on the prince s departure
 but it s over now  he is gone    thank god it s over  you wouldn t believe how insufferable it s been for me    why so  isn t it the life all of you  all young men  always lead   she said  knitting her brows  and taking up the crochet work that was lying on the table  she began drawing the hook out of it  without looking at vronsky
 i gave that life up long ago   said he  wondering at the change in her face  and trying to divine its meaning
 and anna karenina 783 of 1759 i confess   he said  with a smile  showing his thick  white teeth   this week i ve been  as it were  looking at myself in a glass  seeing that life  and i didn t like it   she held the work in her hands  but did not crochet  and looked at him with strange  shining  and hostile eyes
 this morning liza came to see me they re not afraid to call on me  in spite of the countess lidia ivanovna   she put in  and she told me about your athenian evening
how loathsome    i was just going to say    she interrupted him
 it was that therese you used to know    i was just saying     how disgusting you are  you men  how is it you can t understand that a woman can never forget that   she said  getting more and more angry  and so letting him see the cause of her irritation   especially a woman who cannot know your life  what do i know  what have i ever known   she said   what you tell me
and how do i know whether you tell me the truth      anna  you hurt me
don t you trust me  haven t i told you that i haven t a thought i wouldn t lay bare to you   anna karenina 784 of 1759  yes  yes   she said  evidently trying to suppress her jealous thoughts
 but if only you knew how wretched i am  i believe you  i believe you    what were you saying   but he could not at once recall what he had been going to say
these fits of jealousy  which of late had been more and more frequent with her  horrified him  and however much he tried to disguise the fact  made him feel cold to her  although he knew the cause of her jealousy was her love for him
how often he had told himself that her love was happiness  and now she loved him as a woman can love when love has outweighed for her all the good things of life and he was much further from happiness than when he had followed her from moscow then he had thought himself unhappy  but happiness was before him  now he felt that the best happiness was already left behind she was utterly unlike what she had been when he first saw her
both morally and physically she had changed for the worse
she had broadened out all over  and in her face at the time when she was speaking of the actress there was an evil expression of hatred that distorted it
he looked at her as a man looks at a faded flower he has gathered  with difficulty recognizing in it the beauty for which he picked and ruined it
and in spite of this he felt that then  when anna karenina 785 of 1759 his love was stronger  he could  if he had greatly wished it  have torn that love out of his heart  but now  when as at that moment it seemed to him he felt no love for her  he knew that what bound him to her could not be broken
 well  well  what was it you were going to say about the prince  i have driven away the fiend   she added
the fiend was the name they had given her jealousy
 what did you begin to tell me about the prince  why did you find it so tiresome    oh  it was intolerable   he said  trying to pick up the thread of his interrupted thought
 he does not improve on closer acquaintance
if you want him defined  here he is  a prime  well fed beast such as takes medals at the cattle shows  and nothing more   he said  with a tone of vexation that interested her
 no  how so   she replied
 he s seen a great deal  anyway  he s cultured    it s an utterly different culture their culture
he s cultivated  one sees  simply to be able to despise culture  as they despise everything but animal pleasures    but don t you all care for these animal pleasures   she said  and again he noticed a dark look in her eyes that avoided him
 how is it you re defending him   he said  smiling
anna karenina 786 of 1759  i m not defending him  it s nothing to me  but i imagine  if you had not cared for those pleasures yourself  you might have got out of them
but if it affords you satisfaction to gaze at therese in the attire of eve     again  the devil again   vronsky said  taking the hand she had laid on the table and kissing it
 yes  but i can t help it
you don t know what i have suffered waiting for you
i believe i m not jealous
i m not jealous  i believe you when you re here  but when you re away somewhere leading your life  so incomprehensible to me    she turned away from him  pulled the hook at last out of the crochet work  and rapidly  with the help of her forefinger  began working loop after loop of the wool that was dazzling white in the lamplight  while the slender wrist moved swiftly  nervously in the embroidered cuff
 how was it  then  where did you meet alexey alexandrovitch   her voice sounded in an unnatural and jarring tone
 we ran up against each other in the doorway    and he bowed to you like this   she drew a long face  and half closing her eyes  quickly transformed her expression  folded her hands  and vronsky suddenly saw in her beautiful face the very expression with anna karenina 787 of 1759 which alexey alexandrovitch had bowed to him
he smiled  while she laughed gaily  with that sweet  deep laugh  which was one of her greatest charms  i don t understand him in the least   said vronsky
 if after your avowal to him at your country house he had broken with you  if he had called me out but this i can t understand
how can he put up with such a position  he feels it  that s evident    he   she said sneeringly
 he s perfectly satisfied    what are we all miserable for  when everything might be so happy    only not he
don t i know him  the falsity in which he s utterly steeped   
could one  with any feeling  live as he is living with me  he understands nothing  and feels nothing
could a man of any feeling live in the same house with his unfaithful wife  could he talk to her  call her  my dear    and again she could not help mimicking him    anna  ma chere  anna  dear     he s not a man  not a human being he s a doll  no one knows him  but i know him
oh  if i d been in his place  i d long ago have killed  have torn to pieces a wife like me
i wouldn t have said   anna  ma chere   he s not a man  he s an official machine
he doesn t understand anna karenina 788 of 1759 that i m your wife  that he s outside  that he s superfluous   
don t let s talk of him      you re unfair  very unfair  dearest   said vronsky  trying to soothe her
 but never mind  don t let s talk of him
tell me what you ve been doing  what is the matter  what has been wrong with you  and what did the doctor say   she looked at him with mocking amusement
evidently she had hit on other absurd and grotesque aspects in her husband and was awaiting the moment to give expression to them
but he went on   i imagine that it s not illness  but your condition
when will it be   the ironical light died away in her eyes  but a different smile  a consciousness of something  he did not know what  and of quiet melancholy  came over her face
 soon  soon
you say that our position is miserable  that we must put an end to it
if you knew how terrible it is to me  what i would give to be able to love you freely and boldly  i should not torture myself and torture you with my jealousy   
and it will come soon but not as we expect   anna karenina 789 of 1759 and at the thought of how it would come  she seemed so pitiable to herself that tears came into her eyes  and she could not go on
she laid her hand on his sleeve  dazzling and white with its rings in the lamplight  it won t come as we suppose
i didn t mean to say this to you  but you ve made me
soon  soon  all will be over  and we shall all  all be at peace  and suffer no more    i don t understand   he said  understanding her
 you asked when  soon
and i shan t live through it
don t interrupt me   and she made haste to speak
 i know it  i know for certain
i shall die  and i m very glad i shall die  and release myself and you   tears dropped from her eyes  he bent down over her hand and began kissing it  trying to hide his emotion  which  he knew  had no sort of grounds  though he could not control it
 yes  it s better so   she said  tightly gripping his hand
 that s the only way  the only way left us   he had recovered himself  and lifted his head  how absurd  what absurd nonsense you are talking    no  it s the truth    what  what s the truth    that i shall die
i have had a dream   anna karenina 790 of 1759  a dream   repeated vronsky  and instantly he recalled the peasant of his dream
 yes  a dream   she said
 it s a long while since i dreamed it
i dreamed that i ran into my bedroom  that i had to get something there  to find out something  you know how it is in dreams   she said  her eyes wide with horror   and in the bedroom  in the corner  stood something    oh  what nonsense  how can you believe    but she would not let him interrupt her what she was saying was too important to her
 and the something turned round  and i saw it was a peasant with a disheveled beard  little  and dreadful looking
i wanted to run away  but he bent down over a sack  and was fumbling there with his hands    she showed how he had moved his hands
there was terror in her face
and vronsky  remembering his dream  felt the same terror filling his soul
 he was fumbling and kept talking quickly  quickly in french  you know  il faut le battre  le fer  le brayer  le petrir   
and in my horror i tried to wake up  and woke up   but woke up in the dream
and i began asking myself what it meant
and korney said to me   in childbirth you ll die  ma am  you ll die      and i woke up   anna karenina 791 of 1759  what nonsense  what nonsense   said vronsky  but he felt himself that there was no conviction in his voice  but don t let s talk of it
ring the bell  i ll have tea
and stay a little now  it s not long i shall    but all at once she stopped
the expression of her face instantaneously changed
horror and excitement were suddenly replaced by a look of soft  solemn  blissful attention
he could not comprehend the meaning of the change
she was listening to the stirring of the new life within her
anna karenina 792 of 1759 alexey alexandrovitch  after meeting vronsky on his own steps  drove  as he had intended  to the italian opera
he sat through two acts there  and saw everyone he had wanted to see
on returning home  he carefully scrutinized the hat stand  and noticing that there was not a military overcoat there  he went  as usual  to his own room
but  contrary to his usual habits  he did not go to bed  he walked up and down his study till three o clock in the morning
the feeling of furious anger with his wife  who would not observe the proprieties and keep to the one stipulation he had laid on her  not to receive her lover in her own home  gave him no peace
she had not complied with his request  and he was bound to punish her and carry out his threat obtain a divorce and take away his son
he knew all the difficulties connected with this course  but he had said he would do it  and now he must carry out his threat
countess lidia ivanovna had hinted that this was the best way out of his position  and of late the obtaining of divorces had been brought to such perfection that alexey alexandrovitch saw a possibility of overcoming the formal difficulties
misfortunes never anna karenina 793 of 1759 come singly  and the affairs of the reorganization of the native tribes  and of the irrigation of the lands of the zaraisky province  had brought such official worries upon alexey alexandrovitch that he had been of late in a continual condition of extreme irritability
he did not sleep the whole night  and his fury  growing in a sort of vast  arithmetical progression  reached its highest limits in the morning
he dressed in haste  and as though carrying his cup full of wrath  and fearing to spill any over  fearing to lose with his wrath the energy necessary for the interview with his wife  he went into her room directly he heard she was up
anna  who had thought she knew her husband so well  was amazed at his appearance when he went in to her
his brow was lowering  and his eyes stared darkly before him  avoiding her eyes  his mouth was tightly and contemptuously shut
in his walk  in his gestures  in the sound of his voice there was a determination and firmness such as his wife had never seen in him
he went into her room  and without greeting her  walked straight up to her writing table  and taking her keys  opened a drawer
 what do you want   she cried
 your lover s letters   he said
anna karenina 794 of 1759  they re not here   she said  shutting the drawer  but from that action he saw he had guessed right  and roughly pushing away her hand  he quickly snatched a portfolio in which he knew she used to put her most important papers
she tried to pull the portfolio away  but he pushed her back
 sit down  i have to speak to you   he said  putting the portfolio under his arm  and squeezing it so tightly with his elbow that his shoulder stood up
amazed and intimidated  she gazed at him in silence
 i told you that i would not allow you to receive your lover in this house    i had to see him to    she stopped  not finding a reason
 i do not enter into the details of why a woman wants to see her lover    i meant  i only     she said  flushing hotly
this coarseness of his angered her  and gave her courage
 surely you must feel how easy it is for you to insult me   she said
 an honest man and an honest woman may be insulted  but to tell a thief he s a thief is simply la constatation d un fait    this cruelty is something new i did not know in you   anna karenina 795 of 1759  you call it cruelty for a husband to give his wife liberty  giving her the honorable protection of his name  simply on the condition of observing the proprieties  is that cruelty    it s worse than cruel it s base  if you want to know   anna cried  in a rush of hatred  and getting up  she was going away
 no   he shrieked in his shrill voice  which pitched a note higher than usual even  and his big hands clutching her by the arm so violently that red marks were left from the bracelet he was squeezing  he forcibly sat her down in her place
 base  if you care to use that word  what is base is to forsake husband and child for a lover  while you eat your husband s bread   she bowed her head
she did not say what she had said the evening before to her lover  that he was her husband  and her husband was superfluous  she did not even think that
she felt all the justice of his words  and only said softly   you cannot describe my position as worse than i feel it to be myself  but what are you saying all this for    what am i saying it for  what for   he went on  as angrily
 that you may know that since you have not anna karenina 796 of 1759 carried out my wishes in regard to observing outward decorum  i will take measures to put an end to this state of things    soon  very soon  it will end  anyway   she said  and again  at the thought of death near at hand and now desired  tears came into her eyes
 it will end sooner than you and your lover have planned  if you must have the satisfaction of animal passion     alexey alexandrovitch  i won t say it s not generous  but it s not like a gentleman to strike anyone who s down    yes  you only think of yourself  but the sufferings of a man who was your husband have no interest for you
you don t care that his whole life is ruined  that he is thuff   thuff    alexey alexandrovitch was speaking so quickly that he stammered  and was utterly unable to articulate the word  suffering   in the end he pronounced it  thuffering   she wanted to laugh  and was immediately ashamed that anything could amuse her at such a moment
and for the first time  for an instant  she felt for him  put herself in his place  and was sorry for him
but what could she say or do  her head sank  and she sat silent
he too was silent for anna karenina 797 of 1759 some time  and then began speaking in a frigid  less shrill voice  emphasizing random words that had no significance
 i came to tell you     he said
she glanced at him
 no  it was my fancy   she thought  recalling the expression of his face when he stumbled over the word  suffering    no  can a man with those dull eyes  with that self satisfied complacency  feel anything    i cannot change anything   she whispered
 i have come to tell you that i am going tomorrow to moscow  and shall not return again to this house  and you will receive notice of what i decide through the lawyer into whose hands i shall intrust the task of getting a divorce
my son is going to my sister s   said alexey alexandrovitch  with an effort recalling what he had meant to say about his son
 you take seryozha to hurt me   she said  looking at him from under her brows
 you do not love him   
leave me seryozha    yes  i have lost even my affection for my son  because he is associated with the repulsion i feel for you
but still i shall take him
goodbye   and he was going away  but now she detained him
anna karenina 798 of 1759  alexey alexandrovitch  leave me seryozha   she whispered once more
 i have nothing else to say
leave seryozha till my   i shall soon be confined  leave him   alexey alexandrovitch flew into a rage  and  snatching his hand from her  he went out of the room without a word
anna karenina 799 of 1759 the waiting room of the celebrated petersburg lawyer was full when alexey alexandrovitch entered it
three ladies an old lady  a young lady  and a merchant s wife  and three gentlemen  one a german banker with a ring on his finger  the second a merchant with a beard  and the third a wrathful looking government clerk in official uniform  with a cross on his neck  had obviously been waiting a long while already
two clerks were writing at tables with scratching pens
the appurtenances of the writing tables  about which alexey alexandrovitch was himself very fastidious  were exceptionally good he could not help observing this
one of the clerks  without getting up  turned wrathfully to alexey alexandrovitch  half closing his eyes
 what are you wanting   he replied that he had to see the lawyer on some business
 he is engaged   the clerk responded severely  and he pointed with his pen at the persons waiting  and went on writing
 can t he spare time to see me   said alexey alexandrovitch
anna karenina 800 of 1759  he has not time free  he is always busy
kindly wait your turn    then i must trouble you to give him my card   alexey alexandrovitch said with dignity  seeing the impossibility of preserving his incognito
the clerk took the card and  obviously not approving of what he read on it  went to the door
alexey alexandrovitch was in principle in favor of the publicity of legal proceedings  though for some higher official considerations he disliked the application of the principle in russia  and disapproved of it  as far as he could disapprove of anything instituted by authority of the emperor
his whole life had been spent in administrative work  and consequently  when he did not approve of anything  his disapproval was softened by the recognition of the inevitability of mistakes and the possibility of reform in every department
in the new public law courts he disliked the restrictions laid on the lawyers conducting cases
but till then he had had nothing to do with the law courts  and so had disapproved of their publicity simply in theory  now his disapprobation was strengthened by the unpleasant impression made on him in the lawyer s waiting room
about which i have to speak to you is to be strictly private   the lawyer s overhanging reddish mustaches were parted in a scarcely perceptible smile
 i should not be a lawyer if i could not keep the secrets confided to me
but if you would like proof    alexey alexandrovitch glanced at his face  and saw that the shrewd  gray eyes were laughing  and seemed to know all about it already
 you know my name   alexey alexandrovitch resumed
 i know you and the good  again he caught a moth   work you are doing  like every russian   said the lawyer  bowing
alexey alexandrovitch sighed  plucking up his courage
but having once made up his mind he went on in his shrill voice  without timidity or hesitation  accentuating here and there a word
 i have the misfortune   alexey alexandrovitch began   to have been deceived in my married life  and i desire to break off all relations with my wife by legal means that is  to be divorced  but to do this so that my son may not remain with his mother   anna karenina 803 of 1759 the lawyer s gray eyes tried not to laugh  but they were dancing with irrepressible glee  and alexey alexandrovitch saw that it was not simply the delight of a man who has just got a profitable job  there was triumph and joy  there was a gleam like the malignant gleam he saw in his wife s eyes
 you desire my assistance in securing a divorce    yes  precisely so  but i ought to warn you that i may be wasting your time and attention
i have come simply to consult you as a preliminary step
i want a divorce  but the form in which it is possible is of great consequence to me
it is very possible that if that form does not correspond with my requirements i may give up a legal divorce    oh  that s always the case   said the lawyer   and that s always for you to decide   he let his eyes rest on alexey alexandrovitch s feet  feeling that he might offend his client by the sight of his irrepressible amusement
he looked at a moth that flew before his nose  and moved his hands  but did not catch it from regard for alexey alexandrovitch s position
 though in their general features our laws on this subject are known to me   pursued alexey alexandrovitch   i should be glad to have an idea of the forms in which such things are done in practice   anna karenina 804 of 1759  you would be glad   the lawyer  without lifting his eyes  responded  adopting  with a certain satisfaction  the tone of his client s remarks   for me to lay before you all the methods by which you could secure what you desire   and on receiving an assuring nod from alexey alexandrovitch  he went on  stealing a glance now and then at alexey alexandrovitch s face  which was growing red in patches  divorce by our laws   he said  with a slight shade of disapprobation of our laws   is possible  as you are aware  in the following cases   
wait a little   he called to a clerk who put his head in at the door  but he got up all the same  said a few words to him  and sat down again
    in the following cases  physical defect in the married parties  desertion without communication for five years   he said  crooking a short finger covered with hair   adultery  (this word he pronounced with obvious satisfaction)   subdivided as follows  (he continued to crook his fat fingers  though the three cases and their subdivisions could obviously not be classified together)   physical defect of the husband or of the wife  adultery of the husband or of the wife   as by now all his fingers were used up  he uncrooked all his fingers and went on   this is the theoretical view  but i imagine you have done me the anna karenina 805 of 1759 honor to apply to me in order to learn its application in practice
and therefore  guided by precedents  i must inform you that in practice cases of divorce may all be reduced to the following  there s no physical defect  i may assume  nor desertion     alexey alexandrovitch bowed his head in assent
  may be reduced to the following  adultery of one of the married parties  and the detection in the fact of the guilty party by mutual agreement  and failing such agreement  accidental detection
it must be admitted that the latter case is rarely met with in practice   said the lawyer  and stealing a glance at alexey alexandrovitch he paused  as a man selling pistols  after enlarging on the advantages of each weapon  might await his customer s choice
but alexey alexandrovitch said nothing  and therefore the lawyer went on   the most usual and simple  the sensible course  i consider  is adultery by mutual consent
i should not permit myself to express it so  speaking with a man of no education   he said   but i imagine that to you this is comprehensible   alexey alexandrovitch was  however  so perturbed that he did not immediately comprehend all the good sense of adultery by mutual consent  and his eyes expressed this anna karenina 806 of 1759 uncertainty  but the lawyer promptly came to his assistance
 people cannot go on living together here you have a fact
and if both are agreed about it  the details and formalities become a matter of no importance
and at the same time this is the simplest and most certain method   alexey alexandrovitch fully understood now
but he had religious scruples  which hindered the execution of such a plan
 that is out of the question in the present case   he said
 only one alternative is possible  undesigned detection  supported by letters which i have   at the mention of letters the lawyer pursed up his lips  and gave utterance to a thin little compassionate and contemptuous sound
 kindly consider   he began   cases of that kind are  as you are aware  under ecclesiastical jurisdiction  the reverend fathers are fond of going into the minutest details in cases of that kind   he said with a smile  which betrayed his sympathy with the reverend fathers  taste
 letters may  of course  be a partial confirmation  but detection in the fact there must be of the most direct kind  that is  by eyewitnesses
in fact  if you do me the honor to intrust your confidence to me  you will do well to leave me the anna karenina 807 of 1759 choice of the measures to be employed
if one wants the result  one must admit the means    if it is so     alexey alexandrovitch began  suddenly turning white  but at that moment the lawyer rose and again went to the door to speak to the intruding clerk
 tell her we don t haggle over fees   he said  and returned to alexey alexandrovitch
on his way back he caught unobserved another moth
 nice state my rep curtains will be in by the summer   he thought  frowning
 and so you were saying      he said
 i will communicate my decision to you by letter   said alexey alexandrovitch  getting up  and he clutched at the table
after standing a moment in silence  he said   from your words i may consequently conclude that a divorce may be obtained  i would ask you to let me know what are your terms    it may be obtained if you give me complete liberty of action   said the lawyer  not answering his question  when can i reckon on receiving information from you   he asked  moving towards the door  his eyes and his varnished boots shining
anna karenina 808 of 1759  in a week s time
your answer as to whether you will undertake to conduct the case  and on what terms  you will be so good as to communicate to me    very good   the lawyer bowed respectfully  let his client out of the door  and  left alone  gave himself up to his sense of amusement he felt so mirthful that  contrary to his rules  he made a reduction in his terms to the haggling lady  and gave up catching moths  finally deciding that next winter he must have the furniture covered with velvet  like sigonin s alexey alexandrovitch had gained a brilliant victory at the sitting of the commission of the 17th of august  but in the sequel this victory cut the ground from under his feet
the new commission for the inquiry into the condition of the native tribes in all its branches had been formed and despatched to its destination with an unusual speed and energy inspired by alexey alexandrovitch
within three months a report was presented
the condition of the native tribes was investigated in its political  administrative  economic  ethnographic  material  and religious aspects
to all these questions there were answers admirably stated  and answers admitting no shade of doubt  since they were not a product of human thought  always liable to error  but were all the product of official activity
the answers were all based on official data furnished by governors and heads of churches  and founded on the reports of district magistrates and ecclesiastical superintendents  founded in their turn on the reports of parochial overseers and parish priests  and so all of these answers were unhesitating and certain
all such questions as  for instance  of the cause of failure of crops  anna karenina 810 of 1759 of the adherence of certain tribes to their ancient beliefs  etc   questions which  but for the convenient intervention of the official machine  are not  and cannot be solved for ages  received full  unhesitating solution and this solution was in favor of alexey alexandrovitch s contention
but stremov  who had felt stung to the quick at the last sitting  had  on the reception of the commission s report  resorted to tactics which alexey alexandrovitch had not anticipated
stremov  carrying with him several members  went over to alexey alexandrovitch s side  and not contenting himself with warmly defending the measure proposed by karenin  proposed other more extreme measures in the same direction these measures  still further exaggerated in opposition to what was alexey alexandrovitch s fundamental idea  were passed by the commission  and then the aim of stremov s tactics became apparent
carried to an extreme  the measures seemed at once to be so absurd that the highest authorities  and public opinion  and intellectual ladies  and the newspapers  all at the same time fell foul of them  expressing their indignation both with the measures and their nominal father  alexey alexandrovitch
stremov drew back  affecting to have blindly followed karenin  and to be astounded and anna karenina 811 of 1759 distressed at what had been done
this meant the defeat of alexey alexandrovitch
but in spite of failing health  in spite of his domestic griefs  he did not give in
there was a split in the commission
some members  with stremov at their head  justified their mistake on the ground that they had put faith in the commission of revision  instituted by alexey alexandrovitch  and maintained that the report of the commission was rubbish  and simply so much waste paper
alexey alexandrovitch  with a following of those who saw the danger of so revolutionary an attitude to official documents  persisted in upholding the statements obtained by the revising commission
in consequence of this  in the higher spheres  and even in society  all was chaos  and although everyone was interested  no one could tell whether the native tribes really were becoming impoverished and ruined  or whether they were in a flourishing condition
the position of alexey alexandrovitch  owing to this  and partly owing to the contempt lavished on him for his wife s infidelity  became very precarious
and in this position he took an important resolution
to the astonishment of the commission  he announced that he should ask permission to go himself to investigate the question on the spot and having obtained anna karenina 812 of 1759 permission  alexey alexandrovitch prepared to set off to these remote provinces
alexey alexandrovitch s departure made a great sensation  the more so as just before he started he officially returned the posting fares allowed him for twelve horses  to drive to his destination
 i think it very noble   betsy said about this to the princess myakaya
 why take money for posting horses when everyone knows that there are railways everywhere now   but princess myakaya did not agree  and the princess tverskaya s opinion annoyed her indeed
 it s all very well for you to talk   said she   when you have i don t know how many millions  but i am very glad when my husband goes on a revising tour in the summer
it s very good for him and pleasant traveling about  and it s a settled arrangement for me to keep a carriage and coachman on the money   on his way to the remote provinces alexey alexandrovitch stopped for three days at moscow
the day after his arrival he was driving back from calling on the governor general
at the crossroads by gazetoy place  where there are always crowds of carriages and sledges  alexey alexandrovitch suddenly heard his anna karenina 813 of 1759 name called out in such a loud and cheerful voice that he could not help looking round
at the corner of the pavement  in a short  stylish overcoat and a low crowned fashionable hat  jauntily askew  with a smile that showed a gleam of white teeth and red lips  stood stepan arkadyevitch  radiant  young  and beaming
he called him vigorously and urgently  and insisted on his stopping
he had one arm on the window of a carriage that was stopping at the corner  and out of the window were thrust the heads of a lady in a velvet hat  and two children
stepan arkadyevitch was smiling and beckoning to his brother in law
the lady smiled a kindly smile too  and she too waved her hand to alexey alexandrovitch
it was dolly with her children
alexey alexandrovitch did not want to see anyone in moscow  and least of all his wife s brother
he raised his hat and would have driven on  but stepan arkadyevitch told his coachman to stop  and ran across the snow to him
 well  what a shame not to have let us know  been here long  i was at dussot s yesterday and saw  karenin  on the visitors  list  but it never entered my head that it was you   said stepan arkadyevitch  sticking his head in at the window of the carriage   or i should have looked you up
i am glad to see you   he said  knocking one foot anna karenina 814 of 1759 against the other to shake the snow off
 what a shame of you not to let us know   he repeated
 i had no time  i am very busy   alexey alexandrovitch responded dryly
 come to my wife  she does so want to see you   alexey alexandrovitch unfolded the rug in which his frozen feet were wrapped  and getting out of his carriage made his way over the snow to darya alexandrovna
 why  alexey alexandrovitch  what are you cutting us like this for   said dolly  smiling
 i was very busy
delighted to see you   he said in a tone clearly indicating that he was annoyed by it
 how are you    tell me  how is my darling anna   alexey alexandrovitch mumbled something and would have gone on
but stepan arkadyevitch stopped him
 i tell you what we ll do tomorrow
dolly  ask him to dinner
we ll ask koznishev and pestsov  so as to entertain him with our moscow celebrities    yes  please  do come   said dolly   we will expect you at five  or six o clock  if you like
how is my darling anna  how long    anna karenina 815 of 1759  she is quite well   alexey alexandrovitch mumbled  frowning
 delighted   and he moved away towards his carriage
 you will come   dolly called after him
alexey alexandrovitch said something which dolly could not catch in the noise of the moving carriages
 i shall come round tomorrow   stepan arkadyevitch shouted to him
alexey alexandrovitch got into his carriage  and buried himself in it so as neither to see nor be seen  queer fish   said stepan arkadyevitch to his wife  and glancing at his watch  he made a motion of his hand before his face  indicating a caress to his wife and children  and walked jauntily along the pavement
 stiva  stiva   dolly called  reddening
he turned round
 i must get coats  you know  for grisha and tanya
give me the money    never mind  you tell them i ll pay the bill   and he vanished  nodding genially to an acquaintance who drove by
anna karenina 816 of 1759 the next day was sunday
stepan arkadyevitch went to the grand theater to a rehearsal of the ballet  and gave masha tchibisova  a pretty dancing girl whom he had just taken under his protection  the coral necklace he had promised her the evening before  and behind the scenes in the dim daylight of the theater  managed to kiss her pretty little face  radiant over her present
besides the gift of the necklace he wanted to arrange with her about meeting after the ballet
after explaining that he could not come at the beginning of the ballet  he promised he would come for the last act and take her to supper
from the theater stepan arkadyevitch drove to ohotny row  selected himself the fish and asparagus for dinner  and by twelve o clock was at dussot s  where he had to see three people  luckily all staying at the same hotel  levin  who had recently come back from abroad and was staying there  the new head of his department  who had just been promoted to that position  and had come on a tour of revision to moscow  and his brother in law  karenin  whom he must see  so as to be sure of bringing him to dinner anna karenina 817 of 1759 stepan arkadyevitch liked dining  but still better he liked to give a dinner  small  but very choice  both as regards the food and drink and as regards the selection of guests
he particularly liked the program of that day s dinner
there would be fresh perch  asparagus  and la piece de resistance  first rate  but quite plain  roast beef  and wines to suit  so much for the eating and drinking
kitty and levin would be of the party  and that this might not be obtrusively evident  there would be a girl cousin too  and young shtcherbatsky  and la piece de resistance among the guests sergey koznishev and alexey alexandrovitch
sergey ivanovitch was a moscow man  and a philosopher  alexey alexandrovitch a petersburger  and a practical politician
he was asking  too  the wellknown eccentric enthusiast  pestsov  a liberal  a great talker  a musician  an historian  and the most delightfully youthful person of fifty  who would be a sauce or garnish for koznishev and karenin
he would provoke them and set them off
the second installment for the forest had been received from the merchant and was not yet exhausted  dolly had been very amiable and goodhumored of late  and the idea of the dinner pleased stepan arkadyevitch from every point of view
he was in the most light hearted mood
anna karenina 818 of 1759 there were two circumstances a little unpleasant  but these two circumstances were drowned in the sea of goodhumored gaiety which flooded the soul of stepan arkadyevitch these two circumstances were  first  that on meeting alexey alexandrovitch the day before in the street he had noticed that he was cold and reserved with him  and putting the expression of alexey alexandrovitch s face and the fact that he had not come to see them or let them know of his arrival with the rumors he had heard about anna and vronsky  stepan arkadyevitch guessed that something was wrong between the husband and wife that was one disagreeable thing
the other slightly disagreeable fact was that the new head of his department  like all new heads  had the reputation already of a terrible person  who got up at six o clock in the morning  worked like a horse  and insisted on his subordinates working in the same way
moreover  this new head had the further reputation of being a bear in his manners  and was  according to all reports  a man of a class in all respects the opposite of that to which his predecessor had belonged  and to which stepan arkadyevitch had hitherto belonged himself on the previous day stepan arkadyevitch had appeared at the office in a uniform  and the new chief had anna karenina 819 of 1759 been very affable and had talked to him as to an acquaintance
consequently stepan arkadyevitch deemed it his duty to call upon him in his non official dress
the thought that the new chief might not tender him a warm reception was the other unpleasant thing
but stepan arkadyevitch instinctively felt that everything would come round all right
 they re all people  all men  like us poor sinners  why be nasty and quarrelsome   he thought as he went into the hotel
 good day  vassily   he said  walking into the corridor with his hat cocked on one side  and addressing a footman he knew   why  you ve let your whiskers grow  levin  number seven  eh  take me up  please
and find out whether count anitchkin  (this was the new head)  is receiving    yes  sir   vassily responded  smiling
 you ve not been to see us for a long while    i was here yesterday  but at the other entrance
is this number seven   levin was standing with a peasant from tver in the middle of the room  measuring a fresh bearskin  when stepan arkadyevitch went in
 what  you killed him   cried stepan arkadyevitch
 well done  a she bear  how are you  arhip   anna karenina 820 of 1759 he shook hands with the peasant and sat down on the edge of a chair  without taking off his coat and hat
 come  take off your coat and stay a little   said levin  taking his hat
 no  i haven t time  i ve only looked in for a tiny second   answered stepan arkadyevitch
he threw open his coat  but afterwards did take it off  and sat on for a whole hour  talking to levin about hunting and the most intimate subjects
 come  tell me  please  what you did abroad  where have you been   said stepan arkadyevitch  when the peasant had gone
 oh  i stayed in germany  in prussia  in france  and in england  not in the capitals  but in the manufacturing towns  and saw a great deal that was new to me
and i m glad i went    yes  i knew your idea of the solution of the labor question    not a bit  in russia there can be no labor question
in russia the question is that of the relation of the working people to the land  though the question exists there too  but there it s a matter of repairing what s been ruined  while with us    stepan arkadyevitch listened attentively to levin
anna karenina 821 of 1759  yes  yes   he said   it s very possible you re right
but i m glad you re in good spirits  and are hunting bears  and working  and interested
shtcherbatsky told me another story he met you that you were in such a depressed state  talking of nothing but death      well  what of it  i ve not given up thinking of death   said levin
 it s true that it s high time i was dead  and that all this is nonsense
it s the truth i m telling you
i do value my idea and my work awfully  but in reality only consider this  all this world of ours is nothing but a speck of mildew  which has grown up on a tiny planet
and for us to suppose we can have something great ideas  work it s all dust and ashes    but all that s as old as the hills  my boy    it is old  but do you know  when you grasp this fully  then somehow everything becomes of no consequence
when you understand that you will die tomorrow  if not today  and nothing will be left  then everything is so unimportant  and i consider my idea very important  but it turns out really to be as unimportant too  even if it were carried out  as doing for that bear
so one goes on living  amusing oneself with hunting  with work anything so as not to think of death   anna karenina 822 of 1759 stepan arkadyevitch smiled a subtle affectionate smile as he listened to levin
 well  of course  here you ve come round to my point
do you remember you attacked me for seeking enjoyment in life  don t be so severe  o moralist    no  all the same  what s fine in life is     levin hesitated   oh  i don t know
all i know is that we shall soon be dead    why so soon    and do you know  there s less charm in life  when one thinks of death  but there s more peace    on the contrary  the finish is always the best
but i must be going   said stepan arkadyevitch  getting up for the tenth time
 oh  no  stay a bit   said levin  keeping him
 now  when shall we see each other again  i m going tomorrow    i m a nice person  why  that s just what i came for  you simply must come to dinner with us today
your brother s coming  and karenin  my brother in law    you don t mean to say he s here   said levin  and he wanted to inquire about kitty
he had heard at the beginning of the winter that she was at petersburg with her sister  the wife of the diplomat  and he did not know whether she had come back or not  but he changed his anna karenina 823 of 1759 mind and did not ask
 whether she s coming or not  i don t care   he said to himself  so you ll come    of course    at five o clock  then  and not evening dress   and stepan arkadyevitch got up and went down below to the new head of his department
istinct had not misled stepan arkadyevitch
the terrible new head turned out to be an extremely amenable person  and stepan arkadyevitch lunched with him and stayed on  so that it was four o clock before he got to alexey alexandrovitch
anna karenina 824 of 1759 alexey alexandrovitch  on coming back from church service  had spent the whole morning indoors
he had two pieces of business before him that morning  first  to receive and send on a deputation from the native tribes which was on its way to petersburg  and now at moscow  secondly  to write the promised letter to the lawyer
the deputation  though it had been summoned at alexey alexandrovitch s instigation  was not without its discomforting and even dangerous aspect  and he was glad he had found it in moscow
the members of this deputation had not the slightest conception of their duty and the part they were to play
they naively believed that it was their business to lay before the commission their needs and the actual condition of things  and to ask assistance of the government  and utterly failed to grasp that some of their statements and requests supported the contention of the enemy s side  and so spoiled the whole business
alexey alexandrovitch was busily engaged with them for a long while  drew up a program for them from which they were not to depart  and on dismissing them wrote a letter to petersburg for the guidance of the anna karenina 825 of 1759 deputation
he had his chief support in this affair in the countess lidia ivanovna
she was a specialist in the matter of deputations  and no one knew better than she how to manage them  and put them in the way they should go
having completed this task  alexey alexandrovitch wrote the letter to the lawyer
without the slightest hesitation he gave him permission to act as he might judge best
in the letter he enclosed three of vronsky s notes to anna  which were in the portfolio he had taken away
since alexey alexandrovitch had left home with the intention of not returning to his family again  and since he had been at the lawyer s and had spoken  though only to one man  of his intention  since especially he had translated the matter from the world of real life to the world of ink and paper  he had grown more and more used to his own intention  and by now distinctly perceived the feasibility of its execution
he was sealing the envelope to the lawyer  when he heard the loud tones of stepan arkadyevitch s voice
stepan arkadyevitch was disputing with alexey alexandrovitch s servant  and insisting on being announced
 no matter   thought alexey alexandrovitch   so much the better
i will inform him at once of my position in anna karenina 826 of 1759 regard to his sister  and explain why it is i can t dine with him    come in   he said aloud  collecting his papers  and putting them in the blotting paper
 there  you see  you re talking nonsense  and he s at home   responded stepan arkadyevitch s voice  addressing the servant  who had refused to let him in  and taking off his coat as he went  oblonsky walked into the room
 well  i m awfully glad i ve found you  so i hope     stepan arkadyevitch began cheerfully
 i cannot come   alexey alexandrovitch said coldly  standing and not asking his visitor to sit down
alexey alexandrovitch had thought to pass at once into those frigid relations in which he ought to stand with the brother of a wife against whom he was beginning a suit for divorce
but he had not taken into account the ocean of kindliness brimming over in the heart of stepan arkadyevitch
stepan arkadyevitch opened wide his clear  shining eyes
 why can t you  what do you mean   he asked in perplexity  speaking in french
 oh  but it s a promise
and we re all counting on you   anna karenina 827 of 1759  i want to tell you that i can t dine at your house  because the terms of relationship which have existed between us must cease    how  how do you mean  what for   said stepan arkadyevitch with a smile  because i am beginning an action for divorce against your sister  my wife
i ought to have    but  before alexey alexandrovitch had time to finish his sentence  stepan arkadyevitch was behaving not at all as he had expected
he groaned and sank into an armchair
 no  alexey alexandrovitch  what are you saying   cried oblonsky  and his suffering was apparent in his face
 it is so    excuse me  i can t  i can t believe it   alexey alexandrovitch sat down  feeling that his words had not had the effect he anticipated  and that it would be unavoidable for him to explain his position  and that  whatever explanations he might make  his relations with his brother in law would remain unchanged
 yes  i am brought to the painful necessity of seeking a divorce   he said
 i will say one thing  alexey alexandrovitch
i know you for an excellent  upright man  i know anna excuse anna karenina 828 of 1759 me  i can t change my opinion of her for a good  an excellent woman  and so  excuse me  i cannot believe it
there is some misunderstanding   said he
 oh  if it were merely a misunderstanding      pardon  i understand   interposed stepan arkadyevitch
 but of course   
one thing  you must not act in haste
you must not  you must not act in haste    i am not acting in haste   alexey alexandrovitch said coldly   but one cannot ask advice of anyone in such a matter
i have quite made up my mind
 this is awful   said stepan arkadyevitch
 i would do one thing  alexey alexandrovitch
i beseech you  do it   he said
 no action has yet been taken  if i understand rightly
before you take advice  see my wife  talk to her
she loves anna like a sister  she loves you  and she s a wonderful woman
for god s sake  talk to her  do me that favor  i beseech you   alexey alexandrovitch pondered  and stepan arkadyevitch looked at him sympathetically  without interrupting his silence
 you will go to see her    i don t know
that was just why i have not been to see you
i imagine our relations must change   anna karenina 829 of 1759  why so  i don t see that
allow me to believe that apart from our connection you have for me  at least in part  the same friendly feeling i have always had for you   and sincere esteem   said stepan arkadyevitch  pressing his hand
 even if your worst suppositions were correct  i don t and never would take on myself to judge either side  and i see no reason why our relations should be affected
but now  do this  come and see my wife    well  we look at the matter differently   said alexey alexandrovitch coldly
 however  we won t discuss it    no  why shouldn t you come today to dine  anyway  my wife s expecting you
please  do come
and  above all  talk it over with her
she s a wonderful woman
for god s sake  on my knees  i implore you    if you so much wish it  i will come   said alexey alexandrovitch  sighing
and  anxious to change the conversation  he inquired about what interested them both the new head of stepan arkadyevitch s department  a man not yet old  who had suddenly been promoted to so high a position
alexey alexandrovitch had previously felt no liking for count anitchkin  and had always differed from him in his opinions
but now  from a feeling readily comprehensible anna karenina 830 of 1759 to officials that hatred felt by one who has suffered a defeat in the service for one who has received a promotion  he could not endure him
 well  have you seen him   said alexey alexandrovitch with a malignant smile
 of course  he was at our sitting yesterday
he seems to know his work capitally  and to be very energetic    yes  but what is his energy directed to   said alexey alexandrovitch  is he aiming at doing anything  or simply undoing what s been done  it s the great misfortune of our government this paper administration  of which he s a worthy representative    really  i don t know what fault one could find with him
his policy i don t know  but one thing he s a very nice fellow   answered stepan arkadyevitch
 i ve just been seeing him  and he s really a capital fellow
we lunched together  and i taught him how to make  you know that drink  wine and oranges
it s so cooling
and it s a wonder he didn t know it
he liked it awfully
no  really he s a capital fellow   stepan arkadyevitch glanced at his watch
 why  good heavens  it s four already  and i ve still to go to dolgovushin s  so please come round to dinner
you can t imagine how you will grieve my wife and me   anna karenina 831 of 1759 the way in which alexey alexandrovitch saw his brother in law out was very different from the manner in which he had met him
 i ve promised  and i ll come   he answered wearily
 believe me  i appreciate it  and i hope you won t regret it   answered stepan arkadyevitch  smiling
and  putting on his coat as he went  he patted the footman on the head  chuckled  and went out
 at five o clock  and not evening dress  please   he shouted once more  turning at the door
anna karenina 832 of 1759 it was past five  and several guests had already arrived  before the host himself got home he went in together with sergey ivanovitch koznishev and pestsov  who had reached the street door at the same moment
these were the two leading representatives of the moscow intellectuals  as oblonsky had called them
both were men respected for their character and their intelligence
they respected each other  but were in complete and hopeless disagreement upon almost every subject  not because they belonged to opposite parties  but precisely because they were of the same party (their enemies refused to see any distinction between their views)  but  in that party  each had his own special shade of opinion
and since no difference is less easily overcome than the difference of opinion about semi abstract questions  they never agreed in any opinion  and had long  indeed  been accustomed to jeer without anger  each at the other s incorrigible aberrations
they were just going in at the door  talking of the weather  when stepan arkadyevitch overtook them
in the drawing room there were already sitting prince anna karenina 833 of 1759 alexander dmitrievitch shtcherbatsky  young shtcherbatsky  turovtsin  kitty  and karenin
stepan arkadyevitch saw immediately that things were not going well in the drawing room without him
darya alexandrovna  in her best gray silk gown  obviously worried about the children  who were to have their dinner by themselves in the nursery  and by her husband s absence  was not equal to the task of making the party mix without him all were sitting like so many priests  wives on a visit (so the old prince expressed it)  obviously wondering why they were there  and pumping up remarks simply to avoid being silent
turovtsin good  simple man felt unmistakably a fish out of water  and the smile with which his thick lips greeted stepan arkadyevitch said  as plainly as words   well  old boy  you have popped me down in a learned set  a drinking party now  or the chateau des fleurs  would be more in my line   the old prince sat in silence  his bright little eyes watching karenin from one side  and stepan arkadyevitch saw that he had already formed a phrase to sum up that politician of whom guests were invited to partake as though he were a sturgeon
kitty was looking at the door  calling up all her energies to keep her from blushing at the entrance of konstantin levin
young shtcherbatsky  who had not anna karenina 834 of 1759 been introduced to karenin  was trying to look as though he were not in the least conscious of it
karenin himself had followed the petersburg fashion for a dinner with ladies and was wearing evening dress and a white tie stepan arkadyevitch saw by his face that he had come simply to keep his promise  and was performing a disagreeable duty in being present at this gathering
he was indeed the person chiefly responsible for the chill benumbing all the guests before stepan arkadyevitch came in
on entering the drawing room stepan arkadyevitch apologized  explaining that he had been detained by that prince  who was always the scapegoat for all his absences and unpunctualities  and in one moment he had made all the guests acquainted with each other  and  bringing together alexey alexandrovitch and sergey koznishev  started them on a discussion of the russification of poland  into which they immediately plunged with pestsov
slapping turovtsin on the shoulder  he whispered something comic in his ear  and set him down by his wife and the old prince
then he told kitty she was looking very pretty that evening  and presented shtcherbatsky to karenin
in a moment he had so kneaded together the social dough that the drawing room became very lively  anna karenina 835 of 1759 and there was a merry buzz of voices
konstantin levin was the only person who had not arrived
but this was so much the better  as going into the dining room  stepan arkadyevitch found to his horror that the port and sherry had been procured from depre  and not from levy  and  directing that the coachman should be sent off as speedily as possible to levy s  he was going back to the drawing room
in the dining room he was met by konstantin levin
 i m not late    you can never help being late   said stepan arkadyevitch  taking his arm
 have you a lot of people  who s here   asked levin  unable to help blushing  as he knocked the snow off his cap with his glove
 all our own set
kitty s here
come along  i ll introduce you to karenin   stepan arkadyevitch  for all his liberal views  was well aware that to meet karenin was sure to be felt a flattering distinction  and so treated his best friends to this honor
but at that instant konstantin levin was not in a condition to feel all the gratification of making such an acquaintance
he had not seen kitty since that memorable evening when he met vronsky  not counting  that is  the moment anna karenina 836 of 1759 when he had had a glimpse of her on the highroad
he had known at the bottom of his heart that he would see her here today
but to keep his thoughts free  he had tried to persuade himself that he did not know it now when he heard that she was here  he was suddenly conscious of such delight  and at the same time of such dread  that his breath failed him and he could not utter what he wanted to say
 what is she like  what is she like  like what she used to be  or like what she was in the carriage  what if darya alexandrovna told the truth  why shouldn t it be the truth   he thought
 oh  please  introduce me to karenin   he brought out with an effort  and with a desperately determined step he walked into the drawing room and beheld her
she was not the same as she used to be  nor was she as she had been in the carriage  she was quite different
she was scared  shy  shame faced  and still more charming from it
she saw him the very instant he walked into the room
she had been expecting him
she was delighted  and so confused at her own delight that there was a moment  the moment when he went up to her sister and glanced again at her  when she  and he  and dolly  who saw it all  thought she would break down and would anna karenina 837 of 1759 begin to cry
she crimsoned  turned white  crimsoned again  and grew faint  waiting with quivering lips for him to come to her he went up to her  bowed  and held out his hand without speaking
except for the slight quiver of her lips and the moisture in her eyes that made them brighter  her smile was almost calm as she said   how long it is since we ve seen each other   and with desperate determination she pressed his hand with her cold hand
 you ve not seen me  but i ve seen you   said levin  with a radiant smile of happiness
 i saw you when you were driving from the railway station to ergushovo    when   she asked  wondering
 you were driving to ergushovo   said levin  feeling as if he would sob with the rapture that was flooding his heart
 and how dared i associate a thought of anything not innocent with this touching creature  and  yes  i do believe it s true what darya alexandrovna told me   he thought
stepan arkadyevitch took him by the arm and led him away to karenin
 let me introduce you   he mentioned their names
 very glad to meet you again   said alexey alexandrovitch coldly  shaking hands with levin
anna karenina 838 of 1759  you are acquainted   stepan arkadyevitch asked in surprise
 we spent three hours together in the train   said levin smiling   but got out  just as in a masquerade  quite mystified at least i was    nonsense  come along  please   said stepan arkadyevitch  pointing in the direction of the dining room
the men went into the dining room and went up to a table  laid with six sorts of spirits and as many kinds of cheese  some with little silver spades and some without  caviar  herrings  preserves of various kinds  and plates with slices of french bread
the men stood round the strong smelling spirits and salt delicacies  and the discussion of the russification of poland between koznishev  karenin  and pestsov died down in anticipation of dinner
sergey ivanovitch was unequaled in his skill in winding up the most heated and serious argument by some unexpected pinch of attic salt that changed the disposition of his opponent
he did this now
alexey alexandrovitch had been maintaining that the russification of poland could only be accomplished as a anna karenina 839 of 1759 result of larger measures which ought to be introduced by the russian government
pestsov insisted that one country can only absorb another when it is the more densely populated
koznishev admitted both points  but with limitations
as they were going out of the drawing room to conclude the argument  koznishev said  smiling   so  then  for the russification of our foreign populations there is but one method to bring up as many children as one can
my brother and i are terribly in fault  i see
you married men  especially you  stepan arkadyevitch  are the real patriots  what number have you reached   he said  smiling genially at their host and holding out a tiny wine glass to him
everyone laughed  and stepan arkadyevitch with particular good humor
 oh  yes  that s the best method   he said  munching cheese and filling the wine glass with a special sort of spirit
the conversation dropped at the jest
 this cheese is not bad
shall i give you some   said the master of the house
 why  have you been going in for gymnastics again   he asked levin  pinching his muscle with his left hand
levin smiled  bent his arm  and under stepan arkadyevitch s fingers the muscles swelled up like a anna karenina 840 of 1759 sound cheese  hard as a knob of iron  through the fine cloth of the coat
 what biceps  a perfect samson    i imagine great strength is needed for hunting bears   observed alexey alexandrovitch  who had the mistiest notions about the chase he cut off and spread with cheese a wafer of bread fine as a spider web
levin smiled
 not at all
quite the contrary  a child can kill a bear   he said  with a slight bow moving aside for the ladies  who were approaching the table
 you have killed a bear  i ve been told   said kitty  trying assiduously to catch with her fork a perverse mushroom that would slip away  and setting the lace quivering over her white arm
 are there bears on your place   she added  turning her charming little head to him and smiling
there was apparently nothing extraordinary in what she said  but what unutterable meaning there was for him in every sound  in every turn of her lips  her eyes  her hand as she said it  there was entreaty for forgiveness  and trust in him  and tenderness  soft  timid tenderness and promise and hope and love for him  which he could not but believe in and which choked him with happiness
anna karenina 841 of 1759  no  we ve been hunting in the tver province
it was coming back from there that i met your beau frere in the train  or your beau frere s brother in law   he said with a smile
 it was an amusing meeting   and he began telling with droll good humor how  after not sleeping all night  he had  wearing an old fur lined  full skirted coat  got into alexey alexandrovitch s compartment
 the conductor  forgetting the proverb  would have chucked me out on account of my attire  but thereupon i began expressing my feelings in elevated language  and   you  too   he said  addressing karenin and forgetting his name   at first would have ejected me on the ground of the old coat  but afterwards you took my part  for which i am extremely grateful    the rights of passengers generally to choose their seats are too ill defined   said alexey alexandrovitch  rubbing the tips of his fingers on his handkerchief
 i saw you were in uncertainty about me   said levin  smiling good naturedly   but i made haste to plunge into intellectual conversation to smooth over the defects of my attire   sergey ivanovitch  while he kept up a conversation with their hostess  had one ear for his brother  and he glanced askance at him
 what is the matter with him anna karenina 842 of 1759 today  why such a conquering hero   he thought
he did not know that levin was feeling as though he had grown wings
levin knew she was listening to his words and that she was glad to listen to him
and this was the only thing that interested him
not in that room only  but in the whole world  there existed for him only himself  with enormously increased importance and dignity in his own eyes  and she he felt himself on a pinnacle that made him giddy  and far away down below were all those nice excellent karenins  oblonskys  and all the world quite without attracting notice  without glancing at them  as though there were no other places left  stepan arkadyevitch put levin and kitty side by side
 oh  you may as well sit there   he said to levin
the dinner was as choice as the china  in which stepan arkadyevitch was a connoisseur
the soupe marie louise was a splendid success  the tiny pies eaten with it melted in the mouth and were irreproachable
the two footmen and matvey  in white cravats  did their duty with the dishes and wines unobtrusively  quietly  and swiftly
on the material side the dinner was a success  it was no less so on the immaterial
the conversation  at times general and at times between individuals  never paused  and towards the end the company was so lively that the men rose from the anna karenina 843 of 1759 table  without stopping speaking  and even alexey alexandrovitch thawed
anna karenina 844 of 1759 pestsov liked thrashing an argument out to the end  and was not satisfied with sergey ivanovitch s words  especially as he felt the injustice of his view
 i did not mean   he said over the soup  addressing alexey alexandrovitch   mere density of population alone  but in conjunction with fundamental ideas  and not by means of principles    it seems to me   alexey alexandrovitch said languidly  and with no haste   that that s the same thing in my opinion  influence over another people is only possible to the people which has the higher development  which     but that s just the question   pestsov broke in in his bass
he was always in a hurry to speak  and seemed always to put his whole soul into what he was saying
 in what are we to make higher development consist  the english  the french  the germans  which is at the highest stage of development  which of them will nationalize the other  we see the rhine provinces have been turned french  but the germans are not at a lower stage   he shouted
 there is another law at work there   anna karenina 845 of 1759  i fancy that the greater influence is always on the side of true civilization   said alexey alexandrovitch  slightly lifting his eyebrows
 but what are we to lay down as the outward signs of true civilization   said pestsov
 i imagine such signs are generally very well known   said alexey alexandrovitch
 but are they fully known   sergey ivanovitch put in with a subtle smile
 it is the accepted view now that real culture must be purely classical  but we see most intense disputes on each side of the question  and there is no denying that the opposite camp has strong points in its favor    you are for classics  sergey ivanovitch
will you take red wine   said stepan arkadyevitch
 i am not expressing my own opinion of either form of culture   sergey ivanovitch said  holding out his glass with a smile of condescension  as to a child
 i only say that both sides have strong arguments to support them   he went on  addressing alexey alexandrovitch
 my sympathies are classical from education  but in this discussion i am personally unable to arrive at a conclusion
i see no distinct grounds for classical studies being given a preeminence over scientific studies   anna karenina 846 of 1759  the natural sciences have just as great an educational value   put in pestsov
 take astronomy  take botany  or zoology with its system of general principles    i cannot quite agree with that   responded alexey alexandrovitch  it seems to me that one must admit that the very process of studying the forms of language has a peculiarly favorable influence on intellectual development moreover  it cannot be denied that the influence of the classical authors is in the highest degree moral  while  unfortunately  with the study of the natural sciences are associated the false and noxious doctrines which are the curse of our day   sergey ivanovitch would have said something  but pestsov interrupted him in his rich bass
he began warmly contesting the justice of this view
sergey ivanovitch waited serenely to speak  obviously with a convincing reply ready
 but   said sergey ivanovitch  smiling subtly  and addressing karenin   one must allow that to weigh all the advantages and disadvantages of classical and scientific studies is a difficult task  and the question which form of education was to be preferred would not have been so quickly and conclusively decided if there had not been in anna karenina 847 of 1759 favor of classical education  as you expressed it just now  its moral disons le mot anti nihilist influence    undoubtedly    if it had not been for the distinctive property of antinihilistic influence on the side of classical studies  we should have considered the subject more  have weighed the arguments on both sides   said sergey ivanovitch with a subtle smile   we should have given elbow room to both tendencies
but now we know that these little pills of classical learning possess the medicinal property of antinihilism  and we boldly prescribe them to our patients   
but what if they had no such medicinal property   he wound up humorously
at sergey ivanovitch s little pills  everyone laughed  turovtsin in especial roared loudly and jovially  glad at last to have found something to laugh at  all he ever looked for in listening to conversation
stepan arkadyevitch had not made a mistake in inviting pestsov
with pestsov intellectual conversation never flagged for an instant
directly sergey ivanovitch had concluded the conversation with his jest  pestsov promptly started a new one
 i can t agree even   said he   that the government had that aim
the government obviously is guided by abstract anna karenina 848 of 1759 considerations  and remains indifferent to the influence its measures may exercise
the education of women  for instance  would naturally be regarded as likely to be harmful  but the government opens schools and universities for women   and the conversation at once passed to the new subject of the education of women
alexey alexandrovitch expressed the idea that the education of women is apt to be confounded with the emancipation of women  and that it is only so that it can be considered dangerous
 i consider  on the contrary  that the two questions are inseparably connected together   said pestsov   it is a vicious circle
woman is deprived of rights from lack of education  and the lack of education results from the absence of rights
we must not forget that the subjection of women is so complete  and dates from such ages back that we are often unwilling to recognize the gulf that separates them from us   said he
 you said rights   said sergey ivanovitch  waiting till pestsov had finished   meaning the right of sitting on juries  of voting  of presiding at official meetings  the right of entering the civil service  of sitting in parliament     undoubtedly   anna karenina 849 of 1759  but if women  as a rare exception  can occupy such positions  it seems to me you are wrong in using the expression  rights   it would be more correct to say duties every man will agree that in doing the duty of a juryman  a witness  a telegraph clerk  we feel we are performing duties
and therefore it would be correct to say that women are seeking duties  and quite legitimately
and one can but sympathize with this desire to assist in the general labor of man    quite so   alexey alexandrovitch assented
 the question  i imagine  is simply whether they are fitted for such duties    they will most likely be perfectly fitted   said stepan arkadyevitch   when education has become general among them
we see this     how about the proverb   said the prince  who had a long while been intent on the conversation  his little comical eyes twinkling
 i can say it before my daughter  her hair is long  because her wit is     just what they thought of the negroes before their emancipation   said pestsov angrily
 what seems strange to me is that women should seek fresh duties   said sergey ivanovitch   while we see  unhappily  that men usually try to avoid them   anna karenina 850 of 1759  duties are bound up with rights power  money  honor  those are what women are seeking   said pestsov  just as though i should seek the right to be a wet nurse and feel injured because women are paid for the work  while no one will take me   said the old prince
turovtsin exploded in a loud roar of laughter and sergey ivanovitch regretted that he had not made this comparison
even alexey alexandrovitch smiled
 yes  but a man can t nurse a baby   said pestsov   while a woman     no  there was an englishman who did suckle his baby on board ship   said the old prince  feeling this freedom in conversation permissible before his own daughters
 there are as many such englishmen as there would be women officials   said sergey ivanovitch
 yes  but what is a girl to do who has no family   put in stepan arkadyevitch  thinking of masha tchibisova  whom he had had in his mind all along  in sympathizing with pestsov and supporting him
 if the story of such a girl were thoroughly sifted  you would find she had abandoned a family her own or a sister s  where she might have found a woman s duties   darya alexandrovna broke in unexpectedly in a tone of anna karenina 851 of 1759 exasperation  probably suspecting what sort of girl stepan arkadyevitch was thinking of
 but we take our stand on principle as the ideal   replied pestsov in his mellow bass
 woman desires to have rights  to be independent  educated
she is oppressed  humiliated by the consciousness of her disabilities    and i m oppressed and humiliated that they won t engage me at the foundling   the old prince said again  to the huge delight of turovtsin  who in his mirth dropped his asparagus with the thick end in the sauce
anna karenina 852 of 1759 everyone took part in the conversation except kitty and levin
at first  when they were talking of the influence that one people has on another  there rose to levin s mind what he had to say on the subject
but these ideas  once of such importance in his eyes  seemed to come into his brain as in a dream  and had now not the slightest interest for him
it even struck him as strange that they should be so eager to talk of what was of no use to anyone
kitty  too  should  one would have supposed  have been interested in what they were saying of the rights and education of women
how often she had mused on the subject  thinking of her friend abroad  varenka  of her painful state of dependence  how often she had wondered about herself what would become of her if she did not marry  and how often she had argued with her sister about it  but it did not interest her at all
she and levin had a conversation of their own  yet not a conversation  but some sort of mysterious communication  which brought them every moment nearer  and stirred in both a sense of glad terror before the unknown into which they were entering
anna karenina 853 of 1759 at first levin  in answer to kitty s question how he could have seen her last year in the carriage  told her how he had been coming home from the mowing along the highroad and had met her
 it was very  very early in the morning
you were probably only just awake
your mother was asleep in the corner
it was an exquisite morning
i was walking along wondering who it could be in a four in hand  it was a splendid set of four horses with bells  and in a second you flashed by  and i saw you at the window you were sitting like this  holding the strings of your cap in both hands  and thinking awfully deeply about something   he said  smiling
 how i should like to know what you were thinking about then  something important    wasn t i dreadfully untidy   she wondered  but seeing the smile of ecstasy these reminiscences called up  she felt that the impression she had made had been very good
she blushed and laughed with delight   really i don t remember    how nicely turovtsin laughs   said levin  admiring his moist eyes and shaking chest
 have you known him longs  asked kitty
 oh  everyone knows him    and i see you think he s a horrid man   anna karenina 854 of 1759  not horrid  but nothing in him    oh  you re wrong  and you must give up thinking so directly   said kitty
 i used to have a very poor opinion of him too  but he  he s an awfully nice and wonderfully good hearted man
he has a heart of gold    how could you find out what sort of heart he has    we are great friends
i know him very well
last winter  soon after   you came to see us   she said  with a guilty and at the same time confiding smile   all dolly s children had scarlet fever  and he happened to come and see her
and only fancy   she said in a whisper   he felt so sorry for her that he stayed and began to help her look after the children
yes  and for three weeks he stopped with them  and looked after the children like a nurse    i am telling konstantin dmitrievitch about turovtsin in the scarlet fever   she said  bending over to her sister
 yes  it was wonderful  noble   said dolly  glancing towards turovtsin  who had become aware they were talking of him  and smiling gently to him
levin glanced once more at turovtsin  and wondered how it was he had not realized all this man s goodness before
 i m sorry  i m sorry  and i ll never think ill of people again   he said gaily  genuinely expressing what he felt at the moment
anna karenina 855 of 1759 connected with the conversation that had sprung up on the rights of women there were certain questions as to the inequality of rights in marriage improper to discuss before the ladies
pestsov had several times during dinner touched upon these questions  but sergey ivanovitch and stepan arkadyevitch carefully drew him off them
when they rose from the table and the ladies had gone out  pestsov did not follow them  but addressing alexey alexandrovitch  began to expound the chief ground of inequality
the inequality in marriage  in his opinion  lay in the fact that the infidelity of the wife and infidelity of the husband are punished unequally  both by the law and by public opinion
stepan arkadyevitch went hurriedly up to alexey alexandrovitch and offered him a cigar
 no  i don t smoke   alexey alexandrovitch answered calmly  and as though purposely wishing to show that he was not afraid of the subject  he turned to pestsov with a chilly smile
 i imagine that such a view has a foundation in the very nature of things   he said  and would have gone on to the drawing room
but at this point turovtsin broke suddenly anna karenina 856 of 1759 and unexpectedly into the conversation  addressing alexey alexandrovitch
 you heard  perhaps  about pryatchnikov   said turovtsin  warmed up by the champagne he had drunk  and long waiting for an opportunity to break the silence that had weighed on him
 vasya pryatchnikov   he said  with a good natured smile on his damp  red lips  addressing himself principally to the most important guest  alexey alexandrovitch   they told me today he fought a duel with kvitsky at tver  and has killed him   just as it always seems that one bruises oneself on a sore place  so stepan arkadyevitch felt now that the conversation would by ill luck fall every moment on alexey alexandrovitch s sore spot he would again have got his brother in law away  but alexey alexandrovitch himself inquired  with curiosity   what did pryatchnikov fight about    his wife acted like a man  he did  called him out and shot him    ah   said alexey alexandrovitch indifferently  and lifting his eyebrows  he went into the drawing room
 how glad i am you have come   dolly said with a frightened smile  meeting him in the outer drawing room
 i must talk to you
let s sit here   anna karenina 857 of 1759 alexey alexandrovitch  with the same expression of indifference  given him by his lifted eyebrows  sat down beside darya alexandrovna  and smiled affectedly
 it s fortunate   said he   especially as i was meaning to ask you to excuse me  and to be taking leave
i have to start tomorrow   darya alexandrovna was firmly convinced of anna s innocence  and she felt herself growing pale and her lips quivering with anger at this frigid  unfeeling man  who was so calmly intending to ruin her innocent friend
 alexey alexandrovitch   she said  with desperate resolution looking him in the face   i asked you about anna  you made me no answer
how is she    she is  i believe  quite well  darya alexandrovna   replied alexey alexandrovitch  not looking at her
 alexey alexandrovitch  forgive me  i have no right   but i love anna as a sister  and esteem her  i beg  i beseech you to tell me what is wrong between you  what fault do you find with her   alexey alexandrovitch frowned  and almost closing his eyes  dropped his head
 i presume that your husband has told you the grounds on which i consider it necessary to change my attitude to anna arkadyevna   he said  not looking her in the face  anna karenina 858 of 1759 but eyeing with displeasure shtcherbatsky  who was walking across the drawing room
 i don t believe it  i don t believe it  i can t believe it   dolly said  clasping her bony hands before her with a vigorous gesture
she rose quickly  and laid her hand on alexey alexandrovitch s sleeve
 we shall be disturbed here
come this way  please   dolly s agitation had an effect on alexey alexandrovitch
he got up and submissively followed her to the schoolroom
they sat down to a table covered with an oilcloth cut in slits by penknives
 i don t  i don t believe it   dolly said  trying to catch his glance that avoided her
 one cannot disbelieve facts  darya alexandrovna   said he  with an emphasis on the word  facts    but what has she done   said darya alexandrovna
 what precisely has she done    she has forsaken her duty  and deceived her husband
that s what she has done   said he
 no  no  it can t be  no  for god s sake  you are mistaken   said dolly  putting her hands to her temples and closing her eyes
alexey alexandrovitch smiled coldly  with his lips alone  meaning to signify to her and himself the firmness anna karenina 859 of 1759 of his conviction  but this warm defense  though it could not shake him  reopened his wound he began to speak with greater heat
 it is extremely difficult to be mistaken when a wife herself informs her husband of the fact informs him that eight years of her life  and a son  all that s a mistake  and that she wants to begin life again   he said angrily  with a snort  anna and sin i cannot connect them  i cannot believe it    darya alexandrovna   he said  now looking straight into dolly s kindly  troubled face  and feeling that his tongue was being loosened in spite of himself   i would give a great deal for doubt to be still possible when i doubted  i was miserable  but it was better than now
when i doubted  i had hope  but now there is no hope  and still i doubt of everything
i am in such doubt of everything that i even hate my son  and sometimes do not believe he is my son
i am very unhappy   he had no need to say that
darya alexandrovna had seen that as soon as he glanced into her face  and she felt sorry for him  and her faith in the innocence of her friend began to totter
anna karenina 860 of 1759  oh  this is awful  awful  but can it be true that you are resolved on a divorce    i am resolved on extreme measures
there is nothing else for me to do    nothing else to do  nothing else to do     she replied  with tears in her eyes
 oh no  don t say nothing else to do   she said
 what is horrible in a trouble of this kind is that one cannot  as in any other in loss  in death bear one s trouble in peace  but that one must act   said he  as though guessing her thought
 one must get out of the humiliating position in which one is placed  one can t live a trois    i understand  i quite understand that   said dolly  and her head sank
she was silent for a little  thinking of herself  of her own grief in her family  and all at once  with an impulsive movement  she raised her head and clasped her hands with an imploring gesture
 but wait a little  you are a christian
think of her  what will become of her  if you cast her off    i have thought  darya alexandrovna  i have thought a great deal   said alexey alexandrovitch
his face turned red in patches  and his dim eyes looked straight before him
darya alexandrovna at that moment pitied him with anna karenina 861 of 1759 all her heart
 that was what i did indeed when she herself made known to me my humiliation  i left everything as of old
i gave her a chance to reform  i tried to save her
and with what result  she would not regard the slightest request that she should observe decorum   he said  getting heated
 one may save anyone who does not want to be ruined  but if the whole nature is so corrupt  so depraved  that ruin itself seems to be her salvation  what s to be done    anything  only not divorce   answered darya alexandrovna  but what is anything    no  it is awful  she will be no one s wife  she will be lost    what can i do   said alexey alexandrovitch  raising his shoulders and his eyebrows the recollection of his wife s last act had so incensed him that he had become frigid  as at the beginning of the conversation
 i am very grateful for your sympathy  but i must be going   he said  getting up
 no  wait a minute
you must not ruin her
wait a little  i will tell you about myself
i was married  and my husband deceived me  in anger and jealousy  i would have thrown up everything  i would myself   
but i came to anna karenina 862 of 1759 myself again  and who did it  anna saved me
and here i am living on
the children are growing up  my husband has come back to his family  and feels his fault  is growing purer  better  and i live on   
i have forgiven it  and you ought to forgive   alexey alexandrovitch heard her  but her words had no effect on him now
all the hatred of that day when he had resolved on a divorce had sprung up again in his soul
he shook himself  and said in a shrill  loud voice   forgive i cannot  and do not wish to  and i regard it as wrong i have done everything for this woman  and she has trodden it all in the mud to which she is akin
i am not a spiteful man  i have never hated anyone  but i hate her with my whole soul  and i cannot even forgive her  because i hate her too much for all the wrong she has done me   he said  with tones of hatred in his voice
 love those that hate you      darya alexandrovna whispered timorously
alexey alexandrovitch smiled contemptuously
that he knew long ago  but it could not be applied to his case
 love those that hate you  but to love those one hates is impossible
forgive me for having troubled you
everyone has enough to bear in his own grief   and regaining his anna karenina 863 of 1759 self possession  alexey alexandrovitch quietly took leave and went away
anna karenina 864 of 1759 when they rose from table  levin would have liked to follow kitty into the drawing room  but he was afraid she might dislike this  as too obviously paying her attention
he remained in the little ring of men  taking part in the general conversation  and without looking at kitty  he was aware of her movements  her looks  and the place where she was in the drawing room
he did at once  and without the smallest effort  keep the promise he had made her always to think well of all men  and to like everyone always
the conversation fell on the village commune  in which pestsov saw a sort of special principle  called by him the choral principle
levin did not agree with pestsov  nor with his brother  who had a special attitude of his own  both admitting and not admitting the significance of the russian commune
but he talked to them  simply trying to reconcile and soften their differences
he was not in the least interested in what he said himself  and even less so in what they said  all he wanted was that they and everyone should be happy and contented he knew now the one thing of importance  and that one thing was at first there  in the drawing room  anna karenina 865 of 1759 and then began moving across and came to a standstill at the door
without turning round he felt the eyes fixed on him  and the smile  and he could not help turning round
she was standing in the doorway with shtcherbatsky  looking at him
 i thought you were going towards the piano   said he  going up to her
 that s something i miss in the country  music    no  we only came to fetch you and thank you   she said  rewarding him with a smile that was like a gift   for coming what do they want to argue for  no one ever convinces anyone  you know    yes  that s true   said levin   it generally happens that one argues warmly simply because one can t make out what one s opponent wants to prove   levin had often noticed in discussions between the most intelligent people that after enormous efforts  and an enormous expenditure of logical subtleties and words  the disputants finally arrived at being aware that what they had so long been struggling to prove to one another had long ago  from the beginning of the argument  been known to both  but that they liked different things  and would not define what they liked for fear of its being attacked
he had often had the experience of suddenly in a discussion anna karenina 866 of 1759 grasping what it was his opponent liked and at once liking it too  and immediately he found himself agreeing  and then all arguments fell away as useless sometimes  too  he had experienced the opposite  expressing at last what he liked himself  which he was devising arguments to defend  and  chancing to express it well and genuinely  he had found his opponent at once agreeing and ceasing to dispute his position he tried to say this
she knitted her brow  trying to understand
but directly he began to illustrate his meaning  she understood at once
 i know  one must find out what he is arguing for  what is precious to him  then one can    she had completely guessed and expressed his badly expressed idea
levin smiled joyfully  he was struck by this transition from the confused  verbose discussion with pestsov and his brother to this laconic  clear  almost wordless communication of the most complex ideas
shtcherbatsky moved away from them  and kitty  going up to a card table  sat down  and  taking up the chalk  began drawing diverging circles over the new green cloth
they began again on the subject that had been started at dinner  the liberty and occupations of women
levin was of the opinion of darya alexandrovna that a girl who anna karenina 867 of 1759 did not marry should find a woman s duties in a family
he supported this view by the fact that no family can get on without women to help  that in every family  poor or rich  there are and must be nurses  either relations or hired
 no   said kitty  blushing  but looking at him all the more boldly with her truthful eyes   a girl may be so circumstanced that she cannot live in the family without humiliation  while she herself    at the hint he understood her  oh  yes   he said
 yes  yes  yes you re right  you re right   and he saw all that pestsov had been maintaining at dinner of the liberty of woman  simply from getting a glimpse of the terror of an old maid s existence and its humiliation in kitty s heart  and loving her  he felt that terror and humiliation  and at once gave up his arguments
a silence followed
she was still drawing with the chalk on the table
her eyes were shining with a soft light
under the influence of her mood he felt in all his being a continually growing tension of happiness
 ah  i ve scribbled all over the table   she said  and laying down the chalk  she made a movement as though to get up
anna karenina 868 of 1759  what  shall i be left alone without her   he thought with horror  and he took the chalk
 wait a minute   he said  sitting down to the table
 i ve long wanted to ask you one thing   he looked straight into her caressing  though frightened eyes
 please  ask it    here   he said  and he wrote the initial letters  w  y  t  m  i  c  n  b  d  t  m  n  o  t
these letters meant   when you told me it could never be  did that mean never  or then   there seemed no likelihood that she could make out this complicated sentence  but he looked at her as though his life depended on her understanding the words
she glanced at him seriously  then leaned her puckered brow on her hands and began to read
once or twice she stole a look at him  as though asking him   is it what i think    i understand   she said  flushing a little
 what is this word   he said  pointing to the n that stood for never
 it means never   she said   but that s not true   he quickly rubbed out what he had written  gave her the chalk  and stood up
she wrote  t  i  c  n  a  d
anna karenina 869 of 1759 dolly was completely comforted in the depression caused by her conversation with alexey alexandrovitch when she caught sight of the two figures  kitty with the chalk in her hand  with a shy and happy smile looking upwards at levin  and his handsome figure bending over the table with glowing eyes fastened one minute on the table and the next on her
he was suddenly radiant  he had understood
it meant   then i could not answer differently   he glanced at her questioningly  timidly
 only then    yes   her smile answered
 and n   and now   he asked
 well  read this
i ll tell you what i should like should like so much   she wrote the initial letters  i  y  c  f  a  f  w  h
this meant   if you could forget and forgive what happened   he snatched the chalk with nervous  trembling fingers  and breaking it  wrote the initial letters of the following phrase   i have nothing to forget and to forgive  i have never ceased to love you   she glanced at him with a smile that did not waver
 i understand   she said in a whisper
anna karenina 870 of 1759 he sat down and wrote a long phrase
she understood it all  and without asking him   is it this   took the chalk and at once answered
for a long while he could not understand what she had written  and often looked into her eyes
he was stupefied with happiness
he could not supply the word she had meant  but in her charming eyes  beaming with happiness  he saw all he needed to know
and he wrote three letters
but he had hardly finished writing when she read them over her arm  and herself finished and wrote the answer   yes    you re playing secretaire   said the old prince
 but we must really be getting along if you want to be in time at the theater   levin got up and escorted kitty to the door
in their conversation everything had been said  it had been said that she loved him  and that she would tell her father and mother that he would come tomorrow morning
anna karenina 871 of 1759 when kitty had gone and levin was left alone  he felt such uneasiness without her and such an impatient longing to get as quickly  as quickly as possible  to tomorrow morning  when he would see her again and be plighted to her forever  that he felt afraid  as though of death  of those fourteen hours that he had to get through without her
it was essential for him to be with someone to talk to  so as not to be left alone  to kill time
stepan arkadyevitch would have been the companion most congenial to him  but he was going out  he said  to a soiree  in reality to the ballet
levin only had time to tell him he was happy  and that he loved him  and would never  never forget what he had done for him
the eyes and the smile of stepan arkadyevitch showed levin that he comprehended that feeling fittingly
 oh  so it s not time to die yet   said stepan arkadyevitch  pressing levin s hand with emotion
 n n no   said levin
darya alexandrovna too  as she said good bye to him  gave him a sort of congratulation  saying   how glad i am you have met kitty again  one must value old friends   anna karenina 872 of 1759 levin did not like these words of darya alexandrovna s
she could not understand how lofty and beyond her it all was  and she ought not to have dared to allude to it
levin said good bye to them  but  not to be left alone  he attached himself to his brother  where are you going    i m going to a meeting    well  i ll come with you
may i    what for  yes  come along   said sergey ivanovitch  smiling
 what is the matter with you today    with me  happiness is the matter with me   said levin  letting down the window of the carriage they were driving in
 you don t mind  it s so stifling
it s happiness is the matter with me  why is it you have never married   sergey ivanovitch smiled
 i am very glad  she seems a nice gi     sergey ivanovitch was beginning  don t say it  don t say it   shouted levin  clutching at the collar of his fur coat with both hands  and muffling him up in it
 she s a nice girl  were such simple  humble words  so out of harmony with his feeling
sergey ivanovitch laughed outright a merry laugh  which was rare with him
 well  anyway  i may say that i m very glad of it   anna karenina 873 of 1759  that you may do tomorrow  tomorrow and nothing more  nothing  nothing  silence   said levin  and muffing him once more in his fur coat  he added   i do like you so  well  is it possible for me to be present at the meeting    of course it is    what is your discussion about today   asked levin  never ceasing smiling
they arrived at the meeting
levin heard the secretary hesitatingly read the minutes which he obviously did not himself understand  but levin saw from this secretary s face what a good  nice  kind hearted person he was this was evident from his confusion and embarrassment in reading the minutes
then the discussion began
they were disputing about the misappropriation of certain sums and the laying of certain pipes  and sergey ivanovitch was very cutting to two members  and said something at great length with an air of triumph  and another member  scribbling something on a bit of paper  began timidly at first  but afterwards answered him very viciously and delightfully and then sviazhsky (he was there too) said something too  very handsomely and nobly
levin listened to them  and saw clearly that these missing sums and these pipes were not anything real  and that they were not at all angry  but were all the nicest  kindest people  and anna karenina 874 of 1759 everything was as happy and charming as possible among them they did no harm to anyone  and were all enjoying it
what struck levin was that he could see through them all today  and from little  almost imperceptible signs knew the soul of each  and saw distinctly that they were all good at heart
and levin himself in particular they were all extremely fond of that day that was evident from the way they spoke to him  from the friendly  affectionate way even those he did not know looked at him
 well  did you like it   sergey ivanovitch asked him
 very much
i never supposed it was so interesting  capital  splendid   sviazhsky went up to levin and invited him to come round to tea with him
levin was utterly at a loss to comprehend or recall what it was he had disliked in sviazhsky  what he had failed to find in him
he was a clever and wonderfully good hearted man
 most delighted   he said  and asked after his wife and sister in law
and from a queer association of ideas  because in his imagination the idea of sviazhsky s sister inlaw was connected with marriage  it occurred to him that there was no one to whom he could more suitably speak of his happiness  and he was very glad to go and see them
anna karenina 875 of 1759 sviazhsky questioned him about his improvements on his estate  presupposing  as he always did  that there was no possibility of doing anything not done already in europe  and now this did not in the least annoy levin
on the contrary  he felt that sviazhsky was right  that the whole business was of little value  and he saw the wonderful softness and consideration with which sviazhsky avoided fully expressing his correct view
the ladies of the sviazhsky household were particularly delightful
it seemed to levin that they knew all about it already and sympathized with him  saying nothing merely from delicacy
he stayed with them one hour  two  three  talking of all sorts of subjects but the one thing that filled his heart  and did not observe that he was boring them dreadfully  and that it was long past their bedtime
sviazhsky went with him into the hall  yawning and wondering at the strange humor his friend was in
it was past one o clock
levin went back to his hotel  and was dismayed at the thought that all alone now with his impatience he had ten hours still left to get through
the servant  whose turn it was to be up all night  lighted his candles  and would have gone away  but levin stopped him
this servant  yegor  whom levin had noticed anna karenina 876 of 1759 before  struck him as a very intelligent  excellent  and  above all  good hearted man
 well  yegor  it s hard work not sleeping  isn t it    one s got to put up with it  it s part of our work  you see
in a gentleman s house it s easier  but then here one makes more   it appeared that yegor had a family  three boys and a daughter  a sempstress  whom he wanted to marry to a cashier in a saddler s shop
levin  on hearing this  informed yegor that  in his opinion  in marriage the great thing was love  and that with love one would always be happy  for happiness rests only on oneself
yegor listened attentively  and obviously quite took in levin s idea  but by way of assent to it he enunciated  greatly to levin s surprise  the observation that when he had lived with good masters he had always been satisfied with his masters  and now was perfectly satisfied with his employer  though he was a frenchman
 wonderfully good hearted fellow   thought levin
 well  but you yourself  yegor  when you got married  did you love your wife    ay  and why not   responded yegor
and levin saw that yegor too was in an excited state and intending to express all his most heartfelt emotions
anna karenina 877 of 1759  my life  too  has been a wonderful one
from a child up     he was beginning with flashing eyes  apparently catching levin s enthusiasm  just as people catch yawning
but at that moment a ring was heard
yegor departed  and levin was left alone
he had eaten scarcely anything at dinner  had refused tea and supper at sviazhsky s  but he was incapable of thinking of supper
he had not slept the previous night  but was incapable of thinking of sleep either
his room was cold  but he was oppressed by heat
he opened both the movable panes in his window and sat down to the table opposite the open panes
over the snow covered roofs could be seen a decorated cross with chains  and above it the rising triangle of charles s wain with the yellowish light of capella
he gazed at the cross  then at the stars  drank in the fresh freezing air that flowed evenly into the room  and followed as though in a dream the images and memories that rose in his imagination
at four o clock he heard steps in the passage and peeped out at the door
it was the gambler myaskin  whom he knew  coming from the club
he walked gloomily  frowning and coughing
 poor  unlucky fellow   thought levin  and tears came into his eyes from love and pity for this man
he would have talked with him  and tried to comfort him  but remembering that he had nothing but his shirt on  he anna karenina 878 of 1759 changed his mind and sat down again at the open pane to bathe in the cold air and gaze at the exquisite lines of the cross  silent  but full of meaning for him  and the mounting lurid yellow star
at seven o clock there was a noise of people polishing the floors  and bells ringing in some servants  department  and levin felt that he was beginning to get frozen
he closed the pane  washed  dressed  and went out into the street
anna karenina 879 of 1759 the streets were still empty
levin went to the house of the shtcherbatskys
the visitors  doors were closed and everything was asleep
he walked back  went into his room again  and asked for coffee
the day servant  not yegor this time  brought it to him
levin would have entered into conversation with him  but a bell rang for the servant  and he went out
levin tried to drink coffee and put some roll in his mouth  but his mouth was quite at a loss what to do with the roll
levin  rejecting the roll  put on his coat and went out again for a walk
it was nine o clock when he reached the shtcherbatskys  steps the second time
in the house they were only just up  and the cook came out to go marketing
he had to get through at least two hours more
all that night and morning levin lived perfectly unconsciously  and felt perfectly lifted out of the conditions of material life
he had eaten nothing for a whole day  he had not slept for two nights  had spent several hours undressed in the frozen air  and felt not simply fresher and stronger than ever  but felt utterly independent of his body  he moved without muscular anna karenina 880 of 1759 effort  and felt as if he could do anything
he was convinced he could fly upwards or lift the corner of the house  if need be
he spent the remainder of the time in the street  incessantly looking at his watch and gazing about him
and what he saw then  he never saw again after
the children especially going to school  the bluish doves flying down from the roofs to the pavement  and the little loaves covered with flour  thrust out by an unseen hand  touched him
those loaves  those doves  and those two boys were not earthly creatures
it all happened at the same time  a boy ran towards a dove and glanced smiling at levin  the dove  with a whir of her wings  darted away  flashing in the sun  amid grains of snow that quivered in the air  while from a little window there came a smell of freshbaked bread  and the loaves were put out
all of this together was so extraordinarily nice that levin laughed and cried with delight
going a long way round by gazetny place and kislovka  he went back again to the hotel  and putting his watch before him  he sat down to wait for twelve o clock
in the next room they were talking about some sort of machines  and swindling  and coughing their morning coughs
they did not realize that the hand was near twelve
the hand reached it
levin anna karenina 881 of 1759 went out onto the steps
the sledge drivers clearly knew all about it
they crowded round levin with happy faces  quarreling among themselves  and offering their services trying not to offend the other sledge drivers  and promising to drive with them too  levin took one and told him to drive to the shtcherbatskys 
the sledge driver was splendid in a white shirt collar sticking out over his overcoat and into his strong  full blooded red neck
the sledge was high and comfortable  and altogether such a one as levin never drove in after  and the horse was a good one  and tried to gallop but didn t seem to move
the driver knew the shtcherbatskys  house  and drew up at the entrance with a curve of his arm and a  wo   especially indicative of respect for his fare
the shtcherbatskys  hall porter certainly knew all about it
this was evident from the smile in his eyes and the way he said   well  it s a long while since you ve been to see us  konstantin demitrievitch   not only he knew all about it  but he was unmistakably delighted and making efforts to conceal his joy
looking into his kindly old eyes  levin realized even something new in his happiness
 are they up   anna karenina 882 of 1759  pray walk in  leave it here   said he  smiling  as levin would have come back to take his hat
that meant something
 to whom shall i announce your honor   asked the footman
the footman  though a young man  and one of the new school of footmen  a dandy  was a very kind hearted  good fellow  and he too knew all about it
 the princess   the prince   the young princess     said levin
the first person he saw was mademoiselle linon
she walked across the room  and her ringlets and her face were beaming
he had only just spoken to her  when suddenly he heard the rustle of a skirt at the door  and mademoiselle linon vanished from levin s eyes  and a joyful terror came over him at the nearness of his happiness
mademoiselle linon was in great haste  and leaving him  went out at the other door
directly she had gone out  swift  swift light steps sounded on the parquet  and his bliss  his life  himself what was best in himself  what he had so long sought and longed for was quickly  so quickly approaching him she did not walk  but seemed  by some unseen force  to float to him
he saw nothing but her clear  truthful eyes  frightened by the same anna karenina 883 of 1759 bliss of love that flooded his heart
those eyes were shining nearer and nearer  blinding him with their light of love
she stopped still close to him  touching him
her hands rose and dropped onto his shoulders
she had done all she could she had run up to him and given herself up entirely  shy and happy
he put his arms round her and pressed his lips to her mouth that sought his kiss she too had not slept all night  and had been expecting him all the morning
her mother and father had consented without demur  and were happy in her happiness
she had been waiting for him
she wanted to be the first to tell him her happiness and his
she had got ready to see him alone  and had been delighted at the idea  and had been shy and ashamed  and did not know herself what she was doing
she had heard his steps and voice  and had waited at the door for mademoiselle linon to go
mademoiselle linon had gone away
without thinking  without asking herself how and what  she had gone up to him  and did as she was doing
 let us go to mamma   she said  taking him by the hand
for a long while he could say nothing  not so much because he was afraid of desecrating the loftiness of his anna karenina 884 of 1759 emotion by a word  as that every time he tried to say something  instead of words he felt that tears of happiness were welling up
he took her hand and kissed it
 can it be true   he said at last in a choked voice
 i can t believe you love me  dear   she smiled at that  dear   and at the timidity with which he glanced at her
 yes   she said significantly  deliberately
 i am so happy   not letting go his hands  she went into the drawing room
the princess  seeing them  breathed quickly  and immediately began to cry and then immediately began to laugh and with a vigorous step levin had not expected  ran up to him  and hugging his head  kissed him  wetting his cheeks with her tears
 so it is all settled  i am glad
love her
i am glad   
kitty    you ve not been long settling things   said the old prince  trying to seem unmoved  but levin noticed that his eyes were wet when he turned to him
 i ve long  always wished for this   said the prince  taking levin by the arm and drawing him towards himself  even when this little feather head fancied    anna karenina 885 of 1759  papa   shrieked kitty  and shut his mouth with her hands
 well  i won t   he said
 i m very  very    plea    oh  what a fool i am    he embraced kitty  kissed her face  her hand  her face again and made the sign of the cross over her
and there came over levin a new feeling of love for this man  till then so little known to him  when he saw how slowly and tenderly kitty kissed his muscular hand
anna karenina 886 of 1759 the princess sat in her armchair  silent and smiling  the prince sat down beside her
kitty stood by her father s chair  still holding his hand
all were silent
the princess was the first to put everything into words  and to translate all thoughts and feelings into practical questions
and all equally felt this strange and painful for the first minute
 when is it to be  we must have the benediction and announcement
and when s the wedding to be  what do you think  alexander    here he is   said the old prince  pointing to levin   he s the principal person in the matter    when   said levin blushing
 tomorrow  if you ask me  i should say  the benediction today and the wedding tomorrow    come  mon cher  that s nonsense    well  in a week    he s quite mad    no  why so    well  upon my word   said the mother  smiling  delighted at this haste
 how about the trousseau   anna karenina 887 of 1759  will there really be a trousseau and all that   levin thought with horror
 but can the trousseau and the benediction and all that can it spoil my happiness  nothing can spoil it   he glanced at kitty  and noticed that she was not in the least  not in the very least  disturbed by the idea of the trousseau
 then it must be all right   he thought
 oh  i know nothing about it  i only said what i should like   he said apologetically
 we ll talk it over  then
the benediction and announcement can take place now
that s very well   the princess went up to her husband  kissed him  and would have gone away  but he kept her  embraced her  and tenderly as a young lover  kissed her several times  smiling
the old people were obviously muddled for a moment  and did not quite know whether it was they who were in love again or their daughter
when the prince and the princess had gone  levin went up to his betrothed and took her hand
he was self possessed now and could speak  and he had a great deal he wanted to tell her
but he said not at all what he had to say
 how i knew it would be so  i never hoped for it  and yet in my heart i was always sure   he said
 i believe that it was ordained   anna karenina 888 of 1759  and i   she said
 even when      she stopped and went on again  looking at him resolutely with her truthful eyes   even when i thrust from me my happiness
i always loved you alone  but i was carried away
i ought to tell you   
can you forgive that    perhaps it was for the best
you will have to forgive me so much
i ought to tell you    this was one of the things he had meant to speak about
he had resolved from the first to tell her two things that he was not chaste as she was  and that he was not a believer
it was agonizing  but he considered he ought to tell her both these facts
 no  not now  later   he said
 very well  later  but you must certainly tell me
i m not afraid of anything
i want to know everything
now it is settled   he added   settled that you ll take me whatever i may be you won t give me up  yes    yes  yes   their conversation was interrupted by mademoiselle linon  who with an affected but tender smile came to congratulate her favorite pupil
before she had gone  the servants came in with their congratulations
then relations arrived  and there began that state of blissful absurdity anna karenina 889 of 1759 from which levin did not emerge till the day after his wedding
levin was in a continual state of awkwardness and discomfort  but the intensity of his happiness went on all the while increasing
he felt continually that a great deal was being expected of him what  he did not know  and he did everything he was told  and it all gave him happiness
he had thought his engagement would have nothing about it like others  that the ordinary conditions of engaged couples would spoil his special happiness  but it ended in his doing exactly as other people did  and his happiness being only increased thereby and becoming more and more special  more and more unlike anything that had ever happened
 now we shall have sweetmeats to eat   said mademoiselle linon  and levin drove off to buy sweetmeats
 well  i m very glad   said sviazhsky
 i advise you to get the bouquets from fomin s    oh  are they wanted   and he drove to fomin s
his brother offered to lend him money  as he would have so many expenses  presents to give   
 oh  are presents wanted   and he galloped to foulde s
anna karenina 890 of 1759 and at the confectioner s  and at fomin s  and at foulde s he saw that he was expected  that they were pleased to see him  and prided themselves on his happiness  just as every one whom he had to do with during those days what was extraordinary was that everyone not only liked him  but even people previously unsympathetic  cold  and callous  were enthusiastic over him  gave way to him in everything  treated his feeling with tenderness and delicacy  and shared his conviction that he was the happiest man in the world because his betrothed was beyond perfection
kitty too felt the same thing
when countess nordston ventured to hint that she had hoped for something better  kitty was so angry and proved so conclusively that nothing in the world could be better than levin  that countess nordston had to admit it  and in kitty s presence never met levin without a smile of ecstatic admiration
the confession he had promised was the one painful incident of this time
he consulted the old prince  and with his sanction gave kitty his diary  in which there was written the confession that tortured him
he had written this diary at the time with a view to his future wife
two things caused him anguish  his lack of purity and his lack of faith
his confession of unbelief passed unnoticed
she anna karenina 891 of 1759 was religious  had never doubted the truths of religion  but his external unbelief did not affect her in the least
through love she knew all his soul  and in his soul she saw what she wanted  and that such a state of soul should be called unbelieving was to her a matter of no account
the other confession set her weeping bitterly
levin  not without an inner struggle  handed her his diary
he knew that between him and her there could not be  and should not be  secrets  and so he had decided that so it must be
but he had not realized what an effect it would have on her  he had not put himself in her place it was only when the same evening he came to their house before the theater  went into her room and saw her tearstained  pitiful  sweet face  miserable with suffering he had caused and nothing could undo  he felt the abyss that separated his shameful past from her dovelike purity  and was appalled at what he had done
 take them  take these dreadful books   she said  pushing away the notebooks lying before her on the table
 why did you give them me  no  it was better anyway   she added  touched by his despairing face
 but it s awful  awful   his head sank  and he was silent
he could say nothing
 you can t forgive me   he whispered
anna karenina 892 of 1759  yes  i forgive you  but it s terrible   but his happiness was so immense that this confession did not shatter it  it only added another shade to it
she forgave him  but from that time more than ever he considered himself unworthy of her  morally bowed down lower than ever before her  and prized more highly than ever his undeserved happiness anna karenina 893 of 1759 unconsciously going over in his memory the conversations that had taken place during and after dinner  alexey alexandrovitch returned to his solitary room
darya alexandrovna s words about forgiveness had aroused in him nothing but annoyance
the applicability or non applicability of the christian precept to his own case was too difficult a question to be discussed lightly  and this question had long ago been answered by alexey alexandrovitch in the negative
of all that had been said  what stuck most in his memory was the phrase of stupid  good natured turovtsin  acted like a man  he did  called him out and shot him   everyone had apparently shared this feeling  though from politeness they had not expressed it
 but the matter is settled  it s useless thinking about it   alexey alexandrovitch told himself and thinking of nothing but the journey before him  and the revision work he had to do  he went into his room and asked the porter who escorted him where his man was
the porter said that the man had only just gone out
alexey alexandrovitch ordered tea to be sent him  sat down to anna karenina 894 of 1759 the table  and taking the guidebook  began considering the route of his journey
 two telegrams   said his manservant  coming into the room  i beg your pardon  your excellency  i d only just that minute gone out   alexey alexandrovitch took the telegrams and opened them the first telegram was the announcement of stremov s appointment to the very post karenin had coveted
alexey alexandrovitch flung the telegram down  and flushing a little  got up and began to pace up and down the room
 quos vult perdere dementat   he said  meaning by quos the persons responsible for this appointment
he was not so much annoyed that he had not received the post  that he had been conspicuously passed over  but it was incomprehensible  amazing to him that they did not see that the wordy phrase monger stremov was the last man fit for it
how could they fail to see how they were ruining themselves  lowering their prestige by this appointment   something else in the same line   he said to himself bitterly  opening the second telegram the telegram was from his wife
her name  written in blue pencil   anna   was the first thing that caught his eye
 i am dying  i beg  i implore you to come
i shall die easier with your anna karenina 895 of 1759 forgiveness   he read
he smiled contemptuously  and flung down the telegram
that this was a trick and a fraud  of that  he thought for the first minute  there could be no doubt
 there is no deceit she would stick at
she was near her confinement
perhaps it is the confinement
but what can be their aim  to legitimize the child  to compromise me  and prevent a divorce   he thought
 but something was said in it  i am dying      he read the telegram again  and suddenly the plain meaning of what was said in it struck him
 and if it is true   he said to himself  if it is true that in the moment of agony and nearness to death she is genuinely penitent  and i  taking it for a trick  refuse to go  that would not only be cruel  and everyone would blame me  but it would be stupid on my part    piotr  call a coach  i am going to petersburg   he said to his servant
alexey alexandrovitch decided that he would go to petersburg and see his wife
if her illness was a trick  he would say nothing and go away again
if she was really in danger  and wished to see him before her death  he would forgive her if he found her alive  and pay her the last duties if he came too late
anna karenina 896 of 1759 all the way he thought no more of what he ought to do
with a sense of weariness and uncleanness from the night spent in the train  in the early fog of petersburg alexey alexandrovitch drove through the deserted nevsky and stared straight before him  not thinking of what was awaiting him
he could not think about it  because in picturing what would happen  he could not drive away the reflection that her death would at once remove all the difficulty of his position
bakers  closed shops  night cabmen  porters sweeping the pavements flashed past his eyes  and he watched it all  trying to smother the thought of what was awaiting him  and what he dared not hope for  and yet was hoping for
he drove up to the steps
a sledge and a carriage with the coachman asleep stood at the entrance
as he went into the entry  alexey alexandrovitch  as it were  got out his resolution from the remotest corner of his brain  and mastered it thoroughly
its meaning ran   if it s a trick  then calm contempt and departure
if truth  do what is proper   the porter opened the door before alexey alexandrovitch rang
the porter  kapitonitch  looked queer in an old coat  without a tie  and in slippers
 how is your mistress   anna karenina 897 of 1759  a successful confinement yesterday   alexey alexandrovitch stopped short and turned white
he felt distinctly now how intensely he had longed for her death
 and how is she   korney in his morning apron ran downstairs
 very ill   he answered
 there was a consultation yesterday  and the doctor s here now    take my things   said alexey alexandrovitch  and feeling some relief at the news that there was still hope of her death  he went into the hall on the hatstand there was a military overcoat
alexey alexandrovitch noticed it and asked   who is here    the doctor  the midwife and count vronsky   alexey alexandrovitch went into the inner rooms i the drawing room there was no one  at the sound of his steps there came out of her boudoir the midwife in a cap with lilac ribbons
she went up to alexey alexandrovitch  and with the familiarity given by the approach of death took him by the arm and drew him towards the bedroom
 thank god you ve come  she keeps on about you and nothing but you   she said
anna karenina 898 of 1759  make haste with the ice   the doctor s peremptory voice said from the bedroom
alexey alexandrovitch went into her boudoir
at the table  sitting sideways in a low chair  was vronsky  his face hidden in his hands  weeping
he jumped up at the doctor s voice  took his hands from his face  and saw alexey alexandrovitch
seeing the husband  he was so overwhelmed that he sat down again  drawing his head down to his shoulders  as if he wanted to disappear  but he made an effort over himself  got up and said   she is dying the doctors say there is no hope
i am entirely in your power  only let me be here   though i am at your disposal
i    alexey alexandrovitch  seeing vronsky s tears  felt a rush of that nervous emotion always produced in him by the sight of other people s suffering  and turning away his face  he moved hurriedly to the door  without hearing the rest of his words
from the bedroom came the sound of anna s voice saying something
her voice was lively  eager  with exceedingly distinct intonations
alexey alexandrovitch went into the bedroom  and went up to the bed
she was lying turned with her face towards him
her cheeks were flushed crimson  her eyes glittered  her anna karenina 899 of 1759 little white hands thrust out from the sleeves of her dressing gown were playing with the quilt  twisting it about it seemed as though she were not only well and blooming  but in the happiest frame of mind
she was talking rapidly  musically  and with exceptionally correct articulation and expressive intonation
 for alexey i am speaking of alexey alexandrovitch (what a strange and awful thing that both are alexey  isn t it ) alexey would not refuse me
i should forget  he would forgive   
but why doesn t he come  he s so good he doesn t know himself how good he is ah  my god  what agony  give me some water  quick  oh  that will be bad for her  my little girl  oh  very well then  give her to a nurse
yes  i agree  it s better in fact
he ll be coming  it will hurt him to see her
give her to the nurse    anna arkadyevna  he has come
here he is   said the midwife  trying to attract her attention to alexey alexandrovitch
 oh  what nonsense   anna went on  not seeing her husband
 no  give her to me  give me my little one  he has not come yet
you say he won t forgive me  because you don t know him
no one knows him
i m the only one  and it was hard for me even
his eyes i ought to know seryozha has just the same eyes and i can t bear anna karenina 900 of 1759 to see them because of it
has seryozha had his dinner  i know everyone will forget him
he would not forget
seryozha must be moved into the corner room  and mariette must be asked to sleep with him   all of a sudden she shrank back  was silent  and in terror  as though expecting a blow  as though to defend herself  she raised her hands to her face
she had seen her husband
 no  no   she began
 i am not afraid of him  i am afraid of death
alexey  come here
i am in a hurry  because i ve no time  i ve not long left to live  the fever will begin directly and i shall understand nothing more
now i understand  i understand it all  i see it all   alexey alexandrovitch s wrinkled face wore an expression of agony  he took her by the hand and tried to say something  but he could not utter it  his lower lip quivered  but he still went on struggling with his emotion  and only now and then glanced at her
and each time he glanced at her  he saw her eyes gazing at him with such passionate and triumphant tenderness as he had never seen in them
 wait a minute  you don t know   stay a little  stay      she stopped  as though collecting her ideas
 yes   she began   yes  yes  yes
this is what i wanted to say
don t anna karenina 901 of 1759 be surprised at me
i m still the same   
but there is another woman in me  i m afraid of her  she loved that man  and i tried to hate you  and could not forget about her that used to be
i m not that woman
now i m my real self  all myself
i m dying now  i know i shall die  ask him
even now i feel see here  the weights on my feet  on my hands  on my fingers
my fingers see how huge they are  but this will soon all be over   
only one thing i want  forgive me  forgive me quite
i m terrible  but my nurse used to tell me  the holy martyr what was her name  she was worse
and i ll go to rome  there s a wilderness  and there i shall be no trouble to any one  only i ll take seryozha and the little one   
no  you can t forgive me  i know  it can t be forgiven  no  no  go away  you re too good   she held his hand in one burning hand  while she pushed him away with the other
the nervous agitation of alexey alexandrovitch kept increasing  and had by now reached such a point that he ceased to struggle with it
he suddenly felt that what he had regarded as nervous agitation was on the contrary a blissful spiritual condition that gave him all at once a new happiness he had never known
he did not think that the christian law that he had been all his life trying to follow  enjoined on him to forgive and love his enemies  but a anna karenina 902 of 1759 glad feeling of love and forgiveness for his enemies filled his heart
he knelt down  and laying his head in the curve of her arm  which burned him as with fire through the sleeve  he sobbed like a little child
she put her arm around his head  moved towards him  and with defiant pride lifted up her eyes
 that is he
i knew him  now  forgive me  everyone  forgive me   
they ve come again  why don t they go away   
oh  take these cloaks off me   the doctor unloosed her hands  carefully laying her on the pillow  and covered her up to the shoulders
she lay back submissively  and looked before her with beaming eyes
 remember one thing  that i needed nothing but forgiveness  and i want nothing more   
why doesn t he come   she said  turning to the door towards vronsky
 do come  do come  give him your hand   vronsky came to the side of the bed  and seeing anna  again hid his face in his hands
 uncover your face look at him  he s a saint   she said
 oh  uncover your face  do uncover it   she said angrily
 alexey alexandrovitch  do uncover his face  i want to see him   anna karenina 903 of 1759 alexey alexandrovitch took vronsky s hands and drew them away from his face  which was awful with the expression of agony and shame upon it
 give him your hand
forgive him   alexey alexandrovitch gave him his hand  not attempting to restrain the tears that streamed from his eyes
 thank god  thank god   she said   now everything is ready
only to stretch my legs a little there  that s capital
how badly these flowers are done not a bit like a violet   she said  pointing to the hangings
 my god  my god  when will it end  give me some morphine
doctor  give me some morphine  oh  my god  my god   and she tossed about on the bed
the doctors said that it was puerperal fever  and that it was ninety nine chances in a hundred it would end in death
the whole day long there was fever  delirium  and unconsciousness
at midnight the patient lay without consciousness  and almost without pulse
the end was expected every minute
vronsky had gone home  but in the morning he came to inquire  and alexey alexandrovitch meeting him in the hall  said   better stay  she might ask for you   and himself led him to his wife s boudoir towards morning  there was a return again of excitement  rapid thought and talk  anna karenina 904 of 1759 and again it ended in unconsciousness
on the third day it was the same thing  and the doctors said there was hope
that day alexey alexandrovitch went into the boudoir where vronsky was sitting  and closing the door sat down opposite him
 alexey alexandrovitch   said vronsky  feeling that a statement of the position was coming   i can t speak  i can t understand
spare me  however hard it is for you  believe me  it is more terrible for me   he would have risen  but alexey alexandrovitch took him by the hand and said   i beg you to hear me out  it is necessary
i must explain my feelings  the feelings that have guided me and will guide me  so that you may not be in error regarding me
you know i had resolved on a divorce  and had even begun to take proceedings
i won t conceal from you that in beginning this i was in uncertainty  i was in misery  i will confess that i was pursued by a desire to revenge myself on you and on her
when i got the telegram  i came here with the same feelings  i will say more  i longed for her death
but      he paused  pondering whether to disclose or not to disclose his feeling to him
 but i saw her and forgave her
and the happiness of forgiveness has revealed to me my duty
i forgive completely
i would anna karenina 905 of 1759 offer the other cheek  i would give my cloak if my coat be taken
i pray to god only not to take from me the bliss of forgiveness   tears stood in his eyes  and the luminous  serene look in them impressed vronsky
 this is my position  you can trample me in the mud  make me the laughing stock of the world  i will not abandon her  and i will never utter a word of reproach to you   alexey alexandrovitch went on
 my duty is clearly marked for me  i ought to be with her  and i will be
if she wishes to see you  i will let you know  but now i suppose it would be better for you to go away   he got up  and sobs cut short his words
vronsky too was getting up  and in a stooping  not yet erect posture  looked up at him from under his brows
he did not understand alexey alexandrovitch s feeling  but he felt that it was something higher and even unattainable for him with his view of life
anna karenina 906 of 1759 after the conversation with alexey alexandrovitch  vronsky went out onto the steps of the karenins  house and stood still  with difficulty remembering where he was  and where he ought to walk or drive
he felt disgraced  humiliated  guilty  and deprived of all possibility of washing away his humiliation
he felt thrust out of the beaten track along which he had so proudly and lightly walked till then
all the habits and rules of his life that had seemed so firm  had turned out suddenly false and inapplicable
the betrayed husband  who had figured till that time as a pitiful creature  an incidental and somewhat ludicrous obstacle to his happiness  had suddenly been summoned by her herself  elevated to an awe inspiring pinnacle  and on the pinnacle that husband had shown himself  not malignant  not false  not ludicrous  but kind and straightforward and large vronsky could not but feel this  and the parts were suddenly reversed
vronsky felt his elevation and his own abasement  his truth and his own falsehood
he felt that the husband was magnanimous even in his sorrow  while he had been base and petty in his deceit
but this sense of his own humiliation before the anna karenina 907 of 1759 man he had unjustly despised made up only a small part of his misery
he felt unutterably wretched now  for his passion for anna  which had seemed to him of late to be growing cooler  now that he knew he had lost her forever  was stronger than ever it had been he had seen all of her in her illness  had come to know her very soul  and it seemed to him that he had never loved her till then
and now when he had learned to know her  to love her as she should be loved  he had been humiliated before her  and had lost her forever  leaving with her nothing of himself but a shameful memory most terrible of all had been his ludicrous  shameful position when alexey alexandrovitch had pulled his hands away from his humiliated face
he stood on the steps of the karenins  house like one distraught  and did not know what to do
 a sledge  sir   asked the porter
 yes  a sledge   on getting home  after three sleepless nights  vronsky  without undressing  lay down fiat on the sofa  clasping his hands and laying his head on them
his head was heavy
images  memories  and ideas of the strangest description followed one another with extraordinary rapidity and vividness
first it was the medicine he had poured out for the patient and spilt over the spoon  then the midwife s anna karenina 908 of 1759 white hands  then the queer posture of alexey alexandrovitch on the floor beside the bed
 to sleep  to forget   he said to himself with the serene confidence of a healthy man that if he is tired and sleepy  he will go to sleep at once and the same instant his head did begin to feel drowsy and he began to drop off into forgetfulness
the waves of the sea of unconsciousness had begun to meet over his head  when all at once it was as though a violent shock of electricity had passed over him
he started so that he leaped up on the springs of the sofa  and leaning on his arms got in a panic onto his knees his eyes were wide open as though he had never been asleep
the heaviness in his head and the weariness in his limbs that he had felt a minute before had suddenly gone
 you may trample me in the mud   he heard alexey alexandrovitch s words and saw him standing before him  and saw anna s face with its burning flush and glittering eyes  gazing with love and tenderness not at him but at alexey alexandrovitch  he saw his own  as he fancied  foolish and ludicrous figure when alexey alexandrovitch took his hands away from his face
he stretched out his legs again and flung himself on the sofa in the same position and shut his eyes anna karenina 909 of 1759  to sleep  to forget   he repeated to himself but with his eyes shut he saw more distinctly than ever anna s face as it had been on the memorable evening before the races  that is not and will not be  and she wants to wipe it out of her memory
but i cannot live without it
how can we be reconciled  how can we be reconciled   he said aloud  and unconsciously began to repeat these words
this repetition checked the rising up of fresh images and memories  which he felt were thronging in his brain
but repeating words did not check his imagination for long
again in extraordinarily rapid succession his best moments rose before his mind  and then his recent humiliation
 take away his hands   anna s voice says
he takes away his hands and feels the shamestruck and idiotic expression of his face
he still lay down  trying to sleep  though he felt there was not the smallest hope of it  and kept repeating stray words from some chain of thought  trying by this to check the rising flood of fresh images
he listened  and heard in a strange  mad whisper words repeated   i did not appreciate it  did not make enough of it
i did not appreciate it  did not make enough of it    what s this  am i going out of my mind   he said to himself  perhaps
what makes men go out of their minds  anna karenina 910 of 1759 what makes men shoot themselves   he answered himself  and opening his eyes  he saw with wonder an embroidered cushion beside him  worked by varya  his brother s wife he touched the tassel of the cushion  and tried to think of varya  of when he had seen her last
but to think of anything extraneous was an agonizing effort
 no  i must sleep   he moved the cushion up  and pressed his head into it  but he had to make an effort to keep his eyes shut
he jumped up and sat down
 that s all over for me   he said to himself  i must think what to do
what is left   his mind rapidly ran through his life apart from his love of anna
 ambition  serpuhovskoy  society  the court   he could not come to a pause anywhere
all of it had had meaning before  but now there was no reality in it
he got up from the sofa  took off his coat  undid his belt  and uncovering his hairy chest to breathe more freely  walked up and down the room
 this is how people go mad   he repeated   and how they shoot themselves   to escape humiliation   he added slowly he went to the door and closed it  then with fixed eyes and clenched teeth he went up to the table  took a revolver  looked round him  turned it to a loaded barrel  and sank into thought
for two minutes  his head bent anna karenina 911 of 1759 forward with an expression of an intense effort of thought  he stood with the revolver in his hand  motionless  thinking
 of course   he said to himself  as though a logical  continuous  and clear chain of reasoning had brought him to an indubitable conclusion in reality this  of course   that seemed convincing to him  was simply the result of exactly the same circle of memories and images through which he had passed ten times already during the last hour memories of happiness lost forever
there was the same conception of the senselessness of everything to come in life  the same consciousness of humiliation
even the sequence of these images and emotions was the same
 of course   he repeated  when for the third time his thought passed again round the same spellbound circle of memories and images  and pulling the revolver to the left side of his chest  and clutching it vigorously with his whole hand  as it were  squeezing it in his fist  he pulled the trigger
he did not hear the sound of the shot  but a violent blow on his chest sent him reeling
he tried to clutch at the edge of the table  dropped the revolver  staggered  and sat down on the ground  looking about him in astonishment
he did not recognize his room  looking up from the ground  at the bent legs of the table  at the anna karenina 912 of 1759 wastepaper basket  and the tiger skin rug
the hurried  creaking steps of his servant coming through the drawing room brought him to his senses
he made an effort at thought  and was aware that he was on the floor  and seeing blood on the tiger skin rug and on his arm  he knew he had shot himself  idiotic  missed   he said  fumbling after the revolver
the revolver was close beside him he sought further off
still feeling for it  he stretched out to the other side  and not being strong enough to keep his balance  fell over  streaming with blood the elegant  whiskered manservant  who used to be continually complaining to his acquaintances of the delicacy of his nerves  was so panic stricken on seeing his master lying on the floor  that he left him losing blood while he ran for assistance
an hour later varya  his brother s wife  had arrived  and with the assistance of three doctors  whom she had sent for in all directions  and who all appeared at the same moment  she got the wounded man to bed  and remained to nurse him
anna karenina 913 of 1759 the mistake made by alexey alexandrovitch in that  when preparing for seeing his wife  he had overlooked the possibility that her repentance might be sincere  and he might forgive her  and she might not die this mistake was two months after his return from moscow brought home to him in all its significance
but the mistake made by him had arisen not simply from his having overlooked that contingency  but also from the fact that until that day of his interview with his dying wife  he had not known his own heart
at his sick wife s bedside he had for the first time in his life given way to that feeling of sympathetic suffering always roused in him by the sufferings of others  and hitherto looked on by him with shame as a harmful weakness
and pity for her  and remorse for having desired her death  and most of all  the joy of forgiveness  made him at once conscious  not simply of the relief of his own sufferings  but of a spiritual peace he had never experienced before
he suddenly felt that the very thing that was the source of his sufferings had become the source of his spiritual joy  that what had seemed insoluble anna karenina 914 of 1759 while he was judging  blaming  and hating  had become clear and simple when he forgave and loved
he forgave his wife and pitied her for her sufferings and her remorse
he forgave vronsky  and pitied him  especially after reports reached him of his despairing action
he felt more for his son than before
and he blamed himself now for having taken too little interest in him but for the little newborn baby he felt a quite peculiar sentiment  not of pity  only  but of tenderness
at first  from a feeling of compassion alone  he had been interested in the delicate little creature  who was not his child  and who was cast on one side during her mother s illness  and would certainly have died if he had not troubled about her  and he did not himself observe how fond he became of her he would go into the nursery several times a day  and sit there for a long while  so that the nurses  who were at first afraid of him  got quite used to his presence
sometimes for half an hour at a stretch he would sit silently gazing at the saffron red  downy  wrinkled face of the sleeping baby  watching the movements of the frowning brows  and the fat little hands  with clenched fingers  that rubbed the little eyes and nose at such moments particularly  alexey alexandrovitch had a sense of perfect peace and inward harmony  and saw anna karenina 915 of 1759 nothing extraordinary in his position  nothing that ought to be changed
but as time went on  he saw more and more distinctly that however natural the position now seemed to him  he would not long be allowed to remain in it
he felt that besides the blessed spiritual force controlling his soul  there was another  a brutal force  as powerful  or more powerful  which controlled his life  and that this force would not allow him that humble peace he longed for
he felt that everyone was looking at him with inquiring wonder  that he was not understood  and that something was expected of him
above all  he felt the instability and unnaturalness of his relations with his wife
when the softening effect of the near approach of death had passed away  alexey alexandrovitch began to notice that anna was afraid of him  ill at ease with him  and could not look him straight in the face
she seemed to be wanting  and not daring  to tell him something  and as though foreseeing their present relations could not continue  she seemed to be expecting something from him
towards the end of february it happened that anna s baby daughter  who had been named anna too  fell ill
alexey alexandrovitch was in the nursery in the morning  anna karenina 916 of 1759 and leaving orders for the doctor to be sent for  he went to his office
on finishing his work  he returned home at four
going into the hall he saw a handsome groom  in a braided livery and a bear fur cape  holding a white fur cloak
 who is here   asked alexey alexandrovitch
 princess elizaveta federovna tverskaya   the groom answered  and it seemed to alexey alexandrovitch that he grinned
during all this difficult time alexey alexandrovitch had noticed that his worldly acquaintances  especially women  took a peculiar interest in him and his wife
all these acquaintances he observed with difficulty concealing their mirth at something  the same mirth that he had perceived in the lawyer s eyes  and just now in the eyes of this groom
everyone seemed  somehow  hugely delighted  as though they had just been at a wedding
when they met him  with ill disguised enjoyment they inquired after his wife s health
the presence of princess tverskaya was unpleasant to alexey alexandrovitch from the memories associated with her  and also because he disliked her  and he went straight to the nursery
in the day nursery seryozha  leaning on the table with his legs on a chair  was drawing and chatting away merrily
the english anna karenina 917 of 1759 governess  who had during anna s illness replaced the french one  was sitting near the boy knitting a shawl
she hurriedly got up  curtseyed  and pulled seryozha
alexey alexandrovitch stroked his son s hair  answered the governess s inquiries about his wife  and asked what the doctor had said of the baby
 the doctor said it was nothing serious  and he ordered a bath  sir    but she is still in pain   said alexey alexandrovitch  listening to the baby s screaming in the next room
 i think it s the wet nurse  sir   the englishwoman said firmly
 what makes you think so   he asked  stopping short
 it s just as it was at countess paul s  sir
they gave the baby medicine  and it turned out that the baby was simply hungry  the nurse had no milk  sir   alexey alexandrovitch pondered  and after standing still a few seconds he went in at the other door
the baby was lying with its head thrown back  stiffening itself in the nurse s arms  and would not take the plump breast offered it  and it never ceased screaming in spite of the double hushing of the wet nurse and the other nurse  who was bending over her  still no better   said alexey alexandrovitch
anna karenina 918 of 1759  she s very restless   answered the nurse in a whisper
 miss edwarde says that perhaps the wet nurse has no milk   he said
 i think so too  alexey alexandrovitch    then why didn t you say so    who s one to say it to  anna arkadyevna still ill     said the nurse discontentedly
the nurse was an old servant of the family
and in her simple words there seemed to alexey alexandrovitch an allusion to his position
the baby screamed louder than ever  struggling and sobbing
the nurse  with a gesture of despair  went to it  took it from the wet nurse s arms  and began walking up and down  rocking it  you must ask the doctor to examine the wet nurse   said alexey alexandrovitch
the smartly dressed and healthy looking nurse  frightened at the idea of losing her place  muttered something to herself  and covering her bosom  smiled contemptuously at the idea of doubts being cast on her abundance of milk
in that smile  too  alexey alexandrovitch saw a sneer at his position
 luckless child   said the nurse  hushing the baby  and still walking up and down with it
anna karenina 919 of 1759 alexey alexandrovitch sat down  and with a despondent and suffering face watched the nurse walking to and fro
when the child at last was still  and had been put in a deep bed  and the nurse  after smoothing the little pillow  had left her  alexey alexandrovitch got up  and walking awkwardly on tiptoe  approached the baby
for a minute he was still  and with the same despondent face gazed at the baby  but all at once a smile  that moved his hair and the skin of his forehead  came out on his face  and he went as softly out of the room
in the dining room he rang the bell  and told the servant who came in to send again for the doctor
he felt vexed with his wife for not being anxious about this exquisite baby  and in this vexed humor he had no wish to go to her  he had no wish  either  to see princess betsy
but his wife might wonder why he did not go to her as usual  and so  overcoming his disinclination  he went towards the bedroom
as he walked over the soft rug towards the door  he could not help overhearing a conversation he did not want to hear
 if he hadn t been going away  i could have understood your answer and his too
but your husband ought to be above that   betsy was saying
anna karenina 920 of 1759  it s not for my husband  for myself i don t wish it
don t say that   answered anna s excited voice
 yes  but you must care to say good bye to a man who has shot himself on your account      that&#x2019 s just why i don t want to   with a dismayed and guilty expression  alexey alexandrovitch stopped and would have gone back unobserved but reflecting that this would be undignified  he turned back again  and clearing his throat  he went up to the bedroom
the voices were silent  and he went in
anna  in a gray dressing gown  with a crop of short clustering black curls on her round head  was sitting on a settee
the eagerness died out of her face  as it always did  at the sight of her husband  she dropped her head and looked round uneasily at betsy
betsy  dressed in the height of the latest fashion  in a hat that towered somewhere over her head like a shade on a lamp  in a blue dress with violet crossway stripes slanting one way on the bodice and the other way on the skirt  was sitting beside anna  her tall flat figure held erect
bowing her head  she greeted alexey alexandrovitch with an ironical smile
 ah   she said  as though surprised
 i m very glad you re at home
you never put in an appearance anywhere  and i haven t seen you ever since anna has anna karenina 921 of 1759 been ill
i have heard all about it your anxiety
yes  you re a wonderful husband   she said  with a meaning and affable air  as though she were bestowing an order of magnanimity on him for his conduct to his wife
alexey alexandrovitch bowed frigidly  and kissing his wife s hand  asked how she was
 better  i think   she said  avoiding his eyes
 but you ve rather a feverish looking color   he said  laying stress on the word  feverish    we ve been talking too much   said betsy
 i feel it s selfishness on my part  and i am going away   she got up  but anna  suddenly flushing  quickly caught at her hand
 no  wait a minute  please
i must tell you   no  you   she turned to alexey alexandrovitch  and her neck and brow were suffused with crimson  i won t and can t keep anything secret from you   she said
alexey alexandrovitch cracked his fingers and bowed his head
 betsy s been telling me that count vronsky wants to come here to say good bye before his departure for tashkend   she did not look at her husband  and was evidently in haste to have everything out  however hard it might be for her
 i told her i could not receive him   anna karenina 922 of 1759  you said  my dear  that it would depend on alexey alexandrovitch   betsy corrected her
 oh  no  i can t receive him  and what object would there      she stopped suddenly  and glanced inquiringly at her husband (he did not look at her)
 in short  i don t wish it     alexey alexandrovitch advanced and would have taken her hand
her first impulse was to jerk back her hand from the damp hand with big swollen veins that sought hers  but with an obvious effort to control herself she pressed his hand
 i am very grateful to you for your confidence  but     he said  feeling with confusion and annoyance that what he could decide easily and clearly by himself  he could not discuss before princess tverskaya  who to him stood for the incarnation of that brute force which would inevitably control him in the life he led in the eyes of the world  and hinder him from giving way to his feeling of love and forgiveness he stopped short  looking at princess tverskaya
 well  good bye  my darling   said betsy  getting up
she kissed anna  and went out

 i am an outsider  but i so love her and respect you that i venture to advise
receive him
alexey vronsky is the soul of honor  and he is going away to tashkend    thank you  princess  for your sympathy and advice

and he saw this by the suppressed  malicious  and ironical smile with which betsy glanced at him after this phrase
