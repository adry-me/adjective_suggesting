"well  prince  so genoa and lucca are now just family estates of the buonapartes
but i warn you  if you don't tell me that this means war  if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that antichrist—i really believe he is antichrist—i will have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend  no longer my 'faithful slave ' as you call yourself  but how do you do  i see i have frightened you—sit down and tell me all the news " it was in july  1805  and the speaker was the well known anna pavlovna scherer  maid of honor and favorite of the empress marya fedorovna
with these words she greeted prince vasili kuragin  a man of high rank and importance  who was the first to arrive at her reception
anna pavlovna had had a cough for some days
she was  as she said  suffering from la grippe  grippe being then a new word in st
petersburg  used only by the elite
all her invitations without exception  written in french  and delivered by a scarlet liveried footman that morning  ran as follows  "if you have nothing better to do  count  or prince   and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible  i shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10—annette scherer " "heavens  what a virulent attack " replied the prince  not in the least disconcerted by this reception
he had just entered  wearing an embroidered court uniform  knee breeches  and shoes  and had stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face
he spoke in that refined french in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought  and with the gentle  patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old in society and at court
he went up to anna pavlovna  kissed her hand  presenting to her his bald  scented  and shining head  and complacently seated himself on the sofa "first of all  dear friend  tell me how you are
set your friend's mind at rest " said he without altering his tone  beneath the politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be discerned
"can one be well while suffering morally  can one be calm in times like these if one has any feeling " said anna pavlovna
"you are staying the whole evening  i hope " "and the fete at the english ambassador's  today is wednesday
i must put in an appearance there " said the prince
"my daughter is coming for me to take me there " "i thought today's fete had been canceled
i confess all these festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome " "if they had known that you wished it  the entertainment would have been put off " said the prince  who  like a wound up clock  by force of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed
"don't tease  well  and what has been decided about novosiltsev's dispatch  you know everything " "what can one say about it " replied the prince in a cold  listless tone
"what has been decided  they have decided that buonaparte has burnt his boats  and i believe that we are ready to burn ours " prince vasili always spoke languidly  like an actor repeating a stale part
anna pavlovna scherer on the contrary  despite her forty years  overflowed with animation and impulsiveness
to be an enthusiast had become her social vocation and  sometimes even when she did not feel like it  she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the expectations of those who knew her
the subdued smile which  though it did not suit her faded features  always played round her lips expressed  as in a spoiled child  a continual consciousness of her charming defect  which she neither wished  nor could  nor considered it necessary  to correct
in the midst of a conversation on political matters anna pavlovna burst out  "oh  don't speak to me of austria
perhaps i don't understand things  but austria never has wished  and does not wish  for war
she is betraying us  russia alone must save europe
our gracious sovereign recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it
that is the one thing i have faith in  our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform the noblest role on earth  and he is so virtuous and noble that god will not forsake him
he will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of revolution  which has become more terrible than ever in the person of this murderer and villain  we alone must avenge the blood of the just one   
whom  i ask you  can we rely on   
england with her commercial spirit will not and cannot understand the emperor alexander's loftiness of soul
she has refused to evacuate malta
she wanted to find  and still seeks  some secret motive in our actions
what answer did novosiltsev get  none
the english have not understood and cannot understand the self abnegation of our emperor who wants nothing for himself  but only desires the good of mankind and what have they promised  nothing  and what little they have promised they will not perform  prussia has always declared that buonaparte is invincible  and that all europe is powerless before him   
and i don't believe a word that hardenburg says  or haugwitz either
this famous prussian neutrality is just a trap
i have faith only in god and the lofty destiny of our adored monarch
he will save europe " she suddenly paused  smiling at her own impetuosity
"i think " said the prince with a smile  "that if you had been sent instead of our dear wintzingerode you would have captured the king of prussia's consent by assault
you are so eloquent
will you give me a cup of tea " "in a moment
a propos " she added  becoming calm again  "i am expecting two very interesting men tonight  le vicomte de mortemart  who is connected with the montmorencys through the rohans  one of the best french families
he is one of the genuine emigres  the good ones
and also the abbe morio
do you know that profound thinker  he has been received by the emperor
had you heard " "i shall be delighted to meet them " said the prince
"but tell me " he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred to him  though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of his visit  "is it true that the dowager empress wants baron funke to be appointed first secretary at vienna  the baron by all accounts is a poor creature " prince vasili wished to obtain this post for his son  but others were trying through the dowager empress marya fedorovna to secure it for the baron
anna pavlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor anyone else had a right to criticize what the empress desired or was pleased with
"baron funke has been recommended to the dowager empress by her sister " was all she said  in a dry and mournful tone
as she named the empress  anna pavlovna's face suddenly assumed an expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with sadness  and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious patroness
she added that her majesty had deigned to show baron funke beaucoup d'estime  and again her face clouded over with sadness
the prince was silent and looked indifferent
but  with the womanly and courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her  anna pavlovna wished both to rebuke him  for daring to speak as he had done of a man recommended to the empress  and at the same time to console him  so she said  "now about your family
do you know that since your daughter came out everyone has been enraptured by her  they say she is amazingly beautiful " the prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude
"i often think " she continued after a short pause  drawing nearer to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political and social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate conversation—"i often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life are distributed
why has fate given you two such splendid children  i don't speak of anatole  your youngest
i don't like him " she added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows
"two such charming children
and really you appreciate them less than anyone  and so you don't deserve to have them " and she smiled her ecstatic smile
"i can't help it " said the prince
"lavater would have said i lack the bump of paternity " "don't joke  i mean to have a serious talk with you
do you know i am dissatisfied with your younger son  between ourselves"  and her face assumed its melancholy expression   "he was mentioned at her majesty's and you were pitied    " the prince answered nothing  but she looked at him significantly  awaiting a reply
he frowned
"what would you have me do " he said at last
"you know i did all a father could for their education  and they have both turned out fools
hippolyte is at least a quiet fool  but anatole is an active one
that is the only difference between them " he said this smiling in a way more natural and animated than usual  so that the wrinkles round his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and unpleasant
"and why are children born to such men as you  if you were not a father there would be nothing i could reproach you with " said anna pavlovna  looking up pensively
"i am your faithful slave and to you alone i can confess that my children are the bane of my life
it is the cross i have to bear
that is how i explain it to myself
it can't be helped " he said no more  but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a gesture
anna pavlovna meditated
"have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son anatole " she asked
"they say old maids have a mania for matchmaking  and though i don't feel that weakness in myself as yet  i know a little person who is very unhappy with her father
she is a relation of yours  princess mary bolkonskaya " prince vasili did not reply  though  with the quickness of memory and perception befitting a man of the world  he indicated by a movement of the head that he was considering this information
"do you know " he said at last  evidently unable to check the sad current of his thoughts  "that anatole is costing me forty thousand rubles a year  and " he went on after a pause  "what will it be in five years  if he goes on like this " presently he added  "that's what we fathers have to put up with   
is this princess of yours rich " "her father is very rich and stingy
he lives in the country
he is the wellknown prince bolkonski who had to retire from the army under the late emperor  and was nicknamed 'the king of prussia ' he is very clever but eccentric  and a bore
the poor girl is very unhappy
she has a brother  i think you know him  he married lise meinen lately
he is an aide de camp of kutuzov's and will be here tonight " "listen  dear annette " said the prince  suddenly taking anna pavlovna's hand and for some reason drawing it downwards
"arrange that affair for me and i shall always be your most devoted slave slafe with an f  as a village elder of mine writes in his reports
she is rich and of good family and that's all i want " and with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him  he raised the maid of honor's hand to his lips  kissed it  and swung it to and fro as he lay back in his armchair  looking in another direction
"attendez " said anna pavlovna  reflecting  "i'll speak to lise  young bolkonski's wife  this very evening  and perhaps the thing can be arranged
it shall be on your family's behalf that i'll start my apprenticeship as old maid " anna pavlovna's drawing room was gradually filling
the highest petersburg society was assembled there  people differing widely in age and character but alike in the social circle to which they belonged
prince vasili's daughter  the beautiful helene  came to take her father to the ambassador's entertainment  she wore a ball dress and her badge as maid of honor
the youthful little princess bolkonskaya  known as la femme la plus seduisante de petersbourg  * was also there
she had been married during the previous winter  and being pregnant did not go to any large gatherings  but only to small receptions
prince vasili's son  hippolyte  had come with mortemart  whom he introduced
the abbe morio and many others had also come
* the most fascinating woman in petersburg
to each new arrival anna pavlovna said  "you have not yet seen my aunt " or "you do not know my aunt " and very gravely conducted him or her to a little old lady  wearing large bows of ribbon in her cap  who had come sailing in from another room as soon as the guests began to arrive  and slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her aunt  anna pavlovna mentioned each one's name and then left them
each visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom not one of them knew  not one of them wanted to know  and not one of them cared about  anna pavlovna observed these greetings with mournful and solemn interest and silent approval
the aunt spoke to each of them in the same words  about their health and her own  and the health of her majesty  "who  thank god  was better today " and each visitor  though politeness prevented his showing impatience  left the old woman with a sense of relief at having performed a vexatious duty and did not return to her the whole evening
the young princess bolkonskaya had brought some work in a goldembroidered velvet bag
her pretty little upper lip  on which a delicate dark down was just perceptible  was too short for her teeth  but it lifted all the more sweetly  and was especially charming when she occasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip
as is always the case with a thoroughly attractive woman  her defect—the shortness of her upper lip and her half open mouth—seemed to be her own special and peculiar form of beauty
everyone brightened at the sight of this pretty young woman  so soon to become a mother  so full of life and health  and carrying her burden so lightly
old men and dull dispirited young ones who looked at her  after being in her company and talking to her a little while  felt as if they too were becoming  like her  full of life and health
all who talked to her  and at each word saw her bright smile and the constant gleam of her white teeth  thought that they were in a specially amiable mood that day
the little princess went round the table with quick  short  swaying steps  her workbag on her arm  and gaily spreading out her dress sat down on a sofa near the silver samovar  as if all she was doing was a pleasure to herself and to all around her
"i have brought my work " said she in french  displaying her bag and addressing all present
"mind  annette  i hope you have not played a wicked trick on me " she added  turning to her hostess
"you wrote that it was to be quite a small reception  and just see how badly i am dressed " and she spread out her arms to show her short waisted  lace trimmed  dainty gray dress  girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast "soyez tranquille  lise  you will always be prettier than anyone else " replied anna pavlovna
"you know " said the princess in the same tone of voice and still in french  turning to a general  "my husband is deserting me  he is going to get himself killed tell me what this wretched war is for " she added  addressing prince vasili  and without waiting for an answer she turned to speak to his daughter  the beautiful helene "what a delightful woman this little princess is " said prince vasili to anna pavlovna
one of the next arrivals was a stout  heavily built young man with closecropped hair  spectacles  the light colored breeches fashionable at that time  a very high ruffle  and a brown dress coat
this stout young man was an illegitimate son of count bezukhov  a well known grandee of catherine's time who now lay dying in moscow
the young man had not yet entered either the military or civil service  as he had only just returned from abroad where he had been educated  and this was his first appearance in society
anna pavlovna greeted him with the nod she accorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room
but in spite of this lowest grade greeting  a look of anxiety and fear  as at the sight of something too large and unsuited to the place  came over her face when she saw pierre enter
though he was certainly rather bigger than the other men in the room  her anxiety could only have reference to the clever though shy  but observant and natural  expression which distinguished him from everyone else in that drawing room
"it is very good of you  monsieur pierre  to come and visit a poor invalid " said anna pavlovna  exchanging an alarmed glance with her aunt as she conducted him to her
pierre murmured something unintelligible  and continued to look round as if in search of something
on his way to the aunt he bowed to the little princess with a pleased smile  as to an intimate acquaintance
anna pavlovna's alarm was justified  for pierre turned away from the aunt without waiting to hear her speech about her majesty's health
anna pavlovna in dismay detained him with the words  "do you know the abbe morio  he is a most interesting man " "yes  i have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace  and it is very interesting but hardly feasible " "you think so " rejoined anna pavlovna in order to say something and get away to attend to her duties as hostess
but pierre now committed a reverse act of impoliteness
first he had left a lady before she had finished speaking to him  and now he continued to speak to another who wished to get away
with his head bent  and his big feet spread apart  he began explaining his reasons for thinking the abbe's plan chimerical
"we will talk of it later " said anna pavlovna with a smile
and having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave  she resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch  ready to help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag
as the foreman of a spinning mill  when he has set the hands to work  goes round and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one that creaks or makes more noise than it should  and hastens to check the machine or set it in proper motion  so anna pavlovna moved about her drawing room  approaching now a silent  now a too noisy group  and by a word or slight rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steady  proper  and regular motion
but amid these cares her anxiety about pierre was evident
she kept an anxious watch on him when he approached the group round mortemart to listen to what was being said there  and again when he passed to another group whose center was the abbe
pierre had been educated abroad  and this reception at anna pavlovna's was the first he had attended in russia
he knew that all the intellectual lights of petersburg were gathered there and  like a child in a toyshop  did not know which way to look  afraid of missing any clever conversation that was to be heard
seeing the self confident and refined expression on the faces of those present he was always expecting to hear something very profound
at last he came up to morio
here the conversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for an opportunity to express his own views  as young people are fond of doing
anna pavlovna's reception was in full swing
the spindles hummed steadily and ceaselessly on all sides
with the exception of the aunt  beside whom sat only one elderly lady  who with her thin careworn face was rather out of place in this brilliant society  the whole company had settled into three groups
one  chiefly masculine  had formed round the abbe
another  of young people  was grouped round the beautiful princess helene  prince vasili's daughter  and the little princess bolkonskaya  very pretty and rosy  though rather too plump for her age
the third group was gathered round mortemart and anna pavlovna
the vicomte was a nice looking young man with soft features and polished manners  who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out of politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle in which he found himself anna pavlovna was obviously serving him up as a treat to her guests
as a clever maitre d'hotel serves up as a specially choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen it in the kitchen would have cared to eat  so anna pavlovna served up to her guests  first the vicomte and then the abbe  as peculiarly choice morsels
the group about mortemart immediately began discussing the murder of the duc d'enghien
the vicomte said that the duc d'enghien had perished by his own magnanimity  and that there were particular reasons for buonaparte's hatred of him
"ah  yes  do tell us all about it  vicomte " said anna pavlovna  with a pleasant feeling that there was something a la louis xv in the sound of that sentence  "contez nous cela  vicomte " the vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingness to comply
anna pavlovna arranged a group round him  inviting everyone to listen to his tale
"the vicomte knew the duc personally " whispered anna pavlovna to one of the guests
"the vicomte is a wonderful raconteur " said she to another
"how evidently he belongs to the best society " said she to a third  and the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicest and most advantageous style  like a well garnished joint of roast beef on a hot dish
the vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile
"come over here  helene  dear " said anna pavlovna to the beautiful young princess who was sitting some way off  the center of another group
the princess smiled
she rose with the same unchanging smile with which she had first entered the room—the smile of a perfectly beautiful woman
with a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with moss and ivy  with a gleam of white shoulders  glossy hair  and sparkling diamonds  she passed between the men who made way for her  not looking at any of them but smiling on all  as if graciously allowing each the privilege of admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shoulders  back  and bosom—which in the fashion of those days were very much exposed—and she seemed to bring the glamour of a ballroom with her as she moved toward anna pavlovna
helene was so lovely that not only did she not show any trace of coquetry  but on the contrary she even appeared shy of her unquestionable and all too victorious beauty
she seemed to wish  but to be unable  to diminish its effect
"how lovely " said everyone who saw her  and the vicomte lifted his shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something extraordinary when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also with her unchanging smile
"madame  i doubt my ability before such an audience " said he  smilingly inclining his head
the princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and considered a reply unnecessary
she smilingly waited
all the time the story was being told she sat upright  glancing now at her beautiful round arm  altered in shape by its pressure on the table  now at her still more beautiful bosom  on which she readjusted a diamond necklace
from time to time she smoothed the folds of her dress  and whenever the story produced an effect she glanced at anna pavlovna  at once adopted just the expression she saw on the maid of honor's face  and again relapsed into her radiant smile
the little princess had also left the tea table and followed helene
"wait a moment  i'll get my work   
now then  what are you thinking of " she went on  turning to prince hippolyte
"fetch me my workbag " there was a general movement as the princess  smiling and talking merrily to everyone at once  sat down and gaily arranged herself in her seat "now i am all right " she said  and asking the vicomte to begin  she took up her work
prince hippolyte  having brought the workbag  joined the circle and moving a chair close to hers seated himself beside her le charmant hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinary resemblance to his beautiful sister  but yet more by the fact that in spite of this resemblance he was exceedingly ugly
his features were like his sister's  but while in her case everything was lit up by a joyous  self satisfied  youthful  and constant smile of animation  and by the wonderful classic beauty of her figure  his face on the contrary was dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of sullen selfconfidence  while his body was thin and weak
his eyes  nose  and mouth all seemed puckered into a vacant  wearied grimace  and his arms and legs always fell into unnatural positions "it's not going to be a ghost story " said he  sitting down beside the princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette  as if without this instrument he could not begin to speak
"why no  my dear fellow " said the astonished narrator  shrugging his shoulders
"because i hate ghost stories " said prince hippolyte in a tone which showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after he had uttered them
he spoke with such self confidence that his hearers could not be sure whether what he said was very witty or very stupid
he was dressed in a dark green dress coat  knee breeches of the color of cuisse de nymphe effrayee  as he called it  shoes  and silk stockings
the vicomte told his tale very neatly
it was an anecdote  then current  to the effect that the duc d'enghien had gone secretly to paris to visit mademoiselle george  that at her house he came upon bonaparte  who also enjoyed the famous actress' favors  and that in his presence napoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fits to which he was subject  and was thus at the duc's mercy
the latter spared him  and this magnanimity bonaparte subsequently repaid by death
the story was very pretty and interesting  especially at the point where the rivals suddenly recognized one another  and the ladies looked agitated
"charming " said anna pavlovna with an inquiring glance at the little princess
"charming " whispered the little princess  sticking the needle into her work as if to testify that the interest and fascination of the story prevented her from going on with it
the vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully prepared to continue  but just then anna pavlovna  who had kept a watchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her  noticed that he was talking too loudly and vehemently with the abbe  so she hurried to the rescue
pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbe about the balance of power  and the latter  evidently interested by the young man's simple minded eagerness  was explaining his pet theory
both were talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally  which was why anna pavlovna disapproved
"the means are  
the balance of power in europe and the rights of the people " the abbe was saying
"it is only necessary for one powerful nation like russia —barbaric as she is said to be—to place herself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its object the maintenance of the balance of power of europe  and it would save the world " "but how are you to get that balance " pierre was beginning
at that moment anna pavlovna came up and  looking severely at pierre  asked the italian how he stood russian climate
the italian's face instantly changed and assumed an offensively affected  sugary expression  evidently habitual to him when conversing with women
"i am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of the society  more especially of the feminine society  in which i have had the honor of being received  that i have not yet had time to think of the climate " said he
not letting the abbe and pierre escape  anna pavlovna  the more conveniently to keep them under observation  brought them into the larger circle
just then another visitor entered the drawing room  prince andrew bolkonski  the little princess' husband
he was a very handsome young man  of medium height  with firm  clearcut features
everything about him  from his weary  bored expression to his quiet  measured step  offered a most striking contrast to his quiet  little wife
it was evident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing room  but had found them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look at or listen to them
and among all these faces that he found so tedious  none seemed to bore him so much as that of his pretty wife
he turned away from her with a grimace that distorted his handsome face  kissed anna pavlovna's hand  and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole company
"you are off to the war  prince " said anna pavlovna
"general kutuzov " said bolkonski  speaking french and stressing the last syllable of the general's name like a frenchman  "has been pleased to take me as an aide de camp    " "and lise  your wife " "she will go to the country " "are you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife " "andre " said his wife  addressing her husband in the same coquettish manner in which she spoke to other men  "the vicomte has been telling us such a tale about mademoiselle george and buonaparte " prince andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away
pierre  who from the moment prince andrew entered the room had watched him with glad  affectionate eyes  now came up and took his arm
before he looked round prince andrew frowned again  expressing his annoyance with whoever was touching his arm  but when he saw pierre's beaming face he gave him an unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile
"there now   
so you  too  are in the great world " said he to pierre
"i knew you would be here " replied pierre
"i will come to supper with you
may i " he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the vicomte who was continuing his story
"no  impossible " said prince andrew  laughing and pressing pierre's hand to show that there was no need to ask the question
he wished to say something more  but at that moment prince vasili and his daughter got up to go and the two young men rose to let them pass
"you must excuse me  dear vicomte " said prince vasili to the frenchman  holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent his rising
"this unfortunate fete at the ambassador's deprives me of a pleasure  and obliges me to interrupt you
i am very sorry to leave your enchanting party " said he  turning to anna pavlovna
his daughter  princess helene  passed between the chairs  lightly holding up the folds of her dress  and the smile shone still more radiantly on her beautiful face
pierre gazed at her with rapturous  almost frightened  eyes as she passed him
"very lovely " said prince andrew
"very " said pierre
in passing prince vasili seized pierre's hand and said to anna pavlovna  "educate this bear for me  he has been staying with me a whole month and this is the first time i have seen him in society
nothing is so necessary for a young man as the society of clever women " anna pavlovna smiled and promised to take pierre in hand
she knew his father to be a connection of prince vasili's
the elderly lady who had been sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook prince vasili in the anteroom
all the affectation of interest she had assumed had left her kindly and tear worn face and it now expressed only anxiety and fear
"how about my son boris  prince " said she  hurrying after him into the anteroom
"i can't remain any longer in petersburg
tell me what news i may take back to my poor boy " although prince vasili listened reluctantly and not very politely to the elderly lady  even betraying some impatience  she gave him an ingratiating and appealing smile  and took his hand that he might not go away
"what would it cost you to say a word to the emperor  and then he would be transferred to the guards at once " said she
"believe me  princess  i am ready to do all i can " answered prince vasili  "but it is difficult for me to ask the emperor
i should advise you to appeal to rumyantsev through prince golitsyn
that would be the best way " the elderly lady was a princess drubetskaya  belonging to one of the best families in russia  but she was poor  and having long been out of society had lost her former influential connections
she had now come to petersburg to procure an appointment in the guards for her only son
it was  in fact  solely to meet prince vasili that she had obtained an invitation to anna pavlovna's reception and had sat listening to the vicomte's story
prince vasili's words frightened her  an embittered look clouded her once handsome face  but only for a moment  then she smiled again and clutched prince vasili's arm more tightly
"listen to me  prince " said she
"i have never yet asked you for anything and i never will again  nor have i ever reminded you of my father's friendship for you  but now i entreat you for god's sake to do this for my son—and i shall always regard you as a benefactor " she added hurriedly
"no  don't be angry  but promise  i have asked golitsyn and he has refused
be the kindhearted man you always were " she said  trying to smile though tears were in her eyes
"papa  we shall be late " said princess helene  turning her beautiful head and looking over her classically molded shoulder as she stood waiting by the door
influence in society  however  is a capital which has to be economized if it is to last
prince vasili knew this  and having once realized that if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him  he would soon be unable to ask for himself  he became chary of using his influence but in princess drubetskaya's case he felt  after her second appeal  something like qualms of conscience she had reminded him of what was quite true  he had been indebted to her father for the first steps in his career
moreover  he could see by her manners that she was one of those women—mostly mothers—who  having once made up their minds  will not rest until they have gained their end  and are prepared if necessary to go on insisting day after day and hour after hour  and even to make scenes
this last consideration moved him
"my dear anna mikhaylovna " said he with his usual familiarity and weariness of tone  "it is almost impossible for me to do what you ask  but to prove my devotion to you and how i respect your father's memory  i will do the impossible—your son shall be transferred to the guards
here is my hand on it
are you satisfied " "my dear benefactor  this is what i expected from you—i knew your kindness " he turned to go
"wait—just a word  when he has been transferred to the guards   " she faltered
"you are on good terms with michael ilarionovich kutuzov   recommend boris to him as adjutant  then i shall be at rest  and then   " prince vasili smiled
"no  i won't promise that
you don't know how kutuzov is pestered since his appointment as commander in chief
he told me himself that all the moscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons as adjutants " "no  but do promise  i won't let you go  my dear benefactor   " "papa " said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as before  "we shall be late " "well  au revoir  good bye  you hear her " "then tomorrow you will speak to the emperor " "certainly  but about kutuzov  i don't promise " "do promise  do promise  vasili " cried anna mikhaylovna as he went  with the smile of a coquettish girl  which at one time probably came naturally to her  but was now very ill suited to her careworn face apparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit employed all the old feminine arts
but as soon as the prince had gone her face resumed its former cold  artificial expression
she returned to the group where the vicomte was still talking  and again pretended to listen  while waiting till it would be time to leave
her task was accomplished
"and what do you think of this latest comedy  the coronation at milan " asked anna pavlovna  "and of the comedy of the people of genoa and lucca laying their petitions before monsieur buonaparte  and monsieur buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of the nations  adorable  it is enough to make one's head whirl  it is as if the whole world had gone crazy " prince andrew looked anna pavlovna straight in the face with a sarcastic smile
"'dieu me la donne  gare a qui la touche ' * they say he was very fine when he said that " he remarked  repeating the words in italian  "'dio mi l'ha dato
guai a chi la tocchi '" * god has given it to me  let him who touches it beware  "i hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass run over " anna pavlovna continued
"the sovereigns will not be able to endure this man who is a menace to everything " "the sovereigns  i do not speak of russia " said the vicomte  polite but hopeless  "the sovereigns  madame  
what have they done for louis xvii  for the queen  or for madame elizabeth  nothing " and he became more animated
"and believe me  they are reaping the reward of their betrayal of the bourbon cause
the sovereigns  why  they are sending ambassadors to compliment the usurper " and sighing disdainfully  he again changed his position
prince hippolyte  who had been gazing at the vicomte for some time through his lorgnette  suddenly turned completely round toward the little princess  and having asked for a needle began tracing the conde coat of arms on the table he explained this to her with as much gravity as if she had asked him to do it
"baton de gueules  engrele de gueules d'azur—maison conde " said he
the princess listened  smiling
"if buonaparte remains on the throne of france a year longer " the vicomte continued  with the air of a man who  in a matter with which he is better acquainted than anyone else  does not listen to others but follows the current of his own thoughts  "things will have gone too far
by intrigues  violence  exile  and executions  french society—i mean good french society—will have been forever destroyed  and then   " he shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands
pierre wished to make a remark  for the conversation interested him  but anna pavlovna  who had him under observation  interrupted  "the emperor alexander " said she  with the melancholy which always accompanied any reference of hers to the imperial family  "has declared that he will leave it to the french people themselves to choose their own form of government  and i believe that once free from the usurper  the whole nation will certainly throw itself into the arms of its rightful king " she concluded  trying to be amiable to the royalist emigrant "that is doubtful " said prince andrew
"monsieur le vicomte quite rightly supposes that matters have already gone too far
i think it will be difficult to return to the old regime " "from what i have heard " said pierre  blushing and breaking into the conversation  "almost all the aristocracy has already gone over to bonaparte's side " "it is the buonapartists who say that " replied the vicomte without looking at pierre
"at the present time it is difficult to know the real state of french public opinion " "bonaparte has said so " remarked prince andrew with a sarcastic smile
it was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his remarks at him  though without looking at him
"'i showed them the path to glory  but they did not follow it '" prince andrew continued after a short silence  again quoting napoleon's words
"'i opened my antechambers and they crowded in ' i do not know how far he was justified in saying so " "not in the least " replied the vicomte
"after the murder of the duc even the most partial ceased to regard him as a hero
if to some people " he went on  turning to anna pavlovna  "he ever was a hero  after the murder of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and one hero less on earth " before anna pavlovna and the others had time to smile their appreciation of the vicomte's epigram  pierre again broke into the conversation  and though anna pavlovna felt sure he would say something inappropriate  she was unable to stop him
"the execution of the duc d'enghien " declared monsieur pierre  "was a political necessity  and it seems to me that napoleon showed greatness of soul by not fearing to take on himself the whole responsibility of that deed " "dieu  mon dieu " muttered anna pavlovna in a terrified whisper "what  monsieur pierre  
do you consider that assassination shows greatness of soul " said the little princess  smiling and drawing her work nearer to her
"oh  oh " exclaimed several voices
"capital " said prince hippolyte in english  and began slapping his knee with the palm of his hand
the vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders
pierre looked solemnly at his audience over his spectacles and continued
"i say so " he continued desperately  "because the bourbons fled from the revolution leaving the people to anarchy  and napoleon alone understood the revolution and quelled it  and so for the general good  he could not stop short for the sake of one man's life " "won't you come over to the other table " suggested anna pavlovna
but pierre continued his speech without heeding her
"no " cried he  becoming more and more eager  "napoleon is great because he rose superior to the revolution  suppressed its abuses  preserved all that was good in it—equality of citizenship and freedom of speech and of the press— and only for that reason did he obtain power " "yes  if having obtained power  without availing himself of it to commit murder he had restored it to the rightful king  i should have called him a great man " remarked the vicomte "he could not do that
the people only gave him power that he might rid them of the bourbons and because they saw that he was a great man
the revolution was a grand thing " continued monsieur pierre  betraying by this desperate and provocative proposition his extreme youth and his wish to express all that was in his mind
"what  revolution and regicide a grand thing   
well  after that  
but won't you come to this other table " repeated anna pavlovna
"rousseau's contrat social " said the vicomte with a tolerant smile
"i am not speaking of regicide  i am speaking about ideas " "yes  ideas of robbery  murder  and regicide " again interjected an ironical voice
"those were extremes  no doubt  but they are not what is most important
what is important are the rights of man  emancipation from prejudices  and equality of citizenship  and all these ideas napoleon has retained in full force " "liberty and equality " said the vicomte contemptuously  as if at last deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words were  "high sounding words which have long been discredited
who does not love liberty and equality  even our saviour preached liberty and equality
have people since the revolution become happier  on the contrary
we wanted liberty  but buonaparte has destroyed it " prince andrew kept looking with an amused smile from pierre to the vicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess
in the first moment of pierre's outburst anna pavlovna  despite her social experience  was horror struck
but when she saw that pierre's sacrilegious words had not exasperated the vicomte  and had convinced herself that it was impossible to stop him  she rallied her forces and joined the vicomte in a vigorous attack on the orator
"but  my dear monsieur pierre " said she  "how do you explain the fact of a great man executing a duc—or even an ordinary man who—is innocent and untried " "i should like " said the vicomte  "to ask how monsieur explains the 18th brumaire  was not that an imposture  it was a swindle  and not at all like the conduct of a great man " "and the prisoners he killed in africa  that was horrible " said the little princess  shrugging her shoulders
"he's a low fellow  say what you will " remarked prince hippolyte
pierre  not knowing whom to answer  looked at them all and smiled
his smile was unlike the half smile of other people
when he smiled  his grave  even rather gloomy  look was instantaneously replaced by another—a childlike  kindly  even rather silly look  which seemed to ask forgiveness
the vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly that this young jacobin was not so terrible as his words suggested
all were silent
"how do you expect him to answer you all at once " said prince andrew
"besides  in the actions of a statesman one has to distinguish between his acts as a private person  as a general  and as an emperor
so it seems to me " "yes  yes  of course " pierre chimed in  pleased at the arrival of this reinforcement "one must admit " continued prince andrew  "that napoleon as a man was great on the bridge of arcola  and in the hospital at jaffa where he gave his hand to the plague stricken  but  
but there are other acts which it is difficult to justify " prince andrew  who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness of pierre's remarks  rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time to go
suddenly prince hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to attend  and asking them all to be seated began  "i was told a charming moscow story today and must treat you to it
excuse me  vicomte—i must tell it in russian or the point will be lost    " and prince hippolyte began to tell his story in such russian as a frenchman would speak after spending about a year in russia
everyone waited  so emphatically and eagerly did he demand their attention to his story
"there is in moscow a lady  une dame  and she is very stingy
she must have two footmen behind her carriage  and very big ones
that was her taste
and she had a lady's maid  also big
she said   " here prince hippolyte paused  evidently collecting his ideas with difficulty
"she said  
oh yes  she said  'girl ' to the maid  'put on a livery  get up behind the carriage  and come with me while i make some calls '" here prince hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long before his audience  which produced an effect unfavorable to the narrator
several persons  among them the elderly lady and anna pavlovna  did however smile
"she went
suddenly there was a great wind
the girl lost her hat and her long hair came down    " here he could contain himself no longer and went on  between gasps of laughter  "and the whole world knew    " and so the anecdote ended though it was unintelligible why he had told it  or why it had to be told in russian  still anna pavlovna and the others appreciated prince hippolyte's social tact in so agreeably ending pierre's unpleasant and unamiable outburst
after the anecdote the conversation broke up into insignificant small talk about the last and next balls  about theatricals  and who would meet whom  and when and where
having thanked anna pavlovna for her charming soiree  the guests began to take their leave
pierre was ungainly
stout  about the average height  broad  with huge red hands  he did not know  as the saying is  how to enter a drawing room and still less how to leave one  that is  how to say something particularly agreeable before going away
besides this he was absent minded
when he rose to go  he took up instead of his own  the general's three cornered hat  and held it  pulling at the plume  till the general asked him to restore it
all his absentmindedness and inability to enter a room and converse in it was  however  redeemed by his kindly  simple  and modest expression
anna pavlovna turned toward him and  with a christian mildness that expressed forgiveness of his indiscretion  nodded and said  "i hope to see you again  but i also hope you will change your opinions  my dear monsieur pierre " when she said this  he did not reply and only bowed  but again everybody saw his smile  which said nothing  unless perhaps  "opinions are opinions  but you see what a capital  good natured fellow i am " and everyone  including anna pavlovna  felt this
prince andrew had gone out into the hall  and  turning his shoulders to the footman who was helping him on with his cloak  listened indifferently to his wife's chatter with prince hippolyte who had also come into the hall
prince hippolyte stood close to the pretty  pregnant princess  and stared fixedly at her through his eyeglass
"go in  annette  or you will catch cold " said the little princess  taking leave of anna pavlovna
"it is settled " she added in a low voice
anna pavlovna had already managed to speak to lise about the match she contemplated between anatole and the little princess' sister in law
"i rely on you  my dear " said anna pavlovna  also in a low tone
"write to her and let me know how her father looks at the matter
au revoir "—and she left the hall
prince hippolyte approached the little princess and  bending his face close to her  began to whisper something
two footmen  the princess' and his own  stood holding a shawl and a cloak  waiting for the conversation to finish
they listened to the french sentences which to them were meaningless  with an air of understanding but not wishing to appear to do so
the princess as usual spoke smilingly and listened with a laugh
"i am very glad i did not go to the ambassador's " said prince hippolyte " so dull 
it has been a delightful evening  has it not  delightful " "they say the ball will be very good " replied the princess  drawing up her downy little lip
"all the pretty women in society will be there " "not all  for you will not be there  not all " said prince hippolyte smiling joyfully  and snatching the shawl from the footman  whom he even pushed aside  he began wrapping it round the princess
either from awkwardness or intentionally  no one could have said which  after the shawl had been adjusted he kept his arm around her for a long time  as though embracing her
still smiling  she gracefully moved away  turning and glancing at her husband
prince andrew's eyes were closed  so weary and sleepy did he seem
"are you ready " he asked his wife  looking past her
prince hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak  which in the latest fashion reached to his very heels  and  stumbling in it  ran out into the porch following the princess  whom a footman was helping into the carriage
"princesse  au revoir " cried he  stumbling with his tongue as well as with his feet
the princess  picking up her dress  was taking her seat in the dark carriage  her husband was adjusting his saber  prince hippolyte  under pretense of helping  was in everyone's way
"allow me  sir " said prince andrew in russian in a cold  disagreeable tone to prince hippolyte who was blocking his path
"i am expecting you  pierre " said the same voice  but gently and affectionately
the postilion started  the carriage wheels rattled
prince hippolyte laughed spasmodically as he stood in the porch waiting for the vicomte whom he had promised to take home
"well  mon cher " said the vicomte  having seated himself beside hippolyte in the carriage  "your little princess is very nice  very nice indeed  quite french " and he kissed the tips of his fingers hippolyte burst out laughing
"do you know  you are a terrible chap for all your innocent airs " continued the vicomte
"i pity the poor husband  that little officer who gives himself the airs of a monarch " hippolyte spluttered again  and amid his laughter said  "and you were saying that the russian ladies are not equal to the french  one has to know how to deal with them " pierre reaching the house first went into prince andrew's study like one quite at home  and from habit immediately lay down on the sofa  took from the shelf resting on his elbow  began reading it in the middle "what have you done to mlle scherer  she will be quite ill now " said prince andrew  as he entered the study  rubbing his small white hands
pierre turned his whole body  making the sofa creak
he lifted his eager face to prince andrew  smiled  and waved his hand
"that abbe is very interesting but he does not see the thing in the right light   
in my opinion perpetual peace is possible but—i do not know how to express it  
not by a balance of political power    " it was evident that prince andrew was not interested in such abstract conversation
"one can't everywhere say all one thinks  mon cher
well  have you at last decided on anything  are you going to be a guardsman or a diplomatist " asked prince andrew after a momentary silence
pierre sat up on the sofa  with his legs tucked under him
"really  i don't yet know
i don't like either the one or the other " "but you must decide on something  your father expects it " pierre at the age of ten had been sent abroad with an abbe as tutor  and had remained away till he was twenty
when he returned to moscow his father dismissed the abbe and said to the young man  "now go to petersburg  look round  and choose your profession
i will agree to anything
here is a letter to prince vasili  and here is money
write to me all about it  and i will help you in everything " pierre had already been choosing a career for three months  and had not decided on anything
it was about this choice that prince andrew was speaking
pierre rubbed his forehead
"but he must be a freemason " said he  referring to the abbe whom he had met that evening
"that is all nonsense " prince andrew again interrupted him  "let us talk business
have you been to the horse guards " "no  i have not  but this is what i have been thinking and wanted to tell you
there is a war now against napoleon
if it were a war for freedom i could understand it and should be the first to enter the army  but to help england and austria against the greatest man in the world is not right " prince andrew only shrugged his shoulders at pierre's childish words
he put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to such nonsense  but it would in fact have been difficult to give any other answer than the one prince andrew gave to this naive question
"if no one fought except on his own conviction  there would be no wars " he said
"and that would be splendid " said pierre
prince andrew smiled ironically
"very likely it would be splendid  but it will never come about   " "well  why are you going to the war " asked pierre
"what for  i don't know
i must
besides that i am going   " he paused
"i am going because the life i am leading here does not suit me " the rustle of a woman's dress was heard in the next room
prince andrew shook himself as if waking up  and his face assumed the look it had had in anna pavlovna's drawing room pierre removed his feet from the sofa
the princess came in
she had changed her gown for a house dress as fresh and elegant as the other
prince andrew rose and politely placed a chair for her
"how is it " she began  as usual in french  settling down briskly and fussily in the easy chair  "how is it annette never got married  how stupid you men all are not to have married her  excuse me for saying so  but you have no sense about women
what an argumentative fellow you are  monsieur pierre " "and i am still arguing with your husband
i can't understand why he wants to go to the war " replied pierre  addressing the princess with none of the embarrassment so commonly shown by young men in their intercourse with young women
the princess started
evidently pierre's words touched her to the quick
"ah  that is just what i tell him " said she
"i don't understand it  i don't in the least understand why men can't live without wars
how is it that we women don't want anything of the kind  don't need it  now you shall judge between us
i always tell him  here he is uncle's aide de camp  a most brilliant position
he is so well known  so much appreciated by everyone
the other day at the apraksins' i heard a lady asking  'is that the famous prince andrew ' i did indeed " she laughed
"he is so well received everywhere
he might easily become aide de camp to the emperor
you know the emperor spoke to him most graciously
annette and i were speaking of how to arrange it
what do you think " pierre looked at his friend and  noticing that he did not like the conversation  gave no reply
"when are you starting " he asked
"oh  don't speak of his going  don't  i won't hear it spoken of " said the princess in the same petulantly playful tone in which she had spoken to hippolyte in the drawing room and which was so plainly ill suited to the family circle of which pierre was almost a member
"today when i remembered that all these delightful associations must be broken off  
and then you know  andre   "  she looked significantly at her husband  "i'm afraid  i'm afraid " she whispered  and a shudder ran down her back
her husband looked at her as if surprised to notice that someone besides pierre and himself was in the room  and addressed her in a tone of frigid politeness "what is it you are afraid of  lise  i don't understand " said he
"there  what egotists men all are  all  all egotists  just for a whim of his own  goodness only knows why  he leaves me and locks me up alone in the country " "with my father and sister  remember " said prince andrew gently
"alone all the same  without my friends   
and he expects me not to be afraid " her tone was now querulous and her lip drawn up  giving her not a joyful  but an animal  squirrel like expression
she paused as if she felt it indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before pierre  though the gist of the matter lay in that
"i still can't understand what you are afraid of " said prince andrew slowly  not taking his eyes off his wife
the princess blushed  and raised her arms with a gesture of despair "no  andrew  i must say you have changed
oh  how you have   " "your doctor tells you to go to bed earlier " said prince andrew
"you had better go " the princess said nothing  but suddenly her short downy lip quivered
prince andrew rose  shrugged his shoulders  and walked about the room
pierre looked over his spectacles with naive surprise  now at him and now at her  moved as if about to rise too  but changed his mind
"why should i mind monsieur pierre being here " exclaimed the little princess suddenly  her pretty face all at once distorted by a tearful grimace
"i have long wanted to ask you  andrew  why you have changed so to me  what have i done to you  you are going to the war and have no pity for me
why is it " "lise " was all prince andrew said
but that one word expressed an entreaty  a threat  and above all conviction that she would herself regret her words
but she went on hurriedly  "you treat me like an invalid or a child
i see it all  did you behave like that six months ago " "lise  i beg you to desist " said prince andrew still more emphatically
pierre  who had been growing more and more agitated as he listened to all this  rose and approached the princess
he seemed unable to bear the sight of tears and was ready to cry himself "calm yourself  princess  it seems so to you because   i assure you i myself have experienced  
and so  
because  
no  excuse me  an outsider is out of place here  
no  don't distress yourself  
good bye " prince andrew caught him by the hand
"no  wait  pierre  the princess is too kind to wish to deprive me of the pleasure of spending the evening with you " "no  he thinks only of himself " muttered the princess without restraining her angry tears "lise " said prince andrew dryly  raising his voice to the pitch which indicates that patience is exhausted
suddenly the angry  squirrel like expression of the princess' pretty face changed into a winning and piteous look of fear
her beautiful eyes glanced askance at her husband's face  and her own assumed the timid  deprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly wags its drooping tail
"mon dieu  mon dieu " she muttered  and lifting her dress with one hand she went up to her husband and kissed him on the forehead
"good night  lise " said he  rising and courteously kissing her hand as he would have done to a stranger
the friends were silent
neither cared to begin talking
pierre continually glanced at prince andrew  prince andrew rubbed his forehead with his small hand
"let us go and have supper " he said with a sigh  going to the door
they entered the elegant  newly decorated  and luxurious dining room
everything from the table napkins to the silver  china  and glass bore that imprint of newness found in the households of the newly married
halfway through supper prince andrew leaned his elbows on the table and  with a look of nervous agitation such as pierre had never before seen on his face  began to talk—as one who has long had something on his mind and suddenly determines to speak out
"never  never marry  my dear fellow  that's my advice  never marry till you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable of  and until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and have seen her plainly as she is  or else you will make a cruel and irrevocable mistake
marry when you are old and good for nothing—or all that is good and noble in you will be lost
it will all be wasted on trifles
yes  yes  yes  don't look at me with such surprise
if you marry expecting anything from yourself in the future  you will feel at every step that for you all is ended  all is closed except the drawing room  where you will be ranged side by side with a court lackey and an idiot   
but what's the good    " and he waved his arm
pierre took off his spectacles  which made his face seem different and the good natured expression still more apparent  and gazed at his friend in amazement
"my wife " continued prince andrew  "is an excellent woman  one of those rare women with whom a man's honor is safe  but  o god  what would i not give now to be unmarried  you are the first and only one to whom i mention this  because i like you " as he said this prince andrew was less than ever like that bolkonski who had lolled in anna pavlovna's easy chairs and with half closed eyes had uttered french phrases between his teeth
every muscle of his thin face was now quivering with nervous excitement  his eyes  in which the fire of life had seemed extinguished  now flashed with brilliant light
it was evident that the more lifeless he seemed at ordinary times  the more impassioned he became in these moments of almost morbid irritation
"you don't understand why i say this " he continued  "but it is the whole story of life
you talk of bonaparte and his career " said he  though pierre had not mentioned bonaparte   "but bonaparte when he worked went step by step toward his goal
he was free  he had nothing but his aim to consider  and he reached it
but tie yourself up with a woman and  like a chained convict  you lose all freedom  and all you have of hope and strength merely weighs you down and torments you with regret
drawing rooms  gossip  balls  vanity  and triviality—these are the enchanted circle i cannot escape from i am now going to the war  the greatest war there ever was  and i know nothing and am fit for nothing
i am very amiable and have a caustic wit " continued prince andrew  "and at anna pavlovna's they listen to me
and that stupid set without whom my wife cannot exist  and those women  
if you only knew what those society women are  and women in general  my father is right
selfish  vain  stupid  trivial in everything—that's what women are when you see them in their true colors  when you meet them in society it seems as if there were something in them  but there's nothing  nothing  nothing  no  don't marry  my dear fellow  don't marry " concluded prince andrew "it seems funny to me " said pierre  "that you  you should consider yourself incapable and your life a spoiled life you have everything before you  everything
and you   " he did not finish his sentence  but his tone showed how highly he thought of his friend and how much he expected of him in the future
"how can he talk like that " thought pierre
he considered his friend a model of perfection because prince andrew possessed in the highest degree just the very qualities pierre lacked  and which might be best described as strength of will
pierre was always astonished at prince andrew's calm manner of treating everybody  his extraordinary memory  his extensive reading  he had read everything  knew everything  and had an opinion about everything   but above all at his capacity for work and study
and if pierre was often struck by andrew's lack of capacity for philosophical meditation  to which he himself was particularly addicted   he regarded even this not as a defect but as a sign of strength even in the best  most friendly and simplest relations of life  praise and commendation are essential  just as grease is necessary to wheels that they may run smoothly
"my part is played out " said prince andrew
"what's the use of talking about me  let us talk about you " he added after a silence  smiling at his reassuring thoughts
that smile was immediately reflected on pierre's face
"but what is there to say about me " said pierre  his face relaxing into a careless  merry smile
"what am i  an illegitimate son " he suddenly blushed crimson  and it was plain that he had made a great effort to say this "without a name and without means  
and it really   " but he did not say what "it really" was
"for the present i am free and am all right
only i haven't the least idea what i am to do  i wanted to consult you seriously " prince andrew looked kindly at him  yet his glance—friendly and affectionate as it was—expressed a sense of his own superiority
"i am fond of you  especially as you are the one live man among our whole set
yes  you're all right  choose what you will  it's all the same
you'll be all right anywhere
but look here  give up visiting those kuragins and leading that sort of life
it suits you so badly—all this debauchery  dissipation  and the rest of it " "what would you have  my dear fellow " answered pierre  shrugging his shoulders
"women  my dear fellow  women " "i don't understand it " replied prince andrew
"women who are comme il faut  that's a different matter  but the kuragins' set of women  'women and wine' i don't understand " pierre was staying at prince vasili kuragin's and sharing the dissipated life of his son anatole  the son whom they were planning to reform by marrying him to prince andrew's sister
"do you know " said pierre  as if suddenly struck by a happy thought  "seriously  i have long been thinking of it   
leading such a life i can't decide or think properly about anything
one's head aches  and one spends all one's money
he asked me for tonight  but i won't go " "you give me your word of honor not to go " "on my honor " it was past one o'clock when pierre left his friend
it was a cloudless  northern  summer night
pierre took an open cab intending to drive straight home
but the nearer he drew to the house the more he felt the impossibility of going to sleep on such a night
it was light enough to see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed more like morning or evening than night
on the way pierre remembered that anatole kuragin was expecting the usual set for cards that evening  after which there was generally a drinking bout  finishing with visits of a kind pierre was very fond of
"i should like to go to kuragin's " thought he
but he immediately recalled his promise to prince andrew not to go there
then  as happens to people of weak character  he desired so passionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed to that he decided to go
the thought immediately occurred to him that his promise to prince andrew was of no account  because before he gave it he had already promised prince anatole to come to his gathering  "besides " thought he  "all such 'words of honor' are conventional things with no definite meaning  especially if one considers that by tomorrow one may be dead  or something so extraordinary may happen to one that honor and dishonor will be all the same " pierre often indulged in reflections of this sort  nullifying all his decisions and intentions
he went to kuragin's
reaching the large house near the horse guards' barracks  in which anatole lived  pierre entered the lighted porch  ascended the stairs  and went in at the open door
there was no one in the anteroom  empty bottles  cloaks  and overshoes were lying about  there was a smell of alcohol  and sounds of voices and shouting in the distance
cards and supper were over  but the visitors had not yet dispersed
pierre threw off his cloak and entered the first room  in which were the remains of supper
a footman  thinking no one saw him  was drinking on the sly what was left in the glasses
from the third room came sounds of laughter  the shouting of familiar voices  the growling of a bear  and general commotion
some eight or nine young men were crowding anxiously round an open window
three others were romping with a young bear  one pulling him by the chain and trying to set him at the others
"i bet a hundred on stevens " shouted one
"mind  no holding on " cried another
"i bet on dolokhov " cried a third
"kuragin  you part our hands " "there  leave bruin alone  here's a bet on " "at one draught  or he loses " shouted a fourth
"jacob  bring a bottle " shouted the host  a tall  handsome fellow who stood in the midst of the group  without a coat  and with his fine linen shirt unfastened in front
"wait a bit  you fellows   
here is petya  good man " cried he  addressing pierre
another voice  from a man of medium height with clear blue eyes  particularly striking among all these drunken voices by its sober ring  cried from the window  "come here  part the bets " this was dolokhov  an officer of the semenov regiment  a notorious gambler and duelist  who was living with anatole
pierre smiled  looking about him merrily
"i don't understand
what's it all about " "wait a bit  he is not drunk yet  a bottle here " said anatole  taking a glass from the table he went up to pierre
"first of all you must drink " pierre drank one glass after another  looking from under his brows at the tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window  and listening to their chatter
anatole kept on refilling pierre's glass while explaining that dolokhov was betting with stevens  an english naval officer  that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting on the outer ledge of the third floor window with his legs hanging out
"go on  you must drink it all " said anatole  giving pierre the last glass  "or i won't let you go " "no  i won't " said pierre  pushing anatole aside  and he went up to the window
dolokhov was holding the englishman's hand and clearly and distinctly repeating the terms of the bet  addressing himself particularly to anatole and pierre dolokhov was of medium height  with curly hair and light blue eyes
he was about twenty five
like all infantry officers he wore no mustache  so that his mouth  the most striking feature of his face  was clearly seen
the lines of that mouth were remarkably finely curved
the middle of the upper lip formed a sharp wedge and closed firmly on the firm lower one  and something like two distinct smiles played continually round the two corners of the mouth  this  together with the resolute  insolent intelligence of his eyes  produced an effect which made it impossible not to notice his face
dolokhov was a man of small means and no connections
yet  though anatole spent tens of thousands of rubles  dolokhov lived with him and had placed himself on such a footing that all who knew them  including anatole himself  respected him more than they did anatole dolokhov could play all games and nearly always won
however much he drank  he never lost his clearheadedness
both kuragin and dolokhov were at that time notorious among the rakes and scapegraces of petersburg
the bottle of rum was brought
the window frame which prevented anyone from sitting on the outer sill was being forced out by two footmen  who were evidently flurried and intimidated by the directions and shouts of the gentlemen around
anatole with his swaggering air strode up to the window
he wanted to smash something
pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame  but could not move it
he smashed a pane
"you have a try  hercules " said he  turning to pierre
pierre seized the crossbeam  tugged  and wrenched the oak frame out with a crash
"take it right out  or they'll think i'm holding on " said dolokhov
"is the englishman bragging   
eh  is it all right " said anatole
"first rate " said pierre  looking at dolokhov  who with a bottle of rum in his hand was approaching the window  from which the light of the sky  the dawn merging with the afterglow of sunset  was visible
dolokhov  the bottle of rum still in his hand  jumped onto the window sill
"listen " cried he  standing there and addressing those in the room
all were silent
"i bet fifty imperials"—he spoke french that the englishman might understand him  but he did not speak it very well—"i bet fifty imperials  
or do you wish to make it a hundred " added he  addressing the englishman
"no  fifty " replied the latter
"all right
fifty imperials  
that i will drink a whole bottle of rum without taking it from my mouth  sitting outside the window on this spot"  he stooped and pointed to the sloping ledge outside the window  "and without holding on to anything
is that right " "quite right " said the englishman
anatole turned to the englishman and taking him by one of the buttons of his coat and looking down at him—the englishman was short—began repeating the terms of the wager to him in english "wait " cried dolokhov  hammering with the bottle on the window sill to attract attention
"wait a bit  kuragin
listen  if anyone else does the same  i will pay him a hundred imperials
do you understand " the englishman nodded  but gave no indication whether he intended to accept this challenge or not
anatole did not release him  and though he kept nodding to show that he understood  anatole went on translating dolokhov's words into english
a thin young lad  an hussar of the life guards  who had been losing that evening  climbed on the window sill  leaned over  and looked down
"oh  oh  oh " he muttered  looking down from the window at the stones of the pavement
"shut up " cried dolokhov  pushing him away from the window
the lad jumped awkwardly back into the room  tripping over his spurs
placing the bottle on the window sill where he could reach it easily  dolokhov climbed carefully and slowly through the window and lowered his legs
pressing against both sides of the window  he adjusted himself on his seat  lowered his hands  moved a little to the right and then to the left  and took up the bottle anatole brought two candles and placed them on the window sill  though it was already quite light
dolokhov's back in his white shirt  and his curly head  were lit up from both sides
everyone crowded to the window  the englishman in front
pierre stood smiling but silent
one man  older than the others present  suddenly pushed forward with a scared and angry look and wanted to seize hold of dolokhov's shirt
"i say  this is folly  he'll be killed " said this more sensible man
anatole stopped him
"don't touch him  you'll startle him and then he'll be killed
eh   
what then   
eh " dolokhov turned round and  again holding on with both hands  arranged himself on his seat "if anyone comes meddling again " said he  emitting the words separately through his thin compressed lips  "i will throw him down there
now then " saying this he again turned round  dropped his hands  took the bottle and lifted it to his lips  threw back his head  and raised his free hand to balance himself one of the footmen who had stooped to pick up some broken glass remained in that position without taking his eyes from the window and from dolokhov's back
anatole stood erect with staring eyes
the englishman looked on sideways  pursing up his lips
the man who had wished to stop the affair ran to a corner of the room and threw himself on a sofa with his face to the wall pierre hid his face  from which a faint smile forgot to fade though his features now expressed horror and fear
all were still
pierre took his hands from his eyes
dolokhov still sat in the same position  only his head was thrown further back till his curly hair touched his shirt collar  and the hand holding the bottle was lifted higher and higher and trembled with the effort
the bottle was emptying perceptibly and rising still higher and his head tilting yet further back
"why is it so long " thought pierre
it seemed to him that more than half an hour had elapsed
suddenly dolokhov made a backward movement with his spine  and his arm trembled nervously  this was sufficient to cause his whole body to slip as he sat on the sloping ledge
as he began slipping down  his head and arm wavered still more with the strain
one hand moved as if to clutch the window sill  but refrained from touching it
pierre again covered his eyes and thought he would never open them again
suddenly he was aware of a stir all around
he looked up  dolokhov was standing on the window sill  with a pale but radiant face
"it's empty " he threw the bottle to the englishman  who caught it neatly
dolokhov jumped down
he smelt strongly of rum
"well done   
fine fellow   
there's a bet for you   
devil take you " came from different sides
the englishman took out his purse and began counting out the money
dolokhov stood frowning and did not speak
pierre jumped upon the window sill
"gentlemen  who wishes to bet with me  i'll do the same thing " he suddenly cried
"even without a bet  there  tell them to bring me a bottle
i'll do it   
bring a bottle " "let him do it  let him do it " said dolokhov  smiling
"what next  have you gone mad   
no one would let you   
why  you go giddy even on a staircase " exclaimed several voices
"i'll drink it  let's have a bottle of rum " shouted pierre  banging the table with a determined and drunken gesture and preparing to climb out of the window
they seized him by his arms  but he was so strong that everyone who touched him was sent flying "no  you'll never manage him that way " said anatole
"wait a bit and i'll get round him   
listen  i'll take your bet tomorrow  but now we are all going to ——'s " "come on then " cried pierre
"come on   
and we'll take bruin with us " and he caught the bear  took it in his arms  lifted it from the ground  and began dancing round the room with it prince vasili kept the promise he had given to princess drubetskaya who had spoken to him on behalf of her only son boris on the evening of anna pavlovna's soiree
the matter was mentioned to the emperor  an exception made  and boris transferred into the regiment of semenov guards with the rank of cornet
he received  however  no appointment to kutuzov's staff despite all anna mikhaylovna's endeavors and entreaties
soon after anna pavlovna's reception anna mikhaylovna returned to moscow and went straight to her rich relations  the rostovs  with whom she stayed when in the town and where her darling bory  who had only just entered a regiment of the line and was being at once transferred to the guards as a cornet  had been educated from childhood and lived for years at a time
the guards had already left petersburg on the tenth of august  and her son  who had remained in moscow for his equipment  was to join them on the march to radzivilov
it was st
natalia's day and the name day of two of the rostovs—the mother and the youngest daughter—both named nataly
ever since the morning  carriages with six horses had been coming and going continually  bringing visitors to the countess rostova's big house on the povarskaya  so well known to all moscow
the countess herself and her handsome eldest daughter were in the drawing room with the visitors who came to congratulate  and who constantly succeeded one another in relays
the countess was a woman of about forty five  with a thin oriental type of face  evidently worn out with childbearing—she had had twelve
a languor of motion and speech  resulting from weakness  gave her a distinguished air which inspired respect
princess anna mikhaylovna drubetskaya  who as a member of the household was also seated in the drawing room  helped to receive and entertain the visitors
the young people were in one of the inner rooms  not considering it necessary to take part in receiving the visitors the count met the guests and saw them off  inviting them all to dinner
"i am very  very grateful to you  mon cher " or "ma chere"—he called everyone without exception and without the slightest variation in his tone  "my dear " whether they were above or below him in rank—"i thank you for myself and for our two dear ones whose name day we are keeping
but mind you come to dinner or i shall be offended  ma chere  on behalf of the whole family i beg you to come  mon cher " these words he repeated to everyone without exception or variation  and with the same expression on his full  cheerful  clean shaven face  the same firm pressure of the hand and the same quick  repeated bows
as soon as he had seen a visitor off he returned to one of those who were still in the drawing room  drew a chair toward him or her  and jauntily spreading out his legs and putting his hands on his knees with the air of a man who enjoys life and knows how to live  he swayed to and fro with dignity  offered surmises about the weather  or touched on questions of health  sometimes in russian and sometimes in very bad but self confident french  then again  like a man weary but unflinching in the fulfillment of duty  he rose to see some visitors off and  stroking his scanty gray hairs over his bald patch  also asked them to dinner
sometimes on his way back from the anteroom he would pass through the conservatory and pantry into the large marble dining hall  where tables were being set out for eighty people  and looking at the footmen  who were bringing in silver and china  moving tables  and unfolding damask table linen  he would call dmitri vasilevich  a man of good family and the manager of all his affairs  and while looking with pleasure at the enormous table would say  "well  dmitri  you'll see that things are all as they should be  that's right  the great thing is the serving  that's it " and with a complacent sigh he would return to the drawing room
"marya lvovna karagina and her daughter " announced the countess' gigantic footman in his bass voice  entering the drawing room
the countess reflected a moment and took a pinch from a gold snuffbox with her husband's portrait on it
"i'm quite worn out by these callers
however  i'll see her and no more
she is so affected
ask her in " she said to the footman in a sad voice  as if saying  "very well  finish me off " a tall  stout  and proud looking woman  with a round faced smiling daughter  entered the drawing room  their dresses rustling
"dear countess  what an age  
she has been laid up  poor child  
at the razumovski's ball  
and countess apraksina  
i was so delighted   " came the sounds of animated feminine voices  interrupting one another and mingling with the rustling of dresses and the scraping of chairs
then one of those conversations began which last out until  at the first pause  the guests rise with a rustle of dresses and say  "i am so delighted  
mamma's health  
and countess apraksina   " and then  again rustling  pass into the anteroom  put on cloaks or mantles  and drive away
the conversation was on the chief topic of the day  the illness of the wealthy and celebrated beau of catherine's day  count bezukhov  and about his illegitimate son pierre  the one who had behaved so improperly at anna pavlovna's reception
"i am so sorry for the poor count " said the visitor
"he is in such bad health  and now this vexation about his son is enough to kill him " "what is that " asked the countess as if she did not know what the visitor alluded to  though she had already heard about the cause of count bezukhov's distress some fifteen times
"that's what comes of a modern education " exclaimed the visitor
"it seems that while he was abroad this young man was allowed to do as he liked  now in petersburg i hear he has been doing such terrible things that he has been expelled by the police " "you don't say so " replied the countess "he chose his friends badly " interposed anna mikhaylovna
"prince vasili's son  he  and a certain dolokhov have  it is said  been up to heaven only knows what  and they have had to suffer for it
dolokhov has been degraded to the ranks and bezukhov's son sent back to moscow
anatole kuragin's father managed somehow to get his son's affair hushed up  but even he was ordered out of petersburg " "but what have they been up to " asked the countess
"they are regular brigands  especially dolokhov " replied the visitor
"he is a son of marya ivanovna dolokhova  such a worthy woman  but there  just fancy  those three got hold of a bear somewhere  put it in a carriage  and set off with it to visit some actresses  the police tried to interfere  and what did the young men do  they tied a policeman and the bear back to back and put the bear into the moyka canal
and there was the bear swimming about with the policeman on his back " "what a nice figure the policeman must have cut  my dear " shouted the count  dying with laughter
"oh  how dreadful  how can you laugh at it  count " yet the ladies themselves could not help laughing "it was all they could do to rescue the poor man " continued the visitor
"and to think it is cyril vladimirovich bezukhov's son who amuses himself in this sensible manner  and he was said to be so well educated and clever this is all that his foreign education has done for him  i hope that here in moscow no one will receive him  in spite of his money
they wanted to introduce him to me  but i quite declined  i have my daughters to consider " "why do you say this young man is so rich " asked the countess  turning away from the girls  who at once assumed an air of inattention
"his children are all illegitimate
i think pierre also is illegitimate " the visitor made a gesture with her hand
"i should think he has a score of them " princess anna mikhaylovna intervened in the conversation  evidently wishing to show her connections and knowledge of what went on in society
"the fact of the matter is " said she significantly  and also in a half whisper  "everyone knows count cyril's reputation   
he has lost count of his children  but this pierre was his favorite " "how handsome the old man still was only a year ago " remarked the countess
"i have never seen a handsomer man " "he is very much altered now " said anna mikhaylovna
"well  as i was saying  prince vasili is the next heir through his wife  but the count is very fond of pierre  looked after his education  and wrote to the emperor about him  so that in the case of his death—and he is so ill that he may die at any moment  and dr
lorrain has come from petersburg—no one knows who will inherit his immense fortune  pierre or prince vasili
forty thousand serfs and millions of rubles  i know it all very well for prince vasili told me himself besides  cyril vladimirovich is my mother's second cousin
he's also my bory's godfather " she added  as if she attached no importance at all to the fact
"prince vasili arrived in moscow yesterday
i hear he has come on some inspection business " remarked the visitor
"yes  but between ourselves " said the princess  "that is a pretext
the fact is he has come to see count cyril vladimirovich  hearing how ill he is " "but do you know  my dear  that was a capital joke " said the count  and seeing that the elder visitor was not listening  he turned to the young ladies
"i can just imagine what a funny figure that policeman cut " and as he waved his arms to impersonate the policeman  his portly form again shook with a deep ringing laugh  the laugh of one who always eats well and  in particular  drinks well "so do come and dine with us " he said
silence ensued
the countess looked at her callers  smiling affably  but not concealing the fact that she would not be distressed if they now rose and took their leave
the visitor's daughter was already smoothing down her dress with an inquiring look at her mother  when suddenly from the next room were heard the footsteps of boys and girls running to the door and the noise of a chair falling over  and a girl of thirteen  hiding something in the folds of her short muslin frock  darted in and stopped short in the middle of the room
it was evident that she had not intended her flight to bring her so far
behind her in the doorway appeared a student with a crimson coat collar  an officer of the guards  a girl of fifteen  and a plump rosy faced boy in a short jacket the count jumped up and  swaying from side to side  spread his arms wide and threw them round the little girl who had run in "ah  here she is " he exclaimed laughing
"my pet  whose name day it is
my dear pet " "ma chere  there is a time for everything " said the countess with feigned severity
"you spoil her  ilya " she added  turning to her husband
"how do you do  my dear  i wish you many happy returns of your name day " said the visitor
"what a charming child " she added  addressing the mother
this black eyed  wide mouthed girl  not pretty but full of life—with childish bare shoulders which after her run heaved and shook her bodice  with black curls tossed backward  thin bare arms  little legs in lace frilled drawers  and feet in low slippers—was just at that charming age when a girl is no longer a child  though the child is not yet a young woman escaping from her father she ran to hide her flushed face in the lace of her mother's mantilla—not paying the least attention to her severe remark—and began to laugh
she laughed  and in fragmentary sentences tried to explain about a doll which she produced from the folds of her frock
"do you see   
my doll  
mimi  
you see   " was all natasha managed to utter  to her everything seemed funny 
she leaned against her mother and burst into such a loud  ringing fit of laughter that even the prim visitor could not help joining in
"now then  go away and take your monstrosity with you " said the mother  pushing away her daughter with pretended sternness  and turning to the visitor she added  "she is my youngest girl " natasha  raising her face for a moment from her mother's mantilla  glanced up at her through tears of laughter  and again hid her face
the visitor  compelled to look on at this family scene  thought it necessary to take some part in it
"tell me  my dear " said she to natasha  "is mimi a relation of yours  a daughter  i suppose " natasha did not like the visitor's tone of condescension to childish things
she did not reply  but looked at her seriously
meanwhile the younger generation  boris  the officer  anna mikhaylovna's son  nicholas  the undergraduate  the count's eldest son  sonya  the count's fifteen year old niece  and little petya  his youngest boy  had all settled down in the drawing room and were obviously trying to restrain within the bounds of decorum the excitement and mirth that shone in all their faces
evidently in the back rooms  from which they had dashed out so impetuously  the conversation had been more amusing than the drawing room talk of society scandals  the weather  and countess apraksina now and then they glanced at one another  hardly able to suppress their laughter
the two young men  the student and the officer  friends from childhood  were of the same age and both handsome fellows  though not alike
boris was tall and fair  and his calm and handsome face had regular  delicate features
nicholas was short with curly hair and an open expression
dark hairs were already showing on his upper lip  and his whole face expressed impetuosity and enthusiasm
nicholas blushed when he entered the drawing room
he evidently tried to find something to say  but failed
boris on the contrary at once found his footing  and related quietly and humorously how he had known that doll mimi when she was still quite a young lady  before her nose was broken  how she had aged during the five years he had known her  and how her head had cracked right across the skull
having said this he glanced at natasha
she turned away from him and glanced at her younger brother  who was screwing up his eyes and shaking with suppressed laughter  and unable to control herself any longer  she jumped up and rushed from the room as fast as her nimble little feet would carry her
boris did not laugh
"you were meaning to go out  weren't you  mamma  do you want the carriage " he asked his mother with a smile
"yes  yes  go and tell them to get it ready " she answered  returning his smile
boris quietly left the room and went in search of natasha
the plump boy ran after them angrily  as if vexed that their program had been disturbed
the only young people remaining in the drawing room  not counting the young lady visitor and the countess' eldest daughter  who was four years older than her sister and behaved already like a grown up person   were nicholas and sonya  the niece
sonya was a slender little brunette with a tender look in her eyes which were veiled by long lashes  thick black plaits coiling twice round her head  and a tawny tint in her complexion and especially in the color of her slender but graceful and muscular arms and neck by the grace of her movements  by the softness and flexibility of her small limbs  and by a certain coyness and reserve of manner  she reminded one of a pretty  half grown kitten which promises to become a beautiful little cat
she evidently considered it proper to show an interest in the general conversation by smiling  but in spite of herself her eyes under their thick long lashes watched her cousin who was going to join the army  with such passionate girlish adoration that her smile could not for a single instant impose upon anyone  and it was clear that the kitten had settled down only to spring up with more energy and again play with her cousin as soon as they too could  like natasha and boris  escape from the drawing room
"ah yes  my dear " said the count  addressing the visitor and pointing to nicholas  "his friend boris has become an officer  and so for friendship's sake he is leaving the university and me  his old father  and entering the military service  my dear
and there was a place and everything waiting for him in the archives department  isn't that friendship " remarked the count in an inquiring tone
"but they say that war has been declared " replied the visitor
"they've been saying so a long while " said the count  "and they'll say so again and again  and that will be the end of it
my dear  there's friendship for you " he repeated
"he's joining the hussars " the visitor  not knowing what to say  shook her head
"it's not at all from friendship " declared nicholas  flaring up and turning away as if from a shameful aspersion
"it is not from friendship at all  i simply feel that the army is my vocation " he glanced at his cousin and the young lady visitor  and they were both regarding him with a smile of approbation
"schubert  the colonel of the pavlograd hussars  is dining with us today
he has been here on leave and is taking nicholas back with him
it can't be helped " said the count  shrugging his shoulders and speaking playfully of a matter that evidently distressed him
"i have already told you  papa " said his son  "that if you don't wish to let me go  i'll stay
but i know i am no use anywhere except in the army  i am not a diplomat or a government clerk —i don't know how to hide what i feel " as he spoke he kept glancing with the flirtatiousness of a handsome youth at sonya and the young lady visitor
the little kitten  feasting her eyes on him  seemed ready at any moment to start her gambols again and display her kittenish nature
"all right  all right " said the old count
"he always flares up  this buonaparte has turned all their heads  they all think of how he rose from an ensign and became emperor
well  well  god grant it " he added  not noticing his visitor's sarcastic smile
the elders began talking about bonaparte
julie karagina turned to young rostov
"what a pity you weren't at the arkharovs' on thursday
it was so dull without you " said she  giving him a tender smile
the young man  flattered  sat down nearer to her with a coquettish smile  and engaged the smiling julie in a confidential conversation without at all noticing that his involuntary smile had stabbed the heart of sonya  who blushed and smiled unnaturally
in the midst of his talk he glanced round at her
she gave him a passionately angry glance  and hardly able to restrain her tears and maintain the artificial smile on her lips  she got up and left the room
all nicholas' animation vanished
he waited for the first pause in the conversation  and then with a distressed face left the room to find sonya
"how plainly all these young people wear their hearts on their sleeves " said anna mikhaylovna  pointing to nicholas as he went out
"cousinage— dangereux voisinage " * she added
* cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood
"yes " said the countess when the brightness these young people had brought into the room had vanished  and as if answering a question no one had put but which was always in her mind  "and how much suffering  how much anxiety one has had to go through that we might rejoice in them now  and yet really the anxiety is greater now than the joy
one is always  always anxious  especially just at this age  so dangerous both for girls and boys " "it all depends on the bringing up " remarked the visitor
"yes  you're quite right " continued the countess
"till now i have always  thank god  been my children's friend and had their full confidence " said she  repeating the mistake of so many parents who imagine that their children have no secrets from them
"i know i shall always be my daughters' first confidante  and that if nicholas  with his impulsive nature  does get into mischief  a boy can't help it   he will all the same never be like those petersburg young men " "yes  they are splendid  splendid youngsters " chimed in the count  who always solved questions that seemed to him perplexing by deciding that everything was splendid
"just fancy  wants to be an hussar
what's one to do  my dear " "what a charming creature your younger girl is " said the visitor  "a little volcano " "yes  a regular volcano " said the count
"takes after me  and what a voice she has  though she's my daughter  i tell the truth when i say she'll be a singer  a second salomoni  we have engaged an italian to give her lessons " "isn't she too young  i have heard that it harms the voice to train it at that age " "oh no  not at all too young " replied the count "why  our mothers used to be married at twelve or thirteen " "and she's in love with boris already
just fancy " said the countess with a gentle smile  looking at boris and went on  evidently concerned with a thought that always occupied her  "now you see if i were to be severe with her and to forbid it  
goodness knows what they might be up to on the sly"  she meant that they would be kissing   "but as it is  i know every word she utters
she will come running to me of her own accord in the evening and tell me everything
perhaps i spoil her  but really that seems the best plan with her elder sister i was stricter " "yes  i was brought up quite differently " remarked the handsome elder daughter  countess vera  with a smile
but the smile did not enhance vera's beauty as smiles generally do  on the contrary it gave her an unnatural  and therefore unpleasant  expression
vera was good looking  not at all stupid  quick at learning  was well brought up  and had a pleasant voice  what she said was true and appropriate  yet  strange to say  everyone—the visitors and countess alike—turned to look at her as if wondering why she had said it  and they all felt awkward
"people are always too clever with their eldest children and try to make something exceptional of them " said the visitor
"what's the good of denying it  my dear  our dear countess was too clever with vera " said the count
"well  what of that  she's turned out splendidly all the same " he added  winking at vera
the guests got up and took their leave  promising to return to dinner
"what manners  i thought they would never go " said the countess  when she had seen her guests out
when natasha ran out of the drawing room she only went as far as the conservatory
there she paused and stood listening to the conversation in the drawing room  waiting for boris to come out
she was already growing impatient  and stamped her foot  ready to cry at his not coming at once  when she heard the young man's discreet steps approaching neither quickly nor slowly
at this natasha dashed swiftly among the flower tubs and hid there
boris paused in the middle of the room  looked round  brushed a little dust from the sleeve of his uniform  and going up to a mirror examined his handsome face
natasha  very still  peered out from her ambush  waiting to see what he would do
he stood a little while before the glass  smiled  and walked toward the other door
natasha was about to call him but changed her mind
"let him look for me " thought she
hardly had boris gone than sonya  flushed  in tears  and muttering angrily  came in at the other door
natasha checked her first impulse to run out to her  and remained in her hiding place  watching—as under an invisible cap—to see what went on in the world
she was experiencing a new and peculiar pleasure
sonya  muttering to herself  kept looking round toward the drawing room door
it opened and nicholas came in
"sonya  what is the matter with you  how can you " said he  running up to her
"it's nothing  nothing  leave me alone " sobbed sonya
"ah  i know what it is " "well  if you do  so much the better  and you can go back to her " "so o onya  look here  how can you torture me and yourself like that  for a mere fancy " said nicholas taking her hand
sonya did not pull it away  and left off crying
natasha  not stirring and scarcely breathing  watched from her ambush with sparkling eyes
"what will happen now " thought she
"sonya  what is anyone in the world to me  you alone are everything " said nicholas
"and i will prove it to you " "i don't like you to talk like that " "well  then  i won't  only forgive me  sonya " he drew her to him and kissed her
"oh  how nice " thought natasha  and when sonya and nicholas had gone out of the conservatory she followed and called boris to her
"boris  come here " said she with a sly and significant look
"i have something to tell you
here  here " and she led him into the conservatory to the place among the tubs where she had been hiding
boris followed her  smiling
"what is the something " asked he
she grew confused  glanced round  and  seeing the doll she had thrown down on one of the tubs  picked it up
"kiss the doll " said she
boris looked attentively and kindly at her eager face  but did not reply
"don't you want to  well  then  come here " said she  and went further in among the plants and threw down the doll
"closer  closer " she whispered
she caught the young officer by his cuffs  and a look of solemnity and fear appeared on her flushed face
"and me  would you like to kiss me " she whispered almost inaudibly  glancing up at him from under her brows  smiling  and almost crying from excitement
boris blushed
"how funny you are " he said  bending down to her and blushing still more  but he waited and did nothing
suddenly she jumped up onto a tub to be higher than he  embraced him so that both her slender bare arms clasped him above his neck  and  tossing back her hair  kissed him full on the lips then she slipped down among the flowerpots on the other side of the tubs and stood  hanging her head
"natasha " he said  "you know that i love you  but   " "you are in love with me " natasha broke in
"yes  i am  but please don't let us do like that   
in another four years  
then i will ask for your hand " natasha considered
"thirteen  fourteen  fifteen  sixteen " she counted on her slender little fingers
"all right  then it's settled " a smile of joy and satisfaction lit up her eager face
"settled " replied boris
"forever " said the little girl
"till death itself " she took his arm and with a happy face went with him into the adjoining sitting room
after receiving her visitors  the countess was so tired that she gave orders to admit no more  but the porter was told to be sure to invite to dinner all who came "to congratulate " the countess wished to have a tte   tte talk with the friend of her childhood  princess anna mikhaylovna  whom she had not seen properly since she returned from petersburg
anna mikhaylovna  with her tear worn but pleasant face  drew her chair nearer to that of the countess
"with you i will be quite frank " said anna mikhaylovna
"there are not many left of us old friends  that's why i so value your friendship " anna mikhaylovna looked at vera and paused
the countess pressed her friend's hand
"vera " she said to her eldest daughter who was evidently not a favorite  "how is it you have so little tact  don't you see you are not wanted here  go to the other girls  or   " the handsome vera smiled contemptuously but did not seem at all hurt
"if you had told me sooner  mamma  i would have gone " she replied as she rose to go to her own room
but as she passed the sitting room she noticed two couples sitting  one pair at each window
she stopped and smiled scornfully
sonya was sitting close to nicholas who was copying out some verses for her  the first he had ever written
boris and natasha were at the other window and ceased talking when vera entered
sonya and natasha looked at vera with guilty  happy faces
it was pleasant and touching to see these little girls in love  but apparently the sight of them roused no pleasant feeling in vera
"how often have i asked you not to take my things " she said
"you have a room of your own " and she took the inkstand from nicholas
"in a minute  in a minute " he said  dipping his pen
"you always manage to do things at the wrong time " continued vera
"you came rushing into the drawing room so that everyone felt ashamed of you " though what she said was quite just  perhaps for that very reason no one replied  and the four simply looked at one another
she lingered in the room with the inkstand in her hand
"and at your age what secrets can there be between natasha and boris  or between you two  it's all nonsense " "now  vera  what does it matter to you " said natasha in defense  speaking very gently
she seemed that day to be more than ever kind and affectionate to everyone
"very silly " said vera
"i am ashamed of you
secrets indeed " "all have secrets of their own " answered natasha  getting warmer
"we don't interfere with you and berg " "i should think not " said vera  "because there can never be anything wrong in my behavior
but i'll just tell mamma how you are behaving with boris " "natalya ilynichna behaves very well to me " remarked boris
"i have nothing to complain of " "don't  boris  you are such a diplomat that it is really tiresome " said natasha in a mortified voice that trembled slightly
 she used the word "diplomat " which was just then much in vogue among the children  in the special sense they attached to it   "why does she bother me " and she added  turning to vera  "you'll never understand it  because you've never loved anyone
you have no heart  you are a madame de genlis and nothing more"  this nickname  bestowed on vera by nicholas  was considered very stinging   "and your greatest pleasure is to be unpleasant to people  go and flirt with berg as much as you please " she finished quickly
"i shall at any rate not run after a young man before visitors   " "well  now you've done what you wanted " put in nicholas—"said unpleasant things to everyone and upset them
let's go to the nursery " all four  like a flock of scared birds  got up and left the room
"the unpleasant things were said to me " remarked vera  "i said none to anyone " "madame de genlis  madame de genlis " shouted laughing voices through the door
the handsome vera  who produced such an irritating and unpleasant effect on everyone  smiled and  evidently unmoved by what had been said to her  went to the looking glass and arranged her hair and scarf
looking at her own handsome face she seemed to become still colder and calmer
in the drawing room the conversation was still going on
"ah  my dear " said the countess  "my life is not all roses either
don't i know that at the rate we are living our means won't last long  it's all the club and his easygoing nature
even in the country do we get any rest  theatricals  hunting  and heaven knows what besides  but don't let's talk about me  tell me how you managed everything
i often wonder at you  annette—how at your age you can rush off alone in a carriage to moscow  to petersburg  to those ministers and great people  and know how to deal with them all  it's quite astonishing
how did you get things settled  i couldn't possibly do it " "ah  my love " answered anna mikhaylovna  "god grant you never know what it is to be left a widow without means and with a son you love to distraction  one learns many things then " she added with a certain pride
"that lawsuit taught me much
when i want to see one of those big people i write a note  'princess so and so desires an interview with so and so ' and then i take a cab and go myself two  three  or four times—till i get what i want
i don't mind what they think of me " "well  and to whom did you apply about bory " asked the countess
"you see yours is already an officer in the guards  while my nicholas is going as a cadet
there's no one to interest himself for him to whom did you apply " "to prince vasili
he was so kind
he at once agreed to everything  and put the matter before the emperor " said princess anna mikhaylovna enthusiastically  quite forgetting all the humiliation she had endured to gain her end
"has prince vasili aged much " asked the countess
"i have not seen him since we acted together at the rumyantsovs' theatricals
i expect he has forgotten me
he paid me attentions in those days " said the countess  with a smile
"he is just the same as ever " replied anna mikhaylovna  "overflowing with amiability
his position has not turned his head at all
he said to me  'i am sorry i can do so little for you  dear princess
i am at your command ' yes  he is a fine fellow and a very kind relation
but  nataly  you know my love for my son  i would do anything for his happiness  and my affairs are in such a bad way that my position is now a terrible one " continued anna mikhaylovna  sadly  dropping her voice
"my wretched lawsuit takes all i have and makes no progress would you believe it  i have literally not a penny and don't know how to equip boris " she took out her handkerchief and began to cry
"i need five hundred rubles  and have only one twenty five ruble note
i am in such a state   
my only hope now is in count cyril vladimirovich bezukhov
if he will not assist his godson—you know he is bory's godfather —and allow him something for his maintenance  all my trouble will have been thrown away   
i shall not be able to equip him " the countess' eyes filled with tears and she pondered in silence
"i often think  though  perhaps it's a sin " said the princess  "that here lives count cyril vladimirovich bezukhov so rich  all alone  
that tremendous fortune  
and what is his life worth  it's a burden to him  and bory's life is only just beginning    " "surely he will leave something to boris " said the countess
"heaven only knows  my dear  these rich grandees are so selfish
still  i will take boris and go to see him at once  and i shall speak to him straight out
let people think what they will of me  it's really all the same to me when my son's fate is at stake " the princess rose
"it's now two o'clock and you dine at four
there will just be time " and like a practical petersburg lady who knows how to make the most of time  anna mikhaylovna sent someone to call her son  and went into the anteroom with him
"good bye  my dear " said she to the countess who saw her to the door  and added in a whisper so that her son should not hear  "wish me good luck " "are you going to count cyril vladimirovich  my dear " said the count coming out from the dining hall into the anteroom  and he added  "if he is better  ask pierre to dine with us
he has been to the house  you know  and danced with the children
be sure to invite him  my dear
we will see how taras distinguishes himself today he says count orlov never gave such a dinner as ours will be " "my dear boris " said princess anna mikhaylovna to her son as countess rostova's carriage in which they were seated drove over the straw covered street and turned into the wide courtyard of count cyril vladimirovich bezukhov's house
"my dear boris " said the mother  drawing her hand from beneath her old mantle and laying it timidly and tenderly on her son's arm  "be affectionate and attentive to him
count cyril vladimirovich is your godfather after all  your future depends on him
remember that  my dear  and be nice to him  as you so well know how to be " "if only i knew that anything besides humiliation would come of it   " answered her son coldly
"but i have promised and will do it for your sake " although the hall porter saw someone's carriage standing at the entrance  after scrutinizing the mother and son  who without asking to be announced had passed straight through the glass porch between the rows of statues in niches  and looking significantly at the lady's old cloak  he asked whether they wanted the count or the princesses  and  hearing that they wished to see the count  said his excellency was worse today  and that his excellency was not receiving anyone
"we may as well go back " said the son in french
"my dear " exclaimed his mother imploringly  again laying her hand on his arm as if that touch might soothe or rouse him
boris said no more  but looked inquiringly at his mother without taking off his cloak
"my friend " said anna mikhaylovna in gentle tones  addressing the hall porter  "i know count cyril vladimirovich is very ill  
that's why i have come  
i am a relation
i shall not disturb him  my friend  
i only need see prince vasili sergeevich  he is staying here  is he not  please announce me " the hall porter sullenly pulled a bell that rang upstairs  and turned away
"princess drubetskaya to see prince vasili sergeevich " he called to a footman dressed in knee breeches  shoes  and a swallow tail coat  who ran downstairs and looked over from the halfway landing
the mother smoothed the folds of her dyed silk dress before a large venetian mirror in the wall  and in her trodden down shoes briskly ascended the carpeted stairs
"my dear " she said to her son  once more stimulating him by a touch  "you promised me " the son  lowering his eyes  followed her quietly
they entered the large hall  from which one of the doors led to the apartments assigned to prince vasili
just as the mother and son  having reached the middle of the hall  were about to ask their way of an elderly footman who had sprung up as they entered  the bronze handle of one of the doors turned and prince vasili came out—wearing a velvet coat with a single star on his breast  as was his custom when at home —taking leave of a good looking  dark haired man
this was the celebrated petersburg doctor  lorrain
"then it is certain " said the prince
"prince  humanum est errare  * but   " replied the doctor  swallowing his r's  and pronouncing the latin words with a french accent
* to err is human
"very well  very well   " seeing anna mikhaylovna and her son  prince vasili dismissed the doctor with a bow and approached them silently and with a look of inquiry
the son noticed that an expression of profound sorrow suddenly clouded his mother's face  and he smiled slightly
"ah  prince  in what sad circumstances we meet again  and how is our dear invalid " said she  as though unaware of the cold offensive look fixed on her prince vasili stared at her and at boris questioningly and perplexed
boris bowed politely
prince vasili without acknowledging the bow turned to anna mikhaylovna  answering her query by a movement of the head and lips indicating very little hope for the patient
"is it possible " exclaimed anna mikhaylovna
"oh  how awful  it is terrible to think   
this is my son " she added  indicating boris
"he wanted to thank you himself " boris bowed again politely "believe me  prince  a mother's heart will never forget what you have done for us " "i am glad i was able to do you a service  my dear anna mikhaylovna " said prince vasili  arranging his lace frill  and in tone and manner  here in moscow to anna mikhaylovna whom he had placed under an obligation  assuming an air of much greater importance than he had done in petersburg at anna scherer's reception
"try to serve well and show yourself worthy " added he  addressing boris with severity
"i am glad   
are you here on leave " he went on in his usual tone of indifference
"i am awaiting orders to join my new regiment  your excellency " replied boris  betraying neither annoyance at the prince's brusque manner nor a desire to enter into conversation  but speaking so quietly and respectfully that the prince gave him a searching glance
"are you living with your mother " "i am living at countess rostova's " replied boris  again adding  "your excellency " "that is  with ilya rostov who married nataly shinshina " said anna mikhaylovna
"i know  i know " answered prince vasili in his monotonous voice
"i never could understand how nataly made up her mind to marry that unlicked bear  a perfectly absurd and stupid fellow  and a gambler too  i am told " "but a very kind man  prince " said anna mikhaylovna with a pathetic smile  as though she too knew that count rostov deserved this censure  but asked him not to be too hard on the poor old man
"what do the doctors say " asked the princess after a pause  her worn face again expressing deep sorrow
"they give little hope " replied the prince
"and i should so like to thank uncle once for all his kindness to me and boris
he is his godson " she added  her tone suggesting that this fact ought to give prince vasili much satisfaction
prince vasili became thoughtful and frowned
anna mikhaylovna saw that he was afraid of finding in her a rival for count bezukhov's fortune  and hastened to reassure him
"if it were not for my sincere affection and devotion to uncle " said she  uttering the word with peculiar assurance and unconcern  "i know his character  noble  upright  
but you see he has no one with him except the young princesses   
they are still young    " she bent her head and continued in a whisper  "has he performed his final duty  prince  how priceless are those last moments  it can make things no worse  and it is absolutely necessary to prepare him if he is so ill
we women  prince " and she smiled tenderly  "always know how to say these things
i absolutely must see him  however painful it may be for me
i am used to suffering " evidently the prince understood her  and also understood  as he had done at anna pavlovna's  that it would be difficult to get rid of anna mikhaylovna
"would not such a meeting be too trying for him  dear anna mikhaylovna " said he
"let us wait until evening
the doctors are expecting a crisis " "but one cannot delay  prince  at such a moment  consider that the welfare of his soul is at stake
ah  it is awful  the duties of a christian   " a door of one of the inner rooms opened and one of the princesses  the count's niece  entered with a cold  stern face the length of her body was strikingly out of proportion to her short legs
prince vasili turned to her
"well  how is he " "still the same  but what can you expect  this noise   " said the princess  looking at anna mikhaylovna as at a stranger
"ah  my dear  i hardly knew you " said anna mikhaylovna with a happy smile  ambling lightly up to the count's niece
"i have come  and am at your service to help you nurse my uncle
i imagine what you have gone through " and she sympathetically turned up her eyes
the princess gave no reply and did not even smile  but left the room as anna mikhaylovna took off her gloves and  occupying the position she had conquered  settled down in an armchair  inviting prince vasili to take a seat beside her
"boris " she said to her son with a smile  "i shall go in to see the count  my uncle  but you  my dear  had better go to pierre meanwhile and don't forget to give him the rostovs' invitation
they ask him to dinner
i suppose he won't go " she continued  turning to the prince
"on the contrary " replied the prince  who had plainly become depressed  "i shall be only too glad if you relieve me of that young man   
here he is  and the count has not once asked for him " he shrugged his shoulders
a footman conducted boris down one flight of stairs and up another  to pierre's rooms pierre  after all  had not managed to choose a career for himself in petersburg  and had been expelled from there for riotous conduct and sent to moscow the story told about him at count rostov's was true
pierre had taken part in tying a policeman to a bear
he had now been for some days in moscow and was staying as usual at his father's house
though he expected that the story of his escapade would be already known in moscow and that the ladies about his father—who were never favorably disposed toward him—would have used it to turn the count against him  he nevertheless on the day of his arrival went to his father's part of the house
entering the drawing room  where the princesses spent most of their time  he greeted the ladies  two of whom were sitting at embroidery frames while a third read aloud
it was the eldest who was reading —the one who had met anna mikhaylovna
the two younger ones were embroidering  both were rosy and pretty and they differed only in that one had a little mole on her lip which made her much prettier
pierre was received as if he were a corpse or a leper
the eldest princess paused in her reading and silently stared at him with frightened eyes  the second assumed precisely the same expression  while the youngest  the one with the mole  who was of a cheerful and lively disposition  bent over her frame to hide a smile probably evoked by the amusing scene she foresaw
she drew her wool down through the canvas and  scarcely able to refrain from laughing  stooped as if trying to make out the pattern
"how do you do  cousin " said pierre
"you don't recognize me " "i recognize you only too well  too well " "how is the count  can i see him " asked pierre  awkwardly as usual  but unabashed
"the count is suffering physically and mentally  and apparently you have done your best to increase his mental sufferings " "can i see the count " pierre again asked
"hm   
if you wish to kill him  to kill him outright  you can see him  
olga  go and see whether uncle's beef tea is ready—it is almost time " she added  giving pierre to understand that they were busy  and busy making his father comfortable  while evidently he  pierre  was only busy causing him annoyance
olga went out
pierre stood looking at the sisters  then he bowed and said  "then i will go to my rooms you will let me know when i can see him " and he left the room  followed by the low but ringing laughter of the sister with the mole
next day prince vasili had arrived and settled in the count's house
he sent for pierre and said to him  "my dear fellow  if you are going to behave here as you did in petersburg  you will end very badly  that is all i have to say to you
the count is very  very ill  and you must not see him at all " since then pierre had not been disturbed and had spent the whole time in his rooms upstairs when boris appeared at his door pierre was pacing up and down his room  stopping occasionally at a corner to make menacing gestures at the wall  as if running a sword through an invisible foe  and glaring savagely over his spectacles  and then again resuming his walk  muttering indistinct words  shrugging his shoulders and gesticulating
"england is done for " said he  scowling and pointing his finger at someone unseen
"mr pitt  as a traitor to the nation and to the rights of man  is sentenced to   " but before pierre—who at that moment imagined himself to be napoleon in person and to have just effected the dangerous crossing of the straits of dover and captured london—could pronounce pitt's sentence  he saw a well built and handsome young officer entering his room pierre paused
he had left moscow when boris was a boy of fourteen  and had quite forgotten him  but in his usual impulsive and hearty way he took boris by the hand with a friendly smile
"do you remember me " asked boris quietly with a pleasant smile
"i have come with my mother to see the count  but it seems he is not well " "yes  it seems he is ill people are always disturbing him " answered pierre  trying to remember who this young man was
boris felt that pierre did not recognize him but did not consider it necessary to introduce himself  and without experiencing the least embarrassment looked pierre straight in the face "count rostov asks you to come to dinner today " said he  after a considerable pause which made pierre feel uncomfortable
"ah  count rostov " exclaimed pierre joyfully
"then you are his son  ilya  only fancy  i didn't know you at first
do you remember how we went to the sparrow hills with madame jacquot   
it's such an age   " "you are mistaken " said boris deliberately  with a bold and slightly sarcastic smile
"i am boris  son of princess anna mikhaylovna drubetskaya
rostov  the father  is ilya  and his son is nicholas
i never knew any madame jacquot " pierre shook his head and arms as if attacked by mosquitoes or bees "oh dear  what am i thinking about  i've mixed everything up
one has so many relatives in moscow  so you are boris  of course
well  now we know where we are
and what do you think of the boulogne expedition  the english will come off badly  you know  if napoleon gets across the channel
i think the expedition is quite feasible
if only villeneuve doesn't make a mess of things " boris knew nothing about the boulogne expedition  he did not read the papers and it was the first time he had heard villeneuve's name
"we here in moscow are more occupied with dinner parties and scandal than with politics " said he in his quiet ironical tone
"i know nothing about it and have not thought about it
moscow is chiefly busy with gossip " he continued
"just now they are talking about you and your father " pierre smiled in his good natured way as if afraid for his companion's sake that the latter might say something he would afterwards regret
but boris spoke distinctly  clearly  and dryly  looking straight into pierre's eyes
"moscow has nothing else to do but gossip " boris went on
"everybody is wondering to whom the count will leave his fortune  though he may perhaps outlive us all  as i sincerely hope he will   " "yes  it is all very horrid " interrupted pierre  "very horrid " pierre was still afraid that this officer might inadvertently say something disconcerting to himself "and it must seem to you " said boris flushing slightly  but not changing his tone or attitude  "it must seem to you that everyone is trying to get something out of the rich man " "so it does " thought pierre
"but i just wish to say  to avoid misunderstandings  that you are quite mistaken if you reckon me or my mother among such people
we are very poor  but for my own part at any rate  for the very reason that your father is rich  i don't regard myself as a relation of his  and neither i nor my mother would ever ask or take anything from him " for a long time pierre could not understand  but when he did  he jumped up from the sofa  seized boris under the elbow in his quick  clumsy way  and  blushing far more than boris  began to speak with a feeling of mingled shame and vexation "well  this is strange  do you suppose i  
who could think   
i know very well   " but boris again interrupted him
"i am glad i have spoken out fully
perhaps you did not like it  you must excuse me " said he  putting pierre at ease instead of being put at ease by him  "but i hope i have not offended you
i always make it a rule to speak out  
well  what answer am i to take  will you come to dinner at the rostovs' " and boris  having apparently relieved himself of an onerous duty and extricated himself from an awkward situation and placed another in it  became quite pleasant again "no  but i say " said pierre  calming down  "you are a wonderful fellow  what you have just said is good  very good
of course you don't know me
we have not met for such a long time  
not since we were children
you might think that i  
i understand  quite understand
i could not have done it myself  i should not have had the courage  but it's splendid
i am very glad to have made your acquaintance
it's queer " he added after a pause  "that you should have suspected me " he began to laugh
"well  what of it  i hope we'll get better acquainted " and he pressed boris' hand
"do you know  i have not once been in to see the count
he has not sent for me   
i am sorry for him as a man  but what can one do " "and so you think napoleon will manage to get an army across " asked boris with a smile
pierre saw that boris wished to change the subject  and being of the same mind he began explaining the advantages and disadvantages of the boulogne expedition
a footman came in to summon boris—the princess was going
pierre  in order to make boris' better acquaintance  promised to come to dinner  and warmly pressing his hand looked affectionately over his spectacles into boris' eyes
after he had gone pierre continued pacing up and down the room for a long time  no longer piercing an imaginary foe with his imaginary sword  but smiling at the remembrance of that pleasant  intelligent  and resolute young man
as often happens in early youth  especially to one who leads a lonely life  he felt an unaccountable tenderness for this young man and made up his mind that they would be friends
prince vasili saw the princess off
she held a handkerchief to her eyes and her face was tearful
"it is dreadful  dreadful " she was saying  "but cost me what it may i shall do my duty
i will come and spend the night
he must not be left like this
every moment is precious
i can't think why his nieces put it off
perhaps god will help me to find a way to prepare him   
adieu  prince  may god support you   " "adieu  ma bonne " answered prince vasili turning away from her
"oh  he is in a dreadful state " said the mother to her son when they were in the carriage
"he hardly recognizes anybody " "i don't understand  mamma—what is his attitude to pierre " asked the son
"the will will show that  my dear  our fate also depends on it " "but why do you expect that he will leave us anything " "ah  my dear  he is so rich  and we are so poor " "well  that is hardly a sufficient reason  mamma   " "oh  heaven  how ill he is " exclaimed the mother
after anna mikhaylovna had driven off with her son to visit count cyril vladimirovich bezukhov  countess rostova sat for a long time all alone applying her handkerchief to her eyes
at last she rang
"what is the matter with you  my dear " she said crossly to the maid who kept her waiting some minutes
"don't you wish to serve me  then i'll find you another place " the countess was upset by her friend's sorrow and humiliating poverty  and was therefore out of sorts  a state of mind which with her always found expression in calling her maid "my dear" and speaking to her with exaggerated politeness
"i am very sorry  ma'am " answered the maid
"ask the count to come to me " the count came waddling in to see his wife with a rather guilty look as usual
"well  little countess  what a saute of game au madere we are to have  my dear  i tasted it
the thousand rubles i paid for taras were not ill spent
he is worth it " he sat down by his wife  his elbows on his knees and his hands ruffling his gray hair
"what are your commands  little countess " "you see  my dear  
what's that mess " she said  pointing to his waistcoat
"it's the saute  most likely " she added with a smile
"well  you see  count  i want some money " her face became sad
"i want a great deal  count  i want five hundred rubles " and taking out her cambric handkerchief she began wiping her husband's waistcoat
"yes  immediately  immediately  hey  who's there " he called out in a tone only used by persons who are certain that those they call will rush to obey the summons
"send dmitri to me " dmitri  a man of good family who had been brought up in the count's house and now managed all his affairs  stepped softly into the room
"this is what i want  my dear fellow " said the count to the deferential young man who had entered
"bring me   " he reflected a moment  "yes  bring me seven hundred rubles  yes  but mind  don't bring me such tattered and dirty notes as last time  but nice clean ones for the countess " "yes  dmitri  clean ones  please " said the countess  sighing deeply
"when would you like them  your excellency " asked dmitri
"allow me to inform you  
but  don't be uneasy " he added  noticing that the count was beginning to breathe heavily and quickly which was always a sign of approaching anger
"i was forgetting  
do you wish it brought at once " "yes  yes  just so  bring it
give it to the countess " "what a treasure that dmitri is " added the count with a smile when the young man had departed
"there is never any 'impossible' with him
that's a thing i hate  everything is possible " "ah  money  count  money  how much sorrow it causes in the world " said the countess
"but i am in great need of this sum " "you  my little countess  are a notorious spendthrift " said the count  and having kissed his wife's hand he went back to his study
when anna mikhaylovna returned from count bezukhov's the money  all in clean notes  was lying ready under a handkerchief on the countess' little table  and anna mikhaylovna noticed that something was agitating her
"well  my dear " asked the countess
"oh  what a terrible state he is in  one would not know him  he is so ill  i was only there a few moments and hardly said a word   " "annette  for heaven's sake don't refuse me " the countess began  with a blush that looked very strange on her thin  dignified  elderly face  and she took the money from under the handkerchief
anna mikhaylovna instantly guessed her intention and stooped to be ready to embrace the countess at the appropriate moment
"this is for boris from me  for his outfit " anna mikhaylovna was already embracing her and weeping
the countess wept too
they wept because they were friends  and because they were kindhearted  and because they—friends from childhood—had to think about such a base thing as money  and because their youth was over   
but those tears were pleasant to them both
countess rostova  with her daughters and a large number of guests  was already seated in the drawing room
the count took the gentlemen into his study and showed them his choice collection of turkish pipes
from time to time he went out to ask  "hasn't she come yet " they were expecting marya dmitrievna akhrosimova  known in society as le terrible dragon  a lady distinguished not for wealth or rank  but for common sense and frank plainness of speech
marya dmitrievna was known to the imperial family as well as to all moscow and petersburg  and both cities wondered at her  laughed privately at her rudenesses  and told good stories about her  while none the less all without exception respected and feared her
in the count's room  which was full of tobacco smoke  they talked of war that had been announced in a manifesto  and about the recruiting
none of them had yet seen the manifesto  but they all knew it had appeared
the count sat on the sofa between two guests who were smoking and talking
he neither smoked nor talked  but bending his head first to one side and then to the other watched the smokers with evident pleasure and listened to the conversation of his two neighbors  whom he egged on against each other
one of them was a sallow  clean shaven civilian with a thin and wrinkled face  already growing old  though he was dressed like a most fashionable young man
he sat with his legs up on the sofa as if quite at home and  having stuck an amber mouthpiece far into his mouth  was inhaling the smoke spasmodically and screwing up his eyes
this was an old bachelor  shinshin  a cousin of the countess'  a man with "a sharp tongue" as they said in moscow society
he seemed to be condescending to his companion
the latter  a fresh  rosy officer of the guards  irreproachably washed  brushed  and buttoned  held his pipe in the middle of his mouth and with red lips gently inhaled the smoke  letting it escape from his handsome mouth in rings
this was lieutenant berg  an officer in the semenov regiment with whom boris was to travel to join the army  and about whom natasha had teased her elder sister vera  speaking of berg as her "intended " the count sat between them and listened attentively
his favorite occupation when not playing boston  a card game he was very fond of  was that of listener  especially when he succeeded in setting two loquacious talkers at one another
"well  then  old chap  mon tres honorable alphonse karlovich " said shinshin  laughing ironically and mixing the most ordinary russian expressions with the choicest french phrases—which was a peculiarity of his speech
"vous comptez vous faire des rentes sur l'etat  * you want to make something out of your company " * you expect to make an income out of the government
"no  peter nikolaevich  i only want to show that in the cavalry the advantages are far less than in the infantry
just consider my own position now  peter nikolaevich   " berg always spoke quietly  politely  and with great precision
his conversation always related entirely to himself  he would remain calm and silent when the talk related to any topic that had no direct bearing on himself he could remain silent for hours without being at all put out of countenance himself or making others uncomfortable  but as soon as the conversation concerned himself he would begin to talk circumstantially and with evident satisfaction "consider my position  peter nikolaevich
were i in the cavalry i should get not more than two hundred rubles every four months  even with the rank of lieutenant  but as it is i receive two hundred and thirty " said he  looking at shinshin and the count with a joyful  pleasant smile  as if it were obvious to him that his success must always be the chief desire of everyone else
"besides that  peter nikolaevich  by exchanging into the guards i shall be in a more prominent position " continued berg  "and vacancies occur much more frequently in the foot guards
then just think what can be done with two hundred and thirty rubles  i even manage to put a little aside and to send something to my father " he went on  emitting a smoke ring
"la balance y est  
* a german knows how to skin a flint  as the proverb says " remarked shinshin  moving his pipe to the other side of his mouth and winking at the count
* so that squares matters
the count burst out laughing
the other guests seeing that shinshin was talking came up to listen
berg  oblivious of irony or indifference  continued to explain how by exchanging into the guards he had already gained a step on his old comrades of the cadet corps  how in wartime the company commander might get killed and he  as senior in the company  might easily succeed to the post  how popular he was with everyone in the regiment  and how satisfied his father was with him berg evidently enjoyed narrating all this  and did not seem to suspect that others  too  might have their own interests
but all he said was so prettily sedate  and the naivete of his youthful egotism was so obvious  that he disarmed his hearers
"well  my boy  you'll get along wherever you go—foot or horse—that i'll warrant " said shinshin  patting him on the shoulder and taking his feet off the sofa
berg smiled joyously
the count  by his guests  went into the drawing room
it was just the moment before a big dinner when the assembled guests  expecting the summons to zakuska  * avoid engaging in any long conversation but think it necessary to move about and talk  in order to show that they are not at all impatient for their food
the host and hostess look toward the door  and now and then glance at one another  and the visitors try to guess from these glances who  or what  they are waiting for—some important relation who has not yet arrived  or a dish that is not yet ready
* hors d'oeuvres
pierre had come just at dinnertime and was sitting awkwardly in the middle of the drawing room on the first chair he had come across  blocking the way for everyone
the countess tried to make him talk  but he went on naively looking around through his spectacles as if in search of somebody and answered all her questions in monosyllables
he was in the way and was the only one who did not notice the fact
most of the guests  knowing of the affair with the bear  looked with curiosity at this big  stout  quiet man  wondering how such a clumsy  modest fellow could have played such a prank on a policeman "you have only lately arrived " the countess asked him
"oui  madame " replied he  looking around him
"you have not yet seen my husband " "non  madame " he smiled quite inappropriately
"you have been in paris recently  i believe  i suppose it's very interesting " "very interesting " the countess exchanged glances with anna mikhaylovna
the latter understood that she was being asked to entertain this young man  and sitting down beside him she began to speak about his father  but he answered her  as he had the countess  only in monosyllables
the other guests were all conversing with one another
"the razumovskis  
it was charming  
you are very kind  
countess apraksina   " was heard on all sides
the countess rose and went into the ballroom
"marya dmitrievna " came her voice from there
"herself " came the answer in a rough voice  and marya dmitrievna entered the room
all the unmarried ladies and even the married ones except the very oldest rose
marya dmitrievna paused at the door
tall and stout  holding high her fiftyyear old head with its gray curls  she stood surveying the guests  and leisurely arranged her wide sleeves as if rolling them up
marya dmitrievna always spoke in russian
"health and happiness to her whose name day we are keeping and to her children " she said  in her loud  full toned voice which drowned all others
"well  you old sinner " she went on  turning to the count who was kissing her hand  "you're feeling dull in moscow  i daresay  nowhere to hunt with your dogs  but what is to be done  old man  just see how these nestlings are growing up " and she pointed to the girls
"you must look for husbands for them whether you like it or not    " "well " said she  "how's my cossack "  marya dmitrievna always called natasha a cossack  and she stroked the child's arm as she came up fearless and gay to kiss her hand
"i know she's a scamp of a girl  but i like her " she took a pair of pear shaped ruby earrings from her huge reticule and  having given them to the rosy natasha  who beamed with the pleasure of her saint's day fete  turned away at once and addressed herself to pierre
"eh  eh  friend  come here a bit " said she  assuming a soft high tone of voice
"come here  my friend   " and she ominously tucked up her sleeves still higher
pierre approached  looking at her in a childlike way through his spectacles
"come nearer  come nearer  friend  i used to be the only one to tell your father the truth when he was in favor  and in your case it's my evident duty " she paused
all were silent  expectant of what was to follow  for this was clearly only a prelude
"a fine lad  my word  a fine lad   
his father lies on his deathbed and he amuses himself setting a policeman astride a bear  for shame  sir  for shame  it would be better if you went to the war " she turned away and gave her hand to the count  who could hardly keep from laughing "well  i suppose it is time we were at table " said marya dmitrievna
the count went in first with marya dmitrievna  the countess followed on the arm of a colonel of hussars  a man of importance to them because nicholas was to go with him to the regiment  then came anna mikhaylovna with shinshin
berg gave his arm to vera
the smiling julie karagina went in with nicholas
after them other couples followed  filling the whole dining hall  and last of all the children  tutors  and governesses followed singly
the footmen began moving about  chairs scraped  the band struck up in the gallery  and the guests settled down in their places
then the strains of the count's household band were replaced by the clatter of knives and forks  the voices of visitors  and the soft steps of the footmen
at one end of the table sat the countess with marya dmitrievna on her right and anna mikhaylovna on her left  the other lady visitors were farther down
at the other end sat the count  with the hussar colonel on his left and shinshin and the other male visitors on his right
midway down the long table on one side sat the grownup young people  vera beside berg  and pierre beside boris  and on the other side  the children  tutors  and governesses
from behind the crystal decanters and fruit vases  the count kept glancing at his wife and her tall cap with its light blue ribbons  and busily filled his neighbors' glasses  not neglecting his own
the countess in turn  without omitting her duties as hostess  threw significant glances from behind the pineapples at her husband whose face and bald head seemed by their redness to contrast more than usual with his gray hair
at the ladies' end an even chatter of voices was heard all the time  at the men's end the voices sounded louder and louder  especially that of the colonel of hussars who  growing more and more flushed  ate and drank so much that the count held him up as a pattern to the other guests
berg with tender smiles was saying to vera that love is not an earthly but a heavenly feeling
boris was telling his new friend pierre who the guests were and exchanging glances with natasha  who was sitting opposite
pierre spoke little but examined the new faces  and ate a great deal
of the two soups he chose turtle with savory patties and went on to the game without omitting a single dish or one of the wines
these latter the butler thrust mysteriously forward  wrapped in a napkin  from behind the next man's shoulders and whispered  "dry madeira"  
"hungarian"  
or "rhine wine" as the case might be
of the four crystal glasses engraved with the count's monogram that stood before his plate  pierre held out one at random and drank with enjoyment  gazing with ever increasing amiability at the other guests
natasha  who sat opposite  was looking at boris as girls of thirteen look at the boy they are in love with and have just kissed for the first time
sometimes that same look fell on pierre  and that funny lively little girl's look made him inclined to laugh without knowing why
nicholas sat at some distance from sonya  beside julie karagina  to whom he was again talking with the same involuntary smile
sonya wore a company smile but was evidently tormented by jealousy  now she turned pale  now blushed and strained every nerve to overhear what nicholas and julie were saying to one another
the governess kept looking round uneasily as if preparing to resent any slight that might be put upon the children
the german tutor was trying to remember all the dishes  wines  and kinds of dessert  in order to send a full description of the dinner to his people in germany  and he felt greatly offended when the butler with a bottle wrapped in a napkin passed him by
he frowned  trying to appear as if he did not want any of that wine  but was mortified because no one would understand that it was not to quench his thirst or from greediness that he wanted it  but simply from a conscientious desire for knowledge
at the men's end of the table the talk grew more and more animated
the colonel told them that the declaration of war had already appeared in petersburg and that a copy  which he had himself seen  had that day been forwarded by courier to the commander in chief "and why the deuce are we going to fight bonaparte " remarked shinshin
"he has stopped austria's cackle and i fear it will be our turn next " the colonel was a stout  tall  plethoric german  evidently devoted to the service and patriotically russian
he resented shinshin's remark
"it is for the reasson  my goot sir " said he  speaking with a german accent  "for the reasson zat ze emperor knows zat
he declares in ze manifessto zat he cannot fiew wiz indifference ze danger vreatening russia and zat ze safety and dignity of ze empire as vell as ze sanctity of its alliances   " he spoke this last word with particular emphasis as if in it lay the gist of the matter
then with the unerring official memory that characterized him he repeated from the opening words of the manifesto    
and the wish  which constitutes the emperor's sole and absolute aim—to establish peace in europe on firm foundations—has now decided him to despatch part of the army abroad and to create a new condition for the attainment of that purpose
"zat  my dear sir  is vy   " he concluded  drinking a tumbler of wine with dignity and looking to the count for approval
"connaissez vous le proverbe  * 'jerome  jerome  do not roam  but turn spindles at home ' " said shinshin  puckering his brows and smiling
"cela nous convient a merveille * 2  suvorov now—he knew what he was about  yet they beat him a plate couture * 3  and where are we to find suvorovs now  je vous demande un peu "* 4  said he  continually changing from french to russian
*do you know the proverb  * 2  that suits us down to the ground
* 3  hollow
* 4  i just ask you that
"ve must vight to the last tr r op of our plood " said the colonel  thumping the table  "and ve must tie for our emperor  and zen all vill pe vell
and ve must discuss it as little as po o ossible"  
he dwelt particularly on the word possible  
"as po o ossible " he ended  again turning to the count
"zat is how ve old hussars look at it  and zere's an end of it  and how do you  a young man and a young hussar  how do you judge of it " he added  addressing nicholas  who when he heard that the war was being discussed had turned from his partner with eyes and ears intent on the colonel
"i am quite of your opinion " replied nicholas  flaming up  turning his plate round and moving his wineglasses about with as much decision and desperation as though he were at that moment facing some great danger
"i am convinced that we russians must die or conquer " he concluded  conscious— as were others—after the words were uttered that his remarks were too enthusiastic and emphatic for the occasion and were therefore awkward
"what you said just now was splendid " said his partner julie
sonya trembled all over and blushed to her ears and behind them and down to her neck and shoulders while nicholas was speaking
pierre listened to the colonel's speech and nodded approvingly
"that's fine " said he
"the young man's a real hussar " shouted the colonel  again thumping the table
"what are you making such a noise about over there " marya dmitrievna's deep voice suddenly inquired from the other end of the table
"what are you thumping the table for " she demanded of the hussar  "and why are you exciting yourself  do you think the french are here " "i am speaking ze truce " replied the hussar with a smile
"it's all about the war " the count shouted down the table
"you know my son's going  marya dmitrievna  my son is going " "i have four sons in the army but still i don't fret
it is all in god's hands
you may die in your bed or god may spare you in a battle " replied marya dmitrievna's deep voice  which easily carried the whole length of the table
"that's true " once more the conversations concentrated  the ladies' at the one end and the men's at the other
"you won't ask " natasha's little brother was saying  "i know you won't ask " "i will " replied natasha
her face suddenly flushed with reckless and joyous resolution
she half rose  by a glance inviting pierre  who sat opposite  to listen to what was coming  and turning to her mother  "mamma " rang out the clear contralto notes of her childish voice  audible the whole length of the table
"what is it " asked the countess  startled  but seeing by her daughter's face that it was only mischief  she shook a finger at her sternly with a threatening and forbidding movement of her head
the conversation was hushed
"mamma  what sweets are we going to have " and natasha's voice sounded still more firm and resolute
the countess tried to frown  but could not
marya dmitrievna shook her fat finger
"cossack " she said threateningly
most of the guests  uncertain how to regard this sally  looked at the elders
"you had better take care " said the countess
"mamma  what sweets are we going to have " natasha again cried boldly  with saucy gaiety  confident that her prank would be taken in good part
sonya and fat little petya doubled up with laughter
"you see  i have asked " whispered natasha to her little brother and to pierre  glancing at him again
"ice pudding  but you won't get any " said marya dmitrievna
natasha saw there was nothing to be afraid of and so she braved even marya dmitrievna
"marya dmitrievna  what kind of ice pudding  i don't like ice cream " "carrot ices " "no  what kind  marya dmitrievna  what kind " she almost screamed  "i want to know " marya dmitrievna and the countess burst out laughing  and all the guests joined in
everyone laughed  not at marya dmitrievna's answer but at the incredible boldness and smartness of this little girl who had dared to treat marya dmitrievna in this fashion
natasha only desisted when she had been told that there would be pineapple ice
before the ices  champagne was served round
the band again struck up  the count and countess kissed  and the guests  leaving their seats  went up to "congratulate" the countess  and reached across the table to clink glasses with the count  with the children  and with one another
again the footmen rushed about  chairs scraped  and in the same order in which they had entered but with redder faces  the guests returned to the drawing room and to the count's study
the card tables were drawn out  sets made up for boston  and the count's visitors settled themselves  some in the two drawing rooms  some in the sitting room  some in the library the count  holding his cards fanwise  kept himself with difficulty from dropping into his usual after dinner nap  and laughed at everything the young people  at the countess' instigation  gathered round the clavichord and harp
julie by general request played first
after she had played a little air with variations on the harp  she joined the other young ladies in begging natasha and nicholas  who were noted for their musical talent  to sing something
natasha  who was treated as though she were grown up  was evidently very proud of this but at the same time felt shy
"what shall we sing " she said
"'the brook '" suggested nicholas
"well  then  let's be quick
boris  come here " said natasha
"but where is sonya " she looked round and seeing that her friend was not in the room ran to look for her
running into sonya's room and not finding her there  natasha ran to the nursery  but sonya was not there either
natasha concluded that she must be on the chest in the passage
the chest in the passage was the place of mourning for the younger female generation in the rostov household
and there in fact was sonya lying face downward on nurse's dirty feather bed on the top of the chest  crumpling her gauzy pink dress under her  hiding her face with her slender fingers  and sobbing so convulsively that her bare little shoulders shook
natasha's face  which had been so radiantly happy all that saint's day  suddenly changed  her eyes became fixed  and then a shiver passed down her broad neck and the corners of her mouth drooped
"sonya  what is it  what is the matter   
oo  
oo  
oo    " and natasha's large mouth widened  making her look quite ugly  and she began to wail like a baby without knowing why  except that sonya was crying
sonya tried to lift her head to answer but could not  and hid her face still deeper in the bed
natasha wept  sitting on the blue striped feather bed and hugging her friend
with an effort sonya sat up and began wiping her eyes and explaining
"nicholas is going away in a week's time  his  
papers  
have come  
he told me himself   but still i should not cry " and she showed a paper she held in her hand—with the verses nicholas had written  "still  i should not cry  but you can't  
no one can understand  
what a soul he has " and she began to cry again because he had such a noble soul
"it's all very well for you  
i am not envious  
i love you and boris also " she went on  gaining a little strength  "he is nice  
there are no difficulties in your way   
but nicholas is my cousin  
one would have to  
the metropolitan himself   and even then it can't be done
and besides  if she tells mamma"  sonya looked upon the countess as her mother and called her so  "that i am spoiling nicholas' career and am heartless and ungrateful  while truly  
god is my witness " and she made the sign of the cross  "i love her so much  and all of you  only vera  
and what for  what have i done to her  i am so grateful to you that i would willingly sacrifice everything  only i have nothing    " sonya could not continue  and again hid her face in her hands and in the feather bed
natasha began consoling her  but her face showed that she understood all the gravity of her friend's trouble
"sonya " she suddenly exclaimed  as if she had guessed the true reason of her friend's sorrow  "i'm sure vera has said something to you since dinner  hasn't she " "yes  these verses nicholas wrote himself and i copied some others  and she found them on my table and said she'd show them to mamma  and that i was ungrateful  and that mamma would never allow him to marry me  but that he'll marry julie you see how he's been with her all day  
natasha  what have i done to deserve it    " and again she began to sob  more bitterly than before
natasha lifted her up  hugged her  and  smiling through her tears  began comforting her
"sonya  don't believe her  darling  don't believe her  do you remember how we and nicholas  all three of us  talked in the sitting room after supper  why  we settled how everything was to be
i don't quite remember how  but don't you remember that it could all be arranged and how nice it all was  there's uncle shinshin's brother has married his first cousin
and we are only second cousins  you know
and boris says it is quite possible
you know i have told him all about it
and he is so clever and so good " said natasha
"don't you cry  sonya  dear love  darling sonya " and she kissed her and laughed
"vera's spiteful  never mind her  and all will come right and she won't say anything to mamma
nicholas will tell her himself  and he doesn't care at all for julie " natasha kissed her on the hair sonya sat up
the little kitten brightened  its eyes shone  and it seemed ready to lift its tail  jump down on its soft paws  and begin playing with the ball of worsted as a kitten should
"do you think so   
really  truly " she said  quickly smoothing her frock and hair
"really  truly " answered natasha  pushing in a crisp lock that had strayed from under her friend's plaits
both laughed
"well  let's go and sing 'the brook '" "come along " "do you know  that fat pierre who sat opposite me is so funny " said natasha  stopping suddenly
"i feel so happy " and she set off at a run along the passage
sonya  shaking off some down which clung to her and tucking away the verses in the bosom of her dress close to her bony little chest  ran after natasha down the passage into the sitting room with flushed face and light  joyous steps
at the visitors' request the young people sang the quartette  "the brook " with which everyone was delighted
then nicholas sang a song he had just learned  at nighttime in the moon's fair glow how sweet  as fancies wander free  to feel that in this world there's one who still is thinking but of thee  that while her fingers touch the harp wafting sweet music o'er the lea  it is for thee thus swells her heart  sighing its message out to thee  
a day or two  then bliss unspoilt  but oh  till then i cannot live   
he had not finished the last verse before the young people began to get ready to dance in the large hall  and the sound of the feet and the coughing of the musicians were heard from the gallery
pierre was sitting in the drawing room where shinshin had engaged him  as a man recently returned from abroad  in a political conversation in which several others joined but which bored pierre
when the music began natasha came in and walking straight up to pierre said  laughing and blushing  "mamma told me to ask you to join the dancers " "i am afraid of mixing the figures " pierre replied  "but if you will be my teacher   " and lowering his big arm he offered it to the slender little girl
while the couples were arranging themselves and the musicians tuning up  pierre sat down with his little partner natasha was perfectly happy  she was dancing with a grown up man  who had been abroad
she was sitting in a conspicuous place and talking to him like a grown up lady
she had a fan in her hand that one of the ladies had given her to hold
assuming quite the pose of a society woman  heaven knows when and where she had learned it  she talked with her partner  fanning herself and smiling over the fan
"dear  dear  just look at her " exclaimed the countess as she crossed the ballroom  pointing to natasha
natasha blushed and laughed
"well  really  mamma  why should you  what is there to be surprised at " in the midst of the third ecossaise there was a clatter of chairs being pushed back in the sitting room where the count and marya dmitrievna had been playing cards with the majority of the more distinguished and older visitors
they now  stretching themselves after sitting so long  and replacing their and the count  both with merry countenances the count  with playful ceremony somewhat in ballet style  offered his bent arm to marya dmitrievna he drew himself up  a smile of debonair gallantry lit up his face and as soon as the last figure of the ecossaise was ended  he clapped his hands to the musicians and shouted up to their gallery  addressing the first violin  "semen  do you know the daniel cooper " this was the count's favorite dance  which he had danced in his youth  strictly speaking  daniel cooper was one figure of the anglaise   "look at papa " shouted natasha to the whole company  and quite forgetting that she was dancing with a grown up partner she bent her curly head to her knees and made the whole room ring with her laughter
and indeed everybody in the room looked with a smile of pleasure at the jovial old gentleman  who standing beside his tall and stout partner  marya dmitrievna  curved his arms  beat time  straightened his shoulders  turned out his toes  tapped gently with his foot  and  by a smile that broadened his round face more and more  prepared the onlookers for what was to follow as soon as the provocatively gay strains of daniel cooper  somewhat resembling those of a merry peasant dance  began to sound  all the doorways of the ballroom were suddenly filled by the domestic serfs—the men on one side and the women on the other—who with beaming faces had come to see their master making merry
"just look at the master  a regular eagle he is " loudly remarked the nurse  as she stood in one of the doorways
the count danced well and knew it
but his partner could not and did not want to dance well
her enormous figure stood erect  her powerful arms hanging down  she had handed her reticule to the countess   and only her stern but handsome face really joined in the dance what was expressed by the whole of the count's plump figure  in marya dmitrievna found expression only in her more and more beaming face and quivering nose
but if the count  getting more and more into the swing of it  charmed the spectators by the unexpectedness of his adroit maneuvers and the agility with which he capered about on his light feet  marya dmitrievna produced no less impression by slight exertions—the least effort to move her shoulders or bend her arms when turning  or stamp her foot—which everyone appreciated in view of her size and habitual severity the dance grew livelier and livelier
the other couples could not attract a moment's attention to their own evolutions and did not even try to do so
all were watching the count and marya dmitrievna
natasha kept pulling everyone by sleeve or dress  urging them to "look at papa " though as it was they never took their eyes off the couple
in the intervals of the dance the count  breathing deeply  waved and shouted to the musicians to play faster
faster  faster  and faster  lightly  more lightly  and yet more lightly whirled the count  flying round marya dmitrievna  now on his toes  now on his heels  until  turning his partner round to her seat  he executed the final pas  raising his soft foot backwards  bowing his perspiring head  smiling and making a wide sweep with his arm  amid a thunder of applause and laughter led by natasha
both partners stood still  breathing heavily and wiping their faces with their cambric handkerchiefs
"that's how we used to dance in our time  ma chere " said the count
"that was a daniel cooper " exclaimed marya dmitrievna  tucking up her sleeves and puffing heavily
while in the rostovs' ballroom the sixth anglaise was being danced  to a tune in which the weary musicians blundered  and while tired footmen and cooks were getting the supper  count bezukhov had a sixth stroke
the doctors pronounced recovery impossible
after a mute confession  communion was administered to the dying man  preparations made for the sacrament of unction  and in his house there was the bustle and thrill of suspense usual at such moments
outside the house  beyond the gates  a group of undertakers  who hid whenever a carriage drove up  waited in expectation of an important order for an expensive funeral
the military governor of moscow  who had been assiduous in sending aides de camp to inquire after the count's health  came himself that evening to bid a last farewell to the celebrated grandee of catherine's court  count bezukhov the magnificent reception room was crowded
everyone stood up respectfully when the military governor  having stayed about half an hour alone with the dying man  passed out  slightly acknowledging their bows and trying to escape as quickly as possible from the glances fixed on him by the doctors  clergy  and relatives of the family
prince vasili  who had grown thinner and paler during the last few days  escorted him to the door  repeating something to him several times in low tones
when the military governor had gone  prince vasili sat down all alone on a chair in the ballroom  crossing one leg high over the other  leaning his elbow on his knee and covering his face with his hand
after sitting so for a while he rose  and  looking about him with frightened eyes  went with unusually hurried steps down the long corridor leading to the back of the house  to the room of the eldest princess
those who were in the dimly lit reception room spoke in nervous whispers  and  whenever anyone went into or came from the dying man's room  grew silent and gazed with eyes full of curiosity or expectancy at his door  which creaked slightly when opened
"the limits of human life  
are fixed and may not be o'erpassed " said an old priest to a lady who had taken a seat beside him and was listening naively to his words
"i wonder  is it not too late to administer unction " asked the lady  adding the priest's clerical title  as if she had no opinion of her own on the subject
"ah  madam  it is a great sacrament " replied the priest  passing his hand over the thin grizzled strands of hair combed back across his bald head
"who was that  the military governor himself " was being asked at the other side of the room "how young looking he is " "yes  and he is over sixty
i hear the count no longer recognizes anyone
they wished to administer the sacrament of unction " "i knew someone who received that sacrament seven times " the second princess had just come from the sickroom with her eyes red from weeping and sat down beside dr
lorrain  who was sitting in a graceful pose under a portrait of catherine  leaning his elbow on a table
"beautiful " said the doctor in answer to a remark about the weather
"the weather is beautiful  princess  and besides  in moscow one feels as if one were in the country " "yes  indeed " replied the princess with a sigh
"so he may have something to drink " lorrain considered
"has he taken his medicine " "yes " the doctor glanced at his watch
"take a glass of boiled water and put a pinch of cream of tartar " and he indicated with his delicate fingers what he meant by a pinch
"dere has neffer been a gase " a german doctor was saying to an aide decamp  "dat one liffs after de sird stroke " "and what a well preserved man he was " remarked the aide de camp
"and who will inherit his wealth " he added in a whisper
"it von't go begging " replied the german with a smile
everyone again looked toward the door  which creaked as the second princess went in with the drink she had prepared according to lorrain's instructions
the german doctor went up to lorrain
"do you think he can last till morning " asked the german  addressing lorrain in french which he pronounced badly
lorrain  pursing up his lips  waved a severely negative finger before his nose
"tonight  not later " said he in a low voice  and he moved away with a decorous smile of self satisfaction at being able clearly to understand and state the patient's condition
meanwhile prince vasili had opened the door into the princess' room
in this room it was almost dark  only two tiny lamps were burning before the icons and there was a pleasant scent of flowers and burnt pastilles
the room was crowded with small pieces of furniture  whatnots  cupboards  and little tables
the quilt of a high  white feather bed was just visible behind a screen
a small dog began to bark
"ah  is it you  cousin " she rose and smoothed her hair  which was as usual so extremely smooth that it seemed to be made of one piece with her head and covered with varnish
"has anything happened " she asked
"i am so terrified " "no  there is no change
i only came to have a talk about business  catiche " * muttered the prince  seating himself wearily on the chair she had just vacated "you have made the place warm  i must say " he remarked
"well  sit down  let's have a talk " *catherine
"i thought perhaps something had happened " she said with her unchanging stonily severe expression  and  sitting down opposite the prince  she prepared to listen
"i wished to get a nap  mon cousin  but i can't " "well  my dear " said prince vasili  taking her hand and bending it downwards as was his habit
it was plain that this "well " referred to much that they both understood without naming
the princess  who had a straight  rigid body  abnormally long for her legs  looked directly at prince vasili with no sign of emotion in her prominent gray eyes
then she shook her head and glanced up at the icons with a sigh
this might have been taken as an expression of sorrow and devotion  or of weariness and hope of resting before long
prince vasili understood it as an expression of weariness
"and i " he said  "do you think it is easier for me  i am as worn out as a post horse  but still i must have a talk with you  catiche  a very serious talk " prince vasili said no more and his cheeks began to twitch nervously  now on one side  now on the other  giving his face an unpleasant expression which was never to be seen on it in a drawing room
his eyes too seemed strange  at one moment they looked impudently sly and at the next glanced round in alarm
the princess  holding her little dog on her lap with her thin bony hands  looked attentively into prince vasili's eyes evidently resolved not to be the first to break silence  if she had to wait till morning
"well  you see  my dear princess and cousin  catherine semenovna " continued prince vasili  returning to his theme  apparently not without an inner struggle  "at such a moment as this one must think of everything
one must think of the future  of all of you  
i love you all  like children of my own  as you know " the princess continued to look at him without moving  and with the same dull expression
"and then of course my family has also to be considered " prince vasili went on  testily pushing away a little table without looking at her
"you know  catiche  that we—you three sisters  mamontov  and my wife—are the count's only direct heirs
i know  i know how hard it is for you to talk or think of such matters
it is no easier for me  but  my dear  i am getting on for sixty and must be prepared for anything
do you know i have sent for pierre  the count " pointing to his portrait  "definitely demanded that he should be called " prince vasili looked questioningly at the princess  but could not make out whether she was considering what he had just said or whether she was simply looking at him
"there is one thing i constantly pray god to grant  mon cousin " she replied  "and it is that he would be merciful to him and would allow his noble soul peacefully to leave this   " "yes  yes  of course " interrupted prince vasili impatiently  rubbing his bald head and angrily pulling back toward him the little table that he had pushed away
"but  
in short  the fact is  
you know yourself that last winter the count made a will by which he left all his property  not to us his direct heirs  but to pierre " "he has made wills enough " quietly remarked the princess
"but he cannot leave the estate to pierre
pierre is illegitimate " "but  my dear " said prince vasili suddenly  clutching the little table and becoming more animated and talking more rapidly  "what if a letter has been written to the emperor in which the count asks for pierre's legitimation  do you understand that in consideration of the count's services  his request would be granted    " the princess smiled as people do who think they know more about the subject under discussion than those they are talking with
"i can tell you more " continued prince vasili  seizing her hand  "that letter was written  though it was not sent  and the emperor knew of it
the only question is  has it been destroyed or not  if not  then as soon as all is over " and prince vasili sighed to intimate what he meant by the words all is over  "and the count's papers are opened  the will and letter will be delivered to the emperor  and the petition will certainly be granted
pierre will get everything as the legitimate son " "and our share " asked the princess smiling ironically  as if anything might happen  only not that
"but  my poor catiche  it is as clear as daylight  he will then be the legal heir to everything and you won't get anything
you must know  my dear  whether the will and letter were written  and whether they have been destroyed or not
and if they have somehow been overlooked  you ought to know where they are  and must find them  because   " "what next " the princess interrupted  smiling sardonically and not changing the expression of her eyes
"i am a woman  and you think we are all stupid  but i know this  an illegitimate son cannot inherit  
un batard " * she added  as if supposing that this translation of the word would effectively prove to prince vasili the invalidity of his contention
* a bastard
"well  really  catiche  can't you understand  you are so intelligent  how is it you don't see that if the count has written a letter to the emperor begging him to recognize pierre as legitimate  it follows that pierre will not be pierre but will become count bezukhov  and will then inherit everything under the will  and if the will and letter are not destroyed  then you will have nothing but the consolation of having been dutiful et tout ce qui s'ensuit  * that's certain " * and all that follows therefrom
"i know the will was made  but i also know that it is invalid  and you  mon cousin  seem to consider me a perfect fool " said the princess with the expression women assume when they suppose they are saying something witty and stinging
"my dear princess catherine semenovna " began prince vasili impatiently  "i came here not to wrangle with you  but to talk about your interests as with a kinswoman  a good  kind  true relation
and i tell you for the tenth time that if the letter to the emperor and the will in pierre's favor are among the count's papers  then  my dear girl  you and your sisters are not heiresses  if you don't believe me  then believe an expert
i have just been talking to dmitri onufrich"  the family solicitor  "and he says the same " at this a sudden change evidently took place in the princess' ideas  her thin lips grew white  though her eyes did not change  and her voice when she began to speak passed through such transitions as she herself evidently did not expect
"that would be a fine thing " said she
"i never wanted anything and i don't now " she pushed the little dog off her lap and smoothed her dress
"and this is gratitude—this is recognition for those who have sacrificed everything for his sake " she cried
"it's splendid  fine  i don't want anything  prince " "yes  but you are not the only one
there are your sisters   " replied prince vasili
but the princess did not listen to him
"yes  i knew it long ago but had forgotten
i knew that i could expect nothing but meanness  deceit  envy  intrigue  and ingratitude—the blackest ingratitude —in this house   " "do you or do you not know where that will is " insisted prince vasili  his cheeks twitching more than ever
"yes  i was a fool  i still believed in people  loved them  and sacrificed myself
but only the base  the vile succeed  i know who has been intriguing " the princess wished to rise  but the prince held her by the hand
she had the air of one who has suddenly lost faith in the whole human race
she gave her companion an angry glance
"there is still time  my dear
you must remember  catiche  that it was all done casually in a moment of anger  of illness  and was afterwards forgotten
our duty  my dear  is to rectify his mistake  to ease his last moments by not letting him commit this injustice  and not to let him die feeling that he is rendering unhappy those who   " "who sacrificed everything for him " chimed in the princess  who would again have risen had not the prince still held her fast  "though he never could appreciate it
no  mon cousin " she added with a sigh  "i shall always remember that in this world one must expect no reward  that in this world there is neither honor nor justice
in this world one has to be cunning and cruel " "now come  come  be reasonable
i know your excellent heart " "no  i have a wicked heart " "i know your heart " repeated the prince
"i value your friendship and wish you to have as good an opinion of me
don't upset yourself  and let us talk sensibly while there is still time  be it a day or be it but an hour   
tell me all you know about the will  and above all where it is
you must know
we will take it at once and show it to the count
he has  no doubt  forgotten it and will wish to destroy it
you understand that my sole desire is conscientiously to carry out his wishes  that is my only reason for being here
i came simply to help him and you " "now i see it all  i know who has been intriguing—i know " cried the princess
"that's not the point  my dear " "it's that protege of yours  that sweet princess drubetskaya  that anna mikhaylovna whom i would not take for a housemaid  
the infamous  vile woman " "do not let us lose any time   " "ah  don't talk to me  last winter she wheedled herself in here and told the count such vile  disgraceful things about us  especially about sophie—i can't repeat them—that it made the count quite ill and he would not see us for a whole fortnight
i know it was then he wrote this vile  infamous paper  but i thought the thing was invalid " "we've got to it at last—why did you not tell me about it sooner " "it's in the inlaid portfolio that he keeps under his pillow " said the princess  ignoring his question
"now i know  yes  if i have a sin  a great sin  it is hatred of that vile woman " almost shrieked the princess  now quite changed
"and what does she come worming herself in here for  but i will give her a piece of my mind
the time will come " while these conversations were going on in the reception room and the princess' room  a carriage containing pierre  who had been sent for  and anna mikhaylovna  who found it necessary to accompany him  was driving into the court of count bezukhov's house
as the wheels rolled softly over the straw beneath the windows  anna mikhaylovna  having turned with words of comfort to her companion  realized that he was asleep in his corner and woke him up
rousing himself  pierre followed anna mikhaylovna out of the carriage  and only then began to think of the interview with his dying father which awaited him he noticed that they had not come to the front entrance but to the back door
while he was getting down from the carriage steps two men  who looked like tradespeople  ran hurriedly from the entrance and hid in the shadow of the wall
pausing for a moment  pierre noticed several other men of the same kind hiding in the shadow of the house on both sides
but neither anna mikhaylovna nor the footman nor the coachman  who could not help seeing these people  took any notice of them
"it seems to be all right " pierre concluded  and followed anna mikhaylovna she hurriedly ascended the narrow dimly lit stone staircase  calling to pierre  who was lagging behind  to follow
though he did not see why it was necessary for him to go to the count at all  still less why he had to go by the back stairs  yet judging by anna mikhaylovna's air of assurance and haste  pierre concluded that it was all absolutely necessary
halfway up the stairs they were almost knocked over by some men who  carrying pails  came running downstairs  their boots clattering
these men pressed close to the wall to let pierre and anna mikhaylovna pass and did not evince the least surprise at seeing them there
"is this the way to the princesses' apartments " asked anna mikhaylovna of one of them
"yes " replied a footman in a bold loud voice  as if anything were now permissible  "the door to the left  ma'am " "perhaps the count did not ask for me " said pierre when he reached the landing
"i'd better go to my own room " anna mikhaylovna paused and waited for him to come up
"ah  my friend " she said  touching his arm as she had done her son's when speaking to him that afternoon  "believe me i suffer no less than you do  but be a man " "but really  hadn't i better go away " he asked  looking kindly at her over his spectacles
"ah  my dear friend  forget the wrongs that may have been done you
think that he is your father  
perhaps in the agony of death " she sighed
"i have loved you like a son from the first
trust yourself to me  pierre
i shall not forget your interests " pierre did not understand a word  but the conviction that all this had to be grew stronger  and he meekly followed anna mikhaylovna who was already opening a door
this door led into a back anteroom
an old man  a servant of the princesses  sat in a corner knitting a stocking
pierre had never been in this part of the house and did not even know of the existence of these rooms anna mikhaylovna  addressing a maid who was hurrying past with a decanter on a tray as "my dear" and "my sweet " asked about the princess' health and then led pierre along a stone passage
the first door on the left led into the princesses' apartments
the maid with the decanter in her haste had not closed the door  everything in the house was done in haste at that time   and pierre and anna mikhaylovna in passing instinctively glanced into the room  where prince vasili and the eldest princess were sitting close together talking
seeing them pass  prince vasili drew back with obvious impatience  while the princess jumped up and with a gesture of desperation slammed the door with all her might
this action was so unlike her usual composure and the fear depicted on prince vasili's face so out of keeping with his dignity that pierre stopped and glanced inquiringly over his spectacles at his guide
anna mikhaylovna evinced no surprise  she only smiled faintly and sighed  as if to say that this was no more than she had expected
"be a man  my friend
i will look after your interests " said she in reply to his look  and went still faster along the passage
pierre could not make out what it was all about  and still less what "watching over his interests" meant  but he decided that all these things had to be
from the passage they went into a large  dimly lit room adjoining the count's reception room
it was one of those sumptuous but cold apartments known to pierre only from the front approach  but even in this room there now stood an empty bath  and water had been spilled on the carpet
they were met by a deacon with a censer and by a servant who passed out on tiptoe without heeding them
they went into the reception room familiar to pierre  with two italian windows opening into the conservatory  with its large bust and full length portrait of catherine the great
the same people were still sitting here in almost the same positions as before  whispering to one another
all became silent and turned to look at the pale tear worn anna mikhaylovna as she entered  and at the big stout figure of pierre who  hanging his head  meekly followed her
anna mikhaylovna's face expressed a consciousness that the decisive moment had arrived
with the air of a practical petersburg lady she now  keeping pierre close beside her  entered the room even more boldly than that afternoon
she felt that as she brought with her the person the dying man wished to see  her own admission was assured
casting a rapid glance at all those in the room and noticing the count's confessor there  she glided up to him with a sort of amble  not exactly bowing yet seeming to grow suddenly smaller  and respectfully received the blessing first of one and then of another priest
"god be thanked that you are in time " said she to one of the priests  "all we relatives have been in such anxiety
this young man is the count's son " she added more softly
"what a terrible moment " having said this she went up to the doctor
"dear doctor " said she  "this young man is the count's son
is there any hope " the doctor cast a rapid glance upwards and silently shrugged his shoulders
anna mikhaylovna with just the same movement raised her shoulders and eyes  almost closing the latter  sighed  and moved away from the doctor to pierre
to him  in a particularly respectful and tenderly sad voice  she said  "trust in his mercy " and pointing out a small sofa for him to sit and wait for her  she went silently toward the door that everyone was watching and it creaked very slightly as she disappeared behind it
pierre  having made up his mind to obey his monitress implicitly  moved toward the sofa she had indicated
as soon as anna mikhaylovna had disappeared he noticed that the eyes of all in the room turned to him with something more than curiosity and sympathy
he noticed that they whispered to one another  casting significant looks at him with a kind of awe and even servility
a deference such as he had never before received was shown him
a strange lady  the one who had been talking to the priests  rose and offered him her seat  an aide de camp picked up and returned a glove pierre had dropped  the doctors became respectfully silent as he passed by  and moved to make way for him
at first pierre wished to take another seat so as not to trouble the lady  and also to pick up the glove himself and to pass round the doctors who were not even in his way  but all at once he felt that this would not do  and that tonight he was a person obliged to perform some sort of awful rite which everyone expected of him  and that he was therefore bound to accept their services he took the glove in silence from the aide de camp  and sat down in the lady's chair  placing his huge hands symmetrically on his knees in the naive attitude of an egyptian statue  and decided in his own mind that all was as it should be  and that in order not to lose his head and do foolish things he must not act on his own ideas tonight  but must yield himself up entirely to the will of those who were guiding him not two minutes had passed before prince vasili with head erect majestically entered the room
he was wearing his long coat with three stars on his breast
he seemed to have grown thinner since the morning  his eyes seemed larger than usual when he glanced round and noticed pierre
he went up to him  took his hand  a thing he never used to do   and drew it downwards as if wishing to ascertain whether it was firmly fixed on
"courage  courage  my friend  he has asked to see you
that is well " and he turned to go
but pierre thought it necessary to ask  "how is   " and hesitated  not knowing whether it would be proper to call the dying man "the count " yet ashamed to call him "father " "he had another stroke about half an hour ago
courage  my friend   " pierre's mind was in such a confused state that the word "stroke" suggested to him a blow from something
he looked at prince vasili in perplexity  and only later grasped that a stroke was an attack of illness
prince vasili said something to lorrain in passing and went through the door on tiptoe
he could not walk well on tiptoe and his whole body jerked at each step
the eldest princess followed him  and the priests and deacons and some servants also went in at the door
through that door was heard a noise of things being moved about  and at last anna mikhaylovna  still with the same expression  pale but resolute in the discharge of duty  ran out and touching pierre lightly on the arm said  "the divine mercy is inexhaustible  unction is about to be administered
come " pierre went in at the door  stepping on the soft carpet  and noticed that the strange lady  the aide de camp  and some of the servants  all followed him in  as if there were now no further need for permission to enter that room
pierre well knew this large room divided by columns and an arch  its walls hung round with persian carpets
the part of the room behind the columns  with a high silk curtained mahogany bedstead on one side and on the other an immense case containing icons  was brightly illuminated with red light like a russian church during evening service
under the gleaming icons stood a long invalid chair  and in that chair on snowy white smooth pillows  evidently freshly changed  pierre saw—covered to the waist by a bright green quilt—the familiar  majestic figure of his father  count bezukhov  with that gray mane of hair above his broad forehead which reminded one of a lion  and the deep characteristically noble wrinkles of his handsome  ruddy face
he lay just under the icons  his large thick hands outside the quilt
into the right hand  which was lying palm downwards  a wax taper had been thrust between forefinger and thumb  and an old servant  bending over from behind the chair  held it in position
by the chair stood the priests  their long hair falling over their magnificent glittering vestments  with lighted tapers in their hands  slowly and solemnly conducting the service
a little behind them stood the two younger princesses holding handkerchiefs to their eyes  and just in front of them their eldest sister  catiche  with a vicious and determined look steadily fixed on the icons  as though declaring to all that she could not answer for herself should she glance round
anna mikhaylovna  with a meek  sorrowful  and all forgiving expression on her face  stood by the door near the strange lady
prince vasili in front of the door  near the invalid chair  a wax taper in his left hand  was leaning his left arm on the carved back of a velvet chair he had turned round for the purpose  and was crossing himself with his right hand  turning his eyes upward each time he touched his forehead his face wore a calm look of piety and resignation to the will of god
"if you do not understand these sentiments " he seemed to be saying  "so much the worse for you " behind him stood the aide de camp  the doctors  and the menservants  the men and women had separated as in church
all were silently crossing themselves  and the reading of the church service  the subdued chanting of deep bass voices  and in the intervals sighs and the shuffling of feet were the only sounds that could be heard anna mikhaylovna  with an air of importance that showed that she felt she quite knew what she was about  went across the room to where pierre was standing and gave him a taper
he lit it and  distracted by observing those around him  began crossing himself with the hand that held the taper sophie  the rosy  laughter loving  youngest princess with the mole  watched him
she smiled  hid her face in her handkerchief  and remained with it hidden for awhile  then looking up and seeing pierre she again began to laugh
she evidently felt unable to look at him without laughing  but could not resist looking at him  so to be out of temptation she slipped quietly behind one of the columns
in the midst of the service the voices of the priests suddenly ceased  they whispered to one another  and the old servant who was holding the count's hand got up and said something to the ladies
anna mikhaylovna stepped forward and  stooping over the dying man  beckoned to lorrain from behind her back
the french doctor held no taper  he was leaning against one of the columns in a respectful attitude implying that he  a foreigner  in spite of all differences of faith  understood the full importance of the rite now being performed and even approved of it
he now approached the sick man with the noiseless step of one in full vigor of life  with his delicate white fingers raised from the green quilt the hand that was free  and turning sideways felt the pulse and reflected a moment
the sick man was given something to drink  there was a stir around him  then the people resumed their places and the service continued
during this interval pierre noticed that prince vasili left the chair on which he had been leaning  and—with an air which intimated that he knew what he was about and if others did not understand him it was so much the worse for them—did not go up to the dying man  but passed by him  joined the eldest princess  and moved with her to the side of the room where stood the high bedstead with its silken hangings
on leaving the bed both prince vasili and the princess passed out by a back door  but returned to their places one after the other before the service was concluded
pierre paid no more attention to this occurrence than to the rest of what went on  having made up his mind once for all that what he saw happening around him that evening was in some way essential
the chanting of the service ceased  and the voice of the priest was heard respectfully congratulating the dying man on having received the sacrament
the dying man lay as lifeless and immovable as before
around him everyone began to stir  steps were audible and whispers  among which anna mikhaylovna's was the most distinct
pierre heard her say  "certainly he must be moved onto the bed  here it will be impossible   " the sick man was so surrounded by doctors  princesses  and servants that pierre could no longer see the reddish yellow face with its gray mane—which  though he saw other faces as well  he had not lost sight of for a single moment during the whole service
he judged by the cautious movements of those who crowded round the invalid chair that they had lifted the dying man and were moving him
"catch hold of my arm or you'll drop him " he heard one of the servants say in a frightened whisper
"catch hold from underneath
here " exclaimed different voices  and the heavy breathing of the bearers and the shuffling of their feet grew more hurried  as if the weight they were carrying were too much for them
as the bearers  among whom was anna mikhaylovna  passed the young man he caught a momentary glimpse between their heads and backs of the dying man's high  stout  uncovered chest and powerful shoulders  raised by those who were holding him under the armpits  and of his gray  curly  leonine head
this head  with its remarkably broad brow and cheekbones  its handsome  sensual mouth  and its cold  majestic expression  was not disfigured by the approach of death
it was the same as pierre remembered it three months before  when the count had sent him to petersburg
but now this head was swaying helplessly with the uneven movements of the bearers  and the cold listless gaze fixed itself upon nothing
after a few minutes' bustle beside the high bedstead  those who had carried the sick man dispersed
anna mikhaylovna touched pierre's hand and said  "come " pierre went with her to the bed on which the sick man had been laid in a stately pose in keeping with the ceremony just completed
he lay with his head propped high on the pillows
his hands were symmetrically placed on the green silk quilt  the palms downward when pierre came up the count was gazing straight at him  but with a look the significance of which could not be understood by mortal man
either this look meant nothing but that as long as one has eyes they must look somewhere  or it meant too much
pierre hesitated  not knowing what to do  and glanced inquiringly at his guide
anna mikhaylovna made a hurried sign with her eyes  glancing at the sick man's hand and moving her lips as if to send it a kiss
pierre  carefully stretching his neck so as not to touch the quilt  followed her suggestion and pressed his lips to the large boned  fleshy hand neither the hand nor a single muscle of the count's face stirred
once more pierre looked questioningly at anna mikhaylovna to see what he was to do next
anna mikhaylovna with her eyes indicated a chair that stood beside the bed
pierre obediently sat down  his eyes asking if he were doing right
anna mikhaylovna nodded approvingly
again pierre fell into the naively symmetrical pose of an egyptian statue  evidently distressed that his stout and clumsy body took up so much room and doing his utmost to look as small as possible he looked at the count  who still gazed at the spot where pierre's face had been before he sat down
anna mikhaylovna indicated by her attitude her consciousness of the pathetic importance of these last moments of meeting between the father and son
this lasted about two minutes  which to pierre seemed an hour
suddenly the broad muscles and lines of the count's face began to twitch
the twitching increased  the handsome mouth was drawn to one side  only now did pierre realize how near death his father was   and from that distorted mouth issued an indistinct  hoarse sound
anna mikhaylovna looked attentively at the sick man's eyes  trying to guess what he wanted  she pointed first to pierre  then to some drink  then named prince vasili in an inquiring whisper  then pointed to the quilt
the eyes and face of the sick man showed impatience
he made an effort to look at the servant who stood constantly at the head of the bed
"wants to turn on the other side " whispered the servant  and got up to turn the count's heavy body toward the wall
pierre rose to help him
while the count was being turned over  one of his arms fell back helplessly and he made a fruitless effort to pull it forward whether he noticed the look of terror with which pierre regarded that lifeless arm  or whether some other thought flitted across his dying brain  at any rate he glanced at the refractory arm  at pierre's terror stricken face  and again at the arm  and on his face a feeble  piteous smile appeared  quite out of keeping with his features  that seemed to deride his own helplessness
at sight of this smile pierre felt an unexpected quivering in his breast and a tickling in his nose  and tears dimmed his eyes
the sick man was turned on to his side with his face to the wall
he sighed
"he is dozing " said anna mikhaylovna  observing that one of the princesses was coming to take her turn at watching
"let us go " pierre went out
there was now no one in the reception room except prince vasili and the eldest princess  who were sitting under the portrait of catherine the great and talking eagerly
as soon as they saw pierre and his companion they became silent  and pierre thought he saw the princess hide something as she whispered  "i can't bear the sight of that woman " "catiche has had tea served in the small drawing room " said prince vasili to anna mikhaylovna
"go and take something  my poor anna mikhaylovna  or you will not hold out " to pierre he said nothing  merely giving his arm a sympathetic squeeze below the shoulder
pierre went with anna mikhaylovna into the small drawing room
"there is nothing so refreshing after a sleepless night as a cup of this delicious russian tea " lorrain was saying with an air of restrained animation as he stood sipping tea from a delicate chinese handleless cup before a table on which tea and a cold supper were laid in the small circular room
around the table all who were at count bezukhov's house that night had gathered to fortify themselves pierre well remembered this small circular drawing room with its mirrors and little tables
during balls given at the house pierre  who did not know how to dance  had liked sitting in this room to watch the ladies who  as they passed through in their ball dresses with diamonds and pearls on their bare shoulders  looked at themselves in the brilliantly lighted mirrors which repeated their reflections several times now this same room was dimly lighted by two candles
on one small table tea things and supper dishes stood in disorder  and in the middle of the night a motley throng of people sat there  not merrymaking  but somberly whispering  and betraying by every word and movement that they none of them forgot what was happening and what was about to happen in the bedroom
pierre did not eat anything though he would very much have liked to
he looked inquiringly at his monitress and saw that she was again going on tiptoe to the reception room where they had left prince vasili and the eldest princess
pierre concluded that this also was essential  and after a short interval followed her
anna mikhaylovna was standing beside the princess  and they were both speaking in excited whispers
"permit me  princess  to know what is necessary and what is not necessary " said the younger of the two speakers  evidently in the same state of excitement as when she had slammed the door of her room
"but  my dear princess " answered anna mikhaylovna blandly but impressively  blocking the way to the bedroom and preventing the other from passing  "won't this be too much for poor uncle at a moment when he needs repose  worldly conversation at a moment when his soul is already prepared   " prince vasili was seated in an easy chair in his familiar attitude  with one leg crossed high above the other
his cheeks  which were so flabby that they looked heavier below  were twitching violently  but he wore the air of a man little concerned in what the two ladies were saying
"come  my dear anna mikhaylovna  let catiche do as she pleases
you know how fond the count is of her " "i don't even know what is in this paper " said the younger of the two ladies  addressing prince vasili and pointing to an inlaid portfolio she held in her hand
"all i know is that his real will is in his writing table  and this is a paper he has forgotten    " she tried to pass anna mikhaylovna  but the latter sprang so as to bar her path
"i know  my dear  kind princess " said anna mikhaylovna  seizing the portfolio so firmly that it was plain she would not let go easily
"dear princess  i beg and implore you  have some pity on him  je vous en conjure   " the princess did not reply
their efforts in the struggle for the portfolio were the only sounds audible  but it was evident that if the princess did speak  her words would not be flattering to anna mikhaylovna
though the latter held on tenaciously  her voice lost none of its honeyed firmness and softness
"pierre  my dear  come here
i think he will not be out of place in a family consultation  is it not so  prince " "why don't you speak  cousin " suddenly shrieked the princess so loud that those in the drawing room heard her and were startled
"why do you remain silent when heaven knows who permits herself to interfere  making a scene on the very threshold of a dying man's room  intriguer " she hissed viciously  and tugged with all her might at the portfolio
but anna mikhaylovna went forward a step or two to keep her hold on the portfolio  and changed her grip
prince vasili rose
"oh " said he with reproach and surprise  "this is absurd  come  let go i tell you " the princess let go
"and you too " but anna mikhaylovna did not obey him
"let go  i tell you  i will take the responsibility
i myself will go and ask him  i   
does that satisfy you " "but  prince " said anna mikhaylovna  "after such a solemn sacrament  allow him a moment's peace  here  pierre  tell them your opinion " said she  turning to the young man who  having come quite close  was gazing with astonishment at the angry face of the princess which had lost all dignity  and at the twitching cheeks of prince vasili
"remember that you will answer for the consequences " said prince vasili severely
"you don't know what you are doing " "vile woman " shouted the princess  darting unexpectedly at anna mikhaylovna and snatching the portfolio from her
prince vasili bent his head and spread out his hands
at this moment that terrible door  which pierre had watched so long and which had always opened so quietly  burst noisily open and banged against the wall  and the second of the three sisters rushed out wringing her hands
"what are you doing " she cried vehemently
"he is dying and you leave me alone with him " her sister dropped the portfolio
anna mikhaylovna  stooping  quickly caught up the object of contention and ran into the bedroom
the eldest princess and prince vasili  recovering themselves  followed her a few minutes later the eldest sister came out with a pale hard face  again biting her underlip
at sight of pierre her expression showed an irrepressible hatred
"yes  now you may be glad " said she  "this is what you have been waiting for " and bursting into tears she hid her face in her handkerchief and rushed from the room
prince vasili came next
he staggered to the sofa on which pierre was sitting and dropped onto it  covering his face with his hand
pierre noticed that he was pale and that his jaw quivered and shook as if in an ague
"ah  my friend " said he  taking pierre by the elbow  and there was in his voice a sincerity and weakness pierre had never observed in it before
"how often we sin  how much we deceive  and all for what  i am near sixty  dear friend  
i too  
all will end in death  all  death is awful   " and he burst into tears
anna mikhaylovna came out last
she approached pierre with slow  quiet steps
"pierre " she said
pierre gave her an inquiring look
she kissed the young man on his forehead  wetting him with her tears
then after a pause she said  "he is no more    " pierre looked at her over his spectacles
"come  i will go with you
try to weep  nothing gives such relief as tears " she led him into the dark drawing room and pierre was glad no one could see his face
anna mikhaylovna left him  and when she returned he was fast asleep with his head on his arm
in the morning anna mikhaylovna said to pierre  "yes  my dear  this is a great loss for us all  not to speak of you
but god will support you  you are young  and are now  i hope  in command of an immense fortune
the will has not yet been opened
i know you well enough to be sure that this will not turn your head  but it imposes duties on you  and you must be a man " pierre was silent
"perhaps later on i may tell you  my dear boy  that if i had not been there  god only knows what would have happened  you know  uncle promised me only the day before yesterday not to forget boris
but he had no time
i hope  my dear friend  you will carry out your father's wish " pierre understood nothing of all this and coloring shyly looked in silence at princess anna mikhaylovna
after her talk with pierre  anna mikhaylovna returned to the rostovs' and went to bed
on waking in the morning she told the rostovs and all her acquaintances the details of count bezukhov's death
she said the count had died as she would herself wish to die  that his end was not only touching but edifying
as to the last meeting between father and son  it was so touching that she could not think of it without tears  and did not know which had behaved better during those awful moments—the father who so remembered everything and everybody at last and had spoken such pathetic words to the son  or pierre  whom it had been pitiful to see  so stricken was he with grief  though he tried hard to hide it in order not to sadden his dying father
"it is painful  but it does one good
it uplifts the soul to see such men as the old count and his worthy son " said she
of the behavior of the eldest princess and prince vasili she spoke disapprovingly  but in whispers and as a great secret
at bald hills  prince nicholas andreevich bolkonski's estate  the arrival of young prince andrew and his wife was daily expected  but this expectation did not upset the regular routine of life in the old prince's household
general in chief prince nicholas andreevich  nicknamed in society  "the king of prussia"  ever since the emperor paul had exiled him to his country estate had lived there continuously with his daughter  princess mary  and her companion  mademoiselle bourienne
though in the new reign he was free to return to the capitals  he still continued to live in the country  remarking that anyone who wanted to see him could come the hundred miles from moscow to bald hills  while he himself needed no one and nothing he used to say that there are only two sources of human vice—idleness and superstition  and only two virtues— activity and intelligence
he himself undertook his daughter's education  and to develop these two cardinal virtues in her gave her lessons in algebra and geometry till she was twenty  and arranged her life so that her whole time was occupied he was himself always occupied  writing his memoirs  solving problems in higher mathematics  turning snuffboxes on a lathe  working in the garden  or superintending the building that was always going on at his estate as regularity is a prime condition facilitating activity  regularity in his household was carried to the highest point of exactitude
he always came to table under precisely the same conditions  and not only at the same hour but at the same minute
with those about him  from his daughter to his serfs  the prince was sharp and invariably exacting  so that without being a hardhearted man he inspired such fear and respect as few hardhearted men would have aroused
although he was in retirement and had now no influence in political affairs  every high official appointed to the province in which the prince's estate lay considered it his duty to visit him and waited in the lofty antechamber just as the architect  gardener  or princess mary did  till the prince appeared punctually to the appointed hour
everyone sitting in this antechamber experienced the same feeling of respect and even fear when the enormously high study door opened and showed the figure of a rather small old man  with powdered wig  small withered hands  and bushy gray eyebrows which  when he frowned  sometimes hid the gleam of his shrewd  youthfully glittering eyes
on the morning of the day that the young couple were to arrive  princess mary entered the antechamber as usual at the time appointed for the morning greeting  crossing herself with trepidation and repeating a silent prayer
every morning she came in like that  and every morning prayed that the daily interview might pass off well
an old powdered manservant who was sitting in the antechamber rose quietly and said in a whisper  "please walk in " through the door came the regular hum of a lathe
the princess timidly opened the door which moved noiselessly and easily
she paused at the entrance
the prince was working at the lathe and after glancing round continued his work
the enormous study was full of things evidently in constant use
the large in the locks  the high desk for writing while standing up  on which lay an open scattered around—all indicated continuous  varied  and orderly activity
the motion of the small foot shod in a tartar boot embroidered with silver  and the firm pressure of the lean sinewy hand  showed that the prince still possessed the tenacious endurance and vigor of hardy old age
after a few more turns of the lathe he removed his foot from the pedal  wiped his chisel  dropped it into a leather pouch attached to the lathe  and  approaching the table  summoned his daughter
he never gave his children a blessing  so he simply held out his bristly cheek  as yet unshaven  and  regarding her tenderly and attentively  said severely  lessons in geometry written by himself and drew up a chair with his foot "for tomorrow " said he  quickly finding the page and making a scratch from one paragraph to another with his hard nail
"wait a bit  here's a letter for you " said the old man suddenly  taking a letter addressed in a woman's hand from a bag hanging above the table  onto which he threw it
at the sight of the letter red patches showed themselves on the princess' face she took it quickly and bent her head over it
"from heloise " asked the prince with a cold smile that showed his still sound  yellowish teeth
"yes  it's from julie " replied the princess with a timid glance and a timid smile
"i'll let two more letters pass  but the third i'll read " said the prince sternly  "i'm afraid you write much nonsense
i'll read the third " "read this if you like  father " said the princess  blushing still more and holding out the letter
"the third  i said the third " cried the prince abruptly  pushing the letter away  containing geometrical figures
placing an arm on the back of the chair on which she sat  so that she felt herself surrounded on all sides by the acrid scent of old age and tobacco  which she had known so long
"now  madam  these triangles are equal  please note that the angle abc   " the princess looked in a scared way at her father's eyes glittering close to her  the red patches on her face came and went  and it was plain that she understood nothing and was so frightened that her fear would prevent her understanding any of her father's further explanations  however clear they might be
whether it was the teacher's fault or the pupil's  this same thing happened every day  the princess' eyes grew dim  she could not see and could not hear anything  but was only conscious of her stern father's withered face close to her  of his breath and the smell of him  and could think only of how to get away quickly to her own room to make out the problem in peace
the old man was beside himself  moved the chair on which he was sitting noisily backward and forward  made efforts to control himself and not become vehement  but almost always did become vehement  scolded  and sometimes the princess gave a wrong answer turning sharply away  but rising immediately  he paced up and down  lightly touched his daughter's hair and sat down again
he drew up his chair  and continued to explain
"this won't do  princess  it won't do " said he  when princess mary  having leave  "mathematics are most important  madam  i don't want to have you like our silly ladies
get used to it and you'll like it " and he patted her cheek
"it will drive all the nonsense out of your head " from the high desk
"here is some sort of key to the mysteries that your heloise has sent you
religious  i don't interfere with anyone's belief  
i have looked at it
take it
well  now go
go " he patted her on the shoulder and himself closed the door after her princess mary went back to her room with the sad  scared expression that rarely left her and which made her plain  sickly face yet plainer
she sat down at her writing table  on which stood miniature portraits and which was littered from her most intimate friend from childhood  that same julie karagina who had been at the rostovs' name day party
julie wrote in french  dear and precious friend  how terrible and frightful a thing is separation  though i tell myself that half my life and half my happiness are wrapped up in you  and that in spite of the distance separating us our hearts are united by indissoluble bonds  my heart rebels against fate and in spite of the pleasures and distractions around me i cannot overcome a certain secret sorrow that has been in my heart ever since we parted
why are we not together as we were last summer  in your big study  on the blue sofa  the confidential sofa  why cannot i now  as three months ago  draw fresh moral strength from your look  so gentle  calm  and penetrating  a look i loved so well and seem to see before me as i write  having read thus far  princess mary sighed and glanced into the mirror which stood on her right
it reflected a weak  ungraceful figure and thin face
her eyes  always sad  now looked with particular hopelessness at her reflection in the glass
"she flatters me " thought the princess  turning away and continuing to read
but julie did not flatter her friend  the princess' eyes—large  deep and luminous  it seemed as if at times there radiated from them shafts of warm light —were so beautiful that very often in spite of the plainness of her face they gave her an attraction more powerful than that of beauty
but the princess never saw the beautiful expression of her own eyes—the look they had when she was not thinking of herself
as with everyone  her face assumed a forced unnatural expression as soon as she looked in a glass
she went on reading  all moscow talks of nothing but war
one of my two brothers is already abroad  the other is with the guards  who are starting on their march to the frontier
our dear emperor has left petersburg and it is thought intends to expose his precious person to the chances of war
god grant that the corsican monster who is destroying the peace of europe may be overthrown by the angel whom it has pleased the almighty  in his goodness  to give us as sovereign  to say nothing of my brothers  this war has deprived me of one of the associations nearest my heart
i mean young nicholas rostov  who with his enthusiasm could not bear to remain inactive and has left the university to join the army
i will confess to you  dear mary  that in spite of his extreme youth his departure for the army was a great grief to me
this young man  of whom i spoke to you last summer  is so noble minded and full of that real youthfulness which one seldom finds nowadays among our old men of twenty and  particularly  he is so frank and has so much heart
he is so pure and poetic that my relations with him  transient as they were  have been one of the sweetest comforts to my poor heart  which has already suffered so much
someday i will tell you about our parting and all that was said then
that is still too fresh
ah  dear friend  you are happy not to know these poignant joys and sorrows
you are fortunate  for the latter are generally the stronger  i know very well that count nicholas is too young ever to be more to me than a friend  but this sweet friendship  this poetic and pure intimacy  were what my heart needed
but enough of this  the chief news  about which all moscow gossips  is the death of old count bezukhov  and his inheritance
fancy  the three princesses have received very little  prince vasili nothing  and it is monsieur pierre who has inherited all the property and has besides been recognized as legitimate  so that he is now count bezukhov and possessor of the finest fortune in russia
it is rumored that prince vasili played a very despicable part in this affair and that he returned to petersburg quite crestfallen
i confess i understand very little about all these matters of wills and inheritance  but i do know that since this young man  whom we all used to know as plain monsieur pierre  has become count bezukhov and the owner of one of the largest fortunes in russia  i am much amused to watch the change in the tone and manners of the mammas burdened by marriageable daughters  and of the young ladies themselves  toward him  though  between you and me  he always seemed to me a poor sort of fellow as for the past two years people have amused themselves by finding husbands for me  most of whom i don't even know   the matchmaking chronicles of moscow now speak of me as the future countess bezukhova but you will understand that i have no desire for the post
a propos of marriages  do you know that a while ago that universal auntie anna mikhaylovna told me  under the seal of strict secrecy  of a plan of marriage for you
it is neither more nor less than with prince vasili's son anatole  whom they wish to reform by marrying him to someone rich and distinguee  and it is on you that his relations' choice has fallen
i don't know what you will think of it  but i consider it my duty to let you know of it
he is said to be very handsome and a terrible scapegrace
that is all i have been able to find out about him
but enough of gossip
i am at the end of my second sheet of paper  and mamma has sent for me to go and dine at the apraksins'
read the mystical things in it difficult for the feeble human mind to grasp  it is an admirable your father and my compliments to mademoiselle bourienne
i embrace you as i love you
julie p s
let me have news of your brother and his charming little wife
the princess pondered awhile with a thoughtful smile and her luminous eyes lit up so that her face was entirely transformed
then she suddenly rose and with her heavy tread went up to the table
she took a sheet of paper and her hand moved rapidly over it
this is the reply she wrote  also in french  dear and precious friend  your letter of the 13th has given me great delight
so you still love me  my romantic julie  separation  of which you say so much that is bad  does not seem to have had its usual effect on you
you complain of our separation
what then should i say  if i dared complain  i who am deprived of all who are dear to me  ah  if we had not religion to console us life would be very sad
why do you suppose that i should look severely on your affection for that young man  on such matters i am only severe with myself
i understand such feelings in others  and if never having felt them i cannot approve of them  neither do i condemn them
only it seems to me that christian love  love of one's neighbor  love of one's enemy  is worthier  sweeter  and better than the feelings which the beautiful eyes of a young man can inspire in a romantic and loving young girl like yourself the news of count bezukhov's death reached us before your letter and my father was much affected by it
he says the count was the last representative but one of the great century  and that it is his own turn now  but that he will do all he can to let his turn come as late as possible
god preserve us from that terrible misfortune  i cannot agree with you about pierre  whom i knew as a child
he always seemed to me to have an excellent heart  and that is the quality i value most in people
as to his inheritance and the part played by prince vasili  it is very sad for both
ah  my dear friend  our divine saviour's words  that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god  are terribly true
i pity prince vasili but am still more sorry for pierre
so young  and burdened with such riches—to what temptations he will be exposed  if i were asked what i desire most on earth  it would be to be poorer than the poorest beggar
a thousand thanks  dear friend  for the volume you have sent me and which has such success in moscow
yet since you tell me that among some good things it contains others which our weak human understanding cannot grasp  it seems to me rather useless to spend time in reading what is unintelligible and can therefore bear no fruit i never could understand the fondness some people have for confusing their minds by imagination  giving them a bent for exaggeration quite contrary to christian simplicity
let us rather read the epistles and gospels
let us not seek to penetrate what mysteries they contain  for how can we  miserable sinners that we are  know the terrible and holy secrets of providence while we remain in this flesh which forms an impenetrable veil between us and the eternal  let us rather confine ourselves to studying those sublime rules which our divine saviour has left for our guidance here below let us try to conform to them and follow them  and let us be persuaded that the less we let our feeble human minds roam  the better we shall please god  who rejects all knowledge that does not come from him  and the less we seek to fathom what he has been pleased to conceal from us  the sooner will he vouchsafe its revelation to us through his divine spirit
my father has not spoken to me of a suitor  but has only told me that he has received a letter and is expecting a visit from prince vasili
in regard to this project of marriage for me  i will tell you  dear sweet friend  that i look on marriage as a divine institution to which we must conform
however painful it may be to me  should the almighty lay the duties of wife and mother upon me i shall try to perform them as faithfully as i can  without disquieting myself by examining my feelings toward him whom he may give me for husband
i have had a letter from my brother  who announces his speedy arrival at bald hills with his wife
this pleasure will be but a brief one  however  for he will leave us again to take part in this unhappy war into which we have been drawn  god knows how or why
not only where you are—at the heart of affairs and of the world—is the talk all of war  even here amid fieldwork and the calm of nature—which townsfolk consider characteristic of the country— rumors of war are heard and painfully felt
my father talks of nothing but marches and countermarches  things of which i understand nothing  and the day before yesterday during my daily walk through the village i witnessed a heartrending scene   
it was a convoy of conscripts enrolled from our people and starting to join the army
you should have seen the state of the mothers  wives  and children of the men who were going and should have heard the sobs
it seems as though mankind has forgotten the laws of its divine saviour  who preached love and forgiveness of injuries—and that men attribute the greatest merit to skill in killing one another adieu  dear and kind friend  may our divine saviour and his most holy mother keep you in their holy and all powerful care  mary "ah  you are sending off a letter  princess  i have already dispatched mine
i have written to my poor mother " said the smiling mademoiselle bourienne rapidly  in her pleasant mellow tones and with guttural r's
she brought into princess mary's strenuous  mournful  and gloomy world a quite different atmosphere  careless  lighthearted  and self satisfied
"princess  i must warn you " she added  lowering her voice and evidently listening to herself with pleasure  and speaking with exaggerated grasseyement  "the prince has been scolding michael ivanovich
he is in a very bad humor  very morose
be prepared " "ah  dear friend " replied princess mary  "i have asked you never to warn me of the humor my father is in
i do not allow myself to judge him and would not have others do so " the princess glanced at her watch and  seeing that she was five minutes late in starting her practice on the clavichord  went into the sitting room with a look of alarm
between twelve and two o'clock  as the day was mapped out  the prince rested and the princess played the clavichord
the gray haired valet was sitting drowsily listening to the snoring of the prince  who was in his large study
from the far side of the house through the closed doors came the sound of difficult passages—twenty times repeated—of a sonata by dussek
just then a closed carriage and another with a hood drove up to the porch
prince andrew got out of the carriage  helped his little wife to alight  and let her pass into the house before him
old tikhon  wearing a wig  put his head out of the door of the antechamber  reported in a whisper that the prince was sleeping  and hastily closed the door
tikhon knew that neither the son's arrival nor any other unusual event must be allowed to disturb the appointed order of the day
prince andrew apparently knew this as well as tikhon  he looked at his watch as if to ascertain whether his father's habits had changed since he was at home last  and  having assured himself that they had not  he turned to his wife "he will get up in twenty minutes
let us go across to mary's room " he said
the little princess had grown stouter during this time  but her eyes and her short  downy  smiling lip lifted when she began to speak just as merrily and prettily as ever
"why  this is a palace " she said to her husband  looking around with the expression with which people compliment their host at a ball
"let's come  quick  quick " and with a glance round  she smiled at tikhon  at her husband  and at the footman who accompanied them
"is that mary practicing  let's go quietly and take her by surprise " prince andrew followed her with a courteous but sad expression
"you've grown older  tikhon " he said in passing to the old man  who kissed his hand
before they reached the room from which the sounds of the clavichord came  the pretty  fair haired frenchwoman  mademoiselle bourienne  rushed out apparently beside herself with delight
"ah  what joy for the princess " exclaimed she  "at last  i must let her know " "no  no  please not  
you are mademoiselle bourienne " said the little princess  kissing her
"i know you already through my sister in law's friendship for you
she was not expecting us " they went up to the door of the sitting room from which came the sound of the oft repeated passage of the sonata
prince andrew stopped and made a grimace  as if expecting something unpleasant
the little princess entered the room
the passage broke off in the middle  a cry was heard  then princess mary's heavy tread and the sound of kissing
when prince andrew went in the two princesses  who had only met once before for a short time at his wedding  were in each other's arms warmly pressing their lips to whatever place they happened to touch mademoiselle bourienne stood near them pressing her hand to her heart  with a beatific smile and obviously equally ready to cry or to laugh
prince andrew shrugged his shoulders and frowned  as lovers of music do when they hear a false note
the two women let go of one another  and then  as if afraid of being too late  seized each other's hands  kissing them and pulling them away  and again began kissing each other on the face  and then to prince andrew's surprise both began to cry and kissed again
mademoiselle bourienne also began to cry
prince andrew evidently felt ill at ease  but to the two women it seemed quite natural that they should cry  and apparently it never entered their heads that it could have been otherwise at this meeting
"ah  my dear   
ah  mary " they suddenly exclaimed  and then laughed
"i dreamed last night   "—"you were not expecting us    " "ah  mary  you have got thinner    " "and you have grown stouter    " "i knew the princess at once " put in mademoiselle bourienne
"and i had no idea    " exclaimed princess mary
"ah  andrew  i did not see you " prince andrew and his sister  hand in hand  kissed one another  and he told her she was still the same crybaby as ever
princess mary had turned toward her brother  and through her tears the loving  warm  gentle look of her large luminous eyes  very beautiful at that moment  rested on prince andrew's face
the little princess talked incessantly  her short  downy upper lip continually and rapidly touching her rosy nether lip when necessary and drawing up again next moment when her face broke into a smile of glittering teeth and sparkling eyes
she told of an accident they had had on the spasski hill which might have been serious for her in her condition  and immediately after that informed them that she had left all her clothes in petersburg and that heaven knew what she would have to dress in here  and that andrew had quite changed  and that kitty odyntsova had married an old man  and that there was a suitor for mary  a real one  but that they would talk of that later
princess mary was still looking silently at her brother and her beautiful eyes were full of love and sadness
it was plain that she was following a train of thought independent of her sister in law's words
in the midst of a description of the last petersburg fete she addressed her brother  "so you are really going to the war  andrew " she said sighing
lise sighed too
"yes  and even tomorrow " replied her brother
"he is leaving me here  god knows why  when he might have had promotion   " princess mary did not listen to the end  but continuing her train of thought turned to her sister in law with a tender glance at her figure
"is it certain " she said
the face of the little princess changed
she sighed and said  "yes  quite certain
ah  it is very dreadful   " her lip descended
she brought her face close to her sister in law's and unexpectedly again began to cry
"she needs rest " said prince andrew with a frown
"don't you  lise  take her to your room and i'll go to father
how is he  just the same " "yes  just the same
though i don't know what your opinion will be " answered the princess joyfully
"and are the hours the same  and the walks in the avenues  and the lathe " asked prince andrew with a scarcely perceptible smile which showed that  in spite of all his love and respect for his father  he was aware of his weaknesses
"the hours are the same  and the lathe  and also the mathematics and my geometry lessons " said princess mary gleefully  as if her lessons in geometry were among the greatest delights of her life
when the twenty minutes had elapsed and the time had come for the old prince to get up  tikhon came to call the young prince to his father
the old man made a departure from his usual routine in honor of his son's arrival  he gave orders to admit him to his apartments while he dressed for dinner
the old prince always dressed in old fashioned style  wearing an antique coat and powdered hair  and when prince andrew entered his father's dressing room  not with the contemptuous look and manner he wore in drawing rooms  but with the animated face with which he talked to pierre   the old man was sitting on a large leather covered chair  wrapped in a powdering mantle  entrusting his head to tikhon "ah  here's the warrior  wants to vanquish buonaparte " said the old man  shaking his powdered head as much as the tail  which tikhon was holding fast to plait  would allow
"you at least must tackle him properly  or else if he goes on like this he'll soon have us  too  for his subjects  how are you " and he held out his cheek
the old man was in a good temper after his nap before dinner
 he used to say that a nap "after dinner was silver—before dinner  golden "  he cast happy  sidelong glances at his son from under his thick  bushy eyebrows
prince andrew went up and kissed his father on the spot indicated to him
he made no reply on his father's favorite topic—making fun of the military men of the day  and more particularly of bonaparte
"yes  father  i have come to you and brought my wife who is pregnant " said prince andrew  following every movement of his father's face with an eager and respectful look
"how is your health " "only fools and rakes fall ill  my boy
you know me  i am busy from morning till night and abstemious  so of course i am well " "thank god " said his son smiling
"god has nothing to do with it  well  go on " he continued  returning to his hobby  "tell me how the germans have taught you to fight bonaparte by this new science you call 'strategy '" prince andrew smiled
"give me time to collect my wits  father " said he  with a smile that showed that his father's foibles did not prevent his son from loving and honoring him
"why  i have not yet had time to settle down " "nonsense  nonsense " cried the old man  shaking his pigtail to see whether it was firmly plaited  and grasping his by the hand
"the house for your wife is ready
princess mary will take her there and show her over  and they'll talk nineteen to the dozen
that's their woman's way  i am glad to have her
sit down and talk
about mikhelson's army i understand—tolstoy's too  
a simultaneous expedition   
but what's the southern army to do  prussia is neutral  
i know that
what about austria " said he  rising from his chair and pacing up and down the room followed by tikhon  who ran after him  handing him different articles of clothing
"what of sweden  how will they cross pomerania " prince andrew  seeing that his father insisted  began—at first reluctantly  but gradually with more and more animation  and from habit changing unconsciously from russian to french as he went on—to explain the plan of operation for the coming campaign
he explained how an army  ninety thousand strong  was to threaten prussia so as to bring her out of her neutrality and draw her into the war  how part of that army was to join some swedish forces at stralsund  how two hundred and twenty thousand austrians  with a hundred thousand russians  were to operate in italy and on the rhine  how fifty thousand russians and as many english were to land at naples  and how a total force of five hundred thousand men was to attack the french from different sides
the old prince did not evince the least interest during this explanation  but as if he were not listening to it continued to dress while walking about  and three times unexpectedly interrupted
once he stopped it by shouting  "the white one  the white one " this meant that tikhon was not handing him the waistcoat he wanted
another time he interrupted  saying  "and will she soon be confined " and shaking his head reproachfully said  "that's bad  go on  go on " the third interruption came when prince andrew was finishing his description
the old man began to sing  in the cracked voice of old age  "malbrook s'en va t en guerre
dieu sait quand reviendra " * * "marlborough is going to the wars  god knows when he'll return " his son only smiled
"i don't say it's a plan i approve of " said the son  "i am only telling you what it is
napoleon has also formed his plan by now  not worse than this one " "well  you've told me nothing new " and the old man repeated  meditatively and rapidly  "dieu sait quand reviendra
go to the dining room " at the appointed hour the prince  powdered and shaven  entered the dining room where his daughter in law  princess mary  and mademoiselle bourienne were already awaiting him together with his architect  who by a strange caprice of his employer's was admitted to table though the position of that insignificant individual was such as could certainly not have caused him to expect that honor
the prince  who generally kept very strictly to social distinctions and rarely admitted even important government officials to his table  had unexpectedly selected michael ivanovich  who always went into a corner to blow his nose on his checked handkerchief  to illustrate the theory that all men are equals  and had more than once impressed on his daughter that michael ivanovich was "not a whit worse than you or i " at dinner the prince usually spoke to the taciturn michael ivanovich more often than to anyone else
in the dining room  which like all the rooms in the house was exceedingly lofty  the members of the household and the footmen—one behind each chair —stood waiting for the prince to enter the head butler  napkin on arm  was scanning the setting of the table  making signs to the footmen  and anxiously glancing from the clock to the door by which the prince was to enter
prince andrew was looking at a large gilt frame  new to him  containing the genealogical tree of the princes bolkonski  opposite which hung another such frame with a badly painted portrait  evidently by the hand of the artist belonging to the estate  of a ruling prince  in a crown—an alleged descendant of rurik and ancestor of the bolkonskis
prince andrew  looking again at that genealogical tree  shook his head  laughing as a man laughs who looks at a portrait so characteristic of the original as to be amusing
"how thoroughly like him that is " he said to princess mary  who had come up to him
princess mary looked at her brother in surprise
she did not understand what he was laughing at
everything her father did inspired her with reverence and was beyond question
"everyone has his achilles' heel " continued prince andrew
"fancy  with his powerful mind  indulging in such nonsense " princess mary could not understand the boldness of her brother's criticism and was about to reply  when the expected footsteps were heard coming from the study
the prince walked in quickly and jauntily as was his wont  as if intentionally contrasting the briskness of his manners with the strict formality of his house
at that moment the great clock struck two and another with a shrill tone joined in from the drawing room
the prince stood still  his lively glittering eyes from under their thick  bushy eyebrows sternly scanned all present and rested on the little princess
she felt  as courtiers do when the tsar enters  the sensation of fear and respect which the old man inspired in all around him
he stroked her hair and then patted her awkwardly on the back of her neck
"i'm glad  glad  to see you " he said  looking attentively into her eyes  and then quickly went to his place and sat down
"sit down  sit down  sit down  michael ianovich " he indicated a place beside him to his daughter in law
a footman moved the chair for her
"ho  ho " said the old man  casting his eyes on her rounded figure
"you've been in a hurry
that's bad " he laughed in his usual dry  cold  unpleasant way  with his lips only and not with his eyes
"you must walk  walk as much as possible  as much as possible " he said
the little princess did not  or did not wish to  hear his words
she was silent and seemed confused
the prince asked her about her father  and she began to smile and talk
he asked about mutual acquaintances  and she became still more animated and chattered away giving him greetings from various people and retelling the town gossip
"countess apraksina  poor thing  has lost her husband and she has cried her eyes out " she said  growing more and more lively
as she became animated the prince looked at her more and more sternly  and suddenly  as if he had studied her sufficiently and had formed a definite idea of her  he turned away and addressed michael ivanovich
"well  michael ivanovich  our bonaparte will be having a bad time of it
prince andrew"  he always spoke thus of his son  "has been telling me what forces are being collected against him  while you and i never thought much of him " michael ivanovich did not at all know when "you and i" had said such things about bonaparte  but understanding that he was wanted as a peg on which to hang the prince's favorite topic  he looked inquiringly at the young prince  wondering what would follow
"he is a great tactician " said the prince to his son  pointing to the architect
and the conversation again turned on the war  on bonaparte  and the generals and statesmen of the day
the old prince seemed convinced not only that all the men of the day were mere babies who did not know the a b c of war or of politics  and that bonaparte was an insignificant little frenchy  successful only because there were no longer any potemkins or suvorovs left to oppose him  but he was also convinced that there were no political difficulties in europe and no real war  but only a sort of puppet show at which the men of the day were playing  pretending to do something real
prince andrew gaily bore with his father's ridicule of the new men  and drew him on and listened to him with evident pleasure
"the past always seems good " said he  "but did not suvorov himself fall into a trap moreau set him  and from which he did not know how to escape " "who told you that  who " cried the prince "suvorov " and he jerked away his plate  which tikhon briskly caught
"suvorov   
consider  prince andrew
two  
frederick and suvorov  moreau   
moreau would have been a prisoner if suvorov had had a free hand  but he had the hofs kriegs wurst schnappsrath on his hands
it would have puzzled the devil himself  when you get there you'll find out what those hofs kriegs wurst raths are  suvorov couldn't manage them so what chance has michael kutuzov  no  my dear boy " he continued  "you and your generals won't get on against buonaparte  you'll have to call in the french  so that birds of a feather may fight together the german  pahlen  has been sent to new york in america  to fetch the frenchman  moreau " he said  alluding to the invitation made that year to moreau to enter the russian service    "wonderful   
were the potemkins  suvorovs  and orlovs germans  no  lad  either you fellows have all lost your wits  or i have outlived mine
may god help you  but we'll see what will happen
buonaparte has become a great commander among them  hm    " "i don't at all say that all the plans are good " said prince andrew  "i am only surprised at your opinion of bonaparte
you may laugh as much as you like  but all the same bonaparte is a great general " "michael ivanovich " cried the old prince to the architect who  busy with his roast meat  hoped he had been forgotten  "didn't i tell you buonaparte was a great tactician  here  he says the same thing " "to be sure  your excellency " replied the architect
the prince again laughed his frigid laugh
"buonaparte was born with a silver spoon in his mouth
he has got splendid soldiers
besides he began by attacking germans
and only idlers have failed to beat the germans
since the world began everybody has beaten the germans
they beat no one—except one another
he made his reputation fighting them " and the prince began explaining all the blunders which  according to him  bonaparte had made in his campaigns and even in politics
his son made no rejoinder  but it was evident that whatever arguments were presented he was as little able as his father to change his opinion
he listened  refraining from a reply  and involuntarily wondered how this old man  living alone in the country for so many years  could know and discuss so minutely and acutely all the recent european military and political events
"you think i'm an old man and don't understand the present state of affairs " concluded his father
"but it troubles me
i don't sleep at night
come now  where has this great commander of yours shown his skill " he concluded
"that would take too long to tell " answered the son
"well  then go to your buonaparte  mademoiselle bourienne  here's another admirer of that powder monkey emperor of yours " he exclaimed in excellent french
"you know  prince  i am not a bonapartist " "dieu sait quand reviendra   " hummed the prince out of tune and  with a laugh still more so  he quitted the table
the little princess during the whole discussion and the rest of the dinner sat silent  glancing with a frightened look now at her father in law and now at princess mary
when they left the table she took her sister in law's arm and drew her into another room
"what a clever man your father is " said she  "perhaps that is why i am afraid of him " "oh  he is so kind " answered princess mary
prince andrew was to leave next evening
the old prince  not altering his routine  retired as usual after dinner
the little princess was in her sister inlaw's room
prince andrew in a traveling coat without epaulettes had been packing with his valet in the rooms assigned to him after inspecting the carriage himself and seeing the trunks put in  he ordered the horses to be harnessed only those things he always kept with him remained in his room  a small box  a large canteen fitted with silver plate  two turkish pistols and a saber—a present from his father who had brought it from the siege of ochakov
all these traveling effects of prince andrew's were in very good order  new  clean  and in cloth covers carefully tied with tapes
when starting on a journey or changing their mode of life  men capable of reflection are generally in a serious frame of mind
at such moments one reviews the past and plans for the future
prince andrew's face looked very thoughtful and tender
with his hands behind him he paced briskly from corner to corner of the room  looking straight before him and thoughtfully shaking his head
did he fear going to the war  or was he sad at leaving his wife — perhaps both  but evidently he did not wish to be seen in that mood  for hearing footsteps in the passage he hurriedly unclasped his hands  stopped at a table as if tying the cover of the small box  and assumed his usual tranquil and impenetrable expression
it was the heavy tread of princess mary that he heard
"i hear you have given orders to harness " she cried  panting  she had apparently been running   "and i did so wish to have another talk with you alone  god knows how long we may again be parted
you are not angry with me for coming  you have changed so  andrusha " she added  as if to explain such a question
she smiled as she uttered his pet name  "andrusha " it was obviously strange to her to think that this stern handsome man should be andrusha—the slender mischievous boy who had been her playfellow in childhood
"and where is lise " he asked  answering her question only by a smile
"she was so tired that she has fallen asleep on the sofa in my room
oh  andrew  what a treasure of a wife you have " said she  sitting down on the sofa  facing her brother
"she is quite a child  such a dear  merry child
i have grown so fond of her " prince andrew was silent  but the princess noticed the ironical and contemptuous look that showed itself on his face
"one must be indulgent to little weaknesses  who is free from them  andrew  don't forget that she has grown up and been educated in society  and so her position now is not a rosy one
we should enter into everyone's situation
tout comprendre  c'est tout pardonner
* think what it must be for her  poor thing  after what she has been used to  to be parted from her husband and be left alone in the country  in her condition  it's very hard " * to understand all is to forgive all
prince andrew smiled as he looked at his sister  as we smile at those we think we thoroughly understand
"you live in the country and don't think the life terrible " he replied
"i  
that's different
why speak of me  i don't want any other life  and can't  for i know no other
but think  andrew  for a young society woman to be buried in the country during the best years of her life  all alone—for papa is always busy  and i  
well  you know what poor resources i have for entertaining a woman used to the best society
there is only mademoiselle bourienne    " "i don't like your mademoiselle bourienne at all " said prince andrew
"no  she is very nice and kind and  above all  she's much to be pitied
she has no one  no one
to tell the truth  i don't need her  and she's even in my way
you know i always was a savage  and now am even more so
i like being alone   
father likes her very much
she and michael ivanovich are the two people to whom he is always gentle and kind  because he has been a benefactor to them both
as sterne says  'we don't love people so much for the good they have done us  as for the good we have done them ' father took her when she was homeless after losing her own father
she is very good natured  and my father likes her way of reading
she reads to him in the evenings and reads splendidly " "to be quite frank  mary  i expect father's character sometimes makes things trying for you  doesn't it " prince andrew asked suddenly
princess mary was first surprised and then aghast at this question
"for me  for me   
trying for me    " said she
"he always was rather harsh  and now i should think he's getting very trying " said prince andrew  apparently speaking lightly of their father in order to puzzle or test his sister
"you are good in every way  andrew  but you have a kind of intellectual pride " said the princess  following the train of her own thoughts rather than the trend of the conversation—"and that's a great sin
how can one judge father  but even if one might  what feeling except veneration could such a man as my father evoke  and i am so contented and happy with him
i only wish you were all as happy as i am " her brother shook his head incredulously
"the only thing that is hard for me  
i will tell you the truth  andrew  
is father's way of treating religious subjects
i don't understand how a man of his immense intellect can fail to see what is as clear as day  and can go so far astray
that is the only thing that makes me unhappy
but even in this i can see lately a shade of improvement
his satire has been less bitter of late  and there was a monk he received and had a long talk with " "ah  my dear  i am afraid you and your monk are wasting your powder " said prince andrew banteringly yet tenderly
"ah  mon ami  i only pray  and hope that god will hear me
andrew   " she said timidly after a moment's silence  "i have a great favor to ask of you " "what is it  dear " "no—promise that you will not refuse  it will give you no trouble and is nothing unworthy of you  but it will comfort me
promise  andrusha    " said she  putting her hand in her reticule but not yet taking out what she was holding inside it  as if what she held were the subject of her request and must not be shown before the request was granted
she looked timidly at her brother
"even if it were a great deal of trouble   " answered prince andrew  as if guessing what it was about
"think what you please  i know you are just like father
think as you please  but do this for my sake  please do  father's father  our grandfather  wore it in all his wars "  she still did not take out what she was holding in her reticule   "so you promise " "of course
what is it " "andrew  i bless you with this icon and you must promise me you will never take it off
do you promise " "if it does not weigh a hundredweight and won't break my neck  
to please you   " said prince andrew
but immediately  noticing the pained expression his joke had brought to his sister's face  he repented and added  "i am glad  really  dear  i am very glad " "against your will he will save and have mercy on you and bring you to himself  for in him alone is truth and peace " said she in a voice trembling with emotion  solemnly holding up in both hands before her brother a small  oval  antique  dark faced icon of the saviour in a gold setting  on a finely wrought silver chain she crossed herself  kissed the icon  and handed it to andrew
"please  andrew  for my sake    " rays of gentle light shone from her large  timid eyes
those eyes lit up the whole of her thin  sickly face and made it beautiful
her brother would have taken the icon  but she stopped him
andrew understood  crossed himself and kissed the icon there was a look of tenderness  for he was touched  but also a gleam of irony on his face
"thank you  my dear " she kissed him on the forehead and sat down again on the sofa
they were silent for a while
"as i was saying to you  andrew  be kind and generous as you always used to be
don't judge lise harshly " she began
"she is so sweet  so good natured  and her position now is a very hard one " "i do not think i have complained of my wife to you  masha  or blamed her
why do you say all this to me " red patches appeared on princess mary's face and she was silent as if she felt guilty
"i have said nothing to you  but you have already been talked to
and i am sorry for that " he went on
the patches grew deeper on her forehead  neck  and cheeks
she tried to say something but could not
her brother had guessed right  the little princess had been crying after dinner and had spoken of her forebodings about her confinement  and how she dreaded it  and had complained of her fate  her father in law  and her husband
after crying she had fallen asleep
prince andrew felt sorry for his sister
"know this  masha  i can't reproach  have not reproached  and never shall reproach my wife with anything  and i cannot reproach myself with anything in regard to her  and that always will be so in whatever circumstances i may be placed but if you want to know the truth  
if you want to know whether i am happy  no  is she happy  no  but why this is so i don't know   " as he said this he rose  went to his sister  and  stooping  kissed her forehead
his fine eyes lit up with a thoughtful  kindly  and unaccustomed brightness  but he was looking not at his sister but over her head toward the darkness of the open doorway
"let us go to her  i must say good by
or—go and wake and i'll come in a moment
petrushka " he called to his valet  "come here  take these away
put this on the seat and this to the right " princess mary rose and moved to the door  then stopped and said  "andrew  if you had faith you would have turned to god and asked him to give you the love you do not feel  and your prayer would have been answered " "well  may be " said prince andrew
"go  masha  i'll come immediately " on the way to his sister's room  in the passage which connected one wing with the other  prince andrew met mademoiselle bourienne smiling sweetly
it was the third time that day that  with an ecstatic and artless smile  she had met him in secluded passages
"oh  i thought you were in your room " she said  for some reason blushing and dropping her eyes
prince andrew looked sternly at her and an expression of anger suddenly came over his face
he said nothing to her but looked at her forehead and hair  without looking at her eyes  with such contempt that the frenchwoman blushed and went away without a word
when he reached his sister's room his wife was already awake and her merry voice  hurrying one word after another  came through the open door
she was speaking as usual in french  and as if after long self restraint she wished to make up for lost time
"no  but imagine the old countess zubova  with false curls and her mouth full of false teeth  as if she were trying to cheat old age   
ha  ha  ha  mary " this very sentence about countess zubova and this same laugh prince andrew had already heard from his wife in the presence of others some five times
he entered the room softly
the little princess  plump and rosy  was sitting in an easy chair with her work in her hands  talking incessantly  repeating petersburg reminiscences and even phrases
prince andrew came up  stroked her hair  and asked if she felt rested after their journey
she answered him and continued her chatter
the coach with six horses was waiting at the porch
it was an autumn night  so dark that the coachman could not see the carriage pole
servants with lanterns were bustling about in the porch
the immense house was brilliant with lights shining through its lofty windows
the domestic serfs were crowding in the hall  waiting to bid good by to the young prince
the members of the household were all gathered in the reception hall  michael ivanovich  mademoiselle bourienne  princess mary  and the little princess
prince andrew had been called to his father's study as the latter wished to say goodby to him alone
all were waiting for them to come out
when prince andrew entered the study the old man in his old age spectacles and white dressing gown  in which he received no one but his son  sat at the table writing
he glanced round
"going " and he went on writing
"i've come to say good by " "kiss me here " and he touched his cheek  "thanks  thanks " "what do you thank me for " "for not dilly dallying and not hanging to a woman's apron strings
the service before everything
thanks  thanks " and he went on writing  so that his quill spluttered and squeaked
"if you have anything to say  say it
these two things can be done together " he added
"about my wife  
i am ashamed as it is to leave her on your hands   " "why talk nonsense  say what you want " "when her confinement is due  send to moscow for an accoucheur   
let him be here    " the old prince stopped writing and  as if not understanding  fixed his stern eyes on his son
"i know that no one can help if nature does not do her work " said prince andrew  evidently confused
"i know that out of a million cases only one goes wrong  but it is her fancy and mine
they have been telling her things
she has had a dream and is frightened " "hm  
hm   " muttered the old prince to himself  finishing what he was writing "i'll do it " he signed with a flourish and suddenly turning to his son began to laugh
"it's a bad business  eh " "what is bad  father " "the wife " said the old prince  briefly and significantly
"i don't understand " said prince andrew
"no  it can't be helped  lad " said the prince
"they're all like that  one can't unmarry
don't be afraid  i won't tell anyone  but you know it yourself " he seized his son by the hand with small bony fingers  shook it  looked straight into his son's face with keen eyes which seemed to see through him  and again laughed his frigid laugh
the son sighed  thus admitting that his father had understood him
the old man continued to fold and seal his letter  snatching up and throwing down the wax  the seal  and the paper  with his accustomed rapidity
"what's to be done  she's pretty  i will do everything
make your mind easy " said he in abrupt sentences while sealing his letter
andrew did not speak  he was both pleased and displeased that his father understood him
the old man got up and gave the letter to his son
"listen " said he  "don't worry about your wife  what can be done shall be
now listen  give this letter to michael ilarionovich
* i have written that he should make use of you in proper places and not keep you long as an adjutant  a bad position  tell him i remember and like him
write and tell me how he receives you
if he is all right—serve him
nicholas bolkonski's son need not serve under anyone if he is in disfavor
now come here " *kutuzov
he spoke so rapidly that he did not finish half his words  but his son was accustomed to understand him
he led him to the desk  raised the lid  drew out handwriting
"i shall probably die before you
so remember  these are my memoirs  hand them to the emperor after my death
now here is a lombard bond and a letter  it is a premium for the man who writes a history of suvorov's wars
send it to the academy
here are some jottings for you to read when i am gone
you will find them useful " andrew did not tell his father that he would no doubt live a long time yet
he felt that he must not say it
"i will do it all  father " he said
"well  now  good by " he gave his son his hand to kiss  and embraced him
"remember this  prince andrew  if they kill you it will hurt me  your old father   " he paused unexpectedly  and then in a querulous voice suddenly shrieked  "but if i hear that you have not behaved like a son of nicholas bolkonski  i shall be ashamed " "you need not have said that to me  father " said the son with a smile
the old man was silent
"i also wanted to ask you " continued prince andrew  "if i'm killed and if i have a son  do not let him be taken away from you—as i said yesterday  
let him grow up with you   
please " "not let the wife have him " said the old man  and laughed
they stood silent  facing one another
the old man's sharp eyes were fixed straight on his son's
something twitched in the lower part of the old prince's face
"we've said good by
go " he suddenly shouted in a loud  angry voice  opening his door
"what is it  what " asked both princesses when they saw for a moment at the door prince andrew and the figure of the old man in a white dressing gown  spectacled and wigless  shouting in an angry voice
prince andrew sighed and made no reply
"well " he said  turning to his wife
and this "well " sounded coldly ironic  as if he were saying   "now go through your performance " "andrew  already " said the little princess  turning pale and looking with dismay at her husband
he embraced her
she screamed and fell unconscious on his shoulder
he cautiously released the shoulder she leaned on  looked into her face  and carefully placed her in an easy chair
"adieu  mary " said he gently to his sister  taking her by the hand and kissing her  and then he left the room with rapid steps
the little princess lay in the armchair  mademoiselle bourienne chafing her temples
princess mary  supporting her sister in law  still looked with her beautiful eyes full of tears at the door through which prince andrew had gone and made the sign of the cross in his direction
from the study  like pistol shots  came the frequent sound of the old man angrily blowing his nose
hardly had prince andrew gone when the study door opened quickly and the stern figure of the old man in the white dressing gown looked out
"gone  that's all right " said he  and looking angrily at the unconscious little princess  he shook his head reprovingly and slammed the door
in october  1805  a russian army was occupying the villages and towns of the archduchy of austria  and yet other regiments freshly arriving from russia were settling near the fortress of braunau and burdening the inhabitants on whom they were quartered
braunau was the headquarters of the commanderin chief  kutuzov
on october 11  1805  one of the infantry regiments that had just reached braunau had halted half a mile from the town  waiting to be inspected by the commander in chief
despite the un russian appearance of the locality and surroundings—fruit gardens  stone fences  tiled roofs  and hills in the distance —and despite the fact that the inhabitants  who gazed with curiosity at the soldiers  were not russians  the regiment had just the appearance of any russian regiment preparing for an inspection anywhere in the heart of russia
on the evening of the last day's march an order had been received that the commander in chief would inspect the regiment on the march
though the words of the order were not clear to the regimental commander  and the question arose whether the troops were to be in marching order or not  it was decided at a consultation between the battalion commanders to present the regiment in parade order  on the principle that it is always better to "bow too low than not bow low enough " so the soldiers  after a twenty mile march  were kept mending and cleaning all night long without closing their eyes  while the adjutants and company commanders calculated and reckoned  and by morning the regiment—instead of the straggling  disorderly crowd it had been on its last march the day before—presented a well ordered array of two thousand men each of whom knew his place and his duty  had every button and every strap in place  and shone with cleanliness
and not only externally was all in order  but had it pleased the commander in chief to look under the uniforms he would have found on every man a clean shirt  and in every knapsack the appointed number of articles  "awl  soap  and all " as the soldiers say there was only one circumstance concerning which no one could be at ease it was the state of the soldiers' boots
more than half the men's boots were in holes
but this defect was not due to any fault of the regimental commander  for in spite of repeated demands boots had not been issued by the austrian commissariat  and the regiment had marched some seven hundred miles
the commander of the regiment was an elderly  choleric  stout  and thick set general with grizzled eyebrows and whiskers  and wider from chest to back than across the shoulders
he had on a brand new uniform showing the creases where it had been folded and thick gold epaulettes which seemed to stand rather than lie down on his massive shoulders
he had the air of a man happily performing one of the most solemn duties of his life
he walked about in front of the line and at every step pulled himself up  slightly arching his back it was plain that the commander admired his regiment  rejoiced in it  and that his whole mind was engrossed by it  yet his strut seemed to indicate that  besides military matters  social interests and the fair sex occupied no small part of his thoughts
"well  michael mitrich  sir " he said  addressing one of the battalion commanders who smilingly pressed forward  it was plain that they both felt happy 
"we had our hands full last night
however  i think the regiment is not a bad one  eh " the battalion commander perceived the jovial irony and laughed
"it would not be turned off the field even on the tsaritsin meadow " "what " asked the commander
at that moment  on the road from the town on which signalers had been posted  two men appeared on horse back
they were an aide de camp followed by a cossack
the aide de camp was sent to confirm the order which had not been clearly worded the day before  namely  that the commander in chief wished to see the regiment just in the state in which it had been on the march  in their greatcoats  and packs  and without any preparation whatever
a member of the hofkriegsrath from vienna had come to kutuzov the day before with proposals and demands for him to join up with the army of the archduke ferdinand and mack  and kutuzov  not considering this junction advisable  meant  among other arguments in support of his view  to show the austrian general the wretched state in which the troops arrived from russia with this object he intended to meet the regiment  so the worse the condition it was in  the better pleased the commander in chief would be
though the aidede camp did not know these circumstances  he nevertheless delivered the definite order that the men should be in their greatcoats and in marching order  and that the commander in chief would otherwise be dissatisfied on hearing this the regimental commander hung his head  silently shrugged his shoulders  and spread out his arms with a choleric gesture "a fine mess we've made of it " he remarked
"there now  didn't i tell you  michael mitrich  that if it was said 'on the march' it meant in greatcoats " said he reproachfully to the battalion commander
"oh  my god " he added  stepping resolutely forward
"company commanders " he shouted in a voice accustomed to command
"sergeants major   
how soon will he be here " he asked the aide de camp with a respectful politeness evidently relating to the personage he was referring to
"in an hour's time  i should say " "shall we have time to change clothes " "i don't know  general    " the regimental commander  going up to the line himself  ordered the soldiers to change into their greatcoats the company commanders ran off to their companies  the sergeants major began bustling  the greatcoats were not in very good condition   and instantly the squares that had up to then been in regular order and silent began to sway and stretch and hum with voices on all sides soldiers were running to and fro  throwing up their knapsacks with a jerk of their shoulders and pulling the straps over their heads  unstrapping their overcoats and drawing the sleeves on with upraised arms in half an hour all was again in order  only the squares had become gray instead of black
the regimental commander walked with his jerky steps to the front of the regiment and examined it from a distance
"whatever is this  this " he shouted and stood still
"commander of the third company " "commander of the third company wanted by the general   
commander to the general  
third company to the commander " the words passed along the lines and an adjutant ran to look for the missing officer
when the eager but misrepeated words had reached their destination in a cry of  "the general to the third company " the missing officer appeared from behind his company and  though he was a middle aged man and not in the habit of running  trotted awkwardly stumbling on his toes toward the general
the captain's face showed the uneasiness of a schoolboy who is told to repeat a lesson he has not learned
spots appeared on his nose  the redness of which was evidently due to intemperance  and his mouth twitched nervously
the general looked the captain up and down as he came up panting  slackening his pace as he approached
"you will soon be dressing your men in petticoats  what is this " shouted the regimental commander  thrusting forward his jaw and pointing at a soldier in the ranks of the third company in a greatcoat of bluish cloth  which contrasted with the others
"what have you been after  the commander in chief is expected and you leave your place  eh  i'll teach you to dress the men in fancy coats for a parade   
eh    " the commander of the company  with his eyes fixed on his superior  pressed two fingers more and more rigidly to his cap  as if in this pressure lay his only hope of salvation
"well  why don't you speak  whom have you got there dressed up as a hungarian " said the commander with an austere gibe
"your excellency   " "well  your excellency  what  your excellency  but what about your excellency   
nobody knows " "your excellency  it's the officer dolokhov  who has been reduced to the ranks " said the captain softly
"well  has he been degraded into a field marshal  or into a soldier  if a soldier  he should be dressed in regulation uniform like the others " "your excellency  you gave him leave yourself  on the march " "gave him leave  leave  that's just like you young men " said the regimental commander cooling down a little
"leave indeed   
one says a word to you and you  
what " he added with renewed irritation  "i beg you to dress your men decently " and the commander  turning to look at the adjutant  directed his jerky steps down the line
he was evidently pleased at his own display of anger and walking up to the regiment wished to find a further excuse for wrath
having snapped at an officer for an unpolished badge  at another because his line was not straight  he reached the third company
"h o o w are you standing  where's your leg  your leg " shouted the commander with a tone of suffering in his voice  while there were still five men between him and dolokhov with his bluish gray uniform
dolokhov slowly straightened his bent knee  looking straight with his clear  insolent eyes in the general's face
"why a blue coat  off with it  
sergeant major  change his coat  
the ras   " he did not finish
"general  i must obey orders  but i am not bound to endure   " dolokhov hurriedly interrupted
"no talking in the ranks   
no talking  no talking " "not bound to endure insults " dolokhov concluded in loud  ringing tones
the eyes of the general and the soldier met
the general became silent  angrily pulling down his tight scarf
"i request you to have the goodness to change your coat " he said as he turned away
"he's coming " shouted the signaler at that moment
the regimental commander  flushing  ran to his horse  seized the stirrup with trembling hands  threw his body across the saddle  righted himself  drew his saber  and with a happy and resolute countenance  opening his mouth awry  prepared to shout the regiment fluttered like a bird preening its plumage and became motionless
"att ention " shouted the regimental commander in a soul shaking voice which expressed joy for himself  severity for the regiment  and welcome for the approaching chief along the broad country road  edged on both sides by trees  came a high  light blue viennese caleche  slightly creaking on its springs and drawn by six horses at a smart trot
behind the caleche galloped the suite and a convoy of croats
beside kutuzov sat an austrian general  in a white uniform that looked strange among the russian black ones
the caleche stopped in front of the regiment
kutuzov and the austrian general were talking in low voices and kutuzov smiled slightly as treading heavily he stepped down from the carriage just as if those two thousand men breathlessly gazing at him and the regimental commander did not exist
the word of command rang out  and again the regiment quivered  as with a jingling sound it presented arms then amidst a dead silence the feeble voice of the commander in chief was heard
the regiment roared  "health to your ex  
len  
len  
lency " and again all became silent
at first kutuzov stood still while the regiment moved  then he and the general in white  accompanied by the suite  walked between the ranks
from the way the regimental commander saluted the commander in chief and devoured him with his eyes  drawing himself up obsequiously  and from the way he walked through the ranks behind the generals  bending forward and hardly able to restrain his jerky movements  and from the way he darted forward at every word or gesture of the commander in chief  it was evident that he performed his duty as a subordinate with even greater zeal than his duty as a commander thanks to the strictness and assiduity of its commander the regiment  in comparison with others that had reached braunau at the same time  was in splendid condition
there were only 217 sick and stragglers
everything was in good order except the boots
kutuzov walked through the ranks  sometimes stopping to say a few friendly words to officers he had known in the turkish war  sometimes also to the soldiers
looking at their boots he several times shook his head sadly  pointing them out to the austrian general with an expression which seemed to say that he was not blaming anyone  but could not help noticing what a bad state of things it was
the regimental commander ran forward on each such occasion  fearing to miss a single word of the commander in chief's regarding the regiment
behind kutuzov  at a distance that allowed every softly spoken word to be heard  followed some twenty men of his suite
these gentlemen talked among themselves and sometimes laughed nearest of all to the commanderin chief walked a handsome adjutant
this was prince bolkonski
beside him was his comrade nesvitski  a tall staff officer  extremely stout  with a kindly  smiling  handsome face and moist eyes nesvitski could hardly keep from laughter provoked by a swarthy hussar officer who walked beside him
this hussar  with a grave face and without a smile or a change in the expression of his fixed eyes  watched the regimental commander's back and mimicked his every movement
each time the commander started and bent forward  the hussar started and bent forward in exactly the same manner
nesvitski laughed and nudged the others to make them look at the wag
kutuzov walked slowly and languidly past thousands of eyes which were starting from their sockets to watch their chief
on reaching the third company he suddenly stopped
his suite  not having expected this  involuntarily came closer to him
"ah  timokhin " said he  recognizing the red nosed captain who had been reprimanded on account of the blue greatcoat
one would have thought it impossible for a man to stretch himself more than timokhin had done when he was reprimanded by the regimental commander  but now that the commander in chief addressed him he drew himself up to such an extent that it seemed he could not have sustained it had the commander in chief continued to look at him  and so kutuzov  who evidently understood his case and wished him nothing but good  quickly turned away  a scarcely perceptible smile flitting over his scarred and puffy face "another ismail comrade " said he "a brave officer  are you satisfied with him " he asked the regimental commander and the latter—unconscious that he was being reflected in the hussar officer as in a looking glass—started  moved forward  and answered  "highly satisfied  your excellency " "we all have our weaknesses " said kutuzov smiling and walking away from him
"he used to have a predilection for bacchus " the regimental commander was afraid he might be blamed for this and did not answer
the hussar at that moment noticed the face of the red nosed captain and his drawn in stomach  and mimicked his expression and pose with such exactitude that nesvitski could not help laughing
kutuzov turned round
the officer evidently had complete control of his face  and while kutuzov was turning managed to make a grimace and then assume a most serious  deferential  and innocent expression
the third company was the last  and kutuzov pondered  apparently trying to recollect something
prince andrew stepped forward from among the suite and said in french  "you told me to remind you of the officer dolokhov  reduced to the ranks in this regiment " "where is dolokhov " asked kutuzov
dolokhov  who had already changed into a soldier's gray greatcoat  did not wait to be called
the shapely figure of the fair haired soldier  with his clear blue eyes  stepped forward from the ranks  went up to the commander in chief  and presented arms "have you a complaint to make " kutuzov asked with a slight frown
"this is dolokhov " said prince andrew
"ah " said kutuzov
"i hope this will be a lesson to you
do your duty
the emperor is gracious  and i shan't forget you if you deserve well " the clear blue eyes looked at the commander in chief just as boldly as they had looked at the regimental commander  seeming by their expression to tear open the veil of convention that separates a commander in chief so widely from a private
"one thing i ask of your excellency " dolokhov said in his firm  ringing  deliberate voice
"i ask an opportunity to atone for my fault and prove my devotion to his majesty the emperor and to russia " kutuzov turned away
the same smile of the eyes with which he had turned from captain timokhin again flitted over his face
he turned away with a grimace as if to say that everything dolokhov had said to him and everything he could say had long been known to him  that he was weary of it and it was not at all what he wanted
he turned away and went to the carriage
the regiment broke up into companies  which went to their appointed quarters near braunau  where they hoped to receive boots and clothes and to rest after their hard marches
"you won't bear me a grudge  prokhor ignatych " said the regimental commander  overtaking the third company on its way to its quarters and riding up to captain timokhin who was walking in front
 the regimental commander's face now that the inspection was happily over beamed with irrepressible delight   "it's in the emperor's service  
it can't be helped  
one is sometimes a bit hasty on parade  
i am the first to apologize  you know me   
he was very pleased " and he held out his hand to the captain
"don't mention it  general  as if i'd be so bold " replied the captain  his nose growing redder as he gave a smile which showed where two front teeth were missing that had been knocked out by the butt end of a gun at ismail
"and tell mr dolokhov that i won't forget him—he may be quite easy
and tell me  please—i've been meaning to ask—how is he behaving himself  and in general   " "as far as the service goes he is quite punctilious  your excellency  but his character   " said timokhin "and what about his character " asked the regimental commander
"it's different on different days " answered the captain
"one day he is sensible  well educated  and good natured  and the next he's a wild beast   
in poland  if you please  he nearly killed a jew " "oh  well  well " remarked the regimental commander
"still  one must have pity on a young man in misfortune
you know he has important connections  
well  then  you just   " "i will  your excellency " said timokhin  showing by his smile that he understood his commander's wish
"well  of course  of course " the regimental commander sought out dolokhov in the ranks and  reining in his horse  said to him  "after the next affair  
epaulettes " dolokhov looked round but did not say anything  nor did the mocking smile on his lips change
"well  that's all right " continued the regimental commander
"a cup of vodka for the men from me " he added so that the soldiers could hear
"i thank you all  god be praised " and he rode past that company and overtook the next one
"well  he's really a good fellow  one can serve under him " said timokhin to the subaltern beside him
"in a word  a hearty one   " said the subaltern  laughing  the regimental commander was nicknamed king of hearts 
the cheerful mood of their officers after the inspection infected the soldiers
the company marched on gaily
the soldiers' voices could be heard on every side
"and they said kutuzov was blind of one eye " "and so he is  quite blind " "no  friend  he is sharper eyed than you are
boots and leg bands  
he noticed everything   " "when he looked at my feet  friend  
well  thinks i   " "and that other one with him  the austrian  looked as if he were smeared with chalk—as white as flour  i suppose they polish him up as they do the guns " "i say  fedeshon   
did he say when the battles are to begin  you were near him
everybody said that buonaparte himself was at braunau " "buonaparte himself    just listen to the fool  what he doesn't know  the prussians are up in arms now the austrians  you see  are putting them down
when they've been put down  the war with buonaparte will begin
and he says buonaparte is in braunau  shows you're a fool
you'd better listen more carefully " "what devils these quartermasters are  see  the fifth company is turning into the village already  
they will have their buckwheat cooked before we reach our quarters " "give me a biscuit  you devil " "and did you give me tobacco yesterday  that's just it  friend  ah  well  never mind  here you are " "they might call a halt here or we'll have to do another four miles without eating " "wasn't it fine when those germans gave us lifts  you just sit still and are drawn along " "and here  friend  the people are quite beggarly
there they all seemed to be poles—all under the russian crown—but here they're all regular germans " "singers to the front" came the captain's order
and from the different ranks some twenty men ran to the front
a drummer  their leader  turned round facing the singers  and flourishing his arm  began a long drawn out soldiers' song  commencing with the words  "morning dawned  the sun was rising " and concluding  "on then  brothers  on to glory  led by father kamenski " this song had been composed in the turkish campaign and now being sung in austria  the only change being that the words "father kamenski" were replaced by "father kutuzov " having jerked out these last words as soldiers do and waved his arms as if flinging something to the ground  the drummer—a lean  handsome soldier of forty—looked sternly at the singers and screwed up his eyes then having satisfied himself that all eyes were fixed on him  he raised both arms as if carefully lifting some invisible but precious object above his head and  holding it there for some seconds  suddenly flung it down and began  "oh  my bower  oh  my bower    " "oh  my bower new    " chimed in twenty voices  and the castanet player  in spite of the burden of his equipment  rushed out to the front and  walking backwards before the company  jerked his shoulders and flourished his castanets as if threatening someone the soldiers  swinging their arms and keeping time spontaneously  marched with long steps behind the company the sound of wheels  the creaking of springs  and the tramp of horses' hoofs were heard
kutuzov and his suite were returning to the town
the commander inchief made a sign that the men should continue to march at ease  and he and all his suite showed pleasure at the sound of the singing and the sight of the dancing soldier and the gay and smartly marching men
in the second file from the right flank  beside which the carriage passed the company  a blue eyed soldier involuntarily attracted notice
it was dolokhov marching with particular grace and boldness in time to the song and looking at those driving past as if he pitied all who were not at that moment marching with the company
the hussar cornet of kutuzov's suite who had mimicked the regimental commander  fell back from the carriage and rode up to dolokhov
hussar cornet zherkov had at one time  in petersburg  belonged to the wild set led by dolokhov
zherkov had met dolokhov abroad as a private and had not seen fit to recognize him
but now that kutuzov had spoken to the gentleman ranker  he addressed him with the cordiality of an old friend
"my dear fellow  how are you " said he through the singing  making his horse keep pace with the company
"how am i " dolokhov answered coldly
"i am as you see " the lively song gave a special flavor to the tone of free and easy gaiety with which zherkov spoke  and to the intentional coldness of dolokhov's reply
"and how do you get on with the officers " inquired zherkov
"all right
they are good fellows
and how have you wriggled onto the staff " "i was attached  i'm on duty " both were silent
"she let the hawk fly upward from her wide right sleeve " went the song  arousing an involuntary sensation of courage and cheerfulness
their conversation would probably have been different but for the effect of that song
"is it true that austrians have been beaten " asked dolokhov
"the devil only knows  they say so " "i'm glad " answered dolokhov briefly and clearly  as the song demanded
"i say  come round some evening and we'll have a game of faro " said zherkov
"why  have you too much money " "do come " "i can't
i've sworn not to
i won't drink and won't play till i get reinstated " "well  that's only till the first engagement " "we shall see " they were again silent
"come if you need anything
one can at least be of use on the staff   " dolokhov smiled
"don't trouble
if i want anything  i won't beg—i'll take it " "well  never mind  i only   " "and i only   " "good bye " "good health   " "it's a long  long way
to my native land   " zherkov touched his horse with the spurs  it pranced excitedly from foot to foot uncertain with which to start  then settled down  galloped past the company  and overtook the carriage  still keeping time to the song
on returning from the review  kutuzov took the austrian general into his private room and  calling his adjutant  asked for some papers relating to the condition of the troops on their arrival  and the letters that had come from the archduke ferdinand  who was in command of the advanced army
prince andrew bolkonski came into the room with the required papers
kutuzov and the austrian member of the hofkriegsrath were sitting at the table on which a plan was spread out
"ah    " said kutuzov glancing at bolkonski as if by this exclamation he was asking the adjutant to wait  and he went on with the conversation in french
"all i can say  general " said he with a pleasant elegance of expression and intonation that obliged one to listen to each deliberately spoken word
it was evident that kutuzov himself listened with pleasure to his own voice "all i can say  general  is that if the matter depended on my personal wishes  the will of his majesty the emperor francis would have been fulfilled long ago
i should long ago have joined the archduke
and believe me on my honour that to me personally it would be a pleasure to hand over the supreme command of the army into the hands of a better informed and more skillful general—of whom austria has so many—and to lay down all this heavy responsibility
but circumstances are sometimes too strong for us  general " and kutuzov smiled in a way that seemed to say  "you are quite at liberty not to believe me and i don't even care whether you do or not  but you have no grounds for telling me so and that is the whole point " the austrian general looked dissatisfied  but had no option but to reply in the same tone
"on the contrary " he said  in a querulous and angry tone that contrasted with his flattering words  "on the contrary  your excellency's participation in the common action is highly valued by his majesty  but we think the present delay is depriving the splendid russian troops and their commander of the laurels they have been accustomed to win in their battles " he concluded his evidently prearranged sentence
kutuzov bowed with the same smile
"but that is my conviction  and judging by the last letter with which his highness the archduke ferdinand has honored me  i imagine that the austrian troops  under the direction of so skillful a leader as general mack  have by now already gained a decisive victory and no longer need our aid " said kutuzov
the general frowned
though there was no definite news of an austrian defeat  there were many circumstances confirming the unfavorable rumors that were afloat  and so kutuzov's suggestion of an austrian victory sounded much like irony but kutuzov went on blandly smiling with the same expression  which seemed to say that he had a right to suppose so
and  in fact  the last letter he had received from mack's army informed him of a victory and stated strategically the position of the army was very favorable
"give me that letter " said kutuzov turning to prince andrew
"please have a look at it"—and kutuzov with an ironical smile about the corners of his mouth read to the austrian general the following passage  in german  from the archduke ferdinand's letter  we have fully concentrated forces of nearly seventy thousand men with which to attack and defeat the enemy should he cross the lech
also  as we are masters of ulm  we cannot be deprived of the advantage of commanding both sides of the danube  so that should the enemy not cross the lech  we can cross the danube  throw ourselves on his line of communications  recross the river lower down  and frustrate his intention should he try to direct his whole force against our faithful ally
we shall therefore confidently await the moment when the imperial russian army will be fully equipped  and shall then  in conjunction with it  easily find a way to prepare for the enemy the fate he deserves
kutuzov sighed deeply on finishing this paragraph and looked at the member of the hofkriegsrath mildly and attentively
"but you know the wise maxim your excellency  advising one to expect the worst " said the austrian general  evidently wishing to have done with jests and to come to business
he involuntarily looked round at the aide de camp
"excuse me  general " interrupted kutuzov  also turning to prince andrew
"look here  my dear fellow  get from kozlovski all the reports from our scouts
here are two letters from count nostitz and here is one from his highness the archduke ferdinand and here are these " he said  handing him several papers  "make a neat memorandum in french out of all this  showing all the news we have had of the movements of the austrian army  and then give it to his excellency " prince andrew bowed his head in token of having understood from the first not only what had been said but also what kutuzov would have liked to tell him
he gathered up the papers and with a bow to both  stepped softly over the carpet and went out into the waiting room
though not much time had passed since prince andrew had left russia  he had changed greatly during that period
in the expression of his face  in his movements  in his walk  scarcely a trace was left of his former affected languor and indolence
he now looked like a man who has time to think of the impression he makes on others  but is occupied with agreeable and interesting work
his face expressed more satisfaction with himself and those around him  his smile and glance were brighter and more attractive kutuzov  whom he had overtaken in poland  had received him very kindly  promised not to forget him  distinguished him above the other adjutants  and had taken him to vienna and given him the more serious commissions
from vienna kutuzov wrote to his old comrade  prince andrew's father your son bids fair to become an officer distinguished by his industry  firmness  and expedition
i consider myself fortunate to have such a subordinate by me
on kutuzov's staff  among his fellow officers and in the army generally  prince andrew had  as he had had in petersburg society  two quite opposite reputations
some  a minority  acknowledged him to be different from themselves and from everyone else  expected great things of him  listened to him  admired  and imitated him  and with them prince andrew was natural and pleasant others  the majority  disliked him and considered him conceited  cold  and disagreeable
but among these people prince andrew knew how to take his stand so that they respected and even feared him
coming out of kutuzov's room into the waiting room with the papers in his hand prince andrew came up to his comrade  the aide de camp on duty  "well  prince " asked kozlovski "i am ordered to write a memorandum explaining why we are not advancing " "and why is it " prince andrew shrugged his shoulders
"any news from mack " "no " "if it were true that he has been beaten  news would have come " "probably " said prince andrew moving toward the outer door
but at that instant a tall austrian general in a greatcoat  with the order of maria theresa on his neck and a black bandage round his head  who had evidently just arrived  entered quickly  slamming the door
prince andrew stopped short
"commander in chief kutuzov " said the newly arrived general speaking quickly with a harsh german accent  looking to both sides and advancing straight toward the inner door
"the commander in chief is engaged " said kozlovski  going hurriedly up to the unknown general and blocking his way to the door
"whom shall i announce " the unknown general looked disdainfully down at kozlovski  who was rather short  as if surprised that anyone should not know him
"the commander in chief is engaged " repeated kozlovski calmly
the general's face clouded  his lips quivered and trembled
he took out a kozlovski  stepped quickly to the window  and threw himself into a chair  gazing at those in the room as if asking  "why do they look at me " then he lifted his head  stretched his neck as if he intended to say something  but immediately  with affected indifference  began to hum to himself  producing a queer sound which immediately broke off the door of the private room opened and kutuzov appeared in the doorway the general with the bandaged head bent forward as though running away from some danger  and  making long  quick strides with his thin legs  went up to kutuzov
"vous voyez le malheureux mack " he uttered in a broken voice
kutuzov's face as he stood in the open doorway remained perfectly immobile for a few moments
then wrinkles ran over his face like a wave and his forehead became smooth again  he bowed his head respectfully  closed his eyes  silently let mack enter his room before him  and closed the door himself behind him the report which had been circulated that the austrians had been beaten and that the whole army had surrendered at ulm proved to be correct
within half an hour adjutants had been sent in various directions with orders which showed that the russian troops  who had hitherto been inactive  would also soon have to meet the enemy
prince andrew was one of those rare staff officers whose chief interest lay in the general progress of the war
when he saw mack and heard the details of his disaster he understood that half the campaign was lost  understood all the difficulties of the russian army's position  and vividly imagined what awaited it and the part he would have to play
involuntarily he felt a joyful agitation at the thought of the humiliation of arrogant austria and that in a week's time he might  perhaps  see and take part in the first russian encounter with the french since suvorov met them
he feared that bonaparte's genius might outweigh all the courage of the russian troops  and at the same time could not admit the idea of his hero being disgraced
excited and irritated by these thoughts prince andrew went toward his room to write to his father  to whom he wrote every day
in the corridor he met nesvitski  with whom he shared a room  and the wag zherkov  they were as usual laughing
"why are you so glum " asked nesvitski noticing prince andrew's pale face and glittering eyes
"there's nothing to be gay about " answered bolkonski
just as prince andrew met nesvitski and zherkov  there came toward them from the other end of the corridor  strauch  an austrian general who on kutuzov's staff in charge of the provisioning of the russian army  and the member of the hofkriegsrath who had arrived the previous evening
there was room enough in the wide corridor for the generals to pass the three officers quite easily  but zherkov  pushing nesvitski aside with his arm  said in a breathless voice  "they're coming   
they're coming   
stand aside  make way  please make way " the generals were passing by  looking as if they wished to avoid embarrassing attentions
on the face of the wag zherkov there suddenly appeared a stupid smile of glee which he seemed unable to suppress
"your excellency " said he in german  stepping forward and addressing the austrian general  "i have the honor to congratulate you " he bowed his head and scraped first with one foot and then with the other  awkwardly  like a child at a dancing lesson
the member of the hofkriegsrath looked at him severely but  seeing the seriousness of his stupid smile  could not but give him a moment's attention
he screwed up his eyes showing that he was listening
"i have the honor to congratulate you
general mack has arrived  quite well  only a little bruised just here " he added  pointing with a beaming smile to his head
the general frowned  turned away  and went on
"gott  wie naiv " * said he angrily  after he had gone a few steps
* "good god  what simplicity " nesvitski with a laugh threw his arms round prince andrew  but bolkonski  turning still paler  pushed him away with an angry look and turned to zherkov the nervous irritation aroused by the appearance of mack  the news of his defeat  and the thought of what lay before the russian army found vent in anger at zherkov's untimely jest
"if you  sir  choose to make a buffoon of yourself " he said sharply  with a slight trembling of the lower jaw  "i can't prevent your doing so  but i warn you that if you dare to play the fool in my presence  i will teach you to behave yourself " nesvitski and zherkov were so surprised by this outburst that they gazed at bolkonski silently with wide open eyes
"what's the matter  i only congratulated them " said zherkov
"i am not jesting with you  please be silent " cried bolkonski  and taking nesvitski's arm he left zherkov  who did not know what to say
"come  what's the matter  old fellow " said nesvitski trying to soothe him
"what's the matter " exclaimed prince andrew standing still in his excitement
"don't you understand that either we are officers serving our tsar and our country  rejoicing in the successes and grieving at the misfortunes of our common cause  or we are merely lackeys who care nothing for their master's business
quarante mille hommes massacres et l'armee de nos allies detruite  et vous trouvez la le mot pour rire " * he said  as if strengthening his views by this french sentence
"c'est bien pour un garcon de rien comme cet individu dont vous avez fait un ami  mais pas pour vous  pas pour vous
* 2  only a hobbledehoy could amuse himself in this way " he added in russian— but pronouncing the word with a french accent—having noticed that zherkov could still hear him * "forty thousand men massacred and the army of our allies destroyed  and you find that a cause for jesting " *  2  "it is all very well for that good for nothing fellow of whom you have made a friend  but not for you  not for you " he waited a moment to see whether the cornet would answer  but he turned and went out of the corridor
the pavlograd hussars were stationed two miles from braunau
the squadron in which nicholas rostov served as a cadet was quartered in the german village of salzeneck
the best quarters in the village were assigned to cavalrycaptain denisov  the squadron commander  known throughout the whole cavalry division as vaska denisov
cadet rostov  ever since he had overtaken the regiment in poland  had lived with the squadron commander
on october 11  the day when all was astir at headquarters over the news of mack's defeat  the camp life of the officers of this squadron was proceeding as usual
denisov  who had been losing at cards all night  had not yet come home when rostov rode back early in the morning from a foraging expedition
rostov in his cadet uniform  with a jerk to his horse  rode up to the porch  swung his leg over the saddle with a supple youthful movement  stood for a moment in the stirrup as if loathe to part from his horse  and at last sprang down and called to his orderly
"ah  bondarenko  dear friend " said he to the hussar who rushed up headlong to the horse
"walk him up and down  my dear fellow " he continued  with that gay brotherly cordiality which goodhearted young people show to everyone when they are happy
"yes  your excellency " answered the ukrainian gaily  tossing his head
"mind  walk him up and down well " another hussar also rushed toward the horse  but bondarenko had already thrown the reins of the snaffle bridle over the horse's head
it was evident that the cadet was liberal with his tips and that it paid to serve him
rostov patted the horse's neck and then his flank  and lingered for a moment
"splendid  what a horse he will be " he thought with a smile  and holding up his saber  his spurs jingling  he ran up the steps of the porch
his landlord  who in a waistcoat and a pointed cap  pitchfork in hand  was clearing manure from the cowhouse  looked out  and his face immediately brightened on seeing rostov
"schon gut morgen  schon gut morgen " * he said winking with a merry smile  evidently pleased to greet the young man
* "a very good morning  a very good morning " "schon fleissig " * said rostov with the same gay brotherly smile which did not leave his eager face
"hoch oestreicher  hoch russen  kaiser alexander hoch " * 2  said he  quoting words often repeated by the german landlord
* "busy already " *  2  "hurrah for the austrians  hurrah for the russians  hurrah for emperor alexander " the german laughed  came out of the cowshed  pulled off his cap  and waving it above his head cried  "und die ganze welt hoch " * * "and hurrah for the whole world " rostov waved his cap above his head like the german and cried laughing  "und vivat die ganze welt " though neither the german cleaning his cowshed nor rostov back with his platoon from foraging for hay had any reason for rejoicing  they looked at each other with joyful delight and brotherly love  wagged their heads in token of their mutual affection  and parted smiling  the german returning to his cowshed and rostov going to the cottage he occupied with denisov
"what about your master " he asked lavrushka  denisov's orderly  whom all the regiment knew for a rogue
"hasn't been in since the evening
must have been losing " answered lavrushka
"i know by now  if he wins he comes back early to brag about it  but if he stays out till morning it means he's lost and will come back in a rage
will you have coffee " "yes  bring some " ten minutes later lavrushka brought the coffee
"he's coming " said he
"now for trouble " rostov looked out of the window and saw denisov coming home
denisov was a small man with a red face  sparkling black eyes  and black tousled mustache and hair
he wore an unfastened cloak  wide breeches hanging down in creases  and a crumpled shako on the back of his head
he came up to the porch gloomily  hanging his head
"lavwuska " he shouted loudly and angrily  "take it off  blockhead " "well  i am taking it off " replied lavrushka's voice
"ah  you're up already " said denisov  entering the room
"long ago " answered rostov  "i have already been for the hay  and have seen fraulein mathilde " "weally  and i've been losing  bwother
i lost yesterday like a damned fool " cried denisov  not pronouncing his r's
"such ill luck  such ill luck
as soon as you left  it began and went on
hullo there  tea " puckering up his face though smiling  and showing his short strong teeth  he began with stubby fingers of both hands to ruffle up his thick tangled black hair
"and what devil made me go to that wat "  an officer nicknamed "the rat"  he said  rubbing his forehead and whole face with both hands
"just fancy  he didn't let me win a single cahd  not one cahd " he took the lighted pipe that was offered to him  gripped it in his fist  and tapped it on the floor  making the sparks fly  while he continued to shout
"he lets one win the singles and collahs it as soon as one doubles it  gives the singles and snatches the doubles " he scattered the burning tobacco  smashed the pipe  and threw it away
then he remained silent for a while  and all at once looked cheerfully with his glittering  black eyes at rostov
"if at least we had some women here  but there's nothing foh one to do but dwink
if we could only get to fighting soon
hullo  who's there " he said  turning to the door as he heard a tread of heavy boots and the clinking of spurs that came to a stop  and a respectful cough
"the squadron quartermaster " said lavrushka
denisov's face puckered still more
"wetched " he muttered  throwing down a purse with some gold in it "wostov  deah fellow  just see how much there is left and shove the purse undah the pillow " he said  and went out to the quartermaster
rostov took the money and  mechanically arranging the old and new coins in separate piles  began counting them
"ah  telyanin  how d'ye do  they plucked me last night " came denisov's voice from the next room
"where  at bykov's  at the rat's  
i knew it " replied a piping voice  and lieutenant telyanin  a small officer of the same squadron  entered the room
rostov thrust the purse under the pillow and shook the damp little hand which was offered him
telyanin for some reason had been transferred from the guards just before this campaign
he behaved very well in the regiment but was not liked  rostov especially detested him and was unable to overcome or conceal his groundless antipathy to the man
"well  young cavalryman  how is my rook behaving " he asked
 rook was a young horse telyanin had sold to rostov   the lieutenant never looked the man he was speaking to straight in the face  his eyes continually wandered from one object to another
"i saw you riding this morning   " he added
"oh  he's all right  a good horse " answered rostov  though the horse for which he had paid seven hundred rubbles was not worth half that sum
"he's begun to go a little lame on the left foreleg " he added
"the hoof's cracked  that's nothing
i'll teach you what to do and show you what kind of rivet to use " "yes  please do " said rostov
"i'll show you  i'll show you  it's not a secret
and it's a horse you'll thank me for " "then i'll have it brought round " said rostov wishing to avoid telyanin  and he went out to give the order
in the passage denisov  with a pipe  was squatting on the threshold facing the quartermaster who was reporting to him
on seeing rostov  denisov screwed up his face and pointing over his shoulder with his thumb to the room where telyanin was sitting  he frowned and gave a shudder of disgust
"ugh  i don't like that fellow " he said  regardless of the quartermaster's presence
rostov shrugged his shoulders as much as to say  "nor do i  but what's one to do " and  having given his order  he returned to telyanin
telyanin was sitting in the same indolent pose in which rostov had left him  rubbing his small white hands
"well there certainly are disgusting people " thought rostov as he entered
"have you told them to bring the horse " asked telyanin  getting up and looking carelessly about him
"i have " "let us go ourselves
i only came round to ask denisov about yesterday's order
have you got it  denisov " "not yet
but where are you off to " "i want to teach this young man how to shoe a horse " said telyanin
they went through the porch and into the stable
the lieutenant explained how to rivet the hoof and went away to his own quarters
when rostov went back there was a bottle of vodka and a sausage on the table
denisov was sitting there scratching with his pen on a sheet of paper
he looked gloomily in rostov's face and said  "i am witing to her " he leaned his elbows on the table with his pen in his hand and  evidently glad of a chance to say quicker in words what he wanted to write  told rostov the contents of his letter
"you see  my fwiend " he said  "we sleep when we don't love
we are childwen of the dust  
but one falls in love and one is a god  one is pua' as on the first day of cweation  
who's that now  send him to the devil  i'm busy " he shouted to lavrushka  who went up to him not in the least abashed
"who should it be  you yourself told him to come
it's the quartermaster for the money " denisov frowned and was about to shout some reply but stopped
"wetched business " he muttered to himself "how much is left in the puhse " he asked  turning to rostov "seven new and three old imperials " "oh  it's wetched  well  what are you standing there for  you sca'cwow  call the quahtehmasteh " he shouted to lavrushka "please  denisov  let me lend you some  i have some  you know " said rostov  blushing
"don't like bowwowing from my own fellows  i don't " growled denisov
"but if you won't accept money from me like a comrade  you will offend me really i have some " rostov repeated
"no  i tell you " and denisov went to the bed to get the purse from under the pillow
"where have you put it  wostov " "under the lower pillow " "it's not there " denisov threw both pillows on the floor
the purse was not there
"that's a miwacle " "wait  haven't you dropped it " said rostov  picking up the pillows one at a time and shaking them
he pulled off the quilt and shook it
the purse was not there
"dear me  can i have forgotten  no  i remember thinking that you kept it under your head like a treasure " said rostov
"i put it just here
where is it " he asked  turning to lavrushka
"i haven't been in the room
it must be where you put it " "but it isn't    " "you're always like that  you thwow a thing down anywhere and forget it
feel in your pockets " "no  if i hadn't thought of it being a treasure " said rostov  "but i remember putting it there " lavrushka turned all the bedding over  looked under the bed and under the table  searched everywhere  and stood still in the middle of the room
denisov silently watched lavrushka's movements  and when the latter threw up his arms in surprise saying it was nowhere to be found denisov glanced at rostov "wostov  you've not been playing schoolboy twicks   " rostov felt denisov's gaze fixed on him  raised his eyes  and instantly dropped them again
all the blood which had seemed congested somewhere below his throat rushed to his face and eyes
he could not draw breath
"and there hasn't been anyone in the room except the lieutenant and yourselves
it must be here somewhere " said lavrushka
"now then  you devil's puppet  look alive and hunt for it " shouted denisov  suddenly  turning purple and rushing at the man with a threatening gesture
"if the purse isn't found i'll flog you  i'll flog you all " rostov  his eyes avoiding denisov  began buttoning his coat  buckled on his saber  and put on his cap
"i must have that purse  i tell you " shouted denisov  shaking his orderly by the shoulders and knocking him against the wall
"denisov  let him alone  i know who has taken it " said rostov  going toward the door without raising his eyes
denisov paused  thought a moment  and  evidently understanding what rostov hinted at  seized his arm
"nonsense " he cried  and the veins on his forehead and neck stood out like cords
"you are mad  i tell you
i won't allow it
the purse is here  i'll flay this scoundwel alive  and it will be found " "i know who has taken it " repeated rostov in an unsteady voice  and went to the door
"and i tell you  don't you dahe to do it " shouted denisov  rushing at the cadet to restrain him
but rostov pulled away his arm and  with as much anger as though denisov were his worst enemy  firmly fixed his eyes directly on his face
"do you understand what you're saying " he said in a trembling voice
"there was no one else in the room except myself
so that if it is not so  then   " he could not finish  and ran out of the room
"ah  may the devil take you and evewybody " were the last words rostov heard
rostov went to telyanin's quarters
"the master is not in  he's gone to headquarters " said telyanin's orderly
"has something happened " he added  surprised at the cadet's troubled face
"no  nothing " "you've only just missed him " said the orderly
the headquarters were situated two miles away from salzeneck  and rostov  without returning home  took a horse and rode there
there was an inn in the village which the officers frequented
rostov rode up to it and saw telyanin's horse at the porch
in the second room of the inn the lieutenant was sitting over a dish of sausages and a bottle of wine
"ah  you've come here too  young man " he said  smiling and raising his eyebrows
"yes " said rostov as if it cost him a great deal to utter the word  and he sat down at the nearest table
both were silent
there were two germans and a russian officer in the room
no one spoke and the only sounds heard were the clatter of knives and the munching of the lieutenant
when telyanin had finished his lunch he took out of his pocket a double purse and  drawing its rings aside with his small  white  turned up fingers  drew out a gold imperial  and lifting his eyebrows gave it to the waiter
"please be quick " he said
the coin was a new one
rostov rose and went up to telyanin
"allow me to look at your purse " he said in a low  almost inaudible  voice
with shifting eyes but eyebrows still raised  telyanin handed him the purse
"yes  it's a nice purse
yes  yes " he said  growing suddenly pale  and added  "look at it  young man " rostov took the purse in his hand  examined it and the money in it  and looked at telyanin
the lieutenant was looking about in his usual way and suddenly seemed to grow very merry
"if we get to vienna i'll get rid of it there but in these wretched little towns there's nowhere to spend it " said he "well  let me have it  young man  i'm going " rostov did not speak
"and you  are you going to have lunch too  they feed you quite decently here " continued telyanin
"now then  let me have it " he stretched out his hand to take hold of the purse rostov let go of it
telyanin took the purse and began carelessly slipping it into the pocket of his riding breeches  with his eyebrows lifted and his mouth slightly open  as if to say  "yes  yes  i am putting my purse in my pocket and that's quite simple and is no one else's business " "well  young man " he said with a sigh  and from under his lifted brows he glanced into rostov's eyes
some flash as of an electric spark shot from telyanin's eyes to rostov's and back  and back again and again in an instant
"come here " said rostov  catching hold of telyanin's arm and almost dragging him to the window
"that money is denisov's  you took it   " he whispered just above telyanin's ear
"what  what  how dare you  what " said telyanin
but these words came like a piteous  despairing cry and an entreaty for pardon
as soon as rostov heard them  an enormous load of doubt fell from him
he was glad  and at the same instant began to pity the miserable man who stood before him  but the task he had begun had to be completed
"heaven only knows what the people here may imagine " muttered telyanin  taking up his cap and moving toward a small empty room
"we must have an explanation   " "i know it and shall prove it " said rostov
"i   " every muscle of telyanin's pale  terrified face began to quiver  his eyes still shifted from side to side but with a downward look not rising to rostov's face  and his sobs were audible
"count   
don't ruin a young fellow  
here is this wretched money  take it   " he threw it on the table "i have an old father and mother    " rostov took the money  avoiding telyanin's eyes  and went out of the room without a word
but at the door he stopped and then retraced his steps
"o god " he said with tears in his eyes  "how could you do it " "count   " said telyanin drawing nearer to him
"don't touch me " said rostov  drawing back
"if you need it  take the money " and he threw the purse to him and ran out of the inn
that same evening there was an animated discussion among the squadron's officers in denisov's quarters
"and i tell you  rostov  that you must apologize to the colonel " said a tall  grizzly haired staff captain  with enormous mustaches and many wrinkles on his large features  to rostov who was crimson with excitement the staff captain  kirsten  had twice been reduced to the ranks for affairs of honor and had twice regained his commission
"i will allow no one to call me a liar " cried rostov
"he told me i lied  and i told him he lied
and there it rests
he may keep me on duty every day  or may place me under arrest  but no one can make me apologize  because if he  as commander of this regiment  thinks it beneath his dignity to give me satisfaction  then   " "you just wait a moment  my dear fellow  and listen " interrupted the staff captain in his deep bass  calmly stroking his long mustache
"you tell the colonel in the presence of other officers that an officer has stolen   " "i'm not to blame that the conversation began in the presence of other officers
perhaps i ought not to have spoken before them  but i am not a diplomatist
that's why i joined the hussars  thinking that here one would not need finesse  and he tells me that i am lying—so let him give me satisfaction   " "that's all right
no one thinks you a coward  but that's not the point
ask denisov whether it is not out of the question for a cadet to demand satisfaction of his regimental commander " denisov sat gloomily biting his mustache and listening to the conversation  evidently with no wish to take part in it
he answered the staff captain's question by a disapproving shake of his head
"you speak to the colonel about this nasty business before other officers " continued the staff captain  "and bogdanich"  the colonel was called bogdanich  "shuts you up " "he did not shut me up  he said i was telling an untruth " "well  have it so  and you talked a lot of nonsense to him and must apologize " "not on any account " exclaimed rostov
"i did not expect this of you " said the staff captain seriously and severely
"you don't wish to apologize  but  man  it's not only to him but to the whole regiment—all of us—you're to blame all round
the case is this  you ought to have thought the matter over and taken advice  but no  you go and blurt it all straight out before the officers
now what was the colonel to do  have the officer tried and disgrace the whole regiment  disgrace the whole regiment because of one scoundrel  is that how you look at it  we don't see it like that
and bogdanich was a brick  he told you you were saying what was not true
it's not pleasant  but what's to be done  my dear fellow  you landed yourself in it
and now  when one wants to smooth the thing over  some conceit prevents your apologizing  and you wish to make the whole affair public
you are offended at being put on duty a bit  but why not apologize to an old and honorable officer  whatever bogdanich may be  anyway he is an honorable and brave old colonel  you're quick at taking offense  but you don't mind disgracing the whole regiment " the staff captain's voice began to tremble
"you have been in the regiment next to no time  my lad  you're here today and tomorrow you'll be appointed adjutant somewhere and can snap your fingers when it is said 'there are thieves among the pavlograd officers ' but it's not all the same to us  am i not right  denisov  it's not the same " denisov remained silent and did not move  but occasionally looked with his glittering black eyes at rostov
"you value your own pride and don't wish to apologize " continued the staff captain  "but we old fellows  who have grown up in and  god willing  are going to die in the regiment  we prize the honor of the regiment  and bogdanich knows it
oh  we do prize it  old fellow  and all this is not right  it's not right  you may take offense or not but i always stick to mother truth
it's not right " and the staff captain rose and turned away from rostov
"that's twue  devil take it " shouted denisov  jumping up
"now then  wostov  now then " rostov  growing red and pale alternately  looked first at one officer and then at the other
"no  gentlemen  no  
you mustn't think  
i quite understand
you're wrong to think that of me  
i  
for me  
for the honor of the regiment i'd  
ah well  i'll show that in action  and for me the honor of the flag  
well  never mind  it's true i'm to blame  to blame all round
well  what else do you want    " "come  that's right  count " cried the staff captain  turning round and clapping rostov on the shoulder with his big hand
"i tell you " shouted denisov  "he's a fine fellow " "that's better  count " said the staff captain  beginning to address rostov by his title  as if in recognition of his confession
"go and apologize  your excellency
yes  go " "gentlemen  i'll do anything
no one shall hear a word from me " said rostov in an imploring voice  "but i can't apologize  by god i can't  do what you will  how can i go and apologize like a little boy asking forgiveness " denisov began to laugh
"it'll be worse for you
bogdanich is vindictive and you'll pay for your obstinacy " said kirsten
"no  on my word it's not obstinacy  i can't describe the feeling
i can't   " "well  it's as you like " said the staff captain
"and what has become of that scoundrel " he asked denisov
"he has weported himself sick  he's to be stwuck off the list tomowwow " muttered denisov "it is an illness  there's no other way of explaining it " said the staff captain
"illness or not  he'd better not cwoss my path
i'd kill him " shouted denisov in a bloodthirsty tone
just then zherkov entered the room
"what brings you here " cried the officers turning to the newcomer
"we're to go into action  gentlemen  mack has surrendered with his whole army " "it's not true " "i've seen him myself " "what  saw the real mack  with hands and feet " "into action  into action  bring him a bottle for such news  but how did you come here " "i've been sent back to the regiment all on account of that devil  mack
an austrian general complained of me
i congratulated him on mack's arrival  
what's the matter  rostov  you look as if you'd just come out of a hot bath " "oh  my dear fellow  we're in such a stew here these last two days " the regimental adjutant came in and confirmed the news brought by zherkov
they were under orders to advance next day
"we're going into action  gentlemen " "well  thank god  we've been sitting here too long " kutuzov fell back toward vienna  destroying behind him the bridges over the rivers inn  at braunau  and traun  near linz 
on october 23 the russian troops were crossing the river enns
at midday the russian baggage train  the artillery  and columns of troops were defiling through the town of enns on both sides of the bridge
it was a warm  rainy  autumnal day
the wide expanse that opened out before the heights on which the russian batteries stood guarding the bridge was at times veiled by a diaphanous curtain of slanting rain  and then  suddenly spread out in the sunlight  far distant objects could be clearly seen glittering as though freshly varnished
down below  the little town could be seen with its white  red roofed houses  its cathedral  and its bridge  on both sides of which streamed jostling masses of russian troops
at the bend of the danube  vessels  an island  and a castle with a park surrounded by the waters of the confluence of the enns and the danube became visible  and the rocky left bank of the danube covered with pine forests  with a mystic background of green treetops and bluish gorges
the turrets of a convent stood out beyond a wild virgin pine forest  and far away on the other side of the enns the enemy's horse patrols could be discerned
among the field guns on the brow of the hill the general in command of the rearguard stood with a staff officer  scanning the country through his fieldglass
a little behind them nesvitski  who had been sent to the rearguard by the commander in chief  was sitting on the trail of a gun carriage
a cossack who accompanied him had handed him a knapsack and a flask  and nesvitski was treating some officers to pies and real doppelkummel
the officers gladly gathered round him  some on their knees  some squatting turkish fashion on the wet grass
"yes  the austrian prince who built that castle was no fool
it's a fine place  why are you not eating anything  gentlemen " nesvitski was saying
"thank you very much  prince " answered one of the officers  pleased to be talking to a staff officer of such importance
"it's a lovely place  we passed close to the park and saw two deer  
and what a splendid house " "look  prince " said another  who would have dearly liked to take another pie but felt shy  and therefore pretended to be examining the countryside—"see  our infantrymen have already got there
look there in the meadow behind the village  three of them are dragging something
they'll ransack that castle " he remarked with evident approval
"so they will " said nesvitski
"no  but what i should like " added he  munching a pie in his moist lipped handsome mouth  "would be to slip in over there " he pointed with a smile to a turreted nunnery  and his eyes narrowed and gleamed
"that would be fine  gentlemen " the officers laughed
"just to flutter the nuns a bit
they say there are italian girls among them
on my word i'd give five years of my life for it " "they must be feeling dull  too " said one of the bolder officers  laughing
meanwhile the staff officer standing in front pointed out something to the general  who looked through his field glass
"yes  so it is  so it is " said the general angrily  lowering the field glass and shrugging his shoulders  "so it is  they'll be fired on at the crossing
and why are they dawdling there " on the opposite side the enemy could be seen by the naked eye  and from their battery a milk white cloud arose
then came the distant report of a shot  and our troops could be seen hurrying to the crossing
nesvitski rose  puffing  and went up to the general  smiling
"would not your excellency like a little refreshment " he said
"it's a bad business " said the general without answering him  "our men have been wasting time " "hadn't i better ride over  your excellency " asked nesvitski
"yes  please do " answered the general  and he repeated the order that had already once been given in detail  "and tell the hussars that they are to cross last and to fire the bridge as i ordered  and the inflammable material on the bridge must be reinspected " "very good " answered nesvitski
he called the cossack with his horse  told him to put away the knapsack and flask  and swung his heavy person easily into the saddle
"i'll really call in on the nuns " he said to the officers who watched him smilingly  and he rode off by the winding path down the hill
"now then  let's see how far it will carry  captain
just try " said the general  turning to an artillery officer
"have a little fun to pass the time " "crew  to your guns " commanded the officer
in a moment the men came running gaily from their campfires and began loading
"one " came the command
number one jumped briskly aside
the gun rang out with a deafening metallic roar  and a whistling grenade flew above the heads of our troops below the hill and fell far short of the enemy  a little smoke showing the spot where it burst
the faces of officers and men brightened up at the sound
everyone got up and began watching the movements of our troops below  as plainly visible as if but a stone's throw away  and the movements of the approaching enemy farther off
at the same instant the sun came fully out from behind the clouds  and the clear sound of the solitary shot and the brilliance of the bright sunshine merged in a single joyous and spirited impression
two of the enemy's shots had already flown across the bridge  where there was a crush
halfway across stood prince nesvitski  who had alighted from his horse and whose big body was jammed against the railings
he looked back laughing to the cossack who stood a few steps behind him holding two horses by their bridles
each time prince nesvitski tried to move on  soldiers and carts pushed him back again and pressed him against the railings  and all he could do was to smile
"what a fine fellow you are  friend " said the cossack to a convoy soldier with a wagon  who was pressing onto the infantrymen who were crowded together close to his wheels and his horses
"what a fellow  you can't wait a moment  don't you see the general wants to pass " but the convoyman took no notice of the word "general" and shouted at the soldiers who were blocking his way
"hi there  boys  keep to the left  wait a bit " but the soldiers  crowded together shoulder to shoulder  their bayonets interlocking  moved over the bridge in a dense mass
looking down over the rails prince nesvitski saw the rapid  noisy little waves of the enns  which rippling and eddying round the piles of the bridge chased each other along
looking on the bridge he saw equally uniform living waves of soldiers  shoulder straps  covered shakos  knapsacks  bayonets  long muskets  and  under the shakos  faces with broad cheekbones  sunken cheeks  and listless tired expressions  and feet that moved through the sticky mud that covered the planks of the bridge
sometimes through the monotonous waves of men  like a fleck of white foam on the waves of the enns  an officer  in a cloak and with a type of face different from that of the men  squeezed his way along  sometimes like a chip of wood whirling in the river  an hussar on foot  an orderly  or a townsman was carried through the waves of infantry  and sometimes like a log floating down the river  an officers' or company's baggage wagon  piled high  leather covered  and hemmed in on all sides  moved across the bridge
"it's as if a dam had burst " said the cossack hopelessly
"are there many more of you to come " "a million all but one " replied a waggish soldier in a torn coat  with a wink  and passed on followed by another  an old man
"if he"  he meant the enemy  "begins popping at the bridge now " said the old soldier dismally to a comrade  "you'll forget to scratch yourself " that soldier passed on  and after him came another sitting on a cart "where the devil have the leg bands been shoved to " said an orderly  running behind the cart and fumbling in the back of it
and he also passed on with the wagon
then came some merry soldiers who had evidently been drinking
"and then  old fellow  he gives him one in the teeth with the butt end of his gun   " a soldier whose greatcoat was well tucked up said gaily  with a wide swing of his arm
"yes  the ham was just delicious   " answered another with a loud laugh
and they  too  passed on  so that nesvitski did not learn who had been struck on the teeth  or what the ham had to do with it
"bah  how they scurry
he just sends a ball and they think they'll all be killed " a sergeant was saying angrily and reproachfully
"as it flies past me  daddy  the ball i mean " said a young soldier with an enormous mouth  hardly refraining from laughing  "i felt like dying of fright
i did  'pon my word  i got that frightened " said he  as if bragging of having been frightened
that one also passed
then followed a cart unlike any that had gone before
it was a german cart with a pair of horses led by a german  and seemed loaded with a whole houseful of effects
a fine brindled cow with a large udder was attached to the cart behind
a woman with an unweaned baby  an old woman  and a healthy german girl with bright red cheeks were sitting on some feather beds
evidently these fugitives were allowed to pass by special permission
the eyes of all the soldiers turned toward the women  and while the vehicle was passing at foot pace all the soldiers' remarks related to the two young ones
every face bore almost the same smile  expressing unseemly thoughts about the women
"just see  the german sausage is making tracks  too " "sell me the missis " said another soldier  addressing the german  who  angry and frightened  strode energetically along with downcast eyes
"see how smart she's made herself  oh  the devils " "there  fedotov  you should be quartered on them " "i have seen as much before now  mate " "where are you going " asked an infantry officer who was eating an apple  also half smiling as he looked at the handsome girl
the german closed his eyes  signifying that he did not understand
"take it if you like " said the officer  giving the girl an apple
the girl smiled and took it
nesvitski like the rest of the men on the bridge did not take his eyes off the women till they had passed
when they had gone by  the same stream of soldiers followed  with the same kind of talk  and at last all stopped
as often happens  the horses of a convoy wagon became restive at the end of the bridge  and the whole crowd had to wait
"and why are they stopping  there's no proper order " said the soldiers
"where are you shoving to  devil take you  can't you wait  it'll be worse if he fires the bridge
see  here's an officer jammed in too"—different voices were saying in the crowd  as the men looked at one another  and all pressed toward the exit from the bridge
looking down at the waters of the enns under the bridge  nesvitski suddenly heard a sound new to him  of something swiftly approaching  
something big  that splashed into the water
"just see where it carries to " a soldier near by said sternly  looking round at the sound
"encouraging us to get along quicker " said another uneasily
the crowd moved on again
nesvitski realized that it was a cannon ball
"hey  cossack  my horse " he said
"now  then  you there  get out of the way  make way " with great difficulty he managed to get to his horse  and shouting continually he moved on
the soldiers squeezed themselves to make way for him  but again pressed on him so that they jammed his leg  and those nearest him were not to blame for they were themselves pressed still harder from behind "nesvitski  nesvitski  you numskull " came a hoarse voice from behind him nesvitski looked round and saw  some fifteen paces away but separated by the living mass of moving infantry  vaska denisov  red and shaggy  with his cap on the back of his black head and a cloak hanging jauntily over his shoulder
"tell these devils  these fiends  to let me pass " shouted denisov evidently in a fit of rage  his coal black eyes with their bloodshot whites glittering and rolling as he waved his sheathed saber in a small bare hand as red as his face
"ah  vaska " joyfully replied nesvitski
"what's up with you " "the squadwon can't pass " shouted vaska denisov  showing his white teeth fiercely and spurring his black thoroughbred arab  which twitched its ears as the bayonets touched it  and snorted  spurting white foam from his bit  tramping the planks of the bridge with his hoofs  and apparently ready to jump over the railings had his rider let him
"what is this  they're like sheep  just like sheep  out of the way   
let us pass   
stop there  you devil with the cart  i'll hack you with my saber " he shouted  actually drawing his saber from its scabbard and flourishing it
the soldiers crowded against one another with terrified faces  and denisov joined nesvitski
"how's it you're not drunk today " said nesvitski when the other had ridden up to him
"they don't even give one time to dwink " answered vaska denisov
"they keep dwagging the wegiment to and fwo all day
if they mean to fight  let's fight
but the devil knows what this is " "what a dandy you are today " said nesvitski  looking at denisov's new cloak and saddlecloth
denisov smiled  took out of his sabretache a handkerchief that diffused a smell of perfume  and put it to nesvitski's nose
"of course
i'm going into action  i've shaved  bwushed my teeth  and scented myself " the imposing figure of nesvitski followed by his cossack  and the determination of denisov who flourished his sword and shouted frantically  had such an effect that they managed to squeeze through to the farther side of the bridge and stopped the infantry
beside the bridge nesvitski found the colonel to whom he had to deliver the order  and having done this he rode back
having cleared the way denisov stopped at the end of the bridge
carelessly holding in his stallion that was neighing and pawing the ground  eager to rejoin its fellows  he watched his squadron draw nearer
then the clang of hoofs  as of several horses galloping  resounded on the planks of the bridge  and the squadron  officers in front and men four abreast  spread across the bridge and began to emerge on his side of it
the infantry who had been stopped crowded near the bridge in the trampled mud and gazed with that particular feeling of ill will  estrangement  and ridicule with which troops of different arms usually encounter one another at the clean  smart hussars who moved past them in regular order "smart lads  only fit for a fair " said one
"what good are they  they're led about just for show " remarked another
"don't kick up the dust  you infantry " jested an hussar whose prancing horse had splashed mud over some foot soldiers
"i'd like to put you on a two days' march with a knapsack  your fine cords would soon get a bit rubbed " said an infantryman  wiping the mud off his face with his sleeve
"perched up there  you're more like a bird than a man " "there now  zikin  they ought to put you on a horse
you'd look fine " said a corporal  chaffing a thin little soldier who bent under the weight of his knapsack
"take a stick between your legs  that'll suit you for a horse " the hussar shouted back
the last of the infantry hurriedly crossed the bridge  squeezing together as they approached it as if passing through a funnel
at last the baggage wagons had all crossed  the crush was less  and the last battalion came onto the bridge
only denisov's squadron of hussars remained on the farther side of the bridge facing the enemy  who could be seen from the hill on the opposite bank but was not yet visible from the bridge  for the horizon as seen from the valley through which the river flowed was formed by the rising ground only half a mile away
at the foot of the hill lay wasteland over which a few groups of our cossack scouts were moving
suddenly on the road at the top of the high ground  artillery and troops in blue uniform were seen
these were the french
a group of cossack scouts retired down the hill at a trot
all the officers and men of denisov's squadron  though they tried to talk of other things and to look in other directions  thought only of what was there on the hilltop  and kept constantly looking at the patches appearing on the skyline  which they knew to be the enemy's troops
the weather had cleared again since noon and the sun was descending brightly upon the danube and the dark hills around it
it was calm  and at intervals the bugle calls and the shouts of the enemy could be heard from the hill
there was no one now between the squadron and the enemy except a few scattered skirmishers
an empty space of some seven hundred yards was all that separated them
the enemy ceased firing  and that stern  threatening  inaccessible  and intangible line which separates two hostile armies was all the more clearly felt
"one step beyond that boundary line which resembles the line dividing the living from the dead lies uncertainty  suffering  and death
and what is there  who is there —there beyond that field  that tree  that roof lit up by the sun  no one knows  but one wants to know
you fear and yet long to cross that line  and know that sooner or later it must be crossed and you will have to find out what is there  just as you will inevitably have to learn what lies the other side of death
but you are strong  healthy  cheerful  and excited  and are surrounded by other such excitedly animated and healthy men " so thinks  or at any rate feels  anyone who comes in sight of the enemy  and that feeling gives a particular glamour and glad keenness of impression to everything that takes place at such moments
on the high ground where the enemy was  the smoke of a cannon rose  and a ball flew whistling over the heads of the hussar squadron
the officers who had been standing together rode off to their places
the hussars began carefully aligning their horses
silence fell on the whole squadron
all were looking at the enemy in front and at the squadron commander  awaiting the word of command
a second and a third cannon ball flew past
evidently they were firing at the hussars  but the balls with rapid rhythmic whistle flew over the heads of the horsemen and fell somewhere beyond them
the hussars did not look round  but at the sound of each shot  as at the word of command  the whole squadron with its rows of faces so alike yet so different  holding its breath while the ball flew past  rose in the stirrups and sank back again
the soldiers without turning their heads glanced at one another  curious to see their comrades' impression every face  from denisov's to that of the bugler  showed one common expression of conflict  irritation  and excitement  around chin and mouth
the quartermaster frowned  looking at the soldiers as if threatening to punish them
cadet mironov ducked every time a ball flew past
rostov on the left flank  mounted on his rook—a handsome horse despite its game leg—had the happy air of a schoolboy called up before a large audience for an examination in which he feels sure he will distinguish himself he was glancing at everyone with a clear  bright expression  as if asking them to notice how calmly he sat under fire
but despite himself  on his face too that same indication of something new and stern showed round the mouth "who's that curtseying there  cadet miwonov  that's not wight  look at me " cried denisov who  unable to keep still on one spot  kept turning his horse in front of the squadron
the black  hairy  snub nosed face of vaska denisov  and his whole short sturdy figure with the sinewy hairy hand and stumpy fingers in which he held the hilt of his naked saber  looked just as it usually did  especially toward evening when he had emptied his second bottle  he was only redder than usual
with his shaggy head thrown back like birds when they drink  pressing his spurs mercilessly into the sides of his good horse  bedouin  and sitting as though falling backwards in the saddle  he galloped to the other flank of the squadron and shouted in a hoarse voice to the men to look to their pistols
he rode up to kirsten
the staff captain on his broad backed  steady mare came at a walk to meet him
his face with its long mustache was serious as always  only his eyes were brighter than usual
"well  what about it " said he to denisov
"it won't come to a fight
you'll see —we shall retire " "the devil only knows what they're about " muttered denisov
"ah  wostov " he cried noticing the cadet's bright face  "you've got it at last " and he smiled approvingly  evidently pleased with the cadet
rostov felt perfectly happy
just then the commander appeared on the bridge
denisov galloped up to him
"your excellency  let us attack them  i'll dwive them off " "attack indeed " said the colonel in a bored voice  puckering up his face as if driving off a troublesome fly
"and why are you stopping here  don't you see the skirmishers are retreating  lead the squadron back " the squadron crossed the bridge and drew out of range of fire without having lost a single man
the second squadron that had been in the front line followed them across and the last cossacks quitted the farther side of the river
the two pavlograd squadrons  having crossed the bridge  retired up the hill one after the other
their colonel  karl bogdanich schubert  came up to denisov's squadron and rode at a footpace not far from rostov  without taking any notice of him although they were now meeting for the first time since their encounter concerning telyanin
rostov  feeling that he was at the front and in the power of a man toward whom he now admitted that he had been to blame  did not lift his eyes from the colonel's athletic back  his nape covered with light hair  and his red neck
it seemed to rostov that bogdanich was only pretending not to notice him  and that his whole aim now was to test the cadet's courage  so he drew himself up and looked around him merrily  then it seemed to him that bogdanich rode so near in order to show him his courage next he thought that his enemy would send the squadron on a desperate attack just to punish him—rostov
then he imagined how  after the attack  bogdanich would come up to him as he lay wounded and would magnanimously extend the hand of reconciliation
the high shouldered figure of zherkov  familiar to the pavlograds as he had but recently left their regiment  rode up to the colonel
after his dismissal from headquarters zherkov had not remained in the regiment  saying he was not such a fool as to slave at the front when he could get more rewards by doing nothing on the staff  and had succeeded in attaching himself as an orderly officer to prince bagration he now came to his former chief with an order from the commander of the rear guard
"colonel " he said  addressing rostov's enemy with an air of gloomy gravity and glancing round at his comrades  "there is an order to stop and fire the bridge " "an order to who " asked the colonel morosely "i don't myself know 'to who '" replied the cornet in a serious tone  "but the prince told me to 'go and tell the colonel that the hussars must return quickly and fire the bridge '" zherkov was followed by an officer of the suite who rode up to the colonel of hussars with the same order
after him the stout nesvitski came galloping up on a cossack horse that could scarcely carry his weight
"how's this  colonel " he shouted as he approached
"i told you to fire the bridge  and now someone has gone and blundered  they are all beside themselves over there and one can't make anything out " the colonel deliberately stopped the regiment and turned to nesvitski "you spoke to me of inflammable material " said he  "but you said nothing about firing it " "but  my dear sir " said nesvitski as he drew up  taking off his cap and smoothing his hair wet with perspiration with his plump hand  "wasn't i telling you to fire the bridge  when inflammable material had been put in position " "i am not your 'dear sir ' mr staff officer  and you did not tell me to burn the bridge  i know the service  and it is my habit orders strictly to obey
you said the bridge would be burned  but who would it burn  i could not know by the holy spirit " "ah  that's always the way " said nesvitski with a wave of the hand
"how did you get here " said he  turning to zherkov
"on the same business
but you are damp  let me wring you out " "you were saying  mr staff officer   " continued the colonel in an offended tone
"colonel " interrupted the officer of the suite  "you must be quick or the enemy will bring up his guns to use grapeshot " the colonel looked silently at the officer of the suite  at the stout staff officer  and at zherkov  and he frowned
"i will the bridge fire " he said in a solemn tone as if to announce that in spite of all the unpleasantness he had to endure he would still do the right thing
striking his horse with his long muscular legs as if it were to blame for everything  the colonel moved forward and ordered the second squadron  that in which rostov was serving under denisov  to return to the bridge
"there  it's just as i thought " said rostov to himself "he wishes to test me " his heart contracted and the blood rushed to his face
"let him see whether i am a coward " he thought
again on all the bright faces of the squadron the serious expression appeared that they had worn when under fire
rostov watched his enemy  the colonel  closely—to find in his face confirmation of his own conjecture  but the colonel did not once glance at rostov  and looked as he always did when at the front  solemn and stern
then came the word of command
"look sharp  look sharp " several voices repeated around him
their sabers catching in the bridles and their spurs jingling  the hussars hastily dismounted  not knowing what they were to do
the men were crossing themselves rostov no longer looked at the colonel  he had no time
he was afraid of falling behind the hussars  so much afraid that his heart stood still
his hand trembled as he gave his horse into an orderly's charge  and he felt the blood rush to his heart with a thud
denisov rode past him  leaning back and shouting something
rostov saw nothing but the hussars running all around him  their spurs catching and their sabers clattering
"stretchers " shouted someone behind him rostov did not think what this call for stretchers meant  he ran on  trying only to be ahead of the others  but just at the bridge  not looking at the ground  he came on some sticky  trodden mud  stumbled  and fell on his hands the others outstripped him
"at boss zides  captain " he heard the voice of the colonel  who  having ridden ahead  had pulled up his horse near the bridge  with a triumphant  cheerful face
rostov wiping his muddy hands on his breeches looked at his enemy and was about to run on  thinking that the farther he went to the front the better
but bogdanich  without looking at or recognizing rostov  shouted to him  "who's that running on the middle of the bridge  to the right  come back  cadet " he cried angrily  and turning to denisov  who  showing off his courage  had ridden on to the planks of the bridge  "why run risks  captain  you should dismount " he said
"oh  every bullet has its billet " answered vaska denisov  turning in his saddle
meanwhile nesvitski  zherkov  and the officer of the suite were standing together out of range of the shots  watching  now the small group of men with yellow shakos  dark green jackets braided with cord  and blue riding breeches  who were swarming near the bridge  and then at what was approaching in the distance from the opposite side—the blue uniforms and groups with horses  easily recognizable as artillery "will they burn the bridge or not  who'll get there first  will they get there and fire the bridge or will the french get within grapeshot range and wipe them out " these were the questions each man of the troops on the high ground above the bridge involuntarily asked himself with a sinking heart— watching the bridge and the hussars in the bright evening light and the blue tunics advancing from the other side with their bayonets and guns "ugh
the hussars will get it hot " said nesvitski  "they are within grapeshot range now " "he shouldn't have taken so many men " said the officer of the suite
"true enough " answered nesvitski  "two smart fellows could have done the job just as well " "ah  your excellency " put in zherkov  his eyes fixed on the hussars  but still with that naive air that made it impossible to know whether he was speaking in jest or in earnest
"ah  your excellency  how you look at things  send two men  and who then would give us the vladimir medal and ribbon  but now  even if they do get peppered  the squadron may be recommended for honors and he may get a ribbon
our bogdanich knows how things are done " "there now " said the officer of the suite  "that's grapeshot " he pointed to the french guns  the limbers of which were being detached and hurriedly removed
on the french side  amid the groups with cannon  a cloud of smoke appeared  then a second and a third almost simultaneously  and at the moment when the first report was heard a fourth was seen
then two reports one after another  and a third
"oh  oh " groaned nesvitski as if in fierce pain  seizing the officer of the suite by the arm
"look  a man has fallen  fallen  fallen " "two  i think " "if i were tsar i would never go to war " said nesvitski  turning away
the french guns were hastily reloaded
the infantry in their blue uniforms advanced toward the bridge at a run smoke appeared again but at irregular intervals  and grapeshot cracked and rattled onto the bridge
but this time nesvitski could not see what was happening there  as a dense cloud of smoke arose from it
the hussars had succeeded in setting it on fire and the french batteries were now firing at them  no longer to hinder them but because the guns were trained and there was someone to fire at
the french had time to fire three rounds of grapeshot before the hussars got back to their horses
two were misdirected and the shot went too high  but the last round fell in the midst of a group of hussars and knocked three of them over
rostov  absorbed by his relations with bogdanich  had paused on the bridge not knowing what to do
there was no one to hew down  as he had always imagined battles to himself   nor could he help to fire the bridge because he had not brought any burning straw with him like the other soldiers he stood looking about him  when suddenly he heard a rattle on the bridge as if nuts were being spilt  and the hussar nearest to him fell against the rails with a groan
rostov ran up to him with the others
again someone shouted  "stretchers " four men seized the hussar and began lifting him "oooh  for christ's sake let me alone " cried the wounded man  but still he was lifted and laid on the stretcher nicholas rostov turned away and  as if searching for something  gazed into the distance  at the waters of the danube  at the sky  and at the sun
how beautiful the sky looked  how blue  how calm  and how deep  how bright and glorious was the setting sun  with what soft glitter the waters of the distant danube shone
and fairer still were the faraway blue mountains beyond the river  the nunnery  the mysterious gorges  and the pine forests veiled in the mist of their summits  
there was peace and happiness  
"i should wish for nothing else  nothing  if only i were there " thought rostov
"in myself alone and in that sunshine there is so much happiness  but here  
groans  suffering  fear  and this uncertainty and hurry  
there—they are shouting again  and again are all running back somewhere  and i shall run with them  and it  death  is here above me and around  
another instant and i shall never again see the sun  this water  that gorge    " at that instant the sun began to hide behind the clouds  and other stretchers came into view before rostov and the fear of death and of the stretchers  and love of the sun and of life  all merged into one feeling of sickening agitation "o lord god  thou who art in that heaven  save  forgive  and protect me " rostov whispered
the hussars ran back to the men who held their horses  their voices sounded louder and calmer  the stretchers disappeared from sight "well  fwiend  so you've smelt powdah " shouted vaska denisov just above his ear
"it's all over  but i am a coward—yes  a coward " thought rostov  and sighing deeply he took rook  his horse  which stood resting one foot  from the orderly and began to mount
"was that grapeshot " he asked denisov
"yes and no mistake " cried denisov
"you worked like wegular bwicks and it's nasty work  an attack's pleasant work  hacking away at the dogs  but this sort of thing is the very devil  with them shooting at you like a target " and denisov rode up to a group that had stopped near rostov  composed of the colonel  nesvitski  zherkov  and the officer from the suite
"well  it seems that no one has noticed " thought rostov and this was true
no one had taken any notice  for everyone knew the sensation which the cadet under fire for the first time had experienced
"here's something for you to report " said zherkov
"see if i don't get promoted to a sublieutenancy " "inform the prince that i the bridge fired " said the colonel triumphantly and gaily
"and if he asks about the losses " "a trifle " said the colonel in his bass voice  "two hussars wounded  and one knocked out " he added  unable to restrain a happy smile  and pronouncing the phrase "knocked out" with ringing distinctness
pursued by the french army of a hundred thousand men under the command of bonaparte  encountering a population that was unfriendly to it  losing confidence in its allies  suffering from shortness of supplies  and compelled to act under conditions of war unlike anything that had been foreseen  the russian army of thirty five thousand men commanded by kutuzov was hurriedly retreating along the danube  stopping where overtaken by the enemy and fighting rearguard actions only as far as necessary to enable it to retreat without losing its heavy equipment
there had been actions at lambach  amstetten  and melk  but despite the courage and endurance—acknowledged even by the enemy—with which the russians fought  the only consequence of these actions was a yet more rapid retreat austrian troops that had escaped capture at ulm and had joined kutuzov at braunau now separated from the russian army  and kutuzov was left with only his own weak and exhausted forces
the defense of vienna was no longer to be thought of
instead of an offensive  the plan of which  carefully prepared in accord with the modern science of strategics  had been handed to kutuzov when he was in vienna by the austrian hofkriegsrath  the sole and almost unattainable aim remaining for him was to effect a junction with the forces that were advancing from russia  without losing his army as mack had done at ulm
on the twenty eighth of october kutuzov with his army crossed to the left bank of the danube and took up a position for the first time with the river between himself and the main body of the french on the thirtieth he attacked mortier's division  which was on the left bank  and broke it up
in this action for the first time trophies were taken  banners  cannon  and two enemy generals
for the first time  after a fortnight's retreat  the russian troops had halted and after a fight had not only held the field but had repulsed the french
though the troops were ill clad  exhausted  and had lost a third of their number in killed  wounded  sick  and stragglers  though a number of sick and wounded had been abandoned on the other side of the danube with a letter in which kutuzov entrusted them to the humanity of the enemy  and though the big hospitals and the houses in krems converted into military hospitals could no longer accommodate all the sick and wounded  yet the stand made at krems and the victory over mortier raised the spirits of the army considerably throughout the whole army and at headquarters most joyful though erroneous rumors were rife of the imaginary approach of columns from russia  of some victory gained by the austrians  and of the retreat of the frightened bonaparte
prince andrew during the battle had been in attendance on the austrian general schmidt  who was killed in the action
his horse had been wounded under him and his own arm slightly grazed by a bullet
as a mark of the commander in chief's special favor he was sent with the news of this victory to the austrian court  now no longer at vienna  which was threatened by the french  but at brunn
despite his apparently delicate build prince andrew could endure physical fatigue far better than many very muscular men  and on the night of the battle  having arrived at krems excited but not weary  with dispatches from dokhturov to kutuzov  he was sent immediately with a special dispatch to brunn to be so sent meant not only a reward but an important step toward promotion
the night was dark but starry  the road showed black in the snow that had fallen the previous day—the day of the battle
reviewing his impressions of the recent battle  picturing pleasantly to himself the impression his news of a victory would create  or recalling the send off given him by the commanderin chief and his fellow officers  prince andrew was galloping along in a post chaise enjoying the feelings of a man who has at length begun to attain a longdesired happiness as soon as he closed his eyes his ears seemed filled with the rattle of the wheels and the sensation of victory
then he began to imagine that the russians were running away and that he himself was killed  but he quickly roused himself with a feeling of joy  as if learning afresh that this was not so but that on the contrary the french had run away he again recalled all the details of the victory and his own calm courage during the battle  and feeling reassured he dozed off   
the dark starry night was followed by a bright cheerful morning
the snow was thawing in the sunshine  the horses galloped quickly  and on both sides of the road were forests of different kinds  fields  and villages
at one of the post stations he overtook a convoy of russian wounded
the russian officer in charge of the transport lolled back in the front cart  shouting and scolding a soldier with coarse abuse
in each of the long german carts six or more pale  dirty  bandaged men were being jolted over the stony road
some of them were talking  he heard russian words   others were eating bread  the more severely wounded looked silently  with the languid interest of sick children  at the envoy hurrying past them
prince andrew told his driver to stop  and asked a soldier in what action they had been wounded
"day before yesterday  on the danube " answered the soldier
prince andrew took out his purse and gave the soldier three gold pieces
"that's for them all " he said to the officer who came up
"get well soon  lads " he continued  turning to the soldiers
"there's plenty to do still " "what news  sir " asked the officer  evidently anxious to start a conversation
"good news   
go on " he shouted to the driver  and they galloped on
it was already quite dark when prince andrew rattled over the paved streets of brunn and found himself surrounded by high buildings  the lights of shops  houses  and street lamps  fine carriages  and all that atmosphere of a large and active town which is always so attractive to a soldier after camp life despite his rapid journey and sleepless night  prince andrew when he drove up to the palace felt even more vigorous and alert than he had done the day before
only his eyes gleamed feverishly and his thoughts followed one another with extraordinary clearness and rapidity
he again vividly recalled the details of the battle  no longer dim  but definite and in the concise form in which he imagined himself stating them to the emperor francis he vividly imagined the casual questions that might be put to him and the answers he would give
he expected to be at once presented to the emperor
at the chief entrance to the palace  however  an official came running out to meet him  and learning that he was a special messenger led him to another entrance
"to the right from the corridor  euer hochgeboren  there you will find the adjutant on duty " said the official
"he will conduct you to the minister of war " the adjutant on duty  meeting prince andrew  asked him to wait  and went in to the minister of war
five minutes later he returned and bowing with particular courtesy ushered prince andrew before him along a corridor to the cabinet where the minister of war was at work
the adjutant by his elaborate courtesy appeared to wish to ward off any attempt at familiarity on the part of the russian messenger
prince andrew's joyous feeling was considerably weakened as he approached the door of the minister's room
he felt offended  and without his noticing it the feeling of offense immediately turned into one of disdain which was quite uncalled for
his fertile mind instantly suggested to him a point of view which gave him a right to despise the adjutant and the minister
"away from the smell of powder  they probably think it easy to gain victories " he thought
his eyes narrowed disdainfully  he entered the room of the minister of war with peculiarly deliberate steps
this feeling of disdain was heightened when he saw the minister seated at a large table reading some papers and making pencil notes on them  and for the first two or three minutes taking no notice of his arrival
a wax candle stood at each side of the minister's bent bald head with its gray temples
he went on reading to the end  without raising his eyes at the opening of the door and the sound of footsteps
"take this and deliver it " said he to his adjutant  handing him the papers and still taking no notice of the special messenger
prince andrew felt that either the actions of kutuzov's army interested the minister of war less than any of the other matters he was concerned with  or he wanted to give the russian special messenger that impression
"but that is a matter of perfect indifference to me " he thought
the minister drew the remaining papers together  arranged them evenly  and then raised his head
he had an intellectual and distinctive head  but the instant he turned to prince andrew the firm  intelligent expression on his face changed in a way evidently deliberate and habitual to him
his face took on the stupid artificial smile  which does not even attempt to hide its artificiality  of a man who is continually receiving many petitioners one after another
"from general field marshal kutuzov " he asked
"i hope it is good news  there has been an encounter with mortier  a victory  it was high time " he took the dispatch which was addressed to him and began to read it with a mournful expression
"oh  my god  my god  schmidt " he exclaimed in german
"what a calamity  what a calamity " having glanced through the dispatch he laid it on the table and looked at prince andrew  evidently considering something
"ah what a calamity  you say the affair was decisive  but mortier is not captured " again he pondered
"i am very glad you have brought good news  though schmidt's death is a heavy price to pay for the victory
his majesty will no doubt wish to see you  but not today
i thank you  you must have a rest
be at the levee tomorrow after the parade
however  i will let you know " the stupid smile  which had left his face while he was speaking  reappeared
"au revoir  thank you very much
his majesty will probably desire to see you " he added  bowing his head
when prince andrew left the palace he felt that all the interest and happiness the victory had afforded him had been now left in the indifferent hands of the minister of war and the polite adjutant
the whole tenor of his thoughts instantaneously changed  the battle seemed the memory of a remote event long past
prince andrew stayed at brunn with bilibin  a russian acquaintance of his in the diplomatic service
"ah  my dear prince  i could not have a more welcome visitor " said bilibin as he came out to meet prince andrew
"franz  put the prince's things in my bedroom " said he to the servant who was ushering bolkonski in
"so you're a messenger of victory  eh  splendid  and i am sitting here ill  as you see " after washing and dressing  prince andrew came into the diplomat's luxurious study and sat down to the dinner prepared for him
bilibin settled down comfortably beside the fire
after his journey and the campaign during which he had been deprived of all the comforts of cleanliness and all the refinements of life  prince andrew felt a pleasant sense of repose among luxurious surroundings such as he had been accustomed to from childhood
besides it was pleasant  after his reception by the austrians  to speak if not in russian  for they were speaking french  at least with a russian who would  he supposed  share the general russian antipathy to the austrians which was then particularly strong
bilibin was a man of thirty five  a bachelor  and of the same circle as prince andrew
they had known each other previously in petersburg  but had become more intimate when prince andrew was in vienna with kutuzov
just as prince andrew was a young man who gave promise of rising high in the military profession  so to an even greater extent bilibin gave promise of rising in his diplomatic career
he still a young man but no longer a young diplomat  as he had entered the service at the age of sixteen  had been in paris and copenhagen  and now held a rather important post in vienna
both the foreign minister and our ambassador in vienna knew him and valued him
he was not one of those many diplomats who are esteemed because they have certain negative qualities  avoid doing certain things  and speak french
he was one of those  who  liking work  knew how to do it  and despite his indolence would sometimes spend a whole night at his writing table
he worked well whatever the import of his work
it was not the question "what for " but the question "how " that interested him
what the diplomatic matter might be he did not care  but it gave him great pleasure to prepare a circular  memorandum  or report  skillfully  pointedly  and elegantly
bilibin's services were valued not only for what he wrote  but also for his skill in dealing and conversing with those in the highest spheres
bilibin liked conversation as he liked work  only when it could be made elegantly witty
in society he always awaited an opportunity to say something striking and took part in a conversation only when that was possible
his conversation was always sprinkled with wittily original  finished phrases of general interest
these sayings were prepared in the inner laboratory of his mind in a portable form as if intentionally  so that insignificant society people might carry them from drawing room to drawing room
and  in fact  bilibin's witticisms were hawked about in the viennese drawing rooms and often had an influence on matters considered important his thin  worn  sallow face was covered with deep wrinkles  which always looked as clean and well washed as the tips of one's fingers after a russian bath
the movement of these wrinkles formed the principal play of expression on his face
now his forehead would pucker into deep folds and his eyebrows were lifted  then his eyebrows would descend and deep wrinkles would crease his cheeks
his small  deep set eyes always twinkled and looked out straight
"well  now tell me about your exploits " said he
bolkonski  very modestly without once mentioning himself  described the engagement and his reception by the minister of war "they received me and my news as one receives a dog in a game of skittles " said he in conclusion
bilibin smiled and the wrinkles on his face disappeared
"cependant  mon cher " he remarked  examining his nails from a distance and puckering the skin above his left eye  "malgre la haute estime que je professe pour the orthodox russian army  j'avoue que votre victoire n'est pas des plus victorieuses " * * "but my dear fellow  with all my respect for the orthodox russian army  i must say that your victory was not particularly victorious " he went on talking in this way in french  uttering only those words in russian on which he wished to put a contemptuous emphasis
"come now  you with all your forces fall on the unfortunate mortier and his one division  and even then mortier slips through your fingers  where's the victory " "but seriously " said prince andrew  "we can at any rate say without boasting that it was a little better than at ulm   " "why didn't you capture one  just one  marshal for us " "because not everything happens as one expects or with the smoothness of a parade
we had expected  as i told you  to get at their rear by seven in the morning but had not reached it by five in the afternoon " "and why didn't you do it at seven in the morning  you ought to have been there at seven in the morning " returned bilibin with a smile
"you ought to have been there at seven in the morning " "why did you not succeed in impressing on bonaparte by diplomatic methods that he had better leave genoa alone " retorted prince andrew in the same tone
"i know " interrupted bilibin  "you're thinking it's very easy to take marshals  sitting on a sofa by the fire  that is true  but still why didn't you capture him  so don't be surprised if not only the minister of war but also his most august majesty the emperor and king francis is not much delighted by your victory
even i  a poor secretary of the russian embassy  do not feel any need in token of my joy to give my franz a thaler  or let him go with his liebchen to the prater  
true  we have no prater here   " he looked straight at prince andrew and suddenly unwrinkled his forehead
"it is now my turn to ask you 'why ' mon cher " said bolkonski
"i confess i do not understand  perhaps there are diplomatic subtleties here beyond my feeble intelligence  but i can't make it out
mack loses a whole army  the archduke ferdinand and the archduke karl give no signs of life and make blunder after blunder
kutuzov alone at last gains a real victory  destroying the spell of the invincibility of the french  and the minister of war does not even care to hear the details " "that's just it  my dear fellow
you see it's hurrah for the tsar  for russia  for the orthodox greek faith  all that is beautiful  but what do we  i mean the austrian court  care for your victories  bring us nice news of a victory by the archduke karl or ferdinand  one archduke's as good as another  as you know  and even if it is only over a fire brigade of bonaparte's  that will be another story and we'll fire off some cannon  but this sort of thing seems done on purpose to vex us the archduke karl does nothing  the archduke ferdinand disgraces himself you abandon vienna  give up its defense—as much as to say  'heaven is with us  but heaven help you and your capital ' the one general whom we all loved  schmidt  you expose to a bullet  and then you congratulate us on the victory  admit that more irritating news than yours could not have been conceived
it's as if it had been done on purpose  on purpose
besides  suppose you did gain a brilliant victory  if even the archduke karl gained a victory  what effect would that have on the general course of events  it's too late now when vienna is occupied by the french army " "what  occupied  vienna occupied " "not only occupied  but bonaparte is at schonbrunn  and the count  our dear count vrbna  goes to him for orders " after the fatigues and impressions of the journey  his reception  and especially after having dined  bolkonski felt that he could not take in the full significance of the words he heard
"count lichtenfels was here this morning " bilibin continued  "and showed me a letter in which the parade of the french in vienna was fully described  prince murat et tout le tremblement  
you see that your victory is not a matter for great rejoicing and that you can't be received as a savior " "really i don't care about that  i don't care at all " said prince andrew  beginning to understand that his news of the battle before krems was really of small importance in view of such events as the fall of austria's capital "how is it vienna was taken  what of the bridge and its celebrated bridgehead and prince auersperg  we heard reports that prince auersperg was defending vienna " he said
"prince auersperg is on this  on our side of the river  and is defending us— doing it very badly  i think  but still he is defending us
but vienna is on the other side
no  the bridge has not yet been taken and i hope it will not be  for it is mined and orders have been given to blow it up
otherwise we should long ago have been in the mountains of bohemia  and you and your army would have spent a bad quarter of an hour between two fires " "but still this does not mean that the campaign is over " said prince andrew
"well  i think it is
the bigwigs here think so too  but they daren't say so
it will be as i said at the beginning of the campaign  it won't be your skirmishing at durrenstein  or gunpowder at all  that will decide the matter  but those who devised it " said bilibin quoting one of his own mots  releasing the wrinkles on his forehead  and pausing
"the only question is what will come of the meeting between the emperor alexander and the king of prussia in berlin  if prussia joins the allies  austria's hand will be forced and there will be war
if not it is merely a question of settling where the preliminaries of the new campo formio are to be drawn up " "what an extraordinary genius " prince andrew suddenly exclaimed  clenching his small hand and striking the table with it  "and what luck the man has " "buonaparte " said bilibin inquiringly  puckering up his forehead to indicate that he was about to say something witty
"buonaparte " he repeated  accentuating the u  "i think  however  now that he lays down laws for austria at schonbrunn  il faut lui faire grace de l'u  * i shall certainly adopt an innovation and call him simply bonaparte " * "we must let him off the u " "but joking apart " said prince andrew  "do you really think the campaign is over " "this is what i think
austria has been made a fool of  and she is not used to it
she will retaliate
and she has been fooled in the first place because her provinces have been pillaged—they say the holy russian army loots terribly —her army is destroyed  her capital taken  and all this for the beaux yeux * of his sardinian majesty
and therefore—this is between ourselves—i instinctively feel that we are being deceived  my instinct tells me of negotiations with france and projects for peace  a secret peace concluded separately " * fine eyes
"impossible " cried prince andrew
"that would be too base " "if we live we shall see " replied bilibin  his face again becoming smooth as a sign that the conversation was at an end
when prince andrew reached the room prepared for him and lay down in a clean shirt on the feather bed with its warmed and fragrant pillows  he felt that the battle of which he had brought tidings was far  far away from him
the alliance with prussia  austria's treachery  bonaparte's new triumph  tomorrow's levee and parade  and the audience with the emperor francis occupied his thoughts
he closed his eyes  and immediately a sound of cannonading  of musketry and the rattling of carriage wheels seemed to fill his ears  and now again drawn out in a thin line the musketeers were descending the hill  the french were firing  and he felt his heart palpitating as he rode forward beside schmidt with the bullets merrily whistling all around  and he experienced tenfold the joy of living  as he had not done since childhood
he woke up  
"yes  that all happened " he said  and  smiling happily to himself like a child  he fell into a deep  youthful slumber next day he woke late
recalling his recent impressions  the first thought that came into his mind was that today he had to be presented to the emperor francis  he remembered the minister of war  the polite austrian adjutant  bilibin  and last night's conversation
having dressed for his attendance at court in full parade uniform  which he had not worn for a long time  he went into bilibin's study fresh  animated  and handsome  with his hand bandaged
in the study were four gentlemen of the diplomatic corps
with prince hippolyte kuragin  who was a secretary to the embassy  bolkonski was already acquainted
bilibin introduced him to the others
the gentlemen assembled at bilibin's were young  wealthy  gay society men  who here  as in vienna  formed a special set which bilibin  their leader  called les notres
* this set  consisting almost exclusively of diplomats  evidently had its own interests which had nothing to do with war or politics but related to high society  to certain women  and to the official side of the service
these gentlemen received prince andrew as one of themselves  an honor they did not extend to many from politeness and to start conversation  they asked him a few questions about the army and the battle  and then the talk went off into merry jests and gossip
* ours
"but the best of it was " said one  telling of the misfortune of a fellow diplomat  "that the chancellor told him flatly that his appointment to london was a promotion and that he was so to regard it
can you fancy the figure he cut    " "but the worst of it  gentlemen—i am giving kuragin away to you—is that that man suffers  and this don juan  wicked fellow  is taking advantage of it " prince hippolyte was lolling in a lounge chair with his legs over its arm
he began to laugh
"tell me about that " he said
"oh  you don juan  you serpent " cried several voices
"you  bolkonski  don't know " said bilibin turning to prince andrew  "that all the atrocities of the french army  i nearly said of the russian army  are nothing compared to what this man has been doing among the women " "la femme est la compagne de l'homme " * announced prince hippolyte  and began looking through a lorgnette at his elevated legs
* "woman is man's companion " bilibin and the rest of "ours" burst out laughing in hippolyte's face  and prince andrew saw that hippolyte  of whom—he had to admit—he had almost been jealous on his wife's account  was the butt of this set
"oh  i must give you a treat " bilibin whispered to bolkonski
"kuragin is exquisite when he discusses politics—you should see his gravity " he sat down beside hippolyte and wrinkling his forehead began talking to him about politics
prince andrew and the others gathered round these two
"the berlin cabinet cannot express a feeling of alliance " began hippolyte gazing round with importance at the others  "without expressing  
as in its last note  
you understand  
besides  unless his majesty the emperor derogates from the principle of our alliance  
"wait  i have not finished   " he said to prince andrew  seizing him by the arm  "i believe that intervention will be stronger than nonintervention
and   " he paused
"finally one cannot impute the nonreceipt of our dispatch of november 18
that is how it will end " and he released bolkonski's arm to indicate that he had now quite finished
"demosthenes  i know thee by the pebble thou secretest in thy golden mouth " said bilibin  and the mop of hair on his head moved with satisfaction
everybody laughed  and hippolyte louder than anyone
he was evidently distressed  and breathed painfully  but could not restrain the wild laughter that convulsed his usually impassive features
"well now  gentlemen " said bilibin  "bolkonski is my guest in this house and in brunn itself
i want to entertain him as far as i can  with all the pleasures of life here
if we were in vienna it would be easy  but here  in this wretched moravian hole  it is more difficult  and i beg you all to help me brunn's attractions must be shown him
you can undertake the theater  i society  and you  hippolyte  of course the women " "we must let him see amelie  she's exquisite " said one of "ours " kissing his finger tips
"in general we must turn this bloodthirsty soldier to more humane interests " said bilibin
"i shall scarcely be able to avail myself of your hospitality  gentlemen  it is already time for me to go " replied prince andrew looking at his watch
"where to " "to the emperor " "oh  oh  oh  well  au revoir  bolkonski  au revoir  prince  come back early to dinner " cried several voices
"we'll take you in hand " "when speaking to the emperor  try as far as you can to praise the way that provisions are supplied and the routes indicated " said bilibin  accompanying him to the hall
"i should like to speak well of them  but as far as i know the facts  i can't " replied bolkonski  smiling
"well  talk as much as you can  anyway
he has a passion for giving audiences  but he does not like talking himself and can't do it  as you will see " at the levee prince andrew stood among the austrian officers as he had been told to  and the emperor francis merely looked fixedly into his face and just nodded to him with his long head but after it was over  the adjutant he had seen the previous day ceremoniously informed bolkonski that the emperor desired to give him an audience
the emperor francis received him standing in the middle of the room
before the conversation began prince andrew was struck by the fact that the emperor seemed confused and blushed as if not knowing what to say
"tell me  when did the battle begin " he asked hurriedly
prince andrew replied
then followed other questions just as simple  "was kutuzov well  when had he left krems " and so on the emperor spoke as if his sole aim were to put a given number of questions—the answers to these questions  as was only too evident  did not interest him
"at what o'clock did the battle begin " asked the emperor
"i cannot inform your majesty at what o'clock the battle began at the front  but at durrenstein  where i was  our attack began after five in the afternoon " replied bolkonski growing more animated and expecting that he would have a chance to give a reliable account  which he had ready in his mind  of all he knew and had seen
but the emperor smiled and interrupted him
"how many miles " "from where to where  your majesty " "from durrenstein to krems " "three and a half miles  your majesty " "the french have abandoned the left bank " "according to the scouts the last of them crossed on rafts during the night " "is there sufficient forage in krems " "forage has not been supplied to the extent   " the emperor interrupted him "at what o'clock was general schmidt killed " "at seven o'clock  i believe " "at seven o'clock  it's very sad  very sad " the emperor thanked prince andrew and bowed
prince andrew withdrew and was immediately surrounded by courtiers on all sides
everywhere he saw friendly looks and heard friendly words
yesterday's adjutant reproached him for not having stayed at the palace  and offered him his own house
the minister of war came up and congratulated him on the maria theresa order of the third grade  which the emperor was conferring on him
the empress' chamberlain invited him to see her majesty
the archduchess also wished to see him
he did not know whom to answer  and for a few seconds collected his thoughts
then the russian ambassador took him by the shoulder  led him to the window  and began to talk to him
contrary to bilibin's forecast the news he had brought was joyfully received
a thanksgiving service was arranged  kutuzov was awarded the grand cross of maria theresa  and the whole army received rewards
bolkonski was invited everywhere  and had to spend the whole morning calling on the principal austrian dignitaries
between four and five in the afternoon  having made all his calls  he was returning to bilibin's house thinking out a letter to his father about the battle and his visit to brunn
at the door he found a vehicle half full of luggage
franz  bilibin's man  was dragging a portmanteau with some difficulty out of the front door
in the shop
"what is it " he asked
"oh  your excellency " said franz  with difficulty rolling the portmanteau into the vehicle  "we are to move on still farther
the scoundrel is again at our heels " "eh  what " asked prince andrew
bilibin came out to meet him
his usually calm face showed excitement
"there now  confess that this is delightful " said he
"this affair of the thabor bridge  at vienna   
they have crossed without striking a blow " prince andrew could not understand
"but where do you come from not to know what every coachman in the town knows " "i come from the archduchess'
i heard nothing there " "and you didn't see that everybody is packing up " "i did not  
what is it all about " inquired prince andrew impatiently
"what's it all about  why  the french have crossed the bridge that auersperg was defending  and the bridge was not blown up  so murat is now rushing along the road to brunn and will be here in a day or two " "what  here  but why did they not blow up the bridge  if it was mined " "that is what i ask you
no one  not even bonaparte  knows why " bolkonski shrugged his shoulders
"but if the bridge is crossed it means that the army too is lost  it will be cut off " said he
"that's just it " answered bilibin
"listen  the french entered vienna as i told you
very well
next day  which was yesterday  those gentlemen  messieurs les marechaux  * murat  lannes  and belliard  mount and ride to the bridge
 observe that all three are gascons   'gentlemen ' says one of them  'you know the thabor bridge is mined and doubly mined and that there are menacing fortifications at its head and an army of fifteen thousand men has been ordered to blow up the bridge and not let us cross  but it will please our sovereign the emperor napoleon if we take this bridge  so let us three go and take it ' 'yes  let's ' say the others
and off they go and take the bridge  cross it  and now with their whole army are on this side of the danube  marching on us  you  and your lines of communication " * the marshalls
"stop jesting " said prince andrew sadly and seriously
this news grieved him and yet he was pleased
as soon as he learned that the russian army was in such a hopeless situation it occurred to him that it was he who was destined to lead it out of this position  that here was the toulon that would lift him from the ranks of obscure officers and offer him the first step to fame  listening to bilibin he was already imagining how on reaching the army he would give an opinion at the war council which would be the only one that could save the army  and how he alone would be entrusted with the executing of the plan
"stop this jesting " he said
"i am not jesting " bilibin went on
"nothing is truer or sadder
these gentlemen ride onto the bridge alone and wave white handkerchiefs  they assure the officer on duty that they  the marshals  are on their way to negotiate with prince auersperg
he lets them enter the tte de pont
* they spin him a thousand gasconades  saying that the war is over  that the emperor francis is arranging a meeting with bonaparte  that they desire to see prince auersperg  and so on
the officer sends for auersperg  these gentlemen embrace the officers  crack jokes  sit on the cannon  and meanwhile a french battalion gets to the bridge unobserved  flings the bags of incendiary material into the water  and approaches the tte de pont
at length appears the lieutenant general  our dear prince auersperg von mautern himself 'dearest foe  flower of the austrian army  hero of the turkish wars hostilities are ended  we can shake one another's hand   
the emperor napoleon burns with impatience to make prince auersperg's acquaintance ' in a word  those gentlemen  gascons indeed  so bewildered him with fine words  and he is so flattered by his rapidly established intimacy with the french marshals  and so dazzled by the sight of murat's mantle and ostrich plumes  qu'il n'y voit que du feu  et oublie celui qu'il devait faire faire sur l'ennemi " * 2  in spite of the animation of his speech  bilibin did not forget to pause after this mot to give time for its due appreciation
"the french battalion rushes to the bridgehead  spikes the guns  and the bridge is taken  but what is best of all " he went on  his excitement subsiding under the delightful interest of his own story  "is that the sergeant in charge of the cannon which was to give the signal to fire the mines and blow up the bridge  this sergeant  seeing that the french troops were running onto the bridge  was about to fire  but lannes stayed his hand
the sergeant  who was evidently wiser than his general  goes up to auersperg and says  'prince  you are being deceived  here are the french ' murat  seeing that all is lost if the sergeant is allowed to speak  turns to auersperg with feigned astonishment  he is a true gascon  and says  'i don't recognize the world famous austrian discipline  if you allow a subordinate to address you like that ' it was a stroke of genius
prince auersperg feels his dignity at stake and orders the sergeant to be arrested
come  you must own that this affair of the thabor bridge is delightful  it is not exactly stupidity  nor rascality    " * bridgehead
*  2  that their fire gets into his eyes and he forgets that he ought to be firing at the enemy
"it may be treachery " said prince andrew  vividly imagining the gray overcoats  wounds  the smoke of gunpowder  the sounds of firing  and the glory that awaited him
"not that either
that puts the court in too bad a light " replied bilibin
"it's not treachery nor rascality nor stupidity  it is just as at ulm  
it is   "—he seemed to be trying to find the right expression
"c'est  
c'est du mack
nous sommes mackes  it is  
it is a bit of mack
we are macked  " he concluded  feeling that he had produced a good epigram  a fresh one that would be repeated
his hitherto puckered brow became smooth as a sign of pleasure  and with a slight smile he began to examine his nails
"where are you off to " he said suddenly to prince andrew who had risen and was going toward his room
"i am going away " "where to " "to the army " "but you meant to stay another two days " "but now i am off at once " and prince andrew after giving directions about his departure went to his room
"do you know  mon cher " said bilibin following him  "i have been thinking about you
why are you going " and in proof of the conclusiveness of his opinion all the wrinkles vanished from his face
prince andrew looked inquiringly at him and gave no reply
"why are you going  i know you think it your duty to gallop back to the army now that it is in danger
i understand that
mon cher  it is heroism " "not at all " said prince andrew
"but as you are a philosopher  be a consistent one  look at the other side of the question and you will see that your duty  on the contrary  is to take care of yourself
leave it to those who are no longer fit for anything else   
you have not been ordered to return and have not been dismissed from here  therefore  you can stay and go with us wherever our ill luck takes us
they say we are going to olmutz  and olmutz is a very decent town
you and i will travel comfortably in my caleche " "do stop joking  bilibin " cried bolkonski
"i am speaking sincerely as a friend  consider  where and why are you going  when you might remain here  you are faced by one of two things " and the skin over his left temple puckered  "either you will not reach your regiment before peace is concluded  or you will share defeat and disgrace with kutuzov's whole army " and bilibin unwrinkled his temple  feeling that the dilemma was insoluble
"i cannot argue about it " replied prince andrew coldly  but he thought  "i am going to save the army " "my dear fellow  you are a hero " said bilibin
that same night  having taken leave of the minister of war  bolkonski set off to rejoin the army  not knowing where he would find it and fearing to be captured by the french on the way to krems in brunn everybody attached to the court was packing up  and the heavy baggage was already being dispatched to olmutz
near hetzelsdorf prince andrew struck the high road along which the russian army was moving with great haste and in the greatest disorder
the road was so obstructed with carts that it was impossible to get by in a carriage
prince andrew took a horse and a cossack from a cossack commander  and hungry and weary  making his way past the baggage wagons  rode in search of the commander in chief and of his own luggage
very sinister reports of the position of the army reached him as he went along  and the appearance of the troops in their disorderly flight confirmed these rumors
"cette armee russe que l'or de l'angleterre a transportee des extremites de l'univers  nous allons lui faire eprouver le meme sort— le sort de l'armee d'ulm  " * he remembered these words in bonaparte's address to his army at the beginning of the campaign  and they awoke in him astonishment at the genius of his hero  a feeling of wounded pride  and a hope of glory
"and should there be nothing left but to die " he thought
"well  if need be  i shall do it no worse than others " * "that russian army which has been brought from the ends of the earth by english gold  we shall cause to share the same fate— the fate of the army at ulm  " he looked with disdain at the endless confused mass of detachments  carts  guns  artillery  and again baggage wagons and vehicles of all kinds overtaking one another and blocking the muddy road  three and sometimes four abreast
from all sides  behind and before  as far as ear could reach  there were the rattle of wheels  the creaking of carts and gun carriages  the tramp of horses  the crack of whips  shouts  the urging of horses  and the swearing of soldiers  orderlies  and officers
all along the sides of the road fallen horses were to be seen  some flayed  some not  and broken down carts beside which solitary soldiers sat waiting for something  and again soldiers straggling from their companies  crowds of whom set off to the neighboring villages  or returned from them dragging sheep  fowls  hay  and bulging sacks
at each ascent or descent of the road the crowds were yet denser and the din of shouting more incessant
soldiers floundering knee deep in mud pushed the guns and wagons themselves whips cracked  hoofs slipped  traces broke  and lungs were strained with shouting
the officers directing the march rode backward and forward between the carts
their voices were but feebly heard amid the uproar and one saw by their faces that they despaired of the possibility of checking this disorder
"here is our dear orthodox russian army " thought bolkonski  recalling bilibin's words
wishing to find out where the commander in chief was  he rode up to a convoy
directly opposite to him came a strange one horse vehicle  evidently rigged up by soldiers out of any available materials and looking like something between a cart  a cabriolet  and a caleche
a soldier was driving  and a woman enveloped in shawls sat behind the apron under the leather hood of the vehicle
prince andrew rode up and was just putting his question to a soldier when his attention was diverted by the desperate shrieks of the woman in the vehicle
an officer in charge of transport was beating the soldier who was driving the woman's vehicle for trying to get ahead of others  and the strokes of his whip fell on the apron of the equipage
the woman screamed piercingly
seeing prince andrew she leaned out from behind the apron and  waving her thin arms from under the woolen shawl  cried  "mr aide de camp  mr aide de camp    for heaven's sake  
protect me  what will become of us  i am the wife of the doctor of the seventh chasseurs   
they won't let us pass  we are left behind and have lost our people   " "i'll flatten you into a pancake " shouted the angry officer to the soldier
"turn back with your slut " "mr aide de camp  help me   
what does it all mean " screamed the doctor's wife
"kindly let this cart pass
don't you see it's a woman " said prince andrew riding up to the officer
the officer glanced at him  and without replying turned again to the soldier
"i'll teach you to push on   
back " "let them pass  i tell you " repeated prince andrew  compressing his lips
"and who are you " cried the officer  turning on him with tipsy rage  "who are you  are you in command here  eh  i am commander here  not you  go back or i'll flatten you into a pancake " repeated he
this expression evidently pleased him
"that was a nice snub for the little aide de camp " came a voice from behind
prince andrew saw that the officer was in that state of senseless  tipsy rage when a man does not know what he is saying
he saw that his championship of the doctor's wife in her queer trap might expose him to what he dreaded more than anything in the world—to ridicule  but his instinct urged him on
before the officer finished his sentence prince andrew  his face distorted with fury  rode up to him and raised his riding whip
"kind   ly let—them—pass " the officer flourished his arm and hastily rode away
"it's all the fault of these fellows on the staff that there's this disorder " he muttered
"do as you like " prince andrew without lifting his eyes rode hastily away from the doctor's wife  who was calling him her deliverer  and recalling with a sense of disgust the minutest details of this humiliating scene he galloped on to the village where he was told that the commander in chief was
on reaching the village he dismounted and went to the nearest house  intending to rest if but for a moment  eat something  and try to sort out the stinging and tormenting thoughts that confused his mind
"this is a mob of scoundrels and not an army " he was thinking as he went up to the window of the first house  when a familiar voice called him by name
he turned round
nesvitski's handsome face looked out of the little window
nesvitski  moving his moist lips as he chewed something  and flourishing his arm  called him to enter
"bolkonski  bolkonski   
don't you hear  eh  come quick   " he shouted
entering the house  prince andrew saw nesvitski and another adjutant having something to eat
they hastily turned round to him asking if he had any news
on their familiar faces he read agitation and alarm
this was particularly noticeable on nesvitski's usually laughing countenance
"where is the commander in chief " asked bolkonski
"here  in that house " answered the adjutant
"well  is it true that it's peace and capitulation " asked nesvitski
"i was going to ask you
i know nothing except that it was all i could do to get here " "and we  my dear boy  it's terrible  i was wrong to laugh at mack  we're getting it still worse " said nesvitski
"but sit down and have something to eat " "you won't be able to find either your baggage or anything else now  prince
and god only knows where your man peter is " said the other adjutant
"where are headquarters " "we are to spend the night in znaim " "well  i have got all i need into packs for two horses " said nesvitski
"they've made up splendid packs for me—fit to cross the bohemian mountains with
it's a bad lookout  old fellow  but what's the matter with you  you must be ill to shiver like that " he added  noticing that prince andrew winced as at an electric shock
"it's nothing " replied prince andrew
he had just remembered his recent encounter with the doctor's wife and the convoy officer
"what is the commander in chief doing here " he asked
"i can't make out at all " said nesvitski
"well  all i can make out is that everything is abominable  abominable  quite abominable " said prince andrew  and he went off to the house where the commander in chief was
passing by kutuzov's carriage and the exhausted saddle horses of his suite  with their cossacks who were talking loudly together  prince andrew entered the passage
kutuzov himself  he was told  was in the house with prince bagration and weyrother weyrother was the austrian general who had succeeded schmidt
in the passage little kozlovski was squatting on his heels in front of a clerk
the clerk  with cuffs turned up  was hastily writing at a tub turned bottom upwards
kozlovski's face looked worn—he too had evidently not slept all night
he glanced at prince andrew and did not even nod to him
"second line  
have you written it " he continued dictating to the clerk
"the kiev grenadiers  podolian   " "one can't write so fast  your honor " said the clerk  glancing angrily and disrespectfully at kozlovski
through the door came the sounds of kutuzov's voice  excited and dissatisfied  interrupted by another  an unfamiliar voice
from the sound of these voices  the inattentive way kozlovski looked at him  the disrespectful manner of the exhausted clerk  the fact that the clerk and kozlovski were squatting on the floor by a tub so near to the commander in chief  and from the noisy laughter of the cossacks holding the horses near the window  prince andrew felt that something important and disastrous was about to happen
he turned to kozlovski with urgent questions
"immediately  prince " said kozlovski
"dispositions for bagration " "what about capitulation " "nothing of the sort
orders are issued for a battle " prince andrew moved toward the door from whence voices were heard
just as he was going to open it the sounds ceased  the door opened  and kutuzov with his eagle nose and puffy face appeared in the doorway
prince andrew stood right in front of kutuzov but the expression of the commander in chief's one sound eye showed him to be so preoccupied with thoughts and anxieties as to be oblivious of his presence
he looked straight at his adjutant's face without recognizing him
"well  have you finished " said he to kozlovski
"one moment  your excellency " bagration  a gaunt middle aged man of medium height with a firm  impassive face of oriental type  came out after the commander in chief
"i have the honor to present myself " repeated prince andrew rather loudly  handing kutuzov an envelope
"ah  from vienna  very good
later  later " kutuzov went out into the porch with bagration
"well  good by  prince " said he to bagration
"my blessing  and may christ be with you in your great endeavor " his face suddenly softened and tears came into his eyes
with his left hand he drew bagration toward him  and with his right  on which he wore a ring  he made the sign of the cross over him with a gesture evidently habitual  offering his puffy cheek  but bagration kissed him on the neck instead
"christ be with you " kutuzov repeated and went toward his carriage
"get in with me " said he to bolkonski
"your excellency  i should like to be of use here
allow me to remain with prince bagration's detachment " "get in " said kutuzov  and noticing that bolkonski still delayed  he added  "i need good officers myself  need them myself " they got into the carriage and drove for a few minutes in silence
"there is still much  much before us " he said  as if with an old man's penetration he understood all that was passing in bolkonski's mind
"if a tenth part of his detachment returns i shall thank god " he added as if speaking to himself prince andrew glanced at kutuzov's face only a foot distant from him and involuntarily noticed the carefully washed seams of the scar near his temple  where an ismail bullet had pierced his skull  and the empty eye socket "yes  he has a right to speak so calmly of those men's death " thought bolkonski
"that is why i beg to be sent to that detachment " he said
kutuzov did not reply
he seemed to have forgotten what he had been saying  and sat plunged in thought
five minutes later  gently swaying on the soft springs of the carriage  he turned to prince andrew
there was not a trace of agitation on his face
with delicate irony he questioned prince andrew about the details of his interview with the emperor  about the remarks he had heard at court concerning the krems affair  and about some ladies they both knew on november 1 kutuzov had received  through a spy  news that the army he commanded was in an almost hopeless position
the spy reported that the french  after crossing the bridge at vienna  were advancing in immense force upon kutuzov's line of communication with the troops that were arriving from russia
if kutuzov decided to remain at krems  napoleon's army of one hundred and fifty thousand men would cut him off completely and surround his exhausted army of forty thousand  and he would find himself in the position of mack at ulm if kutuzov decided to abandon the road connecting him with the troops arriving from russia  he would have to march with no road into unknown parts of the bohemian mountains  defending himself against superior forces of the enemy and abandoning all hope of a junction with buxhowden if kutuzov decided to retreat along the road from krems to olmutz  to unite with the troops arriving from russia  he risked being forestalled on that road by the french who had crossed the vienna bridge  and encumbered by his baggage and transport  having to accept battle on the march against an enemy three times as strong  who would hem him in from two sides kutuzov chose this latter course
the french  the spy reported  having crossed the vienna bridge  were advancing by forced marches toward znaim  which lay sixty six miles off on the line of kutuzov's retreat
if he reached znaim before the french  there would be great hope of saving the army  to let the french forestall him at znaim meant the exposure of his whole army to a disgrace such as that of ulm  or to utter destruction
but to forestall the french with his whole army was impossible
the road for the french from vienna to znaim was shorter and better than the road for the russians from krems to znaim the night he received the news  kutuzov sent bagration's vanguard  four thousand strong  to the right across the hills from the krems znaim to the vienna znaim road bagration was to make this march without resting  and to halt facing vienna with znaim to his rear  and if he succeeded in forestalling the french he was to delay them as long as possible
kutuzov himself with all his transport took the road to znaim marching thirty miles that stormy night across roadless hills  with his hungry  ill shod soldiers  and losing a third of his men as stragglers by the way  bagration came out on the vienna znaim road at hollabrunn a few hours ahead of the french who were approaching hollabrunn from vienna
kutuzov with his transport had still to march for some days before he could reach znaim
hence bagration with his four thousand hungry  exhausted men would have to detain for days the whole enemy army that came upon him at hollabrunn  which was clearly impossible
but a freak of fate made the impossible possible
the success of the trick that had placed the vienna bridge in the hands of the french without a fight led murat to try to deceive kutuzov in a similar way
meeting bagration's weak detachment on the znaim road he supposed it to be kutuzov's whole army
to be able to crush it absolutely he awaited the arrival of the rest of the troops who were on their way from vienna  and with this object offered a three days' truce on condition that both armies should remain in position without moving
murat declared that negotiations for peace were already proceeding  and that he therefore offered this truce to avoid unnecessary bloodshed
count nostitz  the austrian general occupying the advanced posts  believed murat's emissary and retired  leaving bagration's division exposed
another emissary rode to the russian line to announce the peace negotiations and to offer the russian army the three days' truce
bagration replied that he was not authorized either to accept or refuse a truce and sent his adjutant to kutuzov to report the offer he had received
a truce was kutuzov's sole chance of gaining time  giving bagration's exhausted troops some rest  and letting the transport and heavy convoys  whose movements were concealed from the french  advance if but one stage nearer znaim
the offer of a truce gave the only  and a quite unexpected  chance of saving the army
on receiving the news he immediately dispatched adjutant general wintzingerode  who was in attendance on him  to the enemy camp
wintzingerode was not merely to agree to the truce but also to offer terms of capitulation  and meanwhile kutuzov sent his adjutants back to hasten to the utmost the movements of the baggage trains of the entire army along the krems znaim road bagration's exhausted and hungry detachment  which alone covered this movement of the transport and of the whole army  had to remain stationary in face of an enemy eight times as strong as itself
kutuzov's expectations that the proposals of capitulation  which were in no way binding  might give time for part of the transport to pass  and also that murat's mistake would very soon be discovered  proved correct
as soon as bonaparte  who was at schonbrunn  sixteen miles from hollabrunn  received murat's dispatch with the proposal of a truce and a capitulation  he detected a ruse and wrote the following letter to murat  schonbrunn  25th brumaire  1805  at eight o'clock in the morning to prince murat  i cannot find words to express to you my displeasure
you command only my advance guard  and have no right to arrange an armistice without my order
you are causing me to lose the fruits of a campaign
break the armistice immediately and march on the enemy
inform him that the general who signed that capitulation had no right to do so  and that no one but the emperor of russia has that right
if  however  the emperor of russia ratifies that convention  i will ratify it  but it is only a trick
march on  destroy the russian army   
you are in a position to seize its baggage and artillery
the russian emperor's aide de camp is an impostor
officers are nothing when they have no powers  this one had none   
the austrians let themselves be tricked at the crossing of the vienna bridge  you are letting yourself be tricked by an aide de camp of the emperor napoleon bonaparte's adjutant rode full gallop with this menacing letter to murat
bonaparte himself  not trusting to his generals  moved with all the guards to the field of battle  afraid of letting a ready victim escape  and bagration's four thousand men merrily lighted campfires  dried and warmed themselves  cooked their porridge for the first time for three days  and not one of them knew or imagined what was in store for him between three and four o'clock in the afternoon prince andrew  who had persisted in his request to kutuzov  arrived at grunth and reported himself to bagration bonaparte's adjutant had not yet reached murat's detachment and the battle had not yet begun
in bagration's detachment no one knew anything of the general position of affairs
they talked of peace but did not believe in its possibility  others talked of a battle but also disbelieved in the nearness of an engagement
bagration  knowing bolkonski to be a favorite and trusted adjutant  received him with distinction and special marks of favor  explaining to him that there would probably be an engagement that day or the next  and giving him full liberty to remain with him during the battle or to join the rearguard and have an eye on the order of retreat  "which is also very important " "however  there will hardly be an engagement today " said bagration as if to reassure prince andrew
"if he is one of the ordinary little staff dandies sent to earn a medal he can get his reward just as well in the rearguard  but if he wishes to stay with me  let him  
he'll be of use here if he's a brave officer " thought bagration
prince andrew  without replying  asked the prince's permission to ride round the position to see the disposition of the forces  so as to know his bearings should he be sent to execute an order
the officer on duty  a handsome  elegantly dressed man with a diamond ring on his forefinger  who was fond of speaking french though he spoke it badly  offered to conduct prince andrew
on all sides they saw rain soaked officers with dejected faces who seemed to be seeking something  and soldiers dragging doors  benches  and fencing from the village
"there now  prince  we can't stop those fellows " said the staff officer pointing to the soldiers
"the officers don't keep them in hand
and there " he pointed to a sutler's tent  "they crowd in and sit
this morning i turned them all out and now look  it's full again
i must go there  prince  and scare them a bit
it won't take a moment " "yes  let's go in and i will get myself a roll and some cheese " said prince andrew who had not yet had time to eat anything
"why didn't you mention it  prince  i would have offered you something " they dismounted and entered the tent
several officers  with flushed and weary faces  were sitting at the table eating and drinking
"now what does this mean  gentlemen " said the staff officer  in the reproachful tone of a man who has repeated the same thing more than once
"you know it won't do to leave your posts like this
the prince gave orders that no one should leave his post
now you  captain " and he turned to a thin  dirty little artillery officer who without his boots  he had given them to the canteen keeper to dry   in only his stockings  rose when they entered  smiling not altogether comfortably
"well  aren't you ashamed of yourself  captain tushin " he continued
"one would think that as an artillery officer you would set a good example  yet here you are without your boots  the alarm will be sounded and you'll be in a pretty position without your boots "  the staff officer smiled   "kindly return to your posts  gentlemen  all of you  all " he added in a tone of command
prince andrew smiled involuntarily as he looked at the artillery officer tushin  who silent and smiling  shifting from one stockinged foot to the other  glanced inquiringly with his large  intelligent  kindly eyes from prince andrew to the staff officer
"the soldiers say it feels easier without boots " said captain tushin smiling shyly in his uncomfortable position  evidently wishing to adopt a jocular tone
but before he had finished he felt that his jest was unacceptable and had not come off
he grew confused
"kindly return to your posts " said the staff officer trying to preserve his gravity
prince andrew glanced again at the artillery officer's small figure
there was something peculiar about it  quite unsoldierly  rather comic  but extremely attractive
the staff officer and prince andrew mounted their horses and rode on
having ridden beyond the village  continually meeting and overtaking soldiers and officers of various regiments  they saw on their left some entrenchments being thrown up  the freshly dug clay of which showed up red
several battalions of soldiers  in their shirt sleeves despite the cold wind  swarmed in these earthworks like a host of white ants  spadefuls of red clay were continually being thrown up from behind the bank by unseen hands
prince andrew and the officer rode up  looked at the entrenchment  and went on again
just behind it they came upon some dozens of soldiers  continually replaced by others  who ran from the entrenchment
they had to hold their noses and put their horses to a trot to escape from the poisoned atmosphere of these latrines
"voila l'agrement des camps  monsieur le prince " * said the staff officer
* "this is a pleasure one gets in camp  prince " they rode up the opposite hill
from there the french could already be seen
prince andrew stopped and began examining the position
"that's our battery " said the staff officer indicating the highest point
"it's in charge of the queer fellow we saw without his boots
you can see everything from there  let's go there  prince " "thank you very much  i will go on alone " said prince andrew  wishing to rid himself of this staff officer's company  "please don't trouble yourself further " the staff officer remained behind and prince andrew rode on alone the farther forward and nearer the enemy he went  the more orderly and cheerful were the troops
the greatest disorder and depression had been in the baggage train he had passed that morning on the znaim road seven miles away from the french
at grunth also some apprehension and alarm could be felt  but the nearer prince andrew came to the french lines the more confident was the appearance of our troops
the soldiers in their greatcoats were ranged in lines  the sergeants major and company officers were counting the men  poking the last man in each section in the ribs and telling him to hold his hand up
soldiers scattered over the whole place were dragging logs and brushwood and were building shelters with merry chatter and laughter  around the fires sat others  dressed and undressed  drying their shirts and leg bands or mending boots or overcoats and crowding round the boilers and porridge cookers
in one company dinner was ready  and the soldiers were gazing eagerly at the steaming boiler  waiting till the sample  which a quartermaster sergeant was carrying in a wooden bowl to an officer who sat on a log before his shelter  had been tasted
another company  a lucky one for not all the companies had vodka  crowded round a pockmarked  broad shouldered sergeant major who  tilting a keg  filled one after another the canteen lids held out to him
the soldiers lifted the canteen lids to their lips with reverential faces  emptied them  rolling the vodka in their mouths  and walked away from the sergeant major with brightened expressions  licking their lips and wiping them on the sleeves of their greatcoats
all their faces were as serene as if all this were happening at home awaiting peaceful encampment  and not within sight of the enemy before an action in which at least half of them would be left on the field
after passing a chasseur regiment and in the lines of the kiev grenadiers—fine fellows busy with similar peaceful affairs—near the shelter of the regimental commander  higher than and different from the others  prince andrew came out in front of a platoon of grenadiers before whom lay a naked man
two soldiers held him while two others were flourishing their switches and striking him regularly on his bare back
the man shrieked unnaturally
a stout major was pacing up and down the line  and regardless of the screams kept repeating  "it's a shame for a soldier to steal  a soldier must be honest  honorable  and brave  but if he robs his fellows there is no honor in him  he's a scoundrel go on  go on " so the swishing sound of the strokes  and the desperate but unnatural screams  continued "go on  go on " said the major
a young officer with a bewildered and pained expression on his face stepped away from the man and looked round inquiringly at the adjutant as he rode by
prince andrew  having reached the front line  rode along it
our front line and that of the enemy were far apart on the right and left flanks  but in the center where the men with a flag of truce had passed that morning  the lines were so near together that the men could see one another's faces and speak to one another
besides the soldiers who formed the picket line on either side  there were many curious onlookers who  jesting and laughing  stared at their strange foreign enemies
since early morning—despite an injunction not to approach the picket line— the officers had been unable to keep sight seers away
the soldiers forming the picket line  like showmen exhibiting a curiosity  no longer looked at the french but paid attention to the sight seers and grew weary waiting to be relieved
prince andrew halted to have a look at the french
"look  look there " one soldier was saying to another  pointing to a russian musketeer who had gone up to the picket line with an officer and was rapidly and excitedly talking to a french grenadier
"hark to him jabbering  fine  isn't it  it's all the frenchy can do to keep up with him
there now  sidorov " "wait a bit and listen
it's fine " answered sidorov  who was considered an adept at french
the soldier to whom the laughers referred was dolokhov
prince andrew recognized him and stopped to listen to what he was saying
dolokhov had come from the left flank where their regiment was stationed  with his captain
"now then  go on  go on " incited the officer  bending forward and trying not to lose a word of the speech which was incomprehensible to him
"more  please  more  what's he saying " dolokhov did not answer the captain  he had been drawn into a hot dispute with the french grenadier
they were naturally talking about the campaign
the frenchman  confusing the austrians with the russians  was trying to prove that the russians had surrendered and had fled all the way from ulm  while dolokhov maintained that the russians had not surrendered but had beaten the french
"we have orders to drive you off here  and we shall drive you off " said dolokhov
"only take care you and your cossacks are not all captured " said the french grenadier
the french onlookers and listeners laughed
"we'll make you dance as we did under suvorov    " * said dolokhov
* "on vous fera danser " "qu' est ce qu'il chante " * asked a frenchman
* "what's he singing about " "it's ancient history " said another  guessing that it referred to a former war
"the emperor will teach your suvara as he has taught the others   " "bonaparte   " began dolokhov  but the frenchman interrupted him
"not bonaparte
he is the emperor  sacre nom    " cried he angrily
"the devil skin your emperor " and dolokhov swore at him in coarse soldier's russian and shouldering his musket walked away
"let us go  ivan lukich " he said to the captain
"ah  that's the way to talk french " said the picket soldiers
"now  sidorov  you have a try " sidorov  turning to the french  winked  and began to jabber meaningless sounds very fast  "kari  mala  tafa  safi  muter  kaska " he said  trying to give an expressive intonation to his voice
"ho  ho  ho  ha  ha  ha  ha  ouh  ouh " came peals of such healthy and goodhumored laughter from the soldiers that it infected the french involuntarily  so much so that the only thing left to do seemed to be to unload the muskets  explode the ammunition  and all return home as quickly as possible
but the guns remained loaded  the loopholes in blockhouses and entrenchments looked out just as menacingly  and the unlimbered cannon confronted one another as before
having ridden round the whole line from right flank to left  prince andrew made his way up to the battery from which the staff officer had told him the whole field could be seen
here he dismounted  and stopped beside the farthest of the four unlimbered cannon
before the guns an artillery sentry was pacing up and down  he stood at attention when the officer arrived  but at a sign resumed his measured  monotonous pacing
behind the guns were their limbers and still farther back picket ropes and artillerymen's bonfires
to the left  not far from the farthest cannon  was a small  newly constructed wattle shed from which came the sound of officers' voices in eager conversation
it was true that a view over nearly the whole russian position and the greater part of the enemy's opened out from this battery
just facing it  on the crest of the opposite hill  the village of schon grabern could be seen  and in three places to left and right the french troops amid the smoke of their campfires  the greater part of whom were evidently in the village itself and behind the hill
to the left from that village  amid the smoke  was something resembling a battery  but it was impossible to see it clearly with the naked eye
our right flank was posted on a rather steep incline which dominated the french position
our infantry were stationed there  and at the farthest point the dragoons
in the center  where tushin's battery stood and from which prince andrew was surveying the position  was the easiest and most direct descent and ascent to the brook separating us from schon grabern
on the left our troops were close to a copse  in which smoked the bonfires of our infantry who were felling wood
the french line was wider than ours  and it was plain that they could easily outflank us on both sides
behind our position was a steep and deep dip  making it difficult for artillery and cavalry to retire
prince the position
he made some notes on two points  intending to mention them to bagration
his idea was  first  to concentrate all the artillery in the center  and secondly  to withdraw the cavalry to the other side of the dip
prince andrew  being always near the commander in chief  closely following the mass movements and general orders  and constantly studying historical accounts of battles  involuntarily pictured to himself the course of events in the forthcoming action in broad outline he imagined only important possibilities  "if the enemy attacks the right flank " he said to himself  "the kiev grenadiers and the podolsk chasseurs must hold their position till reserves from the center come up in that case the dragoons could successfully make a flank counterattack
if they attack our center we  having the center battery on this high ground  shall withdraw the left flank under its cover  and retreat to the dip by echelons " so he reasoned   
all the time he had been beside the gun  he had heard the voices of the officers distinctly  but as often happens had not understood a word of what they were saying
suddenly  however  he was struck by a voice coming from the shed  and its tone was so sincere that he could not but listen
"no  friend " said a pleasant and  as it seemed to prince andrew  a familiar voice  "what i say is that if it were possible to know what is beyond death  none of us would be afraid of it
that's so  friend " another  a younger voice  interrupted him  "afraid or not  you can't escape it anyhow " "all the same  one is afraid  oh  you clever people " said a third manly voice interrupting them both
"of course you artillery men are very wise  because you can take everything along with you—vodka and snacks " and the owner of the manly voice  evidently an infantry officer  laughed
"yes  one is afraid " continued the first speaker  he of the familiar voice
"one is afraid of the unknown  that's what it is
whatever we may say about the soul going to the sky  
we know there is no sky but only an atmosphere " the manly voice again interrupted the artillery officer
"well  stand us some of your herb vodka  tushin " it said
"why " thought prince andrew  "that's the captain who stood up in the sutler's hut without his boots " he recognized the agreeable  philosophizing voice with pleasure
"some herb vodka  certainly " said tushin
"but still  to conceive a future life   " he did not finish
just then there was a whistle in the air  nearer and nearer  faster and louder  louder and faster  a cannon ball  as if it had not finished saying what was necessary  thudded into the ground near the shed with super human force  throwing up a mass of earth
the ground seemed to groan at the terrible impact
and immediately tushin  with a short pipe in the corner of his mouth and his kind  intelligent face rather pale  rushed out of the shed followed by the owner of the manly voice  a dashing infantry officer who hurried off to his company  buttoning up his coat as he ran
mounting his horse again prince andrew lingered with the battery  looking at the puff from the gun that had sent the ball
his eyes ran rapidly over the wide space  but he only saw that the hitherto motionless masses of the french now swayed and that there really was a battery to their left
the smoke above it had not yet dispersed
two mounted frenchmen  probably adjutants  were galloping up the hill
a small but distinctly visible enemy column was moving down the hill  probably to strengthen the front line
the smoke of the first shot had not yet dispersed before another puff appeared  followed by a report
the battle had begun  prince andrew turned his horse and galloped back to grunth to find prince bagration
he heard the cannonade behind him growing louder and more frequent
evidently our guns had begun to reply
from the bottom of the slope  where the parleys had taken place  came the report of musketry
lemarrois had just arrived at a gallop with bonaparte's stern letter  and murat  humiliated and anxious to expiate his fault  had at once moved his forces to attack the center and outflank both the russian wings  hoping before evening and before the arrival of the emperor to crush the contemptible detachment that stood before him
"it has begun
here it is " thought prince andrew  feeling the blood rush to his heart
"but where and how will my toulon present itself " passing between the companies that had been eating porridge and drinking vodka a quarter of an hour before  he saw everywhere the same rapid movement of soldiers forming ranks and getting their muskets ready  and on all their faces he recognized the same eagerness that filled his heart
"it has begun  here it is  dreadful but enjoyable " was what the face of each soldier and each officer seemed to say
before he had reached the embankments that were being thrown up  he saw  in the light of the dull autumn evening  mounted men coming toward him
the foremost  wearing a cossack cloak and lambskin cap and riding a white horse  was prince bagration
prince andrew stopped  waiting for him to come up  prince bagration reined in his horse and recognizing prince andrew nodded to him
he still looked ahead while prince andrew told him what he had seen
the feeling  "it has begun  here it is " was seen even on prince bagration's hard brown face with its half closed  dull  sleepy eyes
prince andrew gazed with anxious curiosity at that impassive face and wished he could tell what  if anything  this man was thinking and feeling at that moment
"is there anything at all behind that impassive face " prince andrew asked himself as he looked prince bagration bent his head in sign of agreement with what prince andrew told him  and said  "very good " in a tone that seemed to imply that everything that took place and was reported to him was exactly what he had foreseen
prince andrew  out of breath with his rapid ride  spoke quickly
prince bagration  uttering his words with an oriental accent  spoke particularly slowly  as if to impress the fact that there was no need to hurry
however  he put his horse to a trot in the direction of tushin's battery
prince andrew followed with the suite
behind prince bagration rode an officer of the suite  the prince's personal adjutant  zherkov  an orderly officer  the staff officer on duty  riding a fine bobtailed horse  and a civilian—an accountant who had asked permission to be present at the battle out of curiosity
the accountant  a stout  full faced man  looked around him with a naive smile of satisfaction and presented a strange appearance among the hussars  cossacks  and adjutants  in his camlet coat  as he jolted on his horse with a convoy officer's saddle
"he wants to see a battle " said zherkov to bolkonski  pointing to the accountant  "but he feels a pain in the pit of his stomach already " "oh  leave off " said the accountant with a beaming but rather cunning smile  as if flattered at being made the subject of zherkov's joke  and purposely trying to appear stupider than he really was
"it is very strange  mon monsieur prince " said the staff officer
 he remembered that in french there is some peculiar way of addressing a prince  but could not get it quite right   by this time they were all approaching tushin's battery  and a ball struck the ground in front of them
"what's that that has fallen " asked the accountant with a naive smile
"a french pancake " answered zherkov
"so that's what they hit with " asked the accountant
"how awful " he seemed to swell with satisfaction
he had hardly finished speaking when they again heard an unexpectedly violent whistling which suddenly ended with a thud into something soft  
f f flop  and a cossack  riding a little to their right and behind the accountant  crashed to earth with his horse
zherkov and the staff officer bent over their saddles and turned their horses away
the accountant stopped  facing the cossack  and examined him with attentive curiosity
the cossack was dead  but the horse still struggled
prince bagration screwed up his eyes  looked round  and  seeing the cause of the confusion  turned away with indifference  as if to say  "is it worth while noticing trifles " he reined in his horse with the care of a skillful rider and  slightly bending over  disengaged his saber which had caught in his cloak
it was an old fashioned saber of a kind no longer in general use
prince andrew remembered the story of suvorov giving his saber to bagration in italy  and the recollection was particularly pleasant at that moment
they had reached the battery at which prince andrew had been when he examined the battlefield
"whose company " asked prince bagration of an artilleryman standing by the ammunition wagon
he asked  "whose company " but he really meant  "are you frightened here " and the artilleryman understood him
"captain tushin's  your excellency " shouted the red haired  freckled gunner in a merry voice  standing to attention
"yes  yes " muttered bagration as if considering something  and he rode past the limbers to the farthest cannon
as he approached  a ringing shot issued from it deafening him and his suite  and in the smoke that suddenly surrounded the gun they could see the gunners who had seized it straining to roll it quickly back to its former position
a huge  broad shouldered gunner  number one  holding a mop  his legs far apart  sprang to the wheel  while number two with a trembling hand placed a charge in the cannon's mouth
the short  round shouldered captain tushin  stumbling over the tail of the gun carriage  moved forward and  not noticing the general  looked out shading his eyes with his small hand
"lift it two lines more and it will be just right " cried he in a feeble voice to which he tried to impart a dashing note  ill suited to his weak figure
"number two " he squeaked
"fire  medvedev " bagration called to him  and tushin  raising three fingers to his cap with a bashful and awkward gesture not at all like a military salute but like a priest's benediction  approached the general
though tushin's guns had been intended to cannonade the valley  he was firing incendiary balls at the village of schon grabern visible just opposite  in front of which large masses of french were advancing
no one had given tushin orders where and at what to fire  but after consulting his sergeant major  zakharchenko  for whom he had great respect  he had decided that it would be a good thing to set fire to the village
"very good " said bagration in reply to the officer's report  and began deliberately to examine the whole battlefield extended before him
the french had advanced nearest on our right
below the height on which the kiev regiment was stationed  in the hollow where the rivulet flowed  the soul stirring rolling and crackling of musketry was heard  and much farther to the right beyond the dragoons  the officer of the suite pointed out to bagration a french column that was outflanking us
to the left the horizon bounded by the adjacent wood
prince bagration ordered two battalions from the center to be sent to reinforce the right flank
the officer of the suite ventured to remark to the prince that if these battalions went away  the guns would remain without support
prince bagration turned to the officer and with his dull eyes looked at him in silence
it seemed to prince andrew that the officer's remark was just and that really no answer could be made to it
but at that moment an adjutant galloped up with a message from the commander of the regiment in the hollow and news that immense masses of the french were coming down upon them and that his regiment was in disorder and was retreating upon the kiev grenadiers
prince bagration bowed his head in sign of assent and approval
he rode off at a walk to the right and sent an adjutant to the dragoons with orders to attack the french
but this adjutant returned half an hour later with the news that the commander of the dragoons had already retreated beyond the dip in the ground  as a heavy fire had been opened on him and he was losing men uselessly  and so had hastened to throw some sharpshooters into the wood
"very good " said bagration
as he was leaving the battery  firing was heard on the left also  and as it was too far to the left flank for him to have time to go there himself  prince bagration sent zherkov to tell the general in command  the one who had paraded his regiment before kutuzov at braunau  that he must retreat as quickly as possible behind the hollow in the rear  as the right flank would probably not be able to withstand the enemy's attack very long about tushin and the battalion that had been in support of his battery all was forgotten
prince andrew listened attentively to bagration's colloquies with the commanding officers and the orders he gave them and  to his surprise  found that no orders were really given  but that prince bagration tried to make it appear that everything done by necessity  by accident  or by the will of subordinate commanders was done  if not by his direct command  at least in accord with his intentions
prince andrew noticed  however  that though what happened was due to chance and was independent of the commander's will  owing to the tact bagration showed  his presence was very valuable
officers who approached him with disturbed countenances became calm  soldiers and officers greeted him gaily  grew more cheerful in his presence  and were evidently anxious to display their courage before him
prince bagration  having reached the highest point of our right flank  began riding downhill to where the roll of musketry was heard but where on account of the smoke nothing could be seen
the nearer they got to the hollow the less they could see but the more they felt the nearness of the actual battlefield
they began to meet wounded men
one with a bleeding head and no cap was being dragged along by two soldiers who supported him under the arms there was a gurgle in his throat and he was spitting blood
a bullet had evidently hit him in the throat or mouth
another was walking sturdily by himself but without his musket  groaning aloud and swinging his arm which had just been hurt  while blood from it was streaming over his greatcoat as from a bottle he had that moment been wounded and his face showed fear rather than suffering
crossing a road they descended a steep incline and saw several men lying on the ground  they also met a crowd of soldiers some of whom were unwounded
the soldiers were ascending the hill breathing heavily  and despite the general's presence were talking loudly and gesticulating
in front of them rows of gray cloaks were already visible through the smoke  and an officer catching sight of bagration rushed shouting after the crowd of retreating soldiers  ordering them back
bagration rode up to the ranks along which shots crackled now here and now there  drowning the sound of voices and the shouts of command
the whole air reeked with smoke
the excited faces of the soldiers were blackened with it
some were using their ramrods  others putting powder on the touchpans or taking charges from their pouches  while others were firing  though who they were firing at could not be seen for the smoke which there was no wind to carry away a pleasant humming and whistling of bullets were often heard
"what is this " thought prince andrew approaching the crowd of soldiers
"it can't be an attack  for they are not moving  it can't be a square—for they are not drawn up for that " the commander of the regiment  a thin  feeble looking old man with a pleasant smile—his eyelids drooping more than half over his old eyes  giving him a mild expression  rode up to bagration and welcomed him as a host welcomes an honored guest
he reported that his regiment had been attacked by french cavalry and that  though the attack had been repulsed  he had lost more than half his men
he said the attack had been repulsed  employing this military term to describe what had occurred to his regiment  but in reality he did not himself know what had happened during that half hour to the troops entrusted to him  and could not say with certainty whether the attack had been repulsed or his regiment had been broken up all he knew was that at the commencement of the action balls and shells began flying all over his regiment and hitting men and that afterwards someone had shouted "cavalry " and our men had begun firing
they were still firing  not at the cavalry which had disappeared  but at french infantry who had come into the hollow and were firing at our men
prince bagration bowed his head as a sign that this was exactly what he had desired and expected
turning to his adjutant he ordered him to bring down the two battalions of the sixth chasseurs whom they had just passed
prince andrew was struck by the changed expression on prince bagration's face at this moment
it expressed the concentrated and happy resolution you see on the face of a man who on a hot day takes a final run before plunging into the water
the dull  sleepy expression was no longer there  nor the affectation of profound thought
the round  steady  hawk's eyes looked before him eagerly and rather disdainfully  not resting on anything although his movements were still slow and measured
the commander of the regiment turned to prince bagration  entreating him to go back as it was too dangerous to remain where they were
"please  your excellency  for god's sake " he kept saying  glancing for support at an officer of the suite who turned away from him
"there  you see " and he drew attention to the bullets whistling  singing  and hissing continually around them
he spoke in the tone of entreaty and reproach that a carpenter uses to a gentleman who has picked up an ax  "we are used to it  but you  sir  will blister your hands " he spoke as if those bullets could not kill him  and his half closed eyes gave still more persuasiveness to his words
the staff officer joined in the colonel's appeals  but bagration did not reply  he only gave an order to cease firing and re form  so as to give room for the two approaching battalions
while he was speaking  the curtain of smoke that had concealed the hollow  driven by a rising wind  began to move from right to left as if drawn by an invisible hand  and the hill opposite  with the french moving about on it  opened out before them
all eyes fastened involuntarily on this french column advancing against them and winding down over the uneven ground
one could already see the soldiers' shaggy caps  distinguish the officers from the men  and see the standard flapping against its staff
"they march splendidly " remarked someone in bagration's suite
the head of the column had already descended into the hollow
the clash would take place on this side of it  
the remains of our regiment which had been in action rapidly formed up and moved to the right  from behind it  dispersing the laggards  came two battalions of the sixth chasseurs in fine order
before they had reached bagration  the weighty tread of the mass of men marching in step could be heard
on their left flank  nearest to bagration  marched a company commander  a fine round faced man  with a stupid and happy expression—the same man who had rushed out of the wattle shed
at that moment he was clearly thinking of nothing but how dashing a fellow he would appear as he passed the commander
with the self satisfaction of a man on parade  he stepped lightly with his muscular legs as if sailing along  stretching himself to his full height without the smallest effort  his ease contrasting with the heavy tread of the soldiers who were keeping step with him he carried close to his leg a narrow unsheathed sword  small  curved  and not like a real weapon  and looked now at the superior officers and now back at the men without losing step  his whole powerful body turning flexibly it was as if all the powers of his soul were concentrated on passing the commander in the best possible manner  and feeling that he was doing it well he was happy
"left  
left  
left   " he seemed to repeat to himself at each alternate step  and in time to this  with stern but varied faces  the wall of soldiers burdened with knapsacks and muskets marched in step  and each one of these hundreds of soldiers seemed to be repeating to himself at each alternate step  "left   left  
left   " a fat major skirted a bush  puffing and falling out of step  a soldier who had fallen behind  his face showing alarm at his defection  ran at a trot  panting to catch up with his company
a cannon ball  cleaving the air  flew over the heads of bagration and his suite  and fell into the column to the measure of "left  
left " "close up " came the company commander's voice in jaunty tones
the soldiers passed in a semicircle round something where the ball had fallen  and an old trooper on the flank  a noncommissioned officer who had stopped beside the dead men  ran to catch up his line and  falling into step with a hop  looked back angrily  and through the ominous silence and the regular tramp of feet beating the ground in unison  one seemed to hear left  
left  
left
"well done  lads " said prince bagration
"glad to do our best  your ex'len lency " came a confused shout from the ranks
a morose soldier marching on the left turned his eyes on bagration as he shouted  with an expression that seemed to say  "we know that ourselves " another  without looking round  as though fearing to relax  shouted with his mouth wide open and passed on
the order was given to halt and down knapsacks
bagration rode round the ranks that had marched past him and dismounted
he gave the reins to a cossack  took off and handed over his felt coat  stretched his legs  and set his cap straight the head of the french column  with its officers leading  appeared from below the hill
"forward  with god " said bagration  in a resolute  sonorous voice  turning for a moment to the front line  and slightly swinging his arms  he went forward uneasily over the rough field with the awkward gait of a cavalryman prince andrew felt that an invisible power was leading him forward  and experienced great happiness
the french were already near
prince andrew  walking beside bagration  could clearly distinguish their bandoliers  red epaulets  and even their faces
 he distinctly saw an old french officer who  with gaitered legs and turned out toes  climbed the hill with difficulty   prince bagration gave no further orders and silently continued to walk on in front of the ranks
suddenly one shot after another rang out from the french  smoke appeared all along their uneven ranks  and musket shots sounded
several of our men fell  among them the round faced officer who had marched so gaily and complacently
but at the moment the first report was heard  bagration looked round and shouted  "hurrah " "hurrah—ah —ah " rang a long drawn shout from our ranks  and passing bagration and racing one another they rushed in an irregular but joyous and eager crowd down the hill at their disordered foe
the attack of the sixth chasseurs secured the retreat of our right flank
in the center tushin's forgotten battery  which had managed to set fire to the schon grabern village  delayed the french advance
the french were putting out the fire which the wind was spreading  and thus gave us time to retreat
the retirement of the center to the other side of the dip in the ground at the rear was hurried and noisy  but the different companies did not get mixed
but our left—which consisted of the azov and podolsk infantry and the pavlograd hussars—was simultaneously attacked and outflanked by superior french forces under lannes and was thrown into confusion
bagration had sent zherkov to the general commanding that left flank with orders to retreat immediately
zherkov  not removing his hand from his cap  turned his horse about and galloped off
but no sooner had he left bagration than his courage failed him
he was seized by panic and could not go where it was dangerous
having reached the left flank  instead of going to the front where the firing was  he began to look for the general and his staff where they could not possibly be  and so did not deliver the order
the command of the left flank belonged by seniority to the commander of the regiment kutuzov had reviewed at braunau and in which dolokhov was serving as a private
but the command of the extreme left flank had been assigned to the commander of the pavlograd regiment in which rostov was serving  and a misunderstanding arose
the two commanders were much exasperated with one another and  long after the action had begun on the right flank and the french were already advancing  were engaged in discussion with the sole object of offending one another
but the regiments  both cavalry and infantry  were by no means ready for the impending action
from privates to general they were not expecting a battle and were engaged in peaceful occupations  the cavalry feeding the horses and the infantry collecting wood
"he higher iss dan i in rank " said the german colonel of the hussars  flushing and addressing an adjutant who had ridden up  "so let him do what he vill  but i cannot sacrifice my hussars  
bugler  sount ze retreat " but haste was becoming imperative
cannon and musketry  mingling together  thundered on the right and in the center  while the capotes of lannes' sharpshooters were already seen crossing the milldam and forming up within twice the range of a musket shot
the general in command of the infantry went toward his horse with jerky steps  and having mounted drew himself up very straight and tall and rode to the pavlograd commander the commanders met with polite bows but with secret malevolence in their hearts
"once again  colonel " said the general  "i can't leave half my men in the wood
i beg of you  i beg of you " he repeated  "to occupy the position and prepare for an attack " "i peg of you yourself not to mix in vot is not your business " suddenly replied the irate colonel
"if you vere in the cavalry   " "i am not in the cavalry  colonel  but i am a russian general and if you are not aware of the fact   " "quite avare  your excellency " suddenly shouted the colonel  touching his horse and turning purple in the face
"vill you be so goot to come to ze front and see dat zis position iss no goot  i don't vish to destroy my men for your pleasure " "you forget yourself  colonel
i am not considering my own pleasure and i won't allow it to be said " taking the colonel's outburst as a challenge to his courage  the general expanded his chest and rode  frowning  beside him to the front line  as if their differences would be settled there amongst the bullets
they reached the front  several bullets sped over them  and they halted in silence
there was nothing fresh to be seen from the line  for from where they had been before it had been evident that it was impossible for cavalry to act among the bushes and broken ground  as well as that the french were outflanking our left
the general and colonel looked sternly and significantly at one another like two fighting cocks preparing for battle  each vainly trying to detect signs of cowardice in the other
both passed the examination successfully
as there was nothing to be said  and neither wished to give occasion for it to be alleged that he had been the first to leave the range of fire  they would have remained there for a long time testing each other's courage had it not been that just then they heard the rattle of musketry and a muffled shout almost behind them in the wood
the french had attacked the men collecting wood in the copse
it was no longer possible for the hussars to retreat with the infantry
they were cut off from the line of retreat on the left by the french
however inconvenient the position  it was now necessary to attack in order to cut a way through for themselves the squadron in which rostov was serving had scarcely time to mount before it was halted facing the enemy
again  as at the enns bridge  there was nothing between the squadron and the enemy  and again that terrible dividing line of uncertainty and fear—resembling the line separating the living from the dead —lay between them
all were conscious of this unseen line  and the question whether they would cross it or not  and how they would cross it  agitated them all
the colonel rode to the front  angrily gave some reply to questions put to him by the officers  and  like a man desperately insisting on having his own way  gave an order
no one said anything definite  but the rumor of an attack spread through the squadron
the command to form up rang out and the sabers whizzed as they were drawn from their scabbards
still no one moved
the troops of the left flank  infantry and hussars alike  felt that the commander did not himself know what to do  and this irresolution communicated itself to the men "if only they would be quick " thought rostov  feeling that at last the time had come to experience the joy of an attack of which he had so often heard from his fellow hussars
"fo'ward  with god  lads " rang out denisov's voice
"at a twot fo'ward " the horses' croups began to sway in the front line
rook pulled at the reins and started of his own accord
before him  on the right  rostov saw the front lines of his hussars and still farther ahead a dark line which he could not see distinctly but took to be the enemy
shots could be heard  but some way off
"faster " came the word of command  and rostov felt rook's flanks drooping as he broke into a gallop
rostov anticipated his horse's movements and became more and more elated
he had noticed a solitary tree ahead of him
this tree had been in the middle of the line that had seemed so terrible—and now he had crossed that line and not only was there nothing terrible  but everything was becoming more and more happy and animated
"oh  how i will slash at him " thought rostov  gripping the hilt of his saber
"hur a a a ah " came a roar of voices
"let anyone come my way now " thought rostov driving his spurs into rook and letting him go at a full gallop so that he outstripped the others
ahead  the enemy was already visible
suddenly something like a birch broom seemed to sweep over the squadron
rostov raised his saber  ready to strike  but at that instant the trooper nikitenko  who was galloping ahead  shot away from him  and rostov felt as in a dream that he continued to be carried forward with unnatural speed but yet stayed on the same spot
from behind him bondarchuk  an hussar he knew  jolted against him and looked angrily at him
bondarchuk's horse swerved and galloped past
"how is it i am not moving  i have fallen  i am killed " rostov asked and answered at the same instant
he was alone in the middle of a field
instead of the moving horses and hussars' backs  he saw nothing before him but the motionless earth and the stubble around him
there was warm blood under his arm
"no  i am wounded and the horse is killed " rook tried to rise on his forelegs but fell back  pinning his rider's leg
blood was flowing from his head  he struggled but could not rise
rostov also tried to rise but fell back  his sabretache having become entangled in the saddle
where our men were  and where the french  he did not know
there was no one near
having disentangled his leg  he rose
"where  on which side  was now the line that had so sharply divided the two armies " he asked himself and could not answer "can something bad have happened to me " he wondered as he got up  and at that moment he felt that something superfluous was hanging on his benumbed left arm
the wrist felt as if it were not his
he examined his hand carefully  vainly trying to find blood on it
"ah  here are people coming " he thought joyfully  seeing some men running toward him
"they will help me " in front came a man wearing a strange shako and a blue cloak  swarthy  sunburned  and with a hooked nose
then came two more  and many more running behind
one of them said something strange  not in russian
in among the hindmost of these men wearing similar shakos was a russian hussar
he was being held by the arms and his horse was being led behind him "it must be one of ours  a prisoner
yes
can it be that they will take me too  who are these men " thought rostov  scarcely believing his eyes
"can they be french " he looked at the approaching frenchmen  and though but a moment before he had been galloping to get at them and hack them to pieces  their proximity now seemed so awful that he could not believe his eyes
"who are they  why are they running  can they be coming at me  and why  to kill me  me whom everyone is so fond of " he remembered his mother's love for him  and his family's  and his friends'  and the enemy's intention to kill him seemed impossible
"but perhaps they may do it " for more than ten seconds he stood not moving from the spot or realizing the situation
the foremost frenchman  the one with the hooked nose  was already so close that the expression of his face could be seen
and the excited  alien face of that man  his bayonet hanging down  holding his breath  and running so lightly  frightened rostov
he seized his pistol and  instead of firing it  flung it at the frenchman and ran with all his might toward the bushes
he did not now run with the feeling of doubt and conflict with which he had trodden the enns bridge  but with the feeling of a hare fleeing from the hounds
one single sentiment  that of fear for his young and happy life  possessed his whole being
rapidly leaping the furrows  he fled across the field with the impetuosity he used to show at catchplay  now and then turning his good natured  pale  young face to look back
a shudder of terror went through him  "no  better not look " he thought  but having reached the bushes he glanced round once more
the french had fallen behind  and just as he looked round the first man changed his run to a walk and  turning  shouted something loudly to a comrade farther back rostov paused
"no  there's some mistake " thought he
"they can't have wanted to kill me " but at the same time  his left arm felt as heavy as if a seventy pound weight were tied to it
he could run no more
the frenchman also stopped and took aim
rostov closed his eyes and stooped down
one bullet and then another whistled past him
he mustered his last remaining strength  took hold of his left hand with his right  and reached the bushes
behind these were some russian sharpshooters
the infantry regiments that had been caught unawares in the outskirts of the wood ran out of it  the different companies getting mixed  and retreated as a disorderly crowd
one soldier  in his fear  uttered the senseless cry  "cut off " that is so terrible in battle  and that word infected the whole crowd with a feeling of panic
"surrounded  cut off  we're lost " shouted the fugitives
the moment he heard the firing and the cry from behind  the general realized that something dreadful had happened to his regiment  and the thought that he  an exemplary officer of many years' service who had never been to blame  might be held responsible at headquarters for negligence or inefficiency so staggered him that  forgetting the recalcitrant cavalry colonel  his own dignity as a general  and above all quite forgetting the danger and all regard for selfpreservation  he clutched the crupper of his saddle and  spurring his horse  galloped to the regiment under a hail of bullets which fell around  but fortunately missed him
his one desire was to know what was happening and at any cost correct  or remedy  the mistake if he had made one  so that he  an exemplary officer of twenty two years' service  who had never been censured  should not be held to blame
having galloped safely through the french  he reached a field behind the copse across which our men  regardless of orders  were running and descending the valley
that moment of moral hesitation which decides the fate of battles had arrived
would this disorderly crowd of soldiers attend to the voice of their commander  or would they  disregarding him  continue their flight  despite his desperate shouts that used to seem so terrible to the soldiers  despite his furious purple countenance distorted out of all likeness to his former self  and the flourishing of his saber  the soldiers all continued to run  talking  firing into the air  and disobeying orders
the moral hesitation which decided the fate of battles was evidently culminating in a panic
the general had a fit of coughing as a result of shouting and of the powder smoke and stopped in despair
everything seemed lost
but at that moment the french who were attacking  suddenly and without any apparent reason  ran back and disappeared from the outskirts  and russian sharpshooters showed themselves in the copse it was timokhin's company  which alone had maintained its order in the wood and  having lain in ambush in a ditch  now attacked the french unexpectedly
timokhin  armed only with a sword  had rushed at the enemy with such a desperate cry and such mad  drunken determination that  taken by surprise  the french had thrown down their muskets and run
dolokhov  running beside timokhin  killed a frenchman at close quarters and was the first to seize the surrendering french officer by his collar
our fugitives returned  the battalions re formed  and the french who had nearly cut our left flank in half were for the moment repulsed
our reserve units were able to join up  and the fight was at an end
the regimental commander and major ekonomov had stopped beside a bridge  letting the retreating companies pass by them  when a soldier came up and took hold of the commander's stirrup  almost leaning against him
the man was wearing a bluish coat of broadcloth  he had no knapsack or cap  his head was bandaged  and over his shoulder a french munition pouch was slung
he had an officer's sword in his hand
the soldier was pale  his blue eyes looked impudently into the commander's face  and his lips were smiling
though the commander was occupied in giving instructions to major ekonomov  he could not help taking notice of the soldier
"your excellency  here are two trophies " said dolokhov  pointing to the french sword and pouch
"i have taken an officer prisoner
i stopped the company " dolokhov breathed heavily from weariness and spoke in abrupt sentences
"the whole company can bear witness
i beg you will remember this  your excellency " "all right  all right " replied the commander  and turned to major ekonomov
but dolokhov did not go away  he untied the handkerchief around his head  pulled it off  and showed the blood congealed on his hair
"a bayonet wound
i remained at the front
remember  your excellency " tushin's battery had been forgotten and only at the very end of the action did prince bagration  still hearing the cannonade in the center  send his orderly staff officer  and later prince andrew also  to order the battery to retire as quickly as possible
when the supports attached to tushin's battery had been moved away in the middle of the action by someone's order  the battery had continued firing and was only not captured by the french because the enemy could not surmise that anyone could have the effrontery to continue firing from four quite undefended guns
on the contrary  the energetic action of that battery led the french to suppose that here—in the center—the main russian forces were concentrated
twice they had attempted to attack this point  but on each occasion had been driven back by grapeshot from the four isolated guns on the hillock
soon after prince bagration had left him  tushin had succeeded in setting fire to schon grabern
"look at them scurrying  it's burning  just see the smoke  fine  grand  look at the smoke  the smoke " exclaimed the artillerymen  brightening up
all the guns  without waiting for orders  were being fired in the direction of the conflagration
as if urging each other on  the soldiers cried at each shot  "fine  that's good  look at it  
grand " the fire  fanned by the breeze  was rapidly spreading
the french columns that had advanced beyond the village went back  but as though in revenge for this failure  the enemy placed ten guns to the right of the village and began firing them at tushin's battery
in their childlike glee  aroused by the fire and their luck in successfully cannonading the french  our artillerymen only noticed this battery when two balls  and then four more  fell among our guns  one knocking over two horses and another tearing off a munition wagon driver's leg
their spirits once roused were  however  not diminished  but only changed character
the horses were replaced by others from a reserve gun carriage  the wounded were carried away  and the four guns were turned against the ten gun battery
tushin's companion officer had been killed at the beginning of the engagement and within an hour seventeen of the forty men of the guns' crews had been disabled  but the artillerymen were still as merry and lively as ever
twice they noticed the french appearing below them  and then they fired grapeshot at them
little tushin  moving feebly and awkwardly  kept telling his orderly to "refill my pipe for that one " and then  scattering sparks from it  ran forward shading his eyes with his small hand to look at the french
"smack at 'em  lads " he kept saying  seizing the guns by the wheels and working the screws himself amid the smoke  deafened by the incessant reports which always made him jump  tushin not taking his pipe from his mouth ran from gun to gun  now aiming  now counting the charges  now giving orders about replacing dead or wounded horses and harnessing fresh ones  and shouting in his feeble voice  so high pitched and irresolute
his face grew more and more animated
only when a man was killed or wounded did he frown and turn away from the sight  shouting angrily at the men who  as is always the case  hesitated about lifting the injured or dead
the soldiers  for the most part handsome fellows and  as is always the case in an artillery company  a head and shoulders taller and twice as broad as their officer—all looked at their commander like children in an embarrassing situation  and the expression on his face was invariably reflected on theirs
owing to the terrible uproar and the necessity for concentration and activity  tushin did not experience the slightest unpleasant sense of fear  and the thought that he might be killed or badly wounded never occurred to him
on the contrary  he became more and more elated
it seemed to him that it was a very long time ago  almost a day  since he had first seen the enemy and fired the first shot  and that the corner of the field he stood on was well known and familiar ground
though he thought of everything  considered everything  and did everything the best of officers could do in his position  he was in a state akin to feverish delirium or drunkenness
from the deafening sounds of his own guns around him  the whistle and thud of the enemy's cannon balls  from the flushed and perspiring faces of the crew bustling round the guns  from the sight of the blood of men and horses  from the little puffs of smoke on the enemy's side  always followed by a ball flying past and striking the earth  a man  a gun  a horse   from the sight of all these things a fantastic world of his own had taken possession of his brain and at that moment afforded him pleasure
the enemy's guns were in his fancy not guns but pipes from which occasional puffs were blown by an invisible smoker
"there  
he's puffing again " muttered tushin to himself  as a small cloud rose from the hill and was borne in a streak to the left by the wind "now look out for the ball  
we'll throw it back " "what do you want  your honor " asked an artilleryman  standing close by  who heard him muttering
"nothing  
only a shell   " he answered
"come along  our matvevna " he said to himself "matvevna" * was the name his fancy gave to the farthest gun of the battery  which was large and of an old pattern
the french swarming round their guns seemed to him like ants
in that world  the handsome drunkard number one of the second gun's crew was "uncle"  tushin looked at him more often than at anyone else and took delight in his every movement
the sound of musketry at the foot of the hill  now diminishing  now increasing  seemed like someone's breathing
he listened intently to the ebb and flow of these sounds
* daughter of matthew
"ah  breathing again  breathing " he muttered to himself he imagined himself as an enormously tall  powerful man who was throwing cannon balls at the french with both hands "now then  matvevna  dear old lady  don't let me down " he was saying as he moved from the gun  when a strange  unfamiliar voice called above his head  "captain tushin  captain " tushin turned round in dismay
it was the staff officer who had turned him out of the booth at grunth
he was shouting in a gasping voice  "are you mad  you have twice been ordered to retreat  and you   " "why are they down on me " thought tushin  looking in alarm at his superior
"i  
don't   " he muttered  holding up two fingers to his cap
"i   " but the staff officer did not finish what he wanted to say
a cannon ball  flying close to him  caused him to duck and bend over his horse
he paused  and just as he was about to say something more  another ball stopped him
he turned his horse and galloped off
"retire  all to retire " he shouted from a distance
the soldiers laughed
a moment later  an adjutant arrived with the same order
it was prince andrew
the first thing he saw on riding up to the space where tushin's guns were stationed was an unharnessed horse with a broken leg  that lay screaming piteously beside the harnessed horses
blood was gushing from its leg as from a spring
among the limbers lay several dead men
one ball after another passed over as he approached and he felt a nervous shudder run down his spine
but the mere thought of being afraid roused him again
"i cannot be afraid " thought he  and dismounted slowly among the guns
he delivered the order and did not leave the battery
he decided to have the guns removed from their positions and withdrawn in his presence
together with tushin  stepping across the bodies and under a terrible fire from the french  he attended to the removal of the guns
"a staff officer was here a minute ago  but skipped off " said an artilleryman to prince andrew
"not like your honor " prince andrew said nothing to tushin
they were both so busy as to seem not to notice one another
when having limbered up the only two cannon that remained uninjured out of the four  they began moving down the hill  one shattered gun and one unicorn were left behind   prince andrew rode up to tushin
"well  till we meet again   " he said  holding out his hand to tushin
"good bye  my dear fellow " said tushin
"dear soul  good bye  my dear fellow " and for some unknown reason tears suddenly filled his eyes
the wind had fallen and black clouds  merging with the powder smoke  hung low over the field of battle on the horizon
it was growing dark and the glow of two conflagrations was the more conspicuous
the cannonade was dying down  but the rattle of musketry behind and on the right sounded oftener and nearer
as soon as tushin with his guns  continually driving round or coming upon wounded men  was out of range of fire and had descended into the dip  he was met by some of the staff  among them the staff officer and zherkov  who had been twice sent to tushin's battery but had never reached it
interrupting one another  they all gave  and transmitted  orders as to how to proceed  reprimanding and reproaching him
tushin gave no orders  and  silently—fearing to speak because at every word he felt ready to weep without knowing why—rode behind on his artillery nag
though the orders were to abandon the wounded  many of them dragged themselves after troops and begged for seats on the gun carriages the jaunty infantry officer who just before the battle had rushed out of tushin's wattle shed was laid  with a bullet in his stomach  on "matvevna's" carriage
at the foot of the hill  a pale hussar cadet  supporting one hand with the other  came up to tushin and asked for a seat
"captain  for god's sake  i've hurt my arm " he said timidly
"for god's sake  
i can't walk
for god's sake " it was plain that this cadet had already repeatedly asked for a lift and been refused
he asked in a hesitating  piteous voice
"tell them to give me a seat  for god's sake " "give him a seat " said tushin
"lay a cloak for him to sit on  lad " he said  addressing his favorite soldier
"and where is the wounded officer " "he has been set down
he died " replied someone
"help him up
sit down  dear fellow  sit down  spread out the cloak  antonov " the cadet was rostov
with one hand he supported the other  he was pale and his jaw trembled  shivering feverishly
he was placed on "matvevna " the gun from which they had removed the dead officer
the cloak they spread under him was wet with blood which stained his breeches and arm
"what  are you wounded  my lad " said tushin  approaching the gun on which rostov sat
"no  it's a sprain " "then what is this blood on the gun carriage " inquired tushin
"it was the officer  your honor  stained it " answered the artilleryman  wiping away the blood with his coat sleeve  as if apologizing for the state of his gun
it was all that they could do to get the guns up the rise aided by the infantry  and having reached the village of gruntersdorf they halted
it had grown so dark that one could not distinguish the uniforms ten paces off  and the firing had begun to subside suddenly  near by on the right  shouting and firing were again heard
flashes of shot gleamed in the darkness
this was the last french attack and was met by soldiers who had sheltered in the village houses
they all rushed out of the village again  but tushin's guns could not move  and the artillerymen  tushin  and the cadet exchanged silent glances as they awaited their fate
the firing died down and soldiers  talking eagerly  streamed out of a side street
"not hurt  petrov " asked one
"we've given it 'em hot  mate  they won't make another push now " said another
"you couldn't see a thing
how they shot at their own fellows  nothing could be seen
pitch dark  brother  isn't there something to drink " the french had been repulsed for the last time
and again and again in the complete darkness tushin's guns moved forward  surrounded by the humming infantry as by a frame
in the darkness  it seemed as though a gloomy unseen river was flowing always in one direction  humming with whispers and talk and the sound of hoofs and wheels
amid the general rumble  the groans and voices of the wounded were more distinctly heard than any other sound in the darkness of the night
the gloom that enveloped the army was filled with their groans  which seemed to melt into one with the darkness of the night
after a while the moving mass became agitated  someone rode past on a white horse followed by his suite  and said something in passing  "what did he say  where to  now  halt  is it  did he thank us " came eager questions from all sides
the whole moving mass began pressing closer together and a report spread that they were ordered to halt  evidently those in front had halted
all remained where they were in the middle of the muddy road
fires were lighted and the talk became more audible
captain tushin  having given orders to his company  sent a soldier to find a dressing station or a doctor for the cadet  and sat down by a bonfire the soldiers had kindled on the road
rostov  too  dragged himself to the fire from pain  cold  and damp  a feverish shivering shook his whole body
drowsiness was irresistibly mastering him  but he kept awake by an excruciating pain in his arm  for which he could find no satisfactory position
he kept closing his eyes and then again looking at the fire  which seemed to him dazzlingly red  and at the feeble  round shouldered figure of tushin who was sitting cross legged like a turk beside him
tushin's large  kind  intelligent eyes were fixed with sympathy and commiseration on rostov  who saw that tushin with his whole heart wished to help him but could not
from all sides were heard the footsteps and talk of the infantry  who were walking  driving past  and settling down all around
the sound of voices  the tramping feet  the horses' hoofs moving in mud  the crackling of wood fires near and afar  merged into one tremulous rumble
it was no longer  as before  a dark  unseen river flowing through the gloom  but a dark sea swelling and gradually subsiding after a storm
rostov looked at and listened listlessly to what passed before and around him
an infantryman came to the fire  squatted on his heels  held his hands to the blaze  and turned away his face
"you don't mind your honor " he asked tushin
"i've lost my company  your honor
i don't know where  
such bad luck " with the soldier  an infantry officer with a bandaged cheek came up to the bonfire  and addressing tushin asked him to have the guns moved a trifle to let a wagon go past
after he had gone  two soldiers rushed to the campfire
they were quarreling and fighting desperately  each trying to snatch from the other a boot they were both holding on to
"you picked it up   
i dare say  you're very smart " one of them shouted hoarsely
then a thin  pale soldier  his neck bandaged with a bloodstained leg band  came up and in angry tones asked the artillerymen for water
"must one die like a dog " said he
tushin told them to give the man some water
then a cheerful soldier ran up  begging a little fire for the infantry
"a nice little hot torch for the infantry  good luck to you  fellow countrymen
thanks for the fire—we'll return it with interest " said he  carrying away into the darkness a glowing stick
next came four soldiers  carrying something heavy on a cloak  and passed by the fire
one of them stumbled
"who the devil has put the logs on the road " snarled he
"he's dead—why carry him " said another
"shut up " and they disappeared into the darkness with their load
"still aching " tushin asked rostov in a whisper
"yes " "your honor  you're wanted by the general
he is in the hut here " said a gunner  coming up to tushin
"coming  friend " tushin rose and  buttoning his greatcoat and pulling it straight  walked away from the fire
not far from the artillery campfire  in a hut that had been prepared for him  prince bagration sat at dinner  talking with some commanding officers who had gathered at his quarters
the little old man with the half closed eyes was there greedily gnawing a mutton bone  and the general who had served blamelessly for twenty two years  flushed by a glass of vodka and the dinner  and the staff officer with the signet ring  and zherkov  uneasily glancing at them all  and prince andrew  pale  with compressed lips and feverishly glittering eyes
in a corner of the hut stood a standard captured from the french  and the accountant with the naive face was feeling its texture  shaking his head in perplexity—perhaps because the banner really interested him  perhaps because it was hard for him  hungry as he was  to look on at a dinner where there was no place for him
in the next hut there was a french colonel who had been taken prisoner by our dragoons
our officers were flocking in to look at him
prince bagration was thanking the individual commanders and inquiring into details of the action and our losses
the general whose regiment had been inspected at braunau was informing the prince that as soon as the action began he had withdrawn from the wood  mustered the men who were woodcutting  and  allowing the french to pass him  had made a bayonet charge with two battalions and had broken up the french troops
"when i saw  your excellency  that their first battalion was disorganized  i stopped in the road and thought  'i'll let them come on and will meet them with the fire of the whole battalion'—and that's what i did " the general had so wished to do this and was so sorry he had not managed to do it that it seemed to him as if it had really happened
perhaps it might really have been so  could one possibly make out amid all that confusion what did or did not happen  "by the way  your excellency  i should inform you " he continued— remembering dolokhov's conversation with kutuzov and his last interview with the gentleman ranker—"that private dolokhov  who was reduced to the ranks  took a french officer prisoner in my presence and particularly distinguished himself " "i saw the pavlograd hussars attack there  your excellency " chimed in zherkov  looking uneasily around he had not seen the hussars all that day  but had heard about them from an infantry officer
"they broke up two squares  your excellency " several of those present smiled at zherkov's words  expecting one of his usual jokes  but noticing that what he was saying redounded to the glory of our arms and of the day's work  they assumed a serious expression  though many of them knew that what he was saying was a lie devoid of any foundation prince bagration turned to the old colonel  "gentlemen  i thank you all  all arms have behaved heroically  infantry  cavalry  and artillery how was it that two guns were abandoned in the center " he inquired  searching with his eyes for someone
 prince bagration did not ask about the guns on the left flank  he knew that all the guns there had been abandoned at the very beginning of the action   "i think i sent you " he added  turning to the staff officer on duty
"one was damaged " answered the staff officer  "and the other i can't understand
i was there all the time giving orders and had only just left   
it is true that it was hot there " he added  modestly
someone mentioned that captain tushin was bivouacking close to the village and had already been sent for
"oh  but you were there " said prince bagration  addressing prince andrew
"of course  we only just missed one another " said the staff officer  with a smile to bolkonski
"i had not the pleasure of seeing you " said prince andrew  coldly and abruptly
all were silent
tushin appeared at the threshold and made his way timidly from behind the backs of the generals
as he stepped past the generals in the crowded hut  feeling embarrassed as he always was by the sight of his superiors  he did not notice the staff of the banner and stumbled over it
several of those present laughed
"how was it a gun was abandoned " asked bagration  frowning  not so much at the captain as at those who were laughing  among whom zherkov laughed loudest
only now  when he was confronted by the stern authorities  did his guilt and the disgrace of having lost two guns and yet remaining alive present themselves to tushin in all their horror he had been so excited that he had not thought about it until that moment
the officers' laughter confused him still more
he stood before bagration with his lower jaw trembling and was hardly able to mutter  "i don't know  
your excellency  
i had no men  
your excellency " "you might have taken some from the covering troops " tushin did not say that there were no covering troops  though that was perfectly true
he was afraid of getting some other officer into trouble  and silently fixed his eyes on bagration as a schoolboy who has blundered looks at an examiner
the silence lasted some time
prince bagration  apparently not wishing to be severe  found nothing to say  the others did not venture to intervene
prince andrew looked at tushin from under his brows and his fingers twitched nervously
"your excellency " prince andrew broke the silence with his abrupt voice  "you were pleased to send me to captain tushin's battery
i went there and found two thirds of the men and horses knocked out  two guns smashed  and no supports at all " prince bagration and tushin looked with equal intentness at bolkonski  who spoke with suppressed agitation
"and  if your excellency will allow me to express my opinion " he continued  "we owe today's success chiefly to the action of that battery and the heroic endurance of captain tushin and his company " and without awaiting a reply  prince andrew rose and left the table
prince bagration looked at tushin  evidently reluctant to show distrust in bolkonski's emphatic opinion yet not feeling able fully to credit it  bent his head  and told tushin that he could go
prince andrew went out with him
"thank you  you saved me  my dear fellow " said tushin
prince andrew gave him a look  but said nothing and went away
he felt sad and depressed
it was all so strange  so unlike what he had hoped
"who are they  why are they here  what do they want  and when will all this end " thought rostov  looking at the changing shadows before him
the pain in his arm became more and more intense
irresistible drowsiness overpowered him  red rings danced before his eyes  and the impression of those voices and faces and a sense of loneliness merged with the physical pain
it was they  these soldiers—wounded and unwounded—it was they who were crushing  weighing down  and twisting the sinews and scorching the flesh of his sprained arm and shoulder
to rid himself of them he closed his eyes for a moment he dozed  but in that short interval innumerable things appeared to him in a dream  his mother and her large white hand  sonya's thin little shoulders  natasha's eyes and laughter  denisov with his voice and mustache  and telyanin and all that affair with telyanin and bogdanich
that affair was the same thing as this soldier with the harsh voice  and it was that affair and this soldier that were so agonizingly  incessantly pulling and pressing his arm and always dragging it in one direction
he tried to get away from them  but they would not for an instant let his shoulder move a hair's breadth
it would not ache—it would be well—if only they did not pull it  but it was impossible to get rid of them
he opened his eyes and looked up
the black canopy of night hung less than a yard above the glow of the charcoal
flakes of falling snow were fluttering in that light
tushin had not returned  the doctor had not come
he was alone now  except for a soldier who was sitting naked at the other side of the fire  warming his thin yellow body
"nobody wants me " thought rostov
"there is no one to help me or pity me
yet i was once at home  strong  happy  and loved " he sighed and  doing so  groaned involuntarily
"eh  is anything hurting you " asked the soldier  shaking his shirt out over the fire  and not waiting for an answer he gave a grunt and added  "what a lot of men have been crippled today—frightful " rostov did not listen to the soldier
he looked at the snowflakes fluttering above the fire and remembered a russian winter at his warm  bright home  his fluffy fur coat  his quickly gliding sleigh  his healthy body  and all the affection and care of his family
"and why did i come here " he wondered
next day the french army did not renew their attack  and the remnant of bagration's detachment was reunited to kutuzov's army
prince vasili was not a man who deliberately thought out his plans
still less did he think of injuring anyone for his own advantage
he was merely a man of the world who had got on and to whom getting on had become a habit
schemes and devices for which he never rightly accounted to himself  but which formed the whole interest of his life  were constantly shaping themselves in his mind  arising from the circumstances and persons he met of these plans he had not merely one or two in his head but dozens  some only beginning to form themselves  some approaching achievement  and some in course of disintegration he did not  for instance  say to himself  "this man now has influence  i must gain his confidence and friendship and through him obtain a special grant " nor did he say to himself  "pierre is a rich man  i must entice him to marry my daughter and lend me the forty thousand rubles i need " but when he came across a man of position his instinct immediately told him that this man could be useful  and without any premeditation prince vasili took the first opportunity to gain his confidence  flatter him  become intimate with him  and finally make his request he had pierre at hand in moscow and procured for him an appointment as gentleman of the bedchamber  which at that time conferred the status of councilor of state  and insisted on the young man accompanying him to petersburg and staying at his house
with apparent absent mindedness  yet with unhesitating assurance that he was doing the right thing  prince vasili did everything to get pierre to marry his daughter
had he thought out his plans beforehand he could not have been so natural and shown such unaffected familiarity in intercourse with everybody both above and below him in social standing
something always drew him toward those richer and more powerful than himself and he had rare skill in seizing the most opportune moment for making use of people pierre  on unexpectedly becoming count bezukhov and a rich man  felt himself after his recent loneliness and freedom from cares so beset and preoccupied that only in bed was he able to be by himself he had to sign papers  to present himself at government offices  the purpose of which was not clear to him  to question his chief steward  to visit his estate near moscow  and to receive many people who formerly did not even wish to know of his existence but would now have been offended and grieved had he chosen not to see them these different people—businessmen  relations  and acquaintances alike—were all disposed to treat the young heir in the most friendly and flattering manner  they were all evidently firmly convinced of pierre's noble qualities
he was always hearing such words as  "with your remarkable kindness " or  "with your excellent heart " "you are yourself so honorable count " or  "were he as clever as you " and so on  till he began sincerely to believe in his own exceptional kindness and extraordinary intelligence  the more so as in the depth of his heart it had always seemed to him that he really was very kind and intelligent
even people who had formerly been spiteful toward him and evidently unfriendly now became gentle and affectionate
the angry eldest princess  with the long waist and hair plastered down like a doll's  had come into pierre's room after the funeral
with drooping eyes and frequent blushes she told him she was very sorry about their past misunderstandings and did not now feel she had a right to ask him for anything  except only for permission  after the blow she had received  to remain for a few weeks longer in the house she so loved and where she had sacrificed so much
she could not refrain from weeping at these words
touched that this statuesque princess could so change  pierre took her hand and begged her forgiveness  without knowing what for
from that day the eldest princess quite changed toward pierre and began knitting a striped scarf for him
"do this for my sake  mon cher  after all  she had to put up with a great deal from the deceased " said prince vasili to him  handing him a deed to sign for the princess' benefit
prince vasili had come to the conclusion that it was necessary to throw this bone—a bill for thirty thousand rubles—to the poor princess that it might not occur to her to speak of his share in the affair of the inlaid portfolio
pierre signed the deed and after that the princess grew still kinder
the younger sisters also became affectionate to him  especially the youngest  the pretty one with the mole  who often made him feel confused by her smiles and her own confusion when meeting him
it seemed so natural to pierre that everyone should like him  and it would have seemed so unnatural had anyone disliked him  that he could not but believe in the sincerity of those around him
besides  he had no time to ask himself whether these people were sincere or not he was always busy and always felt in a state of mild and cheerful intoxication
he felt as though he were the center of some important and general movement  that something was constantly expected of him  that if he did not do it he would grieve and disappoint many people  but if he did this and that  all would be well  and he did what was demanded of him  but still that happy result always remained in the future
more than anyone else  prince vasili took possession of pierre's affairs and of pierre himself in those early days from the death of count bezukhov he did not let go his hold of the lad
he had the air of a man oppressed by business  weary and suffering  who yet would not  for pity's sake  leave this helpless youth who  after all  was the son of his old friend and the possessor of such enormous wealth  to the caprice of fate and the designs of rogues
during the few days he spent in moscow after the death of count bezukhov  he would call pierre  or go to him himself  and tell him what ought to be done in a tone of weariness and assurance  as if he were adding every time  "you know i am overwhelmed with business and it is purely out of charity that i trouble myself about you  and you also know quite well that what i propose is the only thing possible " "well  my dear fellow  tomorrow we are off at last " said prince vasili one day  closing his eyes and fingering pierre's elbow  speaking as if he were saying something which had long since been agreed upon and could not now be altered "we start tomorrow and i'm giving you a place in my carriage
i am very glad
all our important business here is now settled  and i ought to have been off long ago
here is something i have received from the chancellor
i asked him for you  and you have been entered in the diplomatic corps and made a gentleman of the bedchamber
the diplomatic career now lies open before you " notwithstanding the tone of wearied assurance with which these words were pronounced  pierre  who had so long been considering his career  wished to make some suggestion
but prince vasili interrupted him in the special deep cooing tone  precluding the possibility of interrupting his speech  which he used in extreme cases when special persuasion was needed
"mais  mon cher  i did this for my own sake  to satisfy my conscience  and there is nothing to thank me for
no one has ever complained yet of being too much loved  and besides  you are free  you could throw it up tomorrow
but you will see everything for yourself when you get to petersburg
it is high time for you to get away from these terrible recollections " prince vasili sighed
"yes  yes  my boy
and my valet can go in your carriage
ah  i was nearly forgetting " he added
"you know  mon cher  your father and i had some accounts to settle  so i have received what was due from the ryazan estate and will keep it  you won't require it
we'll go into the accounts later " by "what was due from the ryazan estate" prince vasili meant several thousand rubles quitrent received from pierre's peasants  which the prince had retained for himself in petersburg  as in moscow  pierre found the same atmosphere of gentleness and affection
he could not refuse the post  or rather the rank  for he did nothing   that prince vasili had procured for him  and acquaintances  invitations  and social occupations were so numerous that  even more than in moscow  he felt a sense of bewilderment  bustle  and continual expectation of some good  always in front of him but never attained
of his former bachelor acquaintances many were no longer in petersburg
the guards had gone to the front  dolokhov had been reduced to the ranks  anatole was in the army somewhere in the provinces  prince andrew was abroad  so pierre had not the opportunity to spend his nights as he used to like to spend them  or to open his mind by intimate talks with a friend older than himself and whom he respected his whole time was taken up with dinners and balls and was spent chiefly at prince vasili's house in the company of the stout princess  his wife  and his beautiful daughter helene
like the others  anna pavlovna scherer showed pierre the change of attitude toward him that had taken place in society
formerly in anna pavlovna's presence  pierre had always felt that what he was saying was out of place  tactless and unsuitable  that remarks which seemed to him clever while they formed in his mind became foolish as soon as he uttered them  while on the contrary hippolyte's stupidest remarks came out clever and apt
now everything pierre said was charmant
even if anna pavlovna did not say so  he could see that she wished to and only refrained out of regard for his modesty
in the beginning of the winter of 1805 6 pierre received one of anna pavlovna's usual pink notes with an invitation to which was added  "you will find the beautiful helene here  whom it is always delightful to see " when he read that sentence  pierre felt for the first time that some link which other people recognized had grown up between himself and helene  and that thought both alarmed him  as if some obligation were being imposed on him which he could not fulfill  and pleased him as an entertaining supposition anna pavlovna's "at home" was like the former one  only the novelty she offered her guests this time was not mortemart  but a diplomatist fresh from berlin with the very latest details of the emperor alexander's visit to potsdam  and of how the two august friends had pledged themselves in an indissoluble alliance to uphold the cause of justice against the enemy of the human race anna pavlovna received pierre with a shade of melancholy  evidently relating to the young man's recent loss by the death of count bezukhov  everyone constantly considered it a duty to assure pierre that he was greatly afflicted by the death of the father he had hardly known   and her melancholy was just like the august melancholy she showed at the mention of her most august majesty the empress marya fedorovna
pierre felt flattered by this
anna pavlovna arranged the different groups in her drawing room with her habitual skill
the large group  in which were prince vasili and the generals  had the benefit of the diplomat
another group was at the tea table
pierre wished to join the former  but anna pavlovna—who was in the excited condition of a commander on a battlefield to whom thousands of new and brilliant ideas occur which there is hardly time to put in action—seeing pierre  touched his sleeve with her finger  saying  "wait a bit  i have something in view for you this evening "  she glanced at helene and smiled at her   "my dear helene  be charitable to my poor aunt who adores you
go and keep her company for ten minutes
and that it will not be too dull  here is the dear count who will not refuse to accompany you " the beauty went to the aunt  but anna pavlovna detained pierre  looking as if she had to give some final necessary instructions
"isn't she exquisite " she said to pierre  pointing to the stately beauty as she glided away
"and how she carries herself  for so young a girl  such tact  such masterly perfection of manner  it comes from her heart
happy the man who wins her  with her the least worldly of men would occupy a most brilliant position in society
don't you think so  i only wanted to know your opinion " and anna pavlovna let pierre go
pierre  in reply  sincerely agreed with her as to helene's perfection of manner
if he ever thought of helene  it was just of her beauty and her remarkable skill in appearing silently dignified in society
the old aunt received the two young people in her corner  but seemed desirous of hiding her adoration for helene and inclined rather to show her fear of anna pavlovna
she looked at her niece  as if inquiring what she was to do with these people
on leaving them  anna pavlovna again touched pierre's sleeve  saying  "i hope you won't say that it is dull in my house again " and she glanced at helene
helene smiled  with a look implying that she did not admit the possibility of anyone seeing her without being enchanted
the aunt coughed  swallowed  and said in french that she was very pleased to see helene  then she turned to pierre with the same words of welcome and the same look
in the middle of a dull and halting conversation  helene turned to pierre with the beautiful bright smile that she gave to everyone
pierre was so used to that smile  and it had so little meaning for him  that he paid no attention to it
the aunt was just speaking of a collection of snuffboxes that had belonged to pierre's father  count bezukhov  and showed them her own box
princess helene asked to see the portrait of the aunt's husband on the box lid
"that is probably the work of vinesse " said pierre  mentioning a celebrated miniaturist  and he leaned over the table to take the snuffbox while trying to hear what was being said at the other table
he half rose  meaning to go round  but the aunt handed him the snuffbox  passing it across helene's back
helene stooped forward to make room  and looked round with a smile
she was  as always at evening parties  wearing a dress such as was then fashionable  cut very low at front and back
her bust  which had always seemed like marble to pierre  was so close to him that his shortsighted eyes could not but perceive the living charm of her neck and shoulders  so near to his lips that he need only have bent his head a little to have touched them
he was conscious of the warmth of her body  the scent of perfume  and the creaking of her corset as she moved
he did not see her marble beauty forming a complete whole with her dress  but all the charm of her body only covered by her garments
and having once seen this he could not help being aware of it  just as we cannot renew an illusion we have once seen through
"so you have never noticed before how beautiful i am " helene seemed to say
"you had not noticed that i am a woman  yes  i am a woman who may belong to anyone—to you too " said her glance
and at that moment pierre felt that helene not only could  but must  be his wife  and that it could not be otherwise
he knew this at that moment as surely as if he had been standing at the altar with her
how and when this would be he did not know  he did not even know if it would be a good thing  he even felt  he knew not why  that it would be a bad thing   but he knew it would happen
pierre dropped his eyes  lifted them again  and wished once more to see her as a distant beauty far removed from him  as he had seen her every day until then  but he could no longer do it
he could not  any more than a man who has been looking at a tuft of steppe grass through the mist and taking it for a tree can again take it for a tree after he has once recognized it to be a tuft of grass
she was terribly close to him
she already had power over him  and between them there was no longer any barrier except the barrier of his own will
"well  i will leave you in your little corner " came anna pavlovna's voice  "i see you are all right there " and pierre  anxiously trying to remember whether he had done anything reprehensible  looked round with a blush
it seemed to him that everyone knew what had happened to him as he knew it himself a little later when he went up to the large circle  anna pavlovna said to him  "i hear you are refitting your petersburg house " this was true
the architect had told him that it was necessary  and pierre  without knowing why  was having his enormous petersburg house done up
"that's a good thing  but don't move from prince vasili's
it is good to have a friend like the prince " she said  smiling at prince vasili
"i know something about that
don't i  and you are still so young
you need advice
don't be angry with me for exercising an old woman's privilege " she paused  as women always do  expecting something after they have mentioned their age
"if you marry it will be a different thing " she continued  uniting them both in one glance
pierre did not look at helene nor she at him
but she was just as terribly close to him
he muttered something and colored
when he got home he could not sleep for a long time for thinking of what had happened
what had happened  nothing
he had merely understood that the woman he had known as a child  of whom when her beauty was mentioned he had said absent mindedly  "yes  she's good looking " he had understood that this woman might belong to him
"but she's stupid
i have myself said she is stupid " he thought
"there is something nasty  something wrong  in the feeling she excites in me
i have been told that her brother anatole was in love with her and she with him  that there was quite a scandal and that that's why he was sent away
hippolyte is her brother  
prince vasili is her father  
it's bad    " he reflected  but while he was thinking this  the reflection was still incomplete   he caught himself smiling and was conscious that another line of thought had sprung up  and while thinking of her worthlessness he was also dreaming of how she would be his wife  how she would love him become quite different  and how all he had thought and heard of her might be false and he again saw her not as the daughter of prince vasili  but visualized her whole body only veiled by its gray dress
"but no  why did this thought never occur to me before " and again he told himself that it was impossible  that there would be something unnatural  and as it seemed to him dishonorable  in this marriage he recalled her former words and looks and the words and looks of those who had seen them together
he recalled anna pavlovna's words and looks when she spoke to him about his house  recalled thousands of such hints from prince vasili and others  and was seized by terror lest he had already  in some way  bound himself to do something that was evidently wrong and that he ought not to do but at the very time he was expressing this conviction to himself  in another part of his mind her image rose in all its womanly beauty in november  1805  prince vasili had to go on a tour of inspection in four different provinces
he had arranged this for himself so as to visit his neglected estates at the same time and pick up his son anatole where his regiment was stationed  and take him to visit prince nicholas bolkonski in order to arrange a match for him with the daughter of that rich old man but before leaving home and undertaking these new affairs  prince vasili had to settle matters with pierre  who  it is true  had latterly spent whole days at home  that is  in prince vasili's house where he was staying  and had been absurd  excited  and foolish in helene's presence  as a lover should be   but had not yet proposed to her
"this is all very fine  but things must be settled " said prince vasili to himself  with a sorrowful sigh  one morning  feeling that pierre who was under such obligations to him  "but never mind that"  was not behaving very well in this matter "youth  frivolity  
well  god be with him " thought he  relishing his own goodness of heart  "but it must be brought to a head
the day after tomorrow will be lelya's name day
i will invite two or three people  and if he does not understand what he ought to do then it will be my affair—yes  my affair
i am her father " six weeks after anna pavlovna's "at home" and after the sleepless night when he had decided that to marry helene would be a calamity and that he ought to avoid her and go away  pierre  despite that decision  had not left prince vasili's and felt with terror that in people's eyes he was every day more and more connected with her  that it was impossible for him to return to his former conception of her  that he could not break away from her  and that though it would be a terrible thing he would have to unite his fate with hers
he might perhaps have been able to free himself but that prince vasili  who had rarely before given receptions  now hardly let a day go by without having an evening party at which pierre had to be present unless he wished to spoil the general pleasure and disappoint everyone's expectation prince vasili  in the rare moments when he was at home  would take pierre's hand in passing and draw it downwards  or absent mindedly hold out his wrinkled  cleanshaven cheek for pierre to kiss and would say  "till tomorrow " or  "be in to dinner or i shall not see you " or  "i am staying in for your sake " and so on
and though prince vasili  when he stayed in  as he said  for pierre's sake  hardly exchanged a couple of words with him  pierre felt unable to disappoint him
every day he said to himself one and the same thing  "it is time i understood her and made up my mind what she really is was i mistaken before  or am i mistaken now  no  she is not stupid  she is an excellent girl " he sometimes said to himself "she never makes a mistake  never says anything stupid she says little  but what she does say is always clear and simple  so she is not stupid
she never was abashed and is not abashed now  so she cannot be a bad woman " he had often begun to make reflections or think aloud in her company  and she had always answered him either by a brief but appropriate remark—showing that it did not interest her—or by a silent look and smile which more palpably than anything else showed pierre her superiority
she was right in regarding all arguments as nonsense in comparison with that smile
she always addressed him with a radiantly confiding smile meant for him alone  in which there was something more significant than in the general smile that usually brightened her face
pierre knew that everyone was waiting for him to say a word and cross a certain line  and he knew that sooner or later he would step across it  but an incomprehensible terror seized him at the thought of that dreadful step
a thousand times during that month and a half while he felt himself drawn nearer and nearer to that dreadful abyss  pierre said to himself  "what am i doing  i need resolution can it be that i have none " he wished to take a decision  but felt with dismay that in this matter he lacked that strength of will which he had known in himself and really possessed pierre was one of those who are only strong when they feel themselves quite innocent  and since that day when he was overpowered by a feeling of desire while stooping over the snuffbox at anna pavlovna's  an unacknowledged sense of the guilt of that desire paralyzed his will on helene's name day  a small party of just their own people—as his wife said —met for supper at prince vasili's
all these friends and relations had been given to understand that the fate of the young girl would be decided that evening
the visitors were seated at supper
princess kuragina  a portly imposing woman who had once been handsome  was sitting at the head of the table
on either side of her sat the more important guests—an old general and his wife  and anna pavlovna scherer
at the other end sat the younger and less important guests  and there too sat the members of the family  and pierre and helene  side by side
prince vasili was not having any supper  he went round the table in a merry mood  sitting down now by one  now by another  of the guests
to each of them he made some careless and agreeable remark except to pierre and helene  whose presence he seemed not to notice
he enlivened the whole party
the wax candles burned brightly  the silver and crystal gleamed  so did the ladies' toilets and the gold and silver of the men's epaulets  servants in scarlet liveries moved round the table  the clatter of plates  knives  and glasses mingled with the animated hum of several conversations
at one end of the table  the old chamberlain was heard assuring an old baroness that he loved her passionately  at which she laughed  at the other could be heard the story of the misfortunes of some mary viktorovna or other
at the center of the table  prince vasili attracted everybody's attention
with a facetious smile on his face  he was telling the ladies about last wednesday's meeting of the imperial council  at which sergey kuzmich vyazmitinov  the new military governor general of petersburg  had received and read the then famous rescript of the emperor alexander from the army to sergey kuzmich  in which the emperor said that he was receiving from all sides declarations of the people's loyalty  that the declaration from petersburg gave him particular pleasure  and that he was proud to be at the head of such a nation and would endeavor to be worthy of it
this rescript began with the words  "sergey kuzmich  from all sides reports reach me " etc "well  and so he never got farther than  'sergey kuzmich' " asked one of the ladies
"exactly  not a hair's breadth farther " answered prince vasili  laughing  "'sergey kuzmich  
from all sides  
from all sides  
sergey kuzmich   ' poor vyazmitinov could not get any farther  he began the rescript again and again  but as soon as he uttered 'sergey' he sobbed  'kuz mi ch ' tears  and 'from all sides' was smothered in sobs and he could get no farther
and again his handkerchief  and again  'sergey kuzmich  from all sides '  
and tears  till at last somebody else was asked to read it " "kuzmich  
from all sides  
and then tears " someone repeated laughing
"don't be unkind " cried anna pavlovna from her end of the table holding up a threatening finger
"he is such a worthy and excellent man  our dear vyazmitinov    " everybody laughed a great deal
at the head of the table  where the honored guests sat  everyone seemed to be in high spirits and under the influence of a variety of exciting sensations
only pierre and helene sat silently side by side almost at the bottom of the table  a suppressed smile brightening both their faces  a smile that had nothing to do with sergey kuzmich—a smile of bashfulness at their own feelings
but much as all the rest laughed  talked  and joked  much as they enjoyed their rhine wine  saute  and ices  and however they avoided looking at the young couple  and heedless and unobservant as they seemed of them  one could feel by the occasional glances they gave that the story about sergey kuzmich  the laughter  and the food were all a pretense  and that the whole attention of that company was directed to—pierre and helene
prince vasili mimicked the sobbing of sergey kuzmich and at the same time his eyes glanced toward his daughter  and while he laughed the expression on his face clearly said  "yes  
it's getting on  it will all be settled today " anna pavlovna threatened him on behalf of "our dear vyazmitinov " and in her eyes  which  for an instant  glanced at pierre  prince vasili read a congratulation on his future son in law and on his daughter's happiness
the old princess sighed sadly as she offered some wine to the old lady next to her and glanced angrily at her daughter  and her sigh seemed to say  "yes  there's nothing left for you and me but to sip sweet wine  my dear  now that the time has come for these young ones to be thus boldly  provocatively happy " "and what nonsense all this is that i am saying " thought a diplomatist  glancing at the happy faces of the lovers
"that's happiness " into the insignificant  trifling  and artificial interests uniting that society had entered the simple feeling of the attraction of a healthy and handsome young man and woman for one another
and this human feeling dominated everything else and soared above all their affected chatter
jests fell flat  news was not interesting  and the animation was evidently forced
not only the guests but even the footmen waiting at table seemed to feel this  and they forgot their duties as they looked at the beautiful helene with her radiant face and at the red  broad  and happy though uneasy face of pierre
it seemed as if the very light of the candles was focused on those two happy faces alone
pierre felt that he was the center of it all  and this both pleased and embarrassed him
he was like a man entirely absorbed in some occupation
he did not see  hear  or understand anything clearly
only now and then detached ideas and impressions from the world of reality shot unexpectedly through his mind
"so it is all finished " he thought
"and how has it all happened  how quickly  now i know that not because of her alone  nor of myself alone  but because of everyone  it must inevitably come about
they are all expecting it  they are so sure that it will happen that i cannot  i cannot  disappoint them
but how will it be  i do not know  but it will certainly happen " thought pierre  glancing at those dazzling shoulders close to his eyes
or he would suddenly feel ashamed of he knew not what
he felt it awkward to attract everyone's attention and to be considered a lucky man and  with his plain face  to be looked on as a sort of paris possessed of a helen
"but no doubt it always is and must be so " he consoled himself "and besides  what have i done to bring it about  how did it begin  i traveled from moscow with prince vasili
then there was nothing
so why should i not stay at his house  then i played cards with her and picked up her reticule and drove out with her
how did it begin  when did it all come about " and here he was sitting by her side as her betrothed  seeing  hearing  feeling her nearness  her breathing  her movements  her beauty
then it would suddenly seem to him that it was not she but he was so unusually beautiful  and that that was why they all looked so at him  and flattered by this general admiration he would expand his chest  raise his head  and rejoice at his good fortune
suddenly he heard a familiar voice repeating something to him a second time
but pierre was so absorbed that he did not understand what was said
"i am asking you when you last heard from bolkonski " repeated prince vasili a third time
"how absent minded you are  my dear fellow " prince vasili smiled  and pierre noticed that everyone was smiling at him and helene
"well  what of it  if you all know it " thought pierre
"what of it  it's the truth " and he himself smiled his gentle childlike smile  and helene smiled too "when did you get the letter  was it from olmutz " repeated prince vasili  who pretended to want to know this in order to settle a dispute
"how can one talk or think of such trifles " thought pierre
"yes  from olmutz " he answered  with a sigh
after supper pierre with his partner followed the others into the drawing room
the guests began to disperse  some without taking leave of helene
some  as if unwilling to distract her from an important occupation  came up to her for a moment and made haste to go away  refusing to let her see them off
the diplomatist preserved a mournful silence as he left the drawing room
he pictured the vanity of his diplomatic career in comparison with pierre's happiness
the old general grumbled at his wife when she asked how his leg was
"oh  the old fool " he thought
"that princess helene will be beautiful still when she's fifty " "i think i may congratulate you " whispered anna pavlovna to the old princess  kissing her soundly
"if i hadn't this headache i'd have stayed longer " the old princess did not reply  she was tormented by jealousy of her daughter's happiness
while the guests were taking their leave pierre remained for a long time alone with helene in the little drawing room where they were sitting
he had often before  during the last six weeks  remained alone with her  but had never spoken to her of love
now he felt that it was inevitable  but he could not make up his mind to take the final step
he felt ashamed  he felt that he was occupying someone else's place here beside helene
"this happiness is not for you " some inner voice whispered to him
"this happiness is for those who have not in them what there is in you " but  as he had to say something  he began by asking her whether she was satisfied with the party
she replied in her usual simple manner that this name day of hers had been one of the pleasantest she had ever had
some of the nearest relatives had not yet left
they were sitting in the large drawing room
prince vasili came up to pierre with languid footsteps
pierre rose and said it was getting late
prince vasili gave him a look of stern inquiry  as though what pierre had just said was so strange that one could not take it in
but then the expression of severity changed  and he drew pierre's hand downwards  made him sit down  and smiled affectionately
"well  lelya " he asked  turning instantly to his daughter and addressing her with the careless tone of habitual tenderness natural to parents who have petted their children from babyhood  but which prince vasili had only acquired by imitating other parents
and he again turned to pierre
"sergey kuzmich—from all sides " he said  unbuttoning the top button of his waistcoat
pierre smiled  but his smile showed that he knew it was not the story about sergey kuzmich that interested prince vasili just then  and prince vasili saw that pierre knew this
he suddenly muttered something and went away
it seemed to pierre that even the prince was disconcerted
the sight of the discomposure of that old man of the world touched pierre  he looked at helene and she too seemed disconcerted  and her look seemed to say  "well  it is your own fault " "the step must be taken but i cannot  i cannot " thought pierre  and he again began speaking about indifferent matters  about sergey kuzmich  asking what the point of the story was as he had not heard it properly
helene answered with a smile that she too had missed it
when prince vasili returned to the drawing room  the princess  his wife  was talking in low tones to the elderly lady about pierre
"of course  it is a very brilliant match  but happiness  my dear   " "marriages are made in heaven " replied the elderly lady
prince vasili passed by  seeming not to hear the ladies  and sat down on a sofa in a far corner of the room
he closed his eyes and seemed to be dozing
his head sank forward and then he roused himself "aline " he said to his wife  "go and see what they are about " the princess went up to the door  passed by it with a dignified and indifferent air  and glanced into the little drawing room
pierre and helene still sat talking just as before
"still the same " she said to her husband
prince vasili frowned  twisting his mouth  his cheeks quivered and his face assumed the coarse  unpleasant expression peculiar to him
shaking himself  he rose  threw back his head  and with resolute steps went past the ladies into the little drawing room with quick steps he went joyfully up to pierre
his face was so unusually triumphant that pierre rose in alarm on seeing it
"thank god " said prince vasili
"my wife has told me everything "  he put one arm around pierre and the other around his daughter  —"my dear boy  
lelya  
i am very pleased "  his voice trembled   "i loved your father  
and she will make you a good wife  
god bless you    " he embraced his daughter  and then again pierre  and kissed him with his malodorous mouth
tears actually moistened his cheeks
"princess  come here " he shouted
the old princess came in and also wept
the elderly lady was using her handkerchief too
pierre was kissed  and he kissed the beautiful helene's hand several times
after a while they were left alone again
"all this had to be and could not be otherwise " thought pierre  "so it is useless to ask whether it is good or bad
it is good because it's definite and one is rid of the old tormenting doubt " pierre held the hand of his betrothed in silence  looking at her beautiful bosom as it rose and fell
"helene " he said aloud and paused
"something special is always said in such cases " he thought  but could not remember what it was that people say
he looked at her face
she drew nearer to him
her face flushed
"oh  take those off  
those   " she said  pointing to his spectacles
pierre took them off  and his eyes  besides the strange look eyes have from which spectacles have just been removed  had also a frightened and inquiring look
he was about to stoop over her hand and kiss it  but with a rapid  almost brutal movement of her head  she intercepted his lips and met them with her own
her face struck pierre  by its altered  unpleasantly excited expression
"it is too late now  it's done  besides i love her " thought pierre
"je vous aime " * he said  remembering what has to be said at such moments  but his words sounded so weak that he felt ashamed of himself * "i love you " six weeks later he was married  and settled in count bezukhov's large  newly furnished petersburg house  the happy possessor  as people said  of a wife who was a celebrated beauty and of millions of money
old prince nicholas bolkonski received a letter from prince vasili in november  1805  announcing that he and his son would be paying him a visit
"i am starting on a journey of inspection  and of course i shall think nothing of an extra seventy miles to come and see you at the same time  my honored benefactor " wrote prince vasili
"my son anatole is accompanying me on his way to the army  so i hope you will allow him personally to express the deep respect that  emulating his father  he feels for you " "it seems that there will be no need to bring mary out  suitors are coming to us of their own accord " incautiously remarked the little princess on hearing the news prince nicholas frowned  but said nothing
a fortnight after the letter prince vasili's servants came one evening in advance of him  and he and his son arrived next day
old bolkonski had always had a poor opinion of prince vasili's character  but more so recently  since in the new reigns of paul and alexander prince vasili had risen to high position and honors
and now  from the hints contained in his letter and given by the little princess  he saw which way the wind was blowing  and his low opinion changed into a feeling of contemptuous ill will
he snorted whenever he mentioned him
on the day of prince vasili's arrival  prince bolkonski was particularly discontented and out of temper
whether he was in a bad temper because prince vasili was coming  or whether his being in a bad temper made him specially annoyed at prince vasili's visit  he was in a bad temper  and in the morning tikhon had already advised the architect not to go to the prince with his report
"do you hear how he's walking " said tikhon  drawing the architect's attention to the sound of the prince's footsteps
"stepping flat on his heels—we know what that means    " however  at nine o'clock the prince  in his velvet coat with a sable collar and cap  went out for his usual walk
it had snowed the day before and the path to the hothouse  along which the prince was in the habit of walking  had been swept  the marks of the broom were still visible in the snow and a shovel had been left sticking in one of the soft snowbanks that bordered both sides of the path
the prince went through the conservatories  the serfs' quarters  and the outbuildings  frowning and silent
"can a sleigh pass " he asked his overseer  a venerable man  resembling his master in manners and looks  who was accompanying him back to the house
"the snow is deep
i am having the avenue swept  your honor " the prince bowed his head and went up to the porch
"god be thanked " thought the overseer  "the storm has blown over " "it would have been hard to drive up  your honor " he added
"i heard  your honor  that a minister is coming to visit your honor " the prince turned round to the overseer and fixed his eyes on him  frowning
"what  a minister  what minister  who gave orders " he said in his shrill  harsh voice
"the road is not swept for the princess my daughter  but for a minister  for me  there are no ministers " "your honor  i thought   " "you thought " shouted the prince  his words coming more and more rapidly and indistinctly
"you thought   
rascals  blackguards   
i'll teach you to think " and lifting his stick he swung it and would have hit alpatych  the overseer  had not the latter instinctively avoided the blow
"thought  
blackguards   " shouted the prince rapidly
but although alpatych  frightened at his own temerity in avoiding the stroke  came up to the prince  bowing his bald head resignedly before him  or perhaps for that very reason  the prince  though he continued to shout  "blackguards   
throw the snow back on the road " did not lift his stick again but hurried into the house
before dinner  princess mary and mademoiselle bourienne  who knew that the prince was in a bad humor  stood awaiting him  mademoiselle bourienne with a radiant face that said  "i know nothing  i am the same as usual " and princess mary pale  frightened  and with downcast eyes
what she found hardest to bear was to know that on such occasions she ought to behave like mademoiselle bourienne  but could not
she thought  "if i seem not to notice he will think that i do not sympathize with him  if i seem sad and out of spirits myself  he will say  as he has done before  that i'm in the dumps " the prince looked at his daughter's frightened face and snorted
"fool  
or dummy " he muttered
"and the other one is not here
they've been telling tales " he thought— referring to the little princess who was not in the dining room
"where is the princess " he asked
"hiding " "she is not very well " answered mademoiselle bourienne with a bright smile  "so she won't come down
it is natural in her state " "hm  hm " muttered the prince  sitting down
his plate seemed to him not quite clean  and pointing to a spot he flung it away
tikhon caught it and handed it to a footman
the little princess was not unwell  but had such an overpowering fear of the prince that  hearing he was in a bad humor  she had decided not to appear
"i am afraid for the baby " she said to mademoiselle bourienne  "heaven knows what a fright might do " in general at bald hills the little princess lived in constant fear  and with a sense of antipathy to the old prince which she did not realize because the fear was so much the stronger feeling
the prince reciprocated this antipathy  but it was overpowered by his contempt for her
when the little princess had grown accustomed to life at bald hills  she took a special fancy to mademoiselle bourienne  spent whole days with her  asked her to sleep in her room  and often talked with her about the old prince and criticized him
"so we are to have visitors  mon prince " remarked mademoiselle bourienne  unfolding her white napkin with her rosy fingers
"his excellency prince vasili kuragin and his son  i understand " she said inquiringly
"hm —his excellency is a puppy   
i got him his appointment in the service " said the prince disdainfully
"why his son is coming i don't understand
perhaps princess elizabeth and princess mary know
i don't want him "  he looked at his blushing daughter   "are you unwell today  eh  afraid of the 'minister' as that idiot alpatych called him this morning " "no  mon pere " though mademoiselle bourienne had been so unsuccessful in her choice of a subject  she did not stop talking  but chattered about the conservatories and the beauty of a flower that had just opened  and after the soup the prince became more genial
after dinner  he went to see his daughter in law
the little princess was sitting at a small table  chattering with masha  her maid
she grew pale on seeing her father in law
she was much altered
she was now plain rather than pretty
her cheeks had sunk  her lip was drawn up  and her eyes drawn down
"yes  i feel a kind of oppression " she said in reply to the prince's question as to how she felt
"do you want anything " "no  merci  mon pere " "well  all right  all right " he left the room and went to the waiting room where alpatych stood with bowed head
"has the snow been shoveled back " "yes  your excellency
forgive me for heaven's sake  
it was only my stupidity " "all right  all right " interrupted the prince  and laughing his unnatural way  he stretched out his hand for alpatych to kiss  and then proceeded to his study prince vasili arrived that evening
he was met in the avenue by coachmen and footmen  who  with loud shouts  dragged his sleighs up to one of the lodges over the road purposely laden with snow
prince vasili and anatole had separate rooms assigned to them anatole  having taken off his overcoat  sat with arms akimbo before a table on a corner of which he smilingly and absent mindedly fixed his large and handsome eyes he regarded his whole life as a continual round of amusement which someone for some reason had to provide for him
and he looked on this visit to a churlish old man and a rich and ugly heiress in the same way
all this might  he thought  turn out very well and amusingly
"and why not marry her if she really has so much money  that never does any harm " thought anatole
he shaved and scented himself with the care and elegance which had become habitual to him and  his handsome head held high  entered his father's room with the good humored and victorious air natural to him prince vasili's two valets were busy dressing him  and he looked round with much animation and cheerfully nodded to his son as the latter entered  as if to say  "yes  that's how i want you to look " "i say  father  joking apart  is she very hideous " anatole asked  as if continuing a conversation the subject of which had often been mentioned during the journey
"enough  what nonsense  above all  try to be respectful and cautious with the old prince " "if he starts a row i'll go away " said prince anatole
"i can't bear those old men  eh " "remember  for you everything depends on this " in the meantime  not only was it known in the maidservants' rooms that the minister and his son had arrived  but the appearance of both had been minutely described princess mary was sitting alone in her room  vainly trying to master her agitation
"why did they write  why did lise tell me about it  it can never happen " she said  looking at herself in the glass
"how shall i enter the drawing room  even if i like him i can't now be myself with him " the mere thought of her father's look filled her with terror
the little princess and mademoiselle bourienne had already received from masha  the lady's maid  the necessary report of how handsome the minister's son was  with his rosy cheeks and dark eyebrows  and with what difficulty the father had dragged his legs upstairs while the son had followed him like an eagle  three steps at a time
having received this information  the little princess and mademoiselle bourienne  whose chattering voices had reached her from the corridor  went into princess mary's room
"you know they've come  marie " said the little princess  waddling in  and sinking heavily into an armchair
she was no longer in the loose gown she generally wore in the morning  but had on one of her best dresses
her hair was carefully done and her face was animated  which  however  did not conceal its sunken and faded outlines
dressed as she used to be in petersburg society  it was still more noticeable how much plainer she had become
some unobtrusive touch had been added to mademoiselle bourienne's toilet which rendered her fresh and pretty face yet more attractive
"what  are you going to remain as you are  dear princess " she began
"they'll be announcing that the gentlemen are in the drawing room and we shall have to go down  and you have not smartened yourself up at all " the little princess got up  rang for the maid  and hurriedly and merrily began to devise and carry out a plan of how princess mary should be dressed
princess mary's self esteem was wounded by the fact that the arrival of a suitor agitated her  and still more so by both her companions' not having the least conception that it could be otherwise
to tell them that she felt ashamed for herself and for them would be to betray her agitation  while to decline their offers to dress her would prolong their banter and insistence
she flushed  her beautiful eyes grew dim  red blotches came on her face  and it took on the unattractive martyrlike expression it so often wore  as she submitted herself to mademoiselle bourienne and lise
both these women quite sincerely tried to make her look pretty
she was so plain that neither of them could think of her as a rival  so they began dressing her with perfect sincerity  and with the naive and firm conviction women have that dress can make a face pretty
"no really  my dear  this dress is not pretty " said lise  looking sideways at princess mary from a little distance
"you have a maroon dress  have it fetched really  you know the fate of your whole life may be at stake
but this one is too light  it's not becoming " it was not the dress  but the face and whole figure of princess mary that was not pretty  but neither mademoiselle bourienne nor the little princess felt this  they still thought that if a blue ribbon were placed in the hair  the hair combed up  and the blue scarf arranged lower on the best maroon dress  and so on  all would be well
they forgot that the frightened face and the figure could not be altered  and that however they might change the setting and adornment of that face  it would still remain piteous and plain
after two or three changes to which princess mary meekly submitted  just as her hair had been arranged on the top of her head  a style that quite altered and spoiled her looks  and she had put on a maroon dress with a pale blue scarf  the little princess walked twice round her  now adjusting a fold of the dress with her little hand  now arranging the scarf and looking at her with her head bent first on one side and then on the other
"no  it will not do " she said decidedly  clasping her hands
"no  mary  really this dress does not suit you
i prefer you in your little gray everyday dress
now please  do it for my sake
katie " she said to the maid  "bring the princess her gray dress  and you'll see  mademoiselle bourienne  how i shall arrange it " she added  smiling with a foretaste of artistic pleasure
but when katie brought the required dress  princess mary remained sitting motionless before the glass  looking at her face  and saw in the mirror her eyes full of tears and her mouth quivering  ready to burst into sobs
"come  dear princess " said mademoiselle bourienne  "just one more little effort " the little princess  taking the dress from the maid  came up to princess mary
"well  now we'll arrange something quite simple and becoming " she said
the three voices  hers  mademoiselle bourienne's  and katie's  who was laughing at something  mingled in a merry sound  like the chirping of birds
"no  leave me alone " said princess mary
her voice sounded so serious and so sad that the chirping of the birds was silenced at once
they looked at the beautiful  large  thoughtful eyes full of tears and of thoughts  gazing shiningly and imploringly at them  and understood that it was useless and even cruel to insist
"at least  change your coiffure " said the little princess
"didn't i tell you " she went on  turning reproachfully to mademoiselle bourienne  "mary's is a face which such a coiffure does not suit in the least
not in the least  please change it " "leave me alone  please leave me alone  it is all quite the same to me " answered a voice struggling with tears
mademoiselle bourienne and the little princess had to own to themselves that princess mary in this guise looked very plain  worse than usual  but it was too late she was looking at them with an expression they both knew  an expression thoughtful and sad
this expression in princess mary did not frighten them  she never inspired fear in anyone   but they knew that when it appeared on her face  she became mute and was not to be shaken in her determination
"you will change it  won't you " said lise
and as princess mary gave no answer  she left the room
princess mary was left alone
she did not comply with lise's request  she not only left her hair as it was  but did not even look in her glass
letting her arms fall helplessly  she sat with downcast eyes and pondered a husband  a man  a strong dominant and strangely attractive being rose in her imagination  and carried her into a totally different happy world of his own
she fancied a child  her own—such as she had seen the day before in the arms of her nurse's daughter—at her own breast  the husband standing by and gazing tenderly at her and the child "but no  it is impossible  i am too ugly " she thought
"please come to tea
the prince will be out in a moment " came the maid's voice at the door
she roused herself  and felt appalled at what she had been thinking  and before going down she went into the room where the icons hung and  her eyes fixed on the dark face of a large icon of the saviour lit by a lamp  she stood before it with folded hands for a few moments
a painful doubt filled her soul
could the joy of love  of earthly love for a man  be for her  in her thoughts of marriage princess mary dreamed of happiness and of children  but her strongest  most deeply hidden longing was for earthly love
the more she tried to hide this feeling from others and even from herself  the stronger it grew
"o god " she said  "how am i to stifle in my heart these temptations of the devil  how am i to renounce forever these vile fancies  so as peacefully to fulfill thy will " and scarcely had she put that question than god gave her the answer in her own heart
"desire nothing for thyself  seek nothing  be not anxious or envious
man's future and thy own fate must remain hidden from thee  but live so that thou mayest be ready for anything
if it be god's will to prove thee in the duties of marriage  be ready to fulfill his will " with this consoling thought  but yet with a hope for the fulfillment of her forbidden earthly longing  princess mary sighed  and having crossed herself went down  thinking neither of her gown and coiffure nor of how she would go in nor of what she would say
what could all that matter in comparison with the will of god  without whose care not a hair of man's head can fall  when princess mary came down  prince vasili and his son were already in the drawing room  talking to the little princess and mademoiselle bourienne
when she entered with her heavy step  treading on her heels  the gentlemen and mademoiselle bourienne rose and the little princess  indicating her to the gentlemen  said  "voila marie " princess mary saw them all and saw them in detail
she saw prince vasili's face  serious for an instant at the sight of her  but immediately smiling again  and the little princess curiously noting the impression "marie" produced on the visitors
and she saw mademoiselle bourienne  with her ribbon and pretty face  and her unusually animated look which was fixed on him  but him she could not see  she only saw something large  brilliant  and handsome moving toward her as she entered the room
prince vasili approached first  and she kissed the bold forehead that bent over her hand and answered his question by saying that  on the contrary  she remembered him quite well
then anatole came up to her
she still could not see him
she only felt a soft hand taking hers firmly  and she touched with her lips a white forehead  over which was beautiful light brown hair smelling of pomade
when she looked up at him she was struck by his beauty
anatole stood with his right thumb under a button of his uniform  his chest expanded and his back drawn in  slightly swinging one foot  and  with his head a little bent  looked with beaming face at the princess without speaking and evidently not thinking about her at all
anatole was not quick witted  nor ready or eloquent in conversation  but he had the faculty  so invaluable in society  of composure and imperturbable self possession
if a man lacking in selfconfidence remains dumb on a first introduction and betrays a consciousness of the impropriety of such silence and an anxiety to find something to say  the effect is bad
but anatole was dumb  swung his foot  and smilingly examined the princess' hair
it was evident that he could be silent in this way for a very long time
"if anyone finds this silence inconvenient  let him talk  but i don't want to " he seemed to say
besides this  in his behavior to women anatole had a manner which particularly inspires in them curiosity  awe  and even love —a supercilious consciousness of his own superiority
it was as if he said to them  "i know you  i know you  but why should i bother about you  you'd be only too glad  of course " perhaps he did not really think this when he met women—even probably he did not  for in general he thought very little—but his looks and manner gave that impression
the princess felt this  and as if wishing to show him that she did not even dare expect to interest him  she turned to his father
the conversation was general and animated  thanks to princess lise's voice and little downy lip that lifted over her white teeth
she met prince vasili with that playful manner often employed by lively chatty people  and consisting in the assumption that between the person they so address and themselves there are some semi private  long established jokes and amusing reminiscences  though no such reminiscences really exist—just as none existed in this case prince vasili readily adopted her tone and the little princess also drew anatole  whom she hardly knew  into these amusing recollections of things that had never occurred
mademoiselle bourienne also shared them and even princess mary felt herself pleasantly made to share in these merry reminiscences
"here at least we shall have the benefit of your company all to ourselves  dear prince " said the little princess  of course  in french  to prince vasili
"it's not as at annette's * receptions where you always ran away  you remember cette chere annette " * anna pavlovna
"ah  but you won't talk politics to me like annette " "and our little tea table " "oh  yes " "why is it you were never at annette's " the little princess asked anatole
"ah  i know  i know " she said with a sly glance  "your brother hippolyte told me about your goings on
oh " and she shook her finger at him  "i have even heard of your doings in paris " "and didn't hippolyte tell you " asked prince vasili  turning to his son and seizing the little princess' arm as if she would have run away and he had just managed to catch her  "didn't he tell you how he himself was pining for the dear princess  and how she showed him the door  oh  she is a pearl among women  princess " he added  turning to princess mary when paris was mentioned  mademoiselle bourienne for her part seized the opportunity of joining in the general current of recollections
she took the liberty of inquiring whether it was long since anatole had left paris and how he had liked that city
anatole answered the frenchwoman very readily and  looking at her with a smile  talked to her about her native land
when he saw the pretty little bourienne  anatole came to the conclusion that he would not find bald hills dull either
"not at all bad " he thought  examining her  "not at all bad  that little companion  i hope she will bring her along with her when we're married  la petite est gentille " * * the little one is charming
the old prince dressed leisurely in his study  frowning and considering what he was to do
the coming of these visitors annoyed him
"what are prince vasili and that son of his to me  prince vasili is a shallow braggart and his son  no doubt  is a fine specimen " he grumbled to himself what angered him was that the coming of these visitors revived in his mind an unsettled question he always tried to stifle  one about which he always deceived himself the question was whether he could ever bring himself to part from his daughter and give her to a husband the prince never directly asked himself that question  knowing beforehand that he would have to answer it justly  and justice clashed not only with his feelings but with the very possibility of life life without princess mary  little as he seemed to value her  was unthinkable to him
"and why should she marry " he thought
"to be unhappy for certain
there's lise  married to andrew—a better husband one would think could hardly be found nowadays—but is she contented with her lot  and who would marry marie for love  plain and awkward  they'll take her for her connections and wealth
are there no women living unmarried  and even the happier for it " so thought prince bolkonski while dressing  and yet the question he was always putting off demanded an immediate answer
prince vasili had brought his son with the evident intention of proposing  and today or tomorrow he would probably ask for an answer
his birth and position in society were not bad
"well  i've nothing against it " the prince said to himself  "but he must be worthy of her and that is what we shall see " "that is what we shall see  that is what we shall see " he added aloud
he entered the drawing room with his usual alert step  glancing rapidly round the company
he noticed the change in the little princess' dress  mademoiselle bourienne's ribbon  princess mary's unbecoming coiffure  mademoiselle bourienne's and anatole's smiles  and the loneliness of his daughter amid the general conversation
"got herself up like a fool " he thought  looking irritably at her
"she is shameless  and he ignores her " he went straight up to prince vasili
"well  how d'ye do  how d'ye do  glad to see you " "friendship laughs at distance " began prince vasili in his usual rapid  selfconfident  familiar tone
"here is my second son  please love and befriend him " prince bolkonski surveyed anatole
"fine young fellow  fine young fellow " he said
"well  come and kiss me " and he offered his cheek
anatole kissed the old man  and looked at him with curiosity and perfect composure  waiting for a display of the eccentricities his father had told him to expect
prince bolkonski sat down in his usual place in the corner of the sofa and  drawing up an armchair for prince vasili  pointed to it and began questioning him about political affairs and news
he seemed to listen attentively to what prince vasili said  but kept glancing at princess mary
"and so they are writing from potsdam already " he said  repeating prince vasili's last words
then rising  he suddenly went up to his daughter
"is it for visitors you've got yourself up like that  eh " said he
"fine  very fine  you have done up your hair in this new way for the visitors  and before the visitors i tell you that in future you are never to dare to change your way of dress without my consent " "it was my fault  mon pere " interceded the little princess  with a blush
"you must do as you please " said prince bolkonski  bowing to his daughterin law  "but she need not make a fool of herself  she's plain enough as it is " and he sat down again  paying no more attention to his daughter  who was reduced to tears
"on the contrary  that coiffure suits the princess very well " said prince vasili
"now you  young prince  what's your name " said prince bolkonski  turning to anatole  "come here  let us talk and get acquainted " "now the fun begins " thought anatole  sitting down with a smile beside the old prince
"well  my dear boy  i hear you've been educated abroad  not taught to read and write by the deacon  like your father and me
now tell me  my dear boy  are you serving in the horse guards " asked the old man  scrutinizing anatole closely and intently
"no  i have been transferred to the line " said anatole  hardly able to restrain his laughter
"ah  that's a good thing
so  my dear boy  you wish to serve the tsar and the country  it is wartime
such a fine fellow must serve
well  are you off to the front " "no  prince  our regiment has gone to the front  but i am attached  
what is it i am attached to  papa " said anatole  turning to his father with a laugh
"a splendid soldier  splendid  'what am i attached to ' ha  ha  ha " laughed prince bolkonski  and anatole laughed still louder
suddenly prince bolkonski frowned
"you may go " he said to anatole
anatole returned smiling to the ladies
"and so you've had him educated abroad  prince vasili  haven't you " said the old prince to prince vasili
"i have done my best for him  and i can assure you the education there is much better than ours " "yes  everything is different nowadays  everything is changed
the lad's a fine fellow  a fine fellow  well  come with me now " he took prince vasili's arm and led him to his study
as soon as they were alone together  prince vasili announced his hopes and wishes to the old prince
"well  do you think i shall prevent her  that i can't part from her " said the old prince angrily
"what an idea  i'm ready for it tomorrow  only let me tell you  i want to know my son in law better
you know my principles—everything aboveboard  i will ask her tomorrow in your presence  if she is willing  then he can stay on
he can stay and i'll see " the old prince snorted
"let her marry  it's all the same to me " he screamed in the same piercing tone as when parting from his son
"i will tell you frankly " said prince vasili in the tone of a crafty man convinced of the futility of being cunning with so keen sighted a companion
"you know  you see right through people
anatole is no genius  but he is an honest  goodhearted lad  an excellent son or kinsman " "all right  all right  we'll see " as always happens when women lead lonely lives for any length of time without male society  on anatole's appearance all the three women of prince bolkonski's household felt that their life had not been real till then
their powers of reasoning  feeling  and observing immediately increased tenfold  and their life  which seemed to have been passed in darkness  was suddenly lit up by a new brightness  full of significance
princess mary grew quite unconscious of her face and coiffure
the handsome open face of the man who might perhaps be her husband absorbed all her attention
he seemed to her kind  brave  determined  manly  and magnanimous
she felt convinced of that
thousands of dreams of a future family life continually rose in her imagination she drove them away and tried to conceal them
"but am i not too cold with him " thought the princess
"i try to be reserved because in the depth of my soul i feel too near to him already  but then he cannot know what i think of him and may imagine that i do not like him " and princess mary tried  but could not manage  to be cordial to her new guest
"poor girl  she's devilish ugly " thought anatole
mademoiselle bourienne  also roused to great excitement by anatole's arrival  thought in another way
of course  she  a handsome young woman without any definite position  without relations or even a country  did not intend to devote her life to serving prince bolkonski  to reading aloud to him and being friends with princess mary
mademoiselle bourienne had long been waiting for a russian prince who  able to appreciate at a glance her superiority to the plain  badly dressed  ungainly russian princesses  would fall in love with her and carry her off  and here at last was a russian prince
mademoiselle bourienne knew a story  heard from her aunt but finished in her own way  which she liked to repeat to herself
it was the story of a girl who had been seduced  and to whom her poor mother  sa pauvre mere  appeared  and reproached her for yielding to a man without being married
mademoiselle bourienne was often touched to tears as in imagination she told this story to him  her seducer
and now he  a real russian prince  had appeared
he would carry her away and then sa pauvre mere would appear and he would marry her
so her future shaped itself in mademoiselle bourienne's head at the very time she was talking to anatole about paris
it was not calculation that guided her  she did not even for a moment consider what she should do   but all this had long been familiar to her  and now that anatole had appeared it just grouped itself around him and she wished and tried to please him as much as possible
the little princess  like an old war horse that hears the trumpet  unconsciously and quite forgetting her condition  prepared for the familiar gallop of coquetry  without any ulterior motive or any struggle  but with naive and lighthearted gaiety
although in female society anatole usually assumed the role of a man tired of being run after by women  his vanity was flattered by the spectacle of his power over these three women
besides that  he was beginning to feel for the pretty and provocative mademoiselle bourienne that passionate animal feeling which was apt to master him with great suddenness and prompt him to the coarsest and most reckless actions
after tea  the company went into the sitting room and princess mary was asked to play on the clavichord
anatole  laughing and in high spirits  came and leaned on his elbows  facing her and beside mademoiselle bourienne
princess mary felt his look with a painfully joyous emotion
her favorite sonata bore her into a most intimately poetic world and the look she felt upon her made that world still more poetic
but anatole's expression  though his eyes were fixed on her  referred not to her but to the movements of mademoiselle bourienne's little foot  which he was then touching with his own under the clavichord
mademoiselle bourienne was also looking at princess mary  and in her lovely eyes there was a look of fearful joy and hope that was also new to the princess
"how she loves me " thought princess mary
"how happy i am now  and how happy i may be with such a friend and such a husband  husband  can it be possible " she thought  not daring to look at his face  but still feeling his eyes gazing at her
in the evening  after supper  when all were about to retire  anatole kissed princess mary's hand
she did not know how she found the courage  but she looked straight into his handsome face as it came near to her shortsighted eyes
turning from princess mary he went up and kissed mademoiselle bourienne's hand
 this was not etiquette  but then he did everything so simply and with such assurance   mademoiselle bourienne flushed  and gave the princess a frightened look
"what delicacy " thought the princess
"is it possible that amelie"  mademoiselle bourienne  "thinks i could be jealous of her  and not value her pure affection and devotion to me " she went up to her and kissed her warmly
anatole went up to kiss the little princess' hand
"no  no  no  when your father writes to tell me that you are behaving well i will give you my hand to kiss
not till then " she said
and smilingly raising a finger at him  she left the room
they all separated  but  except anatole who fell asleep as soon as he got into bed  all kept awake a long time that night
"is he really to be my husband  this stranger who is so kind—yes  kind  that is the chief thing " thought princess mary  and fear  which she had seldom experienced  came upon her
she feared to look round  it seemed to her that someone was there standing behind the screen in the dark corner
and this someone was he—the devil—and he was also this man with the white forehead  black eyebrows  and red lips
she rang for her maid and asked her to sleep in her room
mademoiselle bourienne walked up and down the conservatory for a long time that evening  vainly expecting someone  now smiling at someone  now working herself up to tears with the imaginary words of her pauvre mere rebuking her for her fall
the little princess grumbled to her maid that her bed was badly made
she could not lie either on her face or on her side
every position was awkward and uncomfortable  and her burden oppressed her now more than ever because anatole's presence had vividly recalled to her the time when she was not like that and when everything was light and gay
she sat in an armchair in her dressing jacket and nightcap and katie  sleepy and disheveled  beat and turned the heavy feather bed for the third time  muttering to herself
"i told you it was all lumps and holes " the little princess repeated
"i should be glad enough to fall asleep  so it's not my fault " and her voice quivered like that of a child about to cry
the old prince did not sleep either
tikhon  half asleep  heard him pacing angrily about and snorting
the old prince felt as though he had been insulted through his daughter
the insult was the more pointed because it concerned not himself but another  his daughter  whom he loved more than himself he kept telling himself that he would consider the whole matter and decide what was right and how he should act  but instead of that he only excited himself more and more "the first man that turns up—she forgets her father and everything else  runs upstairs and does up her hair and wags her tail and is unlike herself  glad to throw her father over  and she knew i should notice it
fr  
fr  
fr  and don't i see that that idiot had eyes only for bourienne—i shall have to get rid of her
and how is it she has not pride enough to see it  if she has no pride for herself she might at least have some for my sake  she must be shown that the blockhead thinks nothing of her and looks only at bourienne
no  she has no pride  
but i'll let her see    " the old prince knew that if he told his daughter she was making a mistake and that anatole meant to flirt with mademoiselle bourienne  princess mary's selfesteem would be wounded and his point  not to be parted from her  would be gained  so pacifying himself with this thought  he called tikhon and began to undress "what devil brought them here " thought he  while tikhon was putting the nightshirt over his dried up old body and gray haired chest
"i never invited them
they came to disturb my life—and there is not much of it left " "devil take 'em " he muttered  while his head was still covered by the shirt
tikhon knew his master's habit of sometimes thinking aloud  and therefore met with unaltered looks the angrily inquisitive expression of the face that emerged from the shirt
"gone to bed " asked the prince
tikhon  like all good valets  instinctively knew the direction of his master's thoughts
he guessed that the question referred to prince vasili and his son
"they have gone to bed and put out their lights  your excellency " "no good  
no good   " said the prince rapidly  and thrusting his feet into his slippers and his arms into the sleeves of his dressing gown  he went to the couch on which he slept though no words had passed between anatole and mademoiselle bourienne  they quite understood one another as to the first part of their romance  up to the appearance of the pauvre mere  they understood that they had much to say to one another in private and so they had been seeking an opportunity since morning to meet one another alone
when princess mary went to her father's room at the usual hour  mademoiselle bourienne and anatole met in the conservatory
princess mary went to the door of the study with special trepidation
it seemed to her that not only did everybody know that her fate would be decided that day  but that they also knew what she thought about it
she read this in tikhon's face and in that of prince vasili's valet  who made her a low bow when she met him in the corridor carrying hot water
the old prince was very affectionate and careful in his treatment of his daughter that morning
princess mary well knew this painstaking expression of her father's
his face wore that expression when his dry hands clenched with vexation at her not understanding a sum in arithmetic  when rising from his chair he would walk away from her  repeating in a low voice the same words several times over
he came to the point at once  treating her ceremoniously
"i have had a proposition made me concerning you " he said with an unnatural smile
"i expect you have guessed that prince vasili has not come and brought his pupil with him"  for some reason prince bolkonski referred to anatole as a "pupil"  "for the sake of my beautiful eyes
last night a proposition was made me on your account and  as you know my principles  i refer it to you " "how am i to understand you  mon pere " said the princess  growing pale and then blushing
"how understand me " cried her father angrily
"prince vasili finds you to his taste as a daughter in law and makes a proposal to you on his pupil's behalf
that's how it's to be understood  'how understand it'   
and i ask you " "i do not know what you think  father " whispered the princess
"i  i  what of me  leave me out of the question
i'm not going to get married
what about you  that's what i want to know " the princess saw that her father regarded the matter with disapproval  but at that moment the thought occurred to her that her fate would be decided now or never
she lowered her eyes so as not to see the gaze under which she felt that she could not think  but would only be able to submit from habit  and she said  "i wish only to do your will  but if i had to express my own desire   " she had no time to finish
the old prince interrupted her
"that's admirable " he shouted
"he will take you with your dowry and take mademoiselle bourienne into the bargain
she'll be the wife  while you   " the prince stopped
he saw the effect these words had produced on his daughter
she lowered her head and was ready to burst into tears
"now then  now then  i'm only joking " he said
"remember this  princess  i hold to the principle that a maiden has a full right to choose
i give you freedom
only remember that your life's happiness depends on your decision
never mind me " "but i do not know  father " "there's no need to talk  he receives his orders and will marry you or anybody  but you are free to choose   
go to your room  think it over  and come back in an hour and tell me in his presence  yes or no
i know you will pray over it
well  pray if you like  but you had better think it over
go  yes or no  yes or no  yes or no " he still shouted when the princess  as if lost in a fog  had already staggered out of the study
her fate was decided and happily decided
but what her father had said about mademoiselle bourienne was dreadful
it was untrue to be sure  but still it was terrible  and she could not help thinking of it
she was going straight on through the conservatory  neither seeing nor hearing anything  when suddenly the well known whispering of mademoiselle bourienne aroused her
she raised her eyes  and two steps away saw anatole embracing the frenchwoman and whispering something to her
with a horrified expression on his handsome face  anatole looked at princess mary  but did not at once take his arm from the waist of mademoiselle bourienne who had not yet seen her
"who's that  why  wait a moment " anatole's face seemed to say
princess mary looked at them in silence
she could not understand it
at last mademoiselle bourienne gave a scream and ran away
anatole bowed to princess mary with a gay smile  as if inviting her to join in a laugh at this strange incident  and then shrugging his shoulders went to the door that led to his own apartments
an hour later  tikhon came to call princess mary to the old prince  he added that prince vasili was also there
when tikhon came to her princess mary was sitting on the sofa in her room  holding the weeping mademoiselle bourienne in her arms and gently stroking her hair the princess' beautiful eyes with all their former calm radiance were looking with tender affection and pity at mademoiselle bourienne's pretty face
"no  princess  i have lost your affection forever " said mademoiselle bourienne
"why  i love you more than ever " said princess mary  "and i will try to do all i can for your happiness " "but you despise me
you who are so pure can never understand being so carried away by passion
oh  only my poor mother   " "i quite understand " answered princess mary  with a sad smile
"calm yourself  my dear
i will go to my father " she said  and went out
prince vasili  with one leg thrown high over the other and a snuffbox in his hand  was sitting there with a smile of deep emotion on his face  as if stirred to his heart's core and himself regretting and laughing at his own sensibility  when princess mary entered he hurriedly took a pinch of snuff
"ah  my dear  my dear " he began  rising and taking her by both hands
then  sighing  he added  "my son's fate is in your hands
decide  my dear  good  gentle marie  whom i have always loved as a daughter " he drew back and a real tear appeared in his eye
"fr  
fr   " snorted prince bolkonski
"the prince is making a proposition to you in his pupil's—i mean  his son's—name
do you wish or not to be prince anatole kuragin's wife  reply  yes or no " he shouted  "and then i shall reserve the right to state my opinion also
yes  my opinion  and only my opinion " added prince bolkonski  turning to prince vasili and answering his imploring look
"yes  or no " "my desire is never to leave you  father  never to separate my life from yours
i don't wish to marry " she answered positively  glancing at prince vasili and at her father with her beautiful eyes
"humbug  nonsense  humbug  humbug  humbug " cried prince bolkonski  frowning and taking his daughter's hand  he did not kiss her  but only bending his forehead to hers just touched it  and pressed her hand so that she winced and uttered a cry
prince vasili rose
"my dear  i must tell you that this is a moment i shall never  never forget
but  my dear  will you not give us a little hope of touching this heart  so kind and generous  say 'perhaps'  
the future is so long
say 'perhaps '" "prince  what i have said is all there is in my heart
i thank you for the honor  but i shall never be your son's wife " "well  so that's finished  my dear fellow  i am very glad to have seen you
very glad  go back to your rooms  princess go " said the old prince
"very  very glad to have seen you " repeated he  embracing prince vasili
"my vocation is a different one " thought princess mary
"my vocation is to be happy with another kind of happiness  the happiness of love and self sacrifice
and cost what it may  i will arrange poor amelie's happiness  she loves him so passionately  and so passionately repents
i will do all i can to arrange the match between them
if he is not rich i will give her the means  i will ask my father and andrew
i shall be so happy when she is his wife
she is so unfortunate  a stranger  alone  helpless  and  oh god  how passionately she must love him if she could so far forget herself  perhaps i might have done the same    " thought princess mary
it was long since the rostovs had news of nicholas
not till midwinter was the count at last handed a letter addressed in his son's handwriting
on receiving it  he ran on tiptoe to his study in alarm and haste  trying to escape notice  closed the door  and began to read the letter
anna mikhaylovna  who always knew everything that passed in the house  on hearing of the arrival of the letter went softly into the room and found the count with it in his hand  sobbing and laughing at the same time
anna mikhaylovna  though her circumstances had improved  was still living with the rostovs "my dear friend " said she  in a tone of pathetic inquiry  prepared to sympathize in any way
the count sobbed yet more
"nikolenka  
a letter  
wa  
a  
s  
wounded  
my darling boy  
the countess  
promoted to be an officer  
thank god  
how tell the little countess " anna mikhaylovna sat down beside him  with her own handkerchief wiped the tears from his eyes and from the letter  then having dried her own eyes she comforted the count  and decided that at dinner and till teatime she would prepare the countess  and after tea  with god's help  would inform her
at dinner anna mikhaylovna talked the whole time about the war news and about nikolenka  twice asked when the last letter had been received from him  though she knew that already  and remarked that they might very likely be getting a letter from him that day
each time that these hints began to make the countess anxious and she glanced uneasily at the count and at anna mikhaylovna  the latter very adroitly turned the conversation to insignificant matters
natasha  who  of the whole family  was the most gifted with a capacity to feel any shades of intonation  look  and expression  pricked up her ears from the beginning of the meal and was certain that there was some secret between her father and anna mikhaylovna  that it had something to do with her brother  and that anna mikhaylovna was preparing them for it
bold as she was  natasha  who knew how sensitive her mother was to anything relating to nikolenka  did not venture to ask any questions at dinner  but she was too excited to eat anything and kept wriggling about on her chair regardless of her governess' remarks
after dinner  she rushed head long after anna mikhaylovna and  dashing at her  flung herself on her neck as soon as she overtook her in the sitting room
"auntie  darling  do tell me what it is " "nothing  my dear " "no  dearest  sweet one  honey  i won't give up—i know you know something " anna mikhaylovna shook her head
"you are a little slyboots " she said
"a letter from nikolenka  i'm sure of it " exclaimed natasha  reading confirmation in anna mikhaylovna's face
"but for god's sake  be careful  you know how it may affect your mamma " "i will  i will  only tell me  you won't  then i will go and tell at once " anna mikhaylovna  in a few words  told her the contents of the letter  on condition that she should tell no one
"no  on my true word of honor " said natasha  crossing herself  "i won't tell anyone " and she ran off at once to sonya
"nikolenka  
wounded  
a letter " she announced in gleeful triumph
"nicholas " was all sonya said  instantly turning white
natasha  seeing the impression the news of her brother's wound produced on sonya  felt for the first time the sorrowful side of the news
she rushed to sonya  hugged her  and began to cry
"a little wound  but he has been made an officer  he is well now  he wrote himself " said she through her tears "there now  it's true that all you women are crybabies " remarked petya  pacing the room with large  resolute strides
"now i'm very glad  very glad indeed  that my brother has distinguished himself so you are all blubberers and understand nothing " natasha smiled through her tears
"you haven't read the letter " asked sonya
"no  but she said that it was all over and that he's now an officer " "thank god " said sonya  crossing herself
"but perhaps she deceived you
let us go to mamma " petya paced the room in silence for a time
"if i'd been in nikolenka's place i would have killed even more of those frenchmen " he said
"what nasty brutes they are  i'd have killed so many that there'd have been a heap of them " "hold your tongue  petya  what a goose you are " "i'm not a goose  but they are who cry about trifles " said petya
"do you remember him " natasha suddenly asked  after a moment's silence
sonya smiled
"do i remember nicholas " "no  sonya  but do you remember so that you remember him perfectly  remember everything " said natasha  with an expressive gesture  evidently wishing to give her words a very definite meaning
"i remember nikolenka too  i remember him well " she said
"but i don't remember boris
i don't remember him a bit " "what  you don't remember boris " asked sonya in surprise
"it's not that i don't remember—i know what he is like  but not as i remember nikolenka
him—i just shut my eyes and remember  but boris  
no "  she shut her eyes   "no  there's nothing at all " "oh  natasha " said sonya  looking ecstatically and earnestly at her friend as if she did not consider her worthy to hear what she meant to say and as if she were saying it to someone else  with whom joking was out of the question  "i am in love with your brother once for all and  whatever may happen to him or to me  shall never cease to love him as long as i live " natasha looked at sonya with wondering and inquisitive eyes  and said nothing
she felt that sonya was speaking the truth  that there was such love as sonya was speaking of
but natasha had not yet felt anything like it
she believed it could be  but did not understand it
"shall you write to him " she asked
sonya became thoughtful
the question of how to write to nicholas  and whether she ought to write  tormented her
now that he was already an officer and a wounded hero  would it be right to remind him of herself and  as it might seem  of the obligations to her he had taken on himself  "i don't know i think if he writes  i will write too " she said  blushing
"and you won't feel ashamed to write to him " sonya smiled
"no " "and i should be ashamed to write to boris
i'm not going to " "why should you be ashamed " "well  i don't know
it's awkward and would make me ashamed " "and i know why she'd be ashamed " said petya  offended by natasha's previous remark
"it's because she was in love with that fat one in spectacles"  that was how petya described his namesake  the new count bezukhov  "and now she's in love with that singer"  he meant natasha's italian singing master   "that's why she's ashamed " "petya  you're a stupid " said natasha
"not more stupid than you  madam " said the nine year old petya  with the air of an old brigadier
the countess had been prepared by anna mikhaylovna's hints at dinner
on retiring to her own room  she sat in an armchair  her eyes fixed on a miniature portrait of her son on the lid of a snuffbox  while the tears kept coming into her eyes
anna mikhaylovna  with the letter  came on tiptoe to the countess' door and paused
"don't come in " she said to the old count who was following her
"come later " and she went in  closing the door behind her
the count put his ear to the keyhole and listened
at first he heard the sound of indifferent voices  then anna mikhaylovna's voice alone in a long speech  then a cry  then silence  then both voices together with glad intonations  and then footsteps
anna mikhaylovna opened the door
her face wore the proud expression of a surgeon who has just performed a difficult operation and admits the public to appreciate his skill
"it is done " she said to the count  pointing triumphantly to the countess  who sat holding in one hand the snuffbox with its portrait and in the other the letter  and pressing them alternately to her lips
when she saw the count  she stretched out her arms to him  embraced his bald head  over which she again looked at the letter and the portrait  and in order to press them again to her lips  she slightly pushed away the bald head vera  natasha  sonya  and petya now entered the room  and the reading of the letter began after a brief description of the campaign and the two battles in which he had taken part  and his promotion  nicholas said that he kissed his father's and mother's hands asking for their blessing  and that he kissed vera  natasha  and petya
besides that  he sent greetings to monsieur schelling  madame schoss  and his old nurse  and asked them to kiss for him "dear sonya  whom he loved and thought of just the same as ever " when she heard this sonya blushed so that tears came into her eyes and  unable to bear the looks turned upon her  ran away into the dancing hall  whirled round it at full speed with her dress puffed out like a balloon  and  flushed and smiling  plumped down on the floor
the countess was crying
"why are you crying  mamma " asked vera
"from all he says one should be glad and not cry " this was quite true  but the count  the countess  and natasha looked at her reproachfully
"and who is it she takes after " thought the countess
nicholas' letter was read over hundreds of times  and those who were considered worthy to hear it had to come to the countess  for she did not let it out of her hands
the tutors came  and the nurses  and dmitri  and several acquaintances  and the countess reread the letter each time with fresh pleasure and each time discovered in it fresh proofs of nikolenka's virtues
how strange  how extraordinary  how joyful it seemed  that her son  the scarcely perceptible motion of whose tiny limbs she had felt twenty years ago within her  that son about whom she used to have quarrels with the too indulgent count  that son who had first learned to say "pear" and then "granny " that this son should now be away in a foreign land amid strange surroundings  a manly warrior doing some kind of man's work of his own  without help or guidance
the universal experience of ages  showing that children do grow imperceptibly from the cradle to manhood  did not exist for the countess
her son's growth toward manhood  at each of its stages  had seemed as extraordinary to her as if there had never existed the millions of human beings who grew up in the same way
as twenty years before  it seemed impossible that the little creature who lived somewhere under her heart would ever cry  suck her breast  and begin to speak  so now she could not believe that that little creature could be this strong  brave man  this model son and officer that  judging by this letter  he now was
"what a style  how charmingly he describes " said she  reading the descriptive part of the letter
"and what a soul  not a word about himself    not a word  about some denisov or other  though he himself  i dare say  is braver than any of them he says nothing about his sufferings
what a heart  how like him it is  and how he has remembered everybody  not forgetting anyone
i always said when he was only so high—i always said    " for more than a week preparations were being made  rough drafts of letters to nicholas from all the household were written and copied out  while under the supervision of the countess and the solicitude of the count  money and all things necessary for the uniform and equipment of the newly commissioned officer were collected
anna mikhaylovna  practical woman that she was  had even managed by favor with army authorities to secure advantageous means of communication for herself and her son
she had opportunities of sending her letters to the grand duke constantine pavlovich  who commanded the guards
the rostovs supposed that the russian guards  abroad  was quite a definite address  and that if a letter reached the grand duke in command of the guards there was no reason why it should not reach the pavlograd regiment  which was presumably somewhere in the same neighborhood
and so it was decided to send the letters and money by the grand duke's courier to boris and boris was to forward them to nicholas
the letters were from the old count  the countess  petya  vera  natasha  and sonya  and finally there were six thousand rubles for his outfit and various other things the old count sent to his son
on the twelfth of november  kutuzov's active army  in camp before olmutz  was preparing to be reviewed next day by the two emperors—the russian and the austrian
the guards  just arrived from russia  spent the night ten miles from olmutz and next morning were to come straight to the review  reaching the field at olmutz by ten o'clock
that day nicholas rostov received a letter from boris  telling him that the ismaylov regiment was quartered for the night ten miles from olmutz and that he wanted to see him as he had a letter and money for him
rostov was particularly in need of money now that the troops  after their active service  were stationed near olmutz and the camp swarmed with well provisioned sutlers and austrian jews offering all sorts of tempting wares
the pavlograds held feast after feast  celebrating awards they had received for the campaign  and made expeditions to olmutz to visit a certain caroline the hungarian  who had recently opened a restaurant there with girls as waitresses
rostov  who had just celebrated his promotion to a cornetcy and bought denisov's horse  bedouin  was in debt all round  to his comrades and the sutlers on receiving boris' letter he rode with a fellow officer to olmutz  dined there  drank a bottle of wine  and then set off alone to the guards' camp to find his old playmate rostov had not yet had time to get his uniform
he had on a shabby cadet jacket  decorated with a soldier's cross  equally shabby cadet's riding breeches lined with worn leather  and an officer's saber with a sword knot
the don horse he was riding was one he had bought from a cossack during the campaign  and he wore a crumpled hussar cap stuck jauntily back on one side of his head
as he rode up to the camp he thought how he would impress boris and all his comrades of the guards by his appearance—that of a fighting hussar who had been under fire the guards had made their whole march as if on a pleasure trip  parading their cleanliness and discipline
they had come by easy stages  their knapsacks conveyed on carts  and the austrian authorities had provided excellent dinners for the officers at every halting place
the regiments had entered and left the town with their bands playing  and by the grand duke's orders the men had marched all the way in step  a practice on which the guards prided themselves   the officers on foot and at their proper posts boris had been quartered  and had marched all the way  with berg who was already in command of a company
berg  who had obtained his captaincy during the campaign  had gained the confidence of his superiors by his promptitude and accuracy and had arranged his money matters very satisfactorily
boris  during the campaign  had made the acquaintance of many persons who might prove useful to him  and by a letter of recommendation he had brought from pierre had become acquainted with prince andrew bolkonski  through whom he hoped to obtain a post on the commander in chief's staff
berg and boris  having rested after yesterday's march  were sitting  clean and neatly dressed  at a round table in the clean quarters allotted to them  playing chess
berg held a smoking pipe between his knees
boris  in the accurate way characteristic of him  was building a little pyramid of chessmen with his delicate white fingers while awaiting berg's move  and watched his opponent's face  evidently thinking about the game as he always thought only of whatever he was engaged on
"well  how are you going to get out of that " he remarked
"we'll try to " replied berg  touching a pawn and then removing his hand
at that moment the door opened
"here he is at last " shouted rostov
"and berg too  oh  you petisenfans  allay cushay dormir " he exclaimed  imitating his russian nurse's french  at which he and boris used to laugh long ago
"dear me  how you have changed " boris rose to meet rostov  but in doing so did not omit to steady and replace some chessmen that were falling
he was about to embrace his friend  but nicholas avoided him
with that peculiar feeling of youth  that dread of beaten tracks  and wish to express itself in a manner different from that of its elders which is often insincere  nicholas wished to do something special on meeting his friend
he wanted to pinch him  push him  do anything but kiss him—a thing everybody did
but notwithstanding this  boris embraced him in a quiet  friendly way and kissed him three times
they had not met for nearly half a year and  being at the age when young men take their first steps on life's road  each saw immense changes in the other  quite a new reflection of the society in which they had taken those first steps
both had changed greatly since they last met and both were in a hurry to show the changes that had taken place in them
"oh  you damned dandies  clean and fresh as if you'd been to a fete  not like us sinners of the line " cried rostov  with martial swagger and with baritone notes in his voice  new to boris  pointing to his own mud bespattered breeches
the german landlady  hearing rostov's loud voice  popped her head in at the door
"eh  is she pretty " he asked with a wink
"why do you shout so  you'll frighten them " said boris
"i did not expect you today " he added
"i only sent you the note yesterday by bolkonski—an adjutant of kutuzov's  who's a friend of mine
i did not think he would get it to you so quickly   
well  how are you  been under fire already " asked boris
without answering  rostov shook the soldier's cross of st
george fastened to the cording of his uniform and  indicating a bandaged arm  glanced at berg with a smile
"as you see " he said
"indeed  yes  yes " said boris  with a smile
"and we too have had a splendid march
you know  of course  that his imperial highness rode with our regiment all the time  so that we had every comfort and every advantage
what receptions we had in poland  what dinners and balls  i can't tell you
and the tsarevich was very gracious to all our officers " and the two friends told each other of their doings  the one of his hussar revels and life in the fighting line  the other of the pleasures and advantages of service under members of the imperial family
"oh  you guards " said rostov
"i say  send for some wine " boris made a grimace
"if you really want it " said he
he went to his bed  drew a purse from under the clean pillow  and sent for wine
"yes  and i have some money and a letter to give you " he added
rostov took the letter and  throwing the money on the sofa  put both arms on the table and began to read after reading a few lines  he glanced angrily at berg  then  meeting his eyes  hid his face behind the letter
"well  they've sent you a tidy sum " said berg  eying the heavy purse that sank into the sofa
"as for us  count  we get along on our pay
i can tell you for myself   " "i say  berg  my dear fellow " said rostov  "when you get a letter from home and meet one of your own people whom you want to talk everything over with  and i happen to be there  i'll go at once  to be out of your way  do go somewhere  anywhere  
to the devil " he exclaimed  and immediately seizing him by the shoulder and looking amiably into his face  evidently wishing to soften the rudeness of his words  he added  "don't be hurt  my dear fellow  you know i speak from my heart as to an old acquaintance " "oh  don't mention it  count  i quite understand " said berg  getting up and speaking in a muffled and guttural voice
"go across to our hosts  they invited you " added boris
berg put on the cleanest of coats  without a spot or speck of dust  stood before a looking glass and brushed the hair on his temples upwards  in the way affected by the emperor alexander  and  having assured himself from the way rostov looked at it that his coat had been noticed  left the room with a pleasant smile "oh dear  what a beast i am " muttered rostov  as he read the letter
"why " "oh  what a pig i am  not to have written and to have given them such a fright  oh  what a pig i am " he repeated  flushing suddenly
"well  have you sent gabriel for some wine  all right let's have some " in the letter from his parents was enclosed a letter of recommendation to bagration which the old countess at anna mikhaylovna's advice had obtained through an acquaintance and sent to her son  asking him to take it to its destination and make use of it
"what nonsense  much i need it " said rostov  throwing the letter under the table
"why have you thrown that away " asked boris
"it is some letter of recommendation  
what the devil do i want it for " "why 'what the devil' " said boris  picking it up and reading the address
"this letter would be of great use to you " "i want nothing  and i won't be anyone's adjutant " "why not " inquired boris
"it's a lackey's job " "you are still the same dreamer  i see " remarked boris  shaking his head
"and you're still the same diplomatist  but that's not the point  
come  how are you " asked rostov
"well  as you see
so far everything's all right  but i confess i should much like to be an adjutant and not remain at the front " "why " "because when once a man starts on military service  he should try to make as successful a career of it as possible " "oh  that's it " said rostov  evidently thinking of something else
he looked intently and inquiringly into his friend's eyes  evidently trying in vain to find the answer to some question
old gabriel brought in the wine
"shouldn't we now send for berg " asked boris
"he would drink with you
i can't " "well  send for him  
and how do you get on with that german " asked rostov  with a contemptuous smile
"he is a very  very nice  honest  and pleasant fellow " answered boris
again rostov looked intently into boris' eyes and sighed
berg returned  and over the bottle of wine conversation between the three officers became animated
the guardsmen told rostov of their march and how they had been made much of in russia  poland  and abroad
they spoke of the sayings and doings of their commander  the grand duke  and told stories of his kindness and irascibility
berg  as usual  kept silent when the subject did not relate to himself  but in connection with the stories of the grand duke's quick temper he related with gusto how in galicia he had managed to deal with the grand duke when the latter made a tour of the regiments and was annoyed at the irregularity of a movement with a pleasant smile berg related how the grand duke had ridden up to him in a violent passion  shouting  "arnauts "  "arnauts" was the tsarevich's favorite expression when he was in a rage  and called for the company commander
"would you believe it  count  i was not at all alarmed  because i knew i was right
without boasting  you know  i may say that i know the army orders by heart and know the regulations as well as i do the lord's prayer
so  count  there never is any negligence in my company  and so my conscience was at ease
i came forward    "  berg stood up and showed how he presented himself  with his hand to his cap  and really it would have been difficult for a face to express greater respect and self complacency than his did   "well  he stormed at me  as the saying is  stormed and stormed and stormed  it was not a matter of life but rather of death  as the saying is 'albanians ' and 'devils ' and 'to siberia '" said berg with a sagacious smile
"i knew i was in the right so i kept silent  was not that best  count   
'hey  are you dumb ' he shouted
still i remained silent
and what do you think  count  the next day it was not even mentioned in the orders of the day
that's what keeping one's head means
that's the way  count " said berg  lighting his pipe and emitting rings of smoke
"yes  that was fine " said rostov  smiling
but boris noticed that he was preparing to make fun of berg  and skillfully changed the subject
he asked him to tell them how and where he got his wound
this pleased rostov and he began talking about it  and as he went on became more and more animated
he told them of his schon grabern affair  just as those who have taken part in a battle generally do describe it  that is  as they would like it to have been  as they have heard it described by others  and as sounds well  but not at all as it really was
rostov was a truthful young man and would on no account have told a deliberate lie
he began his story meaning to tell everything just as it happened  but imperceptibly  involuntarily  and inevitably he lapsed into falsehood
if he had told the truth to his hearers —who like himself had often heard stories of attacks and had formed a definite idea of what an attack was and were expecting to hear just such a story—they would either not have believed him or  still worse  would have thought that rostov was himself to blame since what generally happens to the narrators of cavalry attacks had not happened to him he could not tell them simply that everyone went at a trot and that he fell off his horse and sprained his arm and then ran as hard as he could from a frenchman into the wood
besides  to tell everything as it really happened  it would have been necessary to make an effort of will to tell only what happened
it is very difficult to tell the truth  and young people are rarely capable of it
his hearers expected a story of how beside himself and all aflame with excitement  he had flown like a storm at the square  cut his way in  slashed right and left  how his saber had tasted flesh and he had fallen exhausted  and so on and so he told them all that
in the middle of his story  just as he was saying  "you cannot imagine what a strange frenzy one experiences during an attack " prince andrew  whom boris was expecting  entered the room
prince andrew  who liked to help young men  was flattered by being asked for his assistance and being well disposed toward boris  who had managed to please him the day before  he wished to do what the young man wanted
having been sent with papers from kutuzov to the tsarevich  he looked in on boris  hoping to find him alone
when he came in and saw an hussar of the line recounting his military exploits  prince andrew could not endure that sort of man   he gave boris a pleasant smile  frowned as with half closed eyes he looked at rostov  bowed slightly and wearily  and sat down languidly on the sofa  he felt it unpleasant to have dropped in on bad company
rostov flushed up on noticing this  but he did not care  this was a mere stranger
glancing  however  at boris  he saw that he too seemed ashamed of the hussar of the line
in spite of prince andrew's disagreeable  ironical tone  in spite of the contempt with which rostov  from his fighting army point of view  regarded all these little adjutants on the staff of whom the newcomer was evidently one  rostov felt confused  blushed  and became silent
boris inquired what news there might be on the staff  and what  without indiscretion  one might ask about our plans
"we shall probably advance " replied bolkonski  evidently reluctant to say more in the presence of a stranger
berg took the opportunity to ask  with great politeness  whether  as was rumored  the allowance of forage money to captains of companies would be doubled
to this prince andrew answered with a smile that he could give no opinion on such an important government order  and berg laughed gaily
"as to your business " prince andrew continued  addressing boris  "we will talk of it later"  and he looked round at rostov 
"come to me after the review and we will do what is possible " and  having glanced round the room  prince andrew turned to rostov  whose state of unconquerable childish embarrassment now changing to anger he did not condescend to notice  and said  "i think you were talking of the schon grabern affair  were you there " "i was there " said rostov angrily  as if intending to insult the aide de camp
bolkonski noticed the hussar's state of mind  and it amused him
with a slightly contemptuous smile  he said  "yes  there are many stories now told about that affair " "yes  stories " repeated rostov loudly  looking with eyes suddenly grown furious  now at boris  now at bolkonski
"yes  many stories  but our stories are the stories of men who have been under the enemy's fire  our stories have some weight  not like the stories of those fellows on the staff who get rewards without doing anything " "of whom you imagine me to be one " said prince andrew  with a quiet and particularly amiable smile
a strange feeling of exasperation and yet of respect for this man's selfpossession mingled at that moment in rostov's soul
"i am not talking about you " he said  "i don't know you and  frankly  i don't want to
i am speaking of the staff in general " "and i will tell you this " prince andrew interrupted in a tone of quiet authority  "you wish to insult me  and i am ready to agree with you that it would be very easy to do so if you haven't sufficient self respect  but admit that the time and place are very badly chosen
in a day or two we shall all have to take part in a greater and more serious duel  and besides  drubetskoy  who says he is an old friend of yours  is not at all to blame that my face has the misfortune to displease you
however " he added rising  "you know my name and where to find me  but don't forget that i do not regard either myself or you as having been at all insulted  and as a man older than you  my advice is to let the matter drop
well then  on friday after the review i shall expect you  drubetskoy
au revoir " exclaimed prince andrew  and with a bow to them both he went out
only when prince andrew was gone did rostov think of what he ought to have said
and he was still more angry at having omitted to say it
he ordered his horse at once and  coldly taking leave of boris  rode home
should he go to headquarters next day and challenge that affected adjutant  or really let the matter drop  was the question that worried him all the way
he thought angrily of the pleasure he would have at seeing the fright of that small and frail but proud man when covered by his pistol  and then he felt with surprise that of all the men he knew there was none he would so much like to have for a friend as that very adjutant whom he so hated
the day after rostov had been to see boris  a review was held of the austrian and russian troops  both those freshly arrived from russia and those who had been campaigning under kutuzov
the two emperors  the russian with his heir the tsarevich  and the austrian with the archduke  inspected the allied army of eighty thousand men
from early morning the smart clean troops were on the move  forming up on the field before the fortress
now thousands of feet and bayonets moved and halted at the officers' command  turned with banners flying  formed up at intervals  and wheeled round other similar masses of infantry in different uniforms  now was heard the rhythmic beat of hoofs and the jingling of showy cavalry in blue  red  and green braided uniforms  with smartly dressed bandsmen in front mounted on black  roan  or gray horses  then again  spreading out with the brazen clatter of the polished shining cannon that quivered on the gun carriages and with the smell of linstocks  came the artillery which crawled between the infantry and cavalry and took up its appointed position not only the generals in full parade uniforms  with their thin or thick waists drawn in to the utmost  their red necks squeezed into their stiff collars  and wearing scarves and all their decorations  not only the elegant  pomaded officers  but every soldier with his freshly washed and shaven face and his weapons clean and polished to the utmost  and every horse groomed till its coat shone like satin and every hair of its wetted mane lay smooth—felt that no small matter was happening  but an important and solemn affair every general and every soldier was conscious of his own insignificance  aware of being but a drop in that ocean of men  and yet at the same time was conscious of his strength as a part of that enormous whole
from early morning strenuous activities and efforts had begun and by ten o'clock all had been brought into due order
the ranks were drawn up on the vast field
the whole army was extended in three lines  the cavalry in front  behind it the artillery  and behind that again the infantry
a space like a street was left between each two lines of troops
the three parts of that army were sharply distinguished  kutuzov's fighting army  with the pavlograds on the right flank of the front   those recently arrived from russia  both guards and regiments of the line  and the austrian troops
but they all stood in the same lines  under one command  and in a like order
like wind over leaves ran an excited whisper  "they're coming  they're coming " alarmed voices were heard  and a stir of final preparation swept over all the troops
from the direction of olmutz in front of them  a group was seen approaching
and at that moment  though the day was still  a light gust of wind blowing over the army slightly stirred the streamers on the lances and the unfolded standards fluttered against their staffs
it looked as if by that slight motion the army itself was expressing its joy at the approach of the emperors
one voice was heard shouting  "eyes front " then  like the crowing of cocks at sunrise  this was repeated by others from various sides and all became silent
in the deathlike stillness only the tramp of horses was heard
this was the emperors' suites
the emperors rode up to the flank  and the trumpets of the first cavalry regiment played the general march
it seemed as though not the trumpeters were playing  but as if the army itself  rejoicing at the emperors' approach  had naturally burst into music
amid these sounds  only the youthful kindly voice of the emperor alexander was clearly heard
he gave the words of greeting  and the first regiment roared "hurrah " so deafeningly  continuously  and joyfully that the men themselves were awed by their multitude and the immensity of the power they constituted rostov  standing in the front lines of kutuzov's army which the tsar approached first  experienced the same feeling as every other man in that army  a feeling of self forgetfulness  a proud consciousness of might  and a passionate attraction to him who was the cause of this triumph
he felt that at a single word from that man all this vast mass  and he himself an insignificant atom in it  would go through fire and water  commit crime  die  or perform deeds of highest heroism  and so he could not but tremble and his heart stand still at the imminence of that word "hurrah  hurrah  hurrah " thundered from all sides  one regiment after another greeting the tsar with the strains of the march  and then "hurrah "  
then the general march  and again "hurrah  hurrah " growing ever stronger and fuller and merging into a deafening roar
till the tsar reached it  each regiment in its silence and immobility seemed like a lifeless body  but as soon as he came up it became alive  its thunder joining the roar of the whole line along which he had already passed
through the terrible and deafening roar of those voices  amid the square masses of troops standing motionless as if turned to stone  hundreds of riders composing the suites moved carelessly but symmetrically and above all freely  and in front of them two men—the emperors
upon them the undivided  tensely passionate attention of that whole mass of men was concentrated
the handsome young emperor alexander  in the uniform of the horse guards  wearing a cocked hat with its peaks front and back  with his pleasant face and resonant though not loud voice  attracted everyone's attention
rostov was not far from the trumpeters  and with his keen sight had recognized the tsar and watched his approach
when he was within twenty paces  and nicholas could clearly distinguish every detail of his handsome  happy young face  he experienced a feeling of tenderness and ecstasy such as he had never before known
every trait and every movement of the tsar's seemed to him enchanting
stopping in front of the pavlograds  the tsar said something in french to the austrian emperor and smiled
seeing that smile  rostov involuntarily smiled himself and felt a still stronger flow of love for his sovereign he longed to show that love in some way and knowing that this was impossible was ready to cry
the tsar called the colonel of the regiment and said a few words to him
"oh god  what would happen to me if the emperor spoke to me " thought rostov
"i should die of happiness " the tsar addressed the officers also  "i thank you all  gentlemen  i thank you with my whole heart " to rostov every word sounded like a voice from heaven
how gladly would he have died at once for his tsar  "you have earned the st
george's standards and will be worthy of them " "oh  to die  to die for him " thought rostov
the tsar said something more which rostov did not hear  and the soldiers  straining their lungs  shouted "hurrah " rostov too  bending over his saddle  shouted "hurrah " with all his might  feeling that he would like to injure himself by that shout  if only to express his rapture fully the tsar stopped a few minutes in front of the hussars as if undecided
"how can the emperor be undecided " thought rostov  but then even this indecision appeared to him majestic and enchanting  like everything else the tsar did
that hesitation lasted only an instant
the tsar's foot  in the narrow pointed boot then fashionable  touched the groin of the bobtailed bay mare he rode  his hand in a white glove gathered up the reins  and he moved off accompanied by an irregularly swaying sea of aides de camp
farther and farther he rode away  stopping at other regiments  till at last only his white plumes were visible to rostov from amid the suites that surrounded the emperors
among the gentlemen of the suite  rostov noticed bolkonski  sitting his horse indolently and carelessly
rostov recalled their quarrel of yesterday and the question presented itself whether he ought or ought not to challenge bolkonski
"of course not " he now thought
"is it worth thinking or speaking of it at such a moment  at a time of such love  such rapture  and such selfsacrifice  what do any of our quarrels and affronts matter  i love and forgive everybody now " when the emperor had passed nearly all the regiments  the troops began a ceremonial march past him  and rostov on bedouin  recently purchased from denisov  rode past too  at the rear of his squadron—that is  alone and in full view of the emperor
before he reached him  rostov  who was a splendid horseman  spurred bedouin twice and successfully put him to the showy trot in which the animal went when excited
bending his foaming muzzle to his chest  his tail extended  bedouin  as if also conscious of the emperor's eye upon him  passed splendidly  lifting his feet with a high and graceful action  as if flying through the air without touching the ground
rostov himself  his legs well back and his stomach drawn in and feeling himself one with his horse  rode past the emperor with a frowning but blissful face "like a vewy devil " as denisov expressed it "fine fellows  the pavlograds " remarked the emperor
"my god  how happy i should be if he ordered me to leap into the fire this instant " thought rostov
when the review was over  the newly arrived officers  and also kutuzov's  collected in groups and began to talk about the awards  about the austrians and their uniforms  about their lines  about bonaparte  and how badly the latter would fare now  especially if the essen corps arrived and prussia took our side but the talk in every group was chiefly about the emperor alexander
his every word and movement was described with ecstasy
they all had but one wish  to advance as soon as possible against the enemy under the emperor's command
commanded by the emperor himself they could not fail to vanquish anyone  be it whom it might  so thought rostov and most of the officers after the review all were then more confident of victory than the winning of two battles would have made them
the day after the review  boris  in his best uniform and with his comrade berg's best wishes for success  rode to olmutz to see bolkonski  wishing to profit by his friendliness and obtain for himself the best post he could— preferably that of adjutant to some important personage  a position in the army which seemed to him most attractive "it is all very well for rostov  whose father sends him ten thousand rubles at a time  to talk about not wishing to cringe to anybody and not be anyone's lackey  but i who have nothing but my brains have to make a career and must not miss opportunities  but must avail myself of them " he reflected he did not find prince andrew in olmutz that day  but the appearance of the town where the headquarters and the diplomatic corps were stationed and the two emperors were living with their suites  households  and courts only strengthened his desire to belong to that higher world
he knew no one  and despite his smart guardsman's uniform  all these exalted personages passing in the streets in their elegant carriages with their plumes  ribbons  and medals  both courtiers and military men  seemed so immeasurably above him  an insignificant officer of the guards  that they not only did not wish to  but simply could not  be aware of his existence
at the quarters of the commander in chief  kutuzov  where he inquired for bolkonski  all the adjutants and even the orderlies looked at him as if they wished to impress on him that a great many officers like him were always coming there and that everybody was heartily sick of them
in spite of this  or rather because of it  next day  november 15  after dinner he again went to olmutz and  entering the house occupied by kutuzov  asked for bolkonski
prince andrew was in and boris was shown into a large hall probably formerly used for dancing  but in which five beds now stood  and furniture of various kinds  a table  chairs  and a clavichord
one adjutant  nearest the door  was sitting at the table in a persian dressing gown  writing
another  the red  stout nesvitski  lay on a bed with his arms under his head  laughing with an officer who had sat down beside him a third was playing a viennese waltz on the clavichord  while a fourth  lying on the clavichord  sang the tune
bolkonski was not there
none of these gentlemen changed his position on seeing boris
the one who was writing and whom boris addressed turned round crossly and told him bolkonski was on duty and that he should go through the door on the left into the reception room if he wished to see him
boris thanked him and went to the reception room  where he found some ten officers and generals
when he entered  prince andrew  his eyes drooping contemptuously  with that peculiar expression of polite weariness which plainly says  "if it were not my duty i would not talk to you for a moment"   was listening to an old russian general with decorations  who stood very erect  almost on tiptoe  with a soldier's obsequious expression on his purple face  reporting something
"very well  then  be so good as to wait " said prince andrew to the general  in russian  speaking with the french intonation he affected when he wished to speak contemptuously  and noticing boris  prince andrew  paying no more heed to the general who ran after him imploring him to hear something more  nodded and turned to him with a cheerful smile
at that moment boris clearly realized what he had before surmised  that in the army  besides the subordination and discipline prescribed in the military code  which he and the others knew in the regiment  there was another  more important  subordination  which made this tight laced  purple faced general wait respectfully while captain prince andrew  for his own pleasure  chose to chat with lieutenant drubetskoy
more than ever was boris resolved to serve in future not according to the written code  but under this unwritten law
he felt now that merely by having been recommended to prince andrew he had already risen above the general who at the front had the power to annihilate him  a lieutenant of the guards
prince andrew came up to him and took his hand
"i am very sorry you did not find me in yesterday
i was fussing about with germans all day
we went with weyrother to survey the dispositions
when germans start being accurate  there's no end to it " boris smiled  as if he understood what prince andrew was alluding to as something generally known
but it was the first time he had heard weyrother's name  or even the term "dispositions " "well  my dear fellow  so you still want to be an adjutant  i have been thinking about you " "yes  i was thinking"—for some reason boris could not help blushing—"of asking the commander in chief
he has had a letter from prince kuragin about me
i only wanted to ask because i fear the guards won't be in action " he added as if in apology
"all right  all right
we'll talk it over " replied prince andrew
"only let me report this gentleman's business  and i shall be at your disposal " while prince andrew went to report about the purple faced general  that gentleman—evidently not sharing boris' conception of the advantages of the unwritten code of subordination—looked so fixedly at the presumptuous lieutenant who had prevented his finishing what he had to say to the adjutant that boris felt uncomfortable
he turned away and waited impatiently for prince andrew's return from the commander in chief's room
"you see  my dear fellow  i have been thinking about you " said prince andrew when they had gone into the large room where the clavichord was
"it's no use your going to the commander in chief
he would say a lot of pleasant things  ask you to dinner"  "that would not be bad as regards the unwritten code " thought boris   "but nothing more would come of it
there will soon be a battalion of us aides de camp and adjutants  but this is what we'll do  i have a good friend  an adjutant general and an excellent fellow  prince dolgorukov  and though you may not know it  the fact is that now kutuzov with his staff and all of us count for nothing
everything is now centered round the emperor
so we will go to dolgorukov  i have to go there anyhow and i have already spoken to him about you
we shall see whether he cannot attach you to himself or find a place for you somewhere nearer the sun " prince andrew always became specially keen when he had to guide a young man and help him to worldly success under cover of obtaining help of this kind for another  which from pride he would never accept for himself  he kept in touch with the circle which confers success and which attracted him he very readily took up boris' cause and went with him to dolgorukov
it was late in the evening when they entered the palace at olmutz occupied by the emperors and their retinues
that same day a council of war had been held in which all the members of the hofkriegsrath and both emperors took part
at that council  contrary to the views of the old generals kutuzov and prince schwartzenberg  it had been decided to advance immediately and give battle to bonaparte
the council of war was just over when prince andrew accompanied by boris arrived at the palace to find dolgorukov
everyone at headquarters was still under the spell of the day's council  at which the party of the young had triumphed
the voices of those who counseled delay and advised waiting for something else before advancing had been so completely silenced and their arguments confuted by such conclusive evidence of the advantages of attacking that what had been discussed at the council—the coming battle and the victory that would certainly result from it—no longer seemed to be in the future but in the past
all the advantages were on our side
our enormous forces  undoubtedly superior to napoleon's  were concentrated in one place  the troops inspired by the emperors' presence were eager for action
the strategic position where the operations would take place was familiar in all its details to the austrian general weyrother  a lucky accident had ordained that the austrian army should maneuver the previous year on the very fields where the french had now to be fought  the adjacent locality was known and shown in every detail on the maps  and bonaparte  evidently weakened  was undertaking nothing
dolgorukov  one of the warmest advocates of an attack  had just returned from the council  tired and exhausted but eager and proud of the victory that had been gained
prince andrew introduced his protege  but prince dolgorukov politely and firmly pressing his hand said nothing to boris and  evidently unable to suppress the thoughts which were uppermost in his mind at that moment  addressed prince andrew in french
"ah  my dear fellow  what a battle we have gained  god grant that the one that will result from it will be as victorious  however  dear fellow " he said abruptly and eagerly  "i must confess to having been unjust to the austrians and especially to weyrother
what exactitude  what minuteness  what knowledge of the locality  what foresight for every eventuality  every possibility even to the smallest detail  no  my dear fellow  no conditions better than our present ones could have been devised
this combination of austrian precision with russian valor—what more could be wished for " "so the attack is definitely resolved on " asked bolkonski
"and do you know  my dear fellow  it seems to me that bonaparte has decidedly lost bearings  you know that a letter was received from him today for the emperor " dolgorukov smiled significantly "is that so  and what did he say " inquired bolkonski
"what can he say  tra di ri di ra and so on  
merely to gain time
i tell you he is in our hands  that's certain  but what was most amusing " he continued  with a sudden  good natured laugh  "was that we could not think how to address the reply  if not as 'consul' and of course not as 'emperor ' it seemed to me it should be to 'general bonaparte '" "but between not recognizing him as emperor and calling him general bonaparte  there is a difference " remarked bolkonski
"that's just it " interrupted dolgorukov quickly  laughing
"you know bilibin —he's a very clever fellow
he suggested addressing him as 'usurper and enemy of mankind '" dolgorukov laughed merrily
"only that " said bolkonski
"all the same  it was bilibin who found a suitable form for the address
he is a wise and clever fellow " "what was it " "to the head of the french government  
au chef du gouvernement francais " said dolgorukov  with grave satisfaction
"good  wasn't it " "yes  but he will dislike it extremely " said bolkonski
"oh yes  very much  my brother knows him  he's dined with him—the present emperor—more than once in paris  and tells me he never met a more cunning or subtle diplomatist—you know  a combination of french adroitness and italian play acting  do you know the tale about him and count markov  count markov was the only man who knew how to handle him
you know the story of the handkerchief  it is delightful " and the talkative dolgorukov  turning now to boris  now to prince andrew  told how bonaparte wishing to test markov  our ambassador  purposely dropped a handkerchief in front of him and stood looking at markov  probably expecting markov to pick it up for him  and how markov immediately dropped his own beside it and picked it up without touching bonaparte's
"delightful " said bolkonski
"but i have come to you  prince  as a petitioner on behalf of this young man
you see   " but before prince andrew could finish  an aide de camp came in to summon dolgorukov to the emperor
"oh  what a nuisance " said dolgorukov  getting up hurriedly and pressing the hands of prince andrew and boris
"you know i should be very glad to do all in my power both for you and for this dear young man " again he pressed the hand of the latter with an expression of good natured  sincere  and animated levity
"but you see  
another time " boris was excited by the thought of being so close to the higher powers as he felt himself to be at that moment he was conscious that here he was in contact with the springs that set in motion the enormous movements of the mass of which in his regiment he felt himself a tiny  obedient  and insignificant atom they followed prince dolgorukov out into the corridor and met—coming out of the door of the emperor's room by which dolgorukov had entered—a short man in civilian clothes with a clever face and sharply projecting jaw which  without spoiling his face  gave him a peculiar vivacity and shiftiness of expression
this short man nodded to dolgorukov as to an intimate friend and stared at prince andrew with cool intensity  walking straight toward him and evidently expecting him to bow or to step out of his way
prince andrew did neither  a look of animosity appeared on his face and the other turned away and went down the side of the corridor
"who was that " asked boris
"he is one of the most remarkable  but to me most unpleasant of men—the minister of foreign affairs  prince adam czartoryski   
it is such men as he who decide the fate of nations " added bolkonski with a sigh he could not suppress  as they passed out of the palace
next day  the army began its campaign  and up to the very battle of austerlitz  boris was unable to see either prince andrew or dolgorukov again and remained for a while with the ismaylov regiment
at dawn on the sixteenth of november  denisov's squadron  in which nicholas rostov served and which was in prince bagration's detachment  moved from the place where it had spent the night  advancing into action as arranged  and after going behind other columns for about two thirds of a mile was stopped on the highroad
rostov saw the cossacks and then the first and second squadrons of hussars and infantry battalions and artillery pass by and go forward and then generals bagration and dolgorukov ride past with their adjutants
all the fear before action which he had experienced as previously  all the inner struggle to conquer that fear  all his dreams of distinguishing himself as a true hussar in this battle  had been wasted their squadron remained in reserve and nicholas rostov spent that day in a dull and wretched mood at nine in the morning  he heard firing in front and shouts of hurrah  and saw wounded being brought back  there were not many of them   and at last he saw how a whole detachment of french cavalry was brought in  convoyed by a sotnya of cossacks
evidently the affair was over and  though not big  had been a successful engagement
the men and officers returning spoke of a brilliant victory  of the occupation of the town of wischau and the capture of a whole french squadron
the day was bright and sunny after a sharp night frost  and the cheerful glitter of that autumn day was in keeping with the news of victory which was conveyed  not only by the tales of those who had taken part in it  but also by the joyful expression on the faces of soldiers  officers  generals  and adjutants  as they passed rostov going or coming
and nicholas  who had vainly suffered all the dread that precedes a battle and had spent that happy day in inactivity  was all the more depressed
"come here  wostov
let's dwink to dwown our gwief " shouted denisov  who had settled down by the roadside with a flask and some food
the officers gathered round denisov's canteen  eating and talking
"there  they are bringing another " cried one of the officers  indicating a captive french dragoon who was being brought in on foot by two cossacks
one of them was leading by the bridle a fine large french horse he had taken from the prisoner
"sell us that horse " denisov called out to the cossacks
"if you like  your honor " the officers got up and stood round the cossacks and their prisoner
the french dragoon was a young alsatian who spoke french with a german accent
he was breathless with agitation  his face was red  and when he heard some french spoken he at once began speaking to the officers  addressing first one  then another
he said he would not have been taken  it was not his fault but the corporal's who had sent him to seize some horsecloths  though he had told him the russians were there
and at every word he added  "but don't hurt my little horse " and stroked the animal
it was plain that he did not quite grasp where he was
now he excused himself for having been taken prisoner and now  imagining himself before his own officers  insisted on his soldierly discipline and zeal in the service he brought with him into our rearguard all the freshness of atmosphere of the french army  which was so alien to us
the cossacks sold the horse for two gold pieces  and rostov  being the richest of the officers now that he had received his money  bought it
"but don't hurt my little horse " said the alsatian good naturedly to rostov when the animal was handed over to the hussar
rostov smilingly reassured the dragoon and gave him money
"alley  alley " said the cossack  touching the prisoner's arm to make him go on
"the emperor  the emperor " was suddenly heard among the hussars
all began to run and bustle  and rostov saw coming up the road behind him several riders with white plumes in their hats
in a moment everyone was in his place  waiting
rostov did not know or remember how he ran to his place and mounted
instantly his regret at not having been in action and his dejected mood amid people of whom he was weary had gone  instantly every thought of himself had vanished he was filled with happiness at his nearness to the emperor
he felt that this nearness by itself made up to him for the day he had lost
he was happy as a lover when the longed for moment of meeting arrives
not daring to look round and without looking round  he was ecstatically conscious of his approach
he felt it not only from the sound of the hoofs of the approaching cavalcade  but because as he drew near everything grew brighter  more joyful  more significant  and more festive around him
nearer and nearer to rostov came that sun shedding beams of mild and majestic light around  and already he felt himself enveloped in those beams  he heard his voice  that kindly  calm  and majestic voice that was yet so simple  and as if in accord with rostov's feeling  there was a deathly stillness amid which was heard the emperor's voice "the pavlograd hussars " he inquired
"the reserves  sire " replied a voice  a very human one compared to that which had said  "the pavlograd hussars " the emperor drew level with rostov and halted
alexander's face was even more beautiful than it had been three days before at the review
it shone with such gaiety and youth  such innocent youth  that it suggested the liveliness of a fourteen year old boy  and yet it was the face of the majestic emperor
casually  while surveying the squadron  the emperor's eyes met rostov's and rested on them for not more than two seconds
whether or no the emperor understood what was going on in rostov's soul  it seemed to rostov that he understood everything   at any rate his light blue eyes gazed for about two seconds into rostov's face
a gentle  mild light poured from them
then all at once he raised his eyebrows  abruptly touched his horse with his left foot  and galloped on
the younger emperor could not restrain his wish to be present at the battle and  in spite of the remonstrances of his courtiers  at twelve o'clock left the third column with which he had been and galloped toward the vanguard
before he came up with the hussars  several adjutants met him with news of the successful result of the action
this battle  which consisted in the capture of a french squadron  was represented as a brilliant victory over the french  and so the emperor and the whole army  especially while the smoke hung over the battlefield  believed that the french had been defeated and were retreating against their will
a few minutes after the emperor had passed  the pavlograd division was ordered to advance
in wischau itself  a petty german town  rostov saw the emperor again
in the market place  where there had been some rather heavy firing before the emperor's arrival  lay several killed and wounded soldiers whom there had not been time to move
the emperor  surrounded by his suite of officers and courtiers  was riding a bobtailed chestnut mare  a different one from that which he had ridden at the review  and bending to one side he gracefully held a gold lorgnette to his eyes and looked at a soldier who lay prone  with blood on his uncovered head
the wounded soldier was so dirty  coarse  and revolting that his proximity to the emperor shocked rostov
rostov saw how the emperor's rather round shoulders shuddered as if a cold shiver had run down them  how his left foot began convulsively tapping the horse's side with the spur  and how the well trained horse looked round unconcerned and did not stir
an adjutant  dismounting  lifted the soldier under the arms to place him on a stretcher that had been brought the soldier groaned "gently  gently  can't you do it more gently " said the emperor apparently suffering more than the dying soldier  and he rode away
rostov saw tears filling the emperor's eyes and heard him  as he was riding away  say to czartoryski  "what a terrible thing war is  what a terrible thing  quelle terrible chose que la guerre " the troops of the vanguard were stationed before wischau  within sight of the enemy's lines  which all day long had yielded ground to us at the least firing
the emperor's gratitude was announced to the vanguard  rewards were promised  and the men received a double ration of vodka
the campfires crackled and the soldiers' songs resounded even more merrily than on the previous night
denisov celebrated his promotion to the rank of major  and rostov  who had already drunk enough  at the end of the feast proposed the emperor's health
"not 'our sovereign  the emperor ' as they say at official dinners " said he  "but the health of our sovereign  that good  enchanting  and great man  let us drink to his health and to the certain defeat of the french " "if we fought before " he said  "not letting the french pass  as at schon grabern  what shall we not do now when he is at the front  we will all die for him gladly  is it not so  gentlemen  perhaps i am not saying it right  i have drunk a good deal—but that is how i feel  and so do you too  to the health of alexander the first  hurrah " "hurrah " rang the enthusiastic voices of the officers
and the old cavalry captain  kirsten  shouted enthusiastically and no less sincerely than the twenty year old rostov
when the officers had emptied and smashed their glasses  kirsten filled others and  in shirt sleeves and breeches  went glass in hand to the soldiers' bonfires and with his long gray mustache  his white chest showing under his open shirt  he stood in a majestic pose in the light of the campfire  waving his uplifted arm
"lads  here's to our sovereign  the emperor  and victory over our enemies  hurrah " he exclaimed in his dashing  old  hussar's baritone
the hussars crowded round and responded heartily with loud shouts
late that night  when all had separated  denisov with his short hand patted his favorite  rostov  on the shoulder
"as there's no one to fall in love with on campaign  he's fallen in love with the tsar " he said
"denisov  don't make fun of it " cried rostov
"it is such a lofty  beautiful feeling  such a   " "i believe it  i believe it  fwiend  and i share and appwove   " "no  you don't understand " and rostov got up and went wandering among the campfires  dreaming of what happiness it would be to die—not in saving the emperor's life  he did not even dare to dream of that   but simply to die before his eyes
he really was in love with the tsar and the glory of the russian arms and the hope of future triumph and he was not the only man to experience that feeling during those memorable days preceding the battle of austerlitz  nine tenths of the men in the russian army were then in love  though less ecstatically  with their tsar and the glory of the russian arms the next day the emperor stopped at wischau  and villier  his physician  was repeatedly summoned to see him
at headquarters and among the troops near by the news spread that the emperor was unwell
he ate nothing and had slept badly that night  those around him reported
the cause of this indisposition was the strong impression made on his sensitive mind by the sight of the killed and wounded
at daybreak on the seventeenth  a french officer who had come with a flag of truce  demanding an audience with the russian emperor  was brought into wischau from our outposts
this officer was savary
the emperor had only just fallen asleep and so savary had to wait
at midday he was admitted to the emperor  and an hour later he rode off with prince dolgorukov to the advanced post of the french army
it was rumored that savary had been sent to propose to alexander a meeting with napoleon
to the joy and pride of the whole army  a personal interview was refused  and instead of the sovereign  prince dolgorukov  the victor at wischau  was sent with savary to negotiate with napoleon if  contrary to expectations  these negotiations were actuated by a real desire for peace
toward evening dolgorukov came back  went straight to the tsar  and remained alone with him for a long time
on the eighteenth and nineteenth of november  the army advanced two days' march and the enemy's outposts after a brief interchange of shots retreated
in the highest army circles from midday on the nineteenth  a great  excitedly bustling activity began which lasted till the morning of the twentieth  when the memorable battle of austerlitz was fought
till midday on the nineteenth  the activity—the eager talk  running to and fro  and dispatching of adjutants—was confined to the emperor's headquarters
but on the afternoon of that day  this activity reached kutuzov's headquarters and the staffs of the commanders of columns
by evening  the adjutants had spread it to all ends and parts of the army  and in the night from the nineteenth to the twentieth  the whole eighty thousand allied troops rose from their bivouacs to the hum of voices  and the army swayed and started in one enormous mass six miles long
the concentrated activity which had begun at the emperor's headquarters in the morning and had started the whole movement that followed was like the first movement of the main wheel of a large tower clock
one wheel slowly moved  another was set in motion  and a third  and wheels began to revolve faster and faster  levers and cogwheels to work  chimes to play  figures to pop out  and the hands to advance with regular motion as a result of all that activity
just as in the mechanism of a clock  so in the mechanism of the military machine  an impulse once given leads to the final result  and just as indifferently quiescent till the moment when motion is transmitted to them are the parts of the mechanism which the impulse has not yet reached
wheels creak on their axles as the cogs engage one another and the revolving pulleys whirr with the rapidity of their movement  but a neighboring wheel is as quiet and motionless as though it were prepared to remain so for a hundred years  but the moment comes when the lever catches it and obeying the impulse that wheel begins to creak and joins in the common motion the result and aim of which are beyond its ken
just as in a clock  the result of the complicated motion of innumerable wheels and pulleys is merely a slow and regular movement of the hands which show the time  so the result of all the complicated human activities of 160 000 russians and french—all their passions  desires  remorse  humiliations  sufferings  outbursts of pride  fear  and enthusiasm—was only the loss of the battle of austerlitz  the so called battle of the three emperors—that is to say  a slow movement of the hand on the dial of human history
prince andrew was on duty that day and in constant attendance on the commander in chief
at six in the evening  kutuzov went to the emperor's headquarters and after staying but a short time with the tsar went to see the grand marshal of the court  count tolstoy
bolkonski took the opportunity to go in to get some details of the coming action from dolgorukov
he felt that kutuzov was upset and dissatisfied about something and that at headquarters they were dissatisfied with him  and also that at the emperor's headquarters everyone adopted toward him the tone of men who know something others do not know  he therefore wished to speak to dolgorukov
"well  how d'you do  my dear fellow " said dolgorukov  who was sitting at tea with bilibin
"the fete is for tomorrow
how is your old fellow  out of sorts " "i won't say he is out of sorts  but i fancy he would like to be heard " "but they heard him at the council of war and will hear him when he talks sense  but to temporize and wait for something now when bonaparte fears nothing so much as a general battle is impossible " "yes  you have seen him " said prince andrew
"well  what is bonaparte like  how did he impress you " "yes  i saw him  and am convinced that he fears nothing so much as a general engagement " repeated dolgorukov  evidently prizing this general conclusion which he had arrived at from his interview with napoleon
"if he weren't afraid of a battle why did he ask for that interview  why negotiate  and above all why retreat  when to retreat is so contrary to his method of conducting war  believe me  he is afraid  afraid of a general battle
his hour has come  mark my words " "but tell me  what is he like  eh " said prince andrew again
"he is a man in a gray overcoat  very anxious that i should call him 'your majesty ' but who  to his chagrin  got no title from me  that's the sort of man he is  and nothing more " replied dolgorukov  looking round at bilibin with a smile
"despite my great respect for old kutuzov " he continued  "we should be a nice set of fellows if we were to wait about and so give him a chance to escape  or to trick us  now that we certainly have him in our hands  no  we mustn't forget suvorov and his rule—not to put yourself in a position to be attacked  but yourself to attack
believe me in war the energy of young men often shows the way better than all the experience of old cunctators " "but in what position are we going to attack him  i have been at the outposts today and it is impossible to say where his chief forces are situated " said prince andrew
he wished to explain to dolgorukov a plan of attack he had himself formed "oh  that is all the same " dolgorukov said quickly  and getting up he spread a map on the table
"all eventualities have been foreseen
if he is standing before brunn   " and prince dolgorukov rapidly but indistinctly explained weyrother's plan of a flanking movement
prince andrew began to reply and to state his own plan  which might have been as good as weyrother's  but for the disadvantage that weyrother's had already been approved
as soon as prince andrew began to demonstrate the defects of the latter and the merits of his own plan  prince dolgorukov ceased to listen to him and gazed absent mindedly not at the map  but at prince andrew's face
"there will be a council of war at kutuzov's tonight  though  you can say all this there " remarked dolgorukov
"i will do so " said prince andrew  moving away from the map
"whatever are you bothering about  gentlemen " said bilibin  who  till then  had listened with an amused smile to their conversation and now was evidently ready with a joke
"whether tomorrow brings victory or defeat  the glory of our russian arms is secure except your kutuzov  there is not a single russian in command of a column  the commanders are  herr general wimpfen  le comte de langeron  le prince de lichtenstein  le prince  de hohenlohe  and finally prishprish  and so on like all those polish names " "be quiet  backbiter " said dolgorukov
"it is not true  there are now two russians  miloradovich  and dokhturov  and there would be a third  count arakcheev  if his nerves were not too weak " "however  i think general kutuzov has come out " said prince andrew
"i wish you good luck and success  gentlemen " he added and went out after shaking hands with dolgorukov and bilibin
on the way home  prince andrew could not refrain from asking kutuzov  who was sitting silently beside him  what he thought of tomorrow's battle
kutuzov looked sternly at his adjutant and  after a pause  replied  "i think the battle will be lost  and so i told count tolstoy and asked him to tell the emperor
what do you think he replied  'but  my dear general  i am engaged with rice and cutlets  look after military matters yourself ' yes  
that was the answer i got " shortly after nine o'clock that evening  weyrother drove with his plans to kutuzov's quarters where the council of war was to be held
all the commanders of columns were summoned to the commander in chief's and with the exception of prince bagration  who declined to come  were all there at the appointed time
weyrother  who was in full control of the proposed battle  by his eagerness and briskness presented a marked contrast to the dissatisfied and drowsy kutuzov  who reluctantly played the part of chairman and president of the council of war
weyrother evidently felt himself to be at the head of a movement that had already become unrestrainable he was like a horse running downhill harnessed to a heavy cart
whether he was pulling it or being pushed by it he did not know  but rushed along at headlong speed with no time to consider what this movement might lead to
weyrother had been twice that evening to the enemy's picket line to reconnoiter personally  and twice to the emperors  russian and austrian  to report and explain  and to his headquarters where he had dictated the dispositions in german  and now  much exhausted  he arrived at kutuzov's
he was evidently so busy that he even forgot to be polite to the commander in chief
he interrupted him  talked rapidly and indistinctly  without looking at the man he was addressing  and did not reply to questions put to him
he was bespattered with mud and had a pitiful  weary  and distracted air  though at the same time he was haughty and self confident
kutuzov was occupying a nobleman's castle of modest dimensions near ostralitz
in the large drawing room which had become the commander in chief's office were gathered kutuzov himself  weyrother  and the members of the council of war they were drinking tea  and only awaited prince bagration to begin the council
at last bagration's orderly came with the news that the prince could not attend
prince andrew came in to inform the commander inchief of this and  availing himself of permission previously given him by kutuzov to be present at the council  he remained in the room "since prince bagration is not coming  we may begin " said weyrother  hurriedly rising from his seat and going up to the table on which an enormous map of the environs of brunn was spread out
kutuzov  with his uniform unbuttoned so that his fat neck bulged over his collar as if escaping  was sitting almost asleep in a low chair  with his podgy old hands resting symmetrically on its arms at the sound of weyrother's voice  he opened his one eye with an effort
"yes  yes  if you please  it is already late " said he  and nodding his head he let it droop and again closed his eye
if at first the members of the council thought that kutuzov was pretending to sleep  the sounds his nose emitted during the reading that followed proved that the commander in chief at that moment was absorbed by a far more serious matter than a desire to show his contempt for the dispositions or anything else —he was engaged in satisfying the irresistible human need for sleep
he really was asleep
weyrother  with the gesture of a man too busy to lose a moment  glanced at kutuzov and  having convinced himself that he was asleep  took up a paper and in a loud  monotonous voice began to read out the dispositions for the impending battle  under a heading which he also read out  "dispositions for an attack on the enemy position behind kobelnitz and sokolnitz  november 30  1805 " the dispositions were very complicated and difficult they began as follows  "as the enemy's left wing rests on wooded hills and his right extends along kobelnitz and sokolnitz behind the ponds that are there  while we  on the other hand  with our left wing by far outflank his right  it is advantageous to attack the enemy's latter wing especially if we occupy the villages of sokolnitz and kobelnitz  whereby we can both fall on his flank and pursue him over the plain between schlappanitz and the thuerassa forest  avoiding the defiles of schlappanitz and bellowitz which cover the enemy's front
for this object it is necessary that  
the first column marches  
the second column marches  
the third column marches   " and so on  read weyrother
the generals seemed to listen reluctantly to the difficult dispositions
the tall  fair haired general buxhowden stood  leaning his back against the wall  his eyes fixed on a burning candle  and seemed not to listen or even to wish to be thought to listen
exactly opposite weyrother  with his glistening wide open eyes fixed upon him and his mustache twisted upwards  sat the ruddy miloradovich in a military pose  his elbows turned outwards  his hands on his knees  and his shoulders raised
he remained stubbornly silent  gazing at weyrother's face  and only turned away his eyes when the austrian chief of staff finished reading
then miloradovich looked round significantly at the other generals
but one could not tell from that significant look whether he agreed or disagreed and was satisfied or not with the arrangements
next to weyrother sat count langeron who  with a subtle smile that never left his typically southern french face during the whole time of the reading  gazed at his delicate fingers which rapidly twirled by its corners a gold snuffbox on which was a portrait
in the middle of one of the longest sentences  he stopped the rotary motion of the snuffbox  raised his head  and with inimical politeness lurking in the corners of his thin lips interrupted weyrother  wishing to say something
but the austrian general  continuing to read  frowned angrily and jerked his elbows  as if to say  "you can tell me your views later  but now be so good as to look at the map and listen " langeron lifted his eyes with an expression of perplexity  turned round to miloradovich as if seeking an explanation  but meeting the latter's impressive but meaningless gaze drooped his eyes sadly and again took to twirling his snuffbox
"a geography lesson " he muttered as if to himself  but loud enough to be heard przebyszewski  with respectful but dignified politeness  held his hand to his ear toward weyrother  with the air of a man absorbed in attention
dohkturov  a little man  sat opposite weyrother  with an assiduous and modest mien  and stooping over the outspread map conscientiously studied the dispositions and the unfamiliar locality
he asked weyrother several times to repeat words he had not clearly heard and the difficult names of villages
weyrother complied and dohkturov noted them down
when the reading which lasted more than an hour was over  langeron again brought his snuffbox to rest and  without looking at weyrother or at anyone in particular  began to say how difficult it was to carry out such a plan in which the enemy's position was assumed to be known  whereas it was perhaps not known  since the enemy was in movement
langeron's objections were valid but it was obvious that their chief aim was to show general weyrother—who had read his dispositions with as much self confidence as if he were addressing school children—that he had to do  not with fools  but with men who could teach him something in military matters
when the monotonous sound of weyrother's voice ceased  kutuzov opened his eye as a miller wakes up when the soporific drone of the mill wheel is interrupted
he listened to what langeron said  as if remarking  "so you are still at that silly business " quickly closed his eye again  and let his head sink still lower
langeron  trying as virulently as possible to sting weyrother's vanity as author of the military plan  argued that bonaparte might easily attack instead of being attacked  and so render the whole of this plan perfectly worthless
weyrother met all objections with a firm and contemptuous smile  evidently prepared beforehand to meet all objections be they what they might
"if he could attack us  he would have done so today " said he
"so you think he is powerless " said langeron
"he has forty thousand men at most " replied weyrother  with the smile of a doctor to whom an old wife wishes to explain the treatment of a case
"in that case he is inviting his doom by awaiting our attack " said langeron  with a subtly ironical smile  again glancing round for support to miloradovich who was near him
but miloradovich was at that moment evidently thinking of anything rather than of what the generals were disputing about
"ma foi " said he  "tomorrow we shall see all that on the battlefield " weyrother again gave that smile which seemed to say that to him it was strange and ridiculous to meet objections from russian generals and to have to prove to them what he had not merely convinced himself of  but had also convinced the sovereign emperors of "the enemy has quenched his fires and a continual noise is heard from his camp " said he
"what does that mean  either he is retreating  which is the only thing we need fear  or he is changing his position "  he smiled ironically   "but even if he also took up a position in the thuerassa  he merely saves us a great deal of trouble and all our arrangements to the minutest detail remain the same " "how is that    " began prince andrew  who had for long been waiting an opportunity to express his doubts
kutuzov here woke up  coughed heavily  and looked round at the generals
"gentlemen  the dispositions for tomorrow—or rather for today  for it is past midnight—cannot now be altered " said he
"you have heard them  and we shall all do our duty
but before a battle  there is nothing more important   " he paused  "than to have a good sleep " he moved as if to rise
the generals bowed and retired
it was past midnight
prince andrew went out
the council of war  at which prince andrew had not been able to express his opinion as he had hoped to  left on him a vague and uneasy impression
whether dolgorukov and weyrother  or kutuzov  langeron  and the others who did not approve of the plan of attack  were right—he did not know
"but was it really not possible for kutuzov to state his views plainly to the emperor  is it possible that on account of court and personal considerations tens of thousands of lives  and my life  my life " he thought  "must be risked " "yes  it is very likely that i shall be killed tomorrow " he thought
and suddenly  at this thought of death  a whole series of most distant  most intimate  memories rose in his imagination  he remembered his last parting from his father and his wife  he remembered the days when he first loved her
he thought of her pregnancy and felt sorry for her and for himself  and in a nervously emotional and softened mood he went out of the hut in which he was billeted with nesvitski and began to walk up and down before it the night was foggy and through the fog the moonlight gleamed mysteriously
"yes  tomorrow  tomorrow " he thought
"tomorrow everything may be over for me  all these memories will be no more  none of them will have any meaning for me
tomorrow perhaps  even certainly  i have a presentiment that for the first time i shall have to show all i can do " and his fancy pictured the battle  its loss  the concentration of fighting at one point  and the hesitation of all the commanders
and then that happy moment  that toulon for which he had so long waited  presents itself to him at last
he firmly and clearly expresses his opinion to kutuzov  to weyrother  and to the emperors
all are struck by the justness of his views  but no one undertakes to carry them out  so he takes a regiment  a division stipulates that no one is to interfere with his arrangements—leads his division to the decisive point  and gains the victory alone
"but death and suffering " suggested another voice
prince andrew  however  did not answer that voice and went on dreaming of his triumphs
the dispositions for the next battle are planned by him alone
nominally he is only an adjutant on kutuzov's staff  but he does everything alone
the next battle is won by him alone
kutuzov is removed and he is appointed  
"well and then " asked the other voice
"if before that you are not ten times wounded  killed  or betrayed  well  
what then    " "well then " prince andrew answered himself  "i don't know what will happen and don't want to know  and can't  but if i want this—want glory  want to be known to men  want to be loved by them  it is not my fault that i want it and want nothing but that and live only for that yes  for that alone  i shall never tell anyone  but  oh god  what am i to do if i love nothing but fame and men's esteem  death  wounds  the loss of family—i fear nothing
and precious and dear as many persons are to me—father  sister  wife —those dearest to me—yet dreadful and unnatural as it seems  i would give them all at once for a moment of glory  of triumph over men  of love from men i don't know and never shall know  for the love of these men here " he thought  as he listened to voices in kutuzov's courtyard the voices were those of the orderlies who were packing up  one voice  probably a coachman's  was teasing kutuzov's old cook whom prince andrew knew  and who was called tit
he was saying  "tit  i say  tit " "well " returned the old man
"go  tit  thresh a bit " said the wag
"oh  go to the devil " called out a voice  drowned by the laughter of the orderlies and servants
"all the same  i love and value nothing but triumph over them all  i value this mystic power and glory that is floating here above me in this mist " that same night  rostov was with a platoon on skirmishing duty in front of bagration's detachment
his hussars were placed along the line in couples and he himself rode along the line trying to master the sleepiness that kept coming over him an enormous space  with our army's campfires dimly glowing in the fog  could be seen behind him  in front of him was misty darkness
rostov could see nothing  peer as he would into that foggy distance  now something gleamed gray  now there was something black  now little lights seemed to glimmer where the enemy ought to be  now he fancied it was only something in his own eyes
his eyes kept closing  and in his fancy appeared—now the emperor  now denisov  and now moscow memories—and he again hurriedly opened his eyes and saw close before him the head and ears of the horse he was riding  and sometimes  when he came within six paces of them  the black figures of hussars  but in the distance was still the same misty darkness
"why not   
it might easily happen " thought rostov  "that the emperor will meet me and give me an order as he would to any other officer  he'll say  'go and find out what's there ' there are many stories of his getting to know an officer in just such a chance way and attaching him to himself  what if he gave me a place near him  oh  how i would guard him  how i would tell him the truth  how i would unmask his deceivers " and in order to realize vividly his love devotion to the sovereign  rostov pictured to himself an enemy or a deceitful german  whom he would not only kill with pleasure but whom he would slap in the face before the emperor suddenly a distant shout aroused him
he started and opened his eyes
"where am i  oh yes  in the skirmishing line  
pass and watchword—shaft  olmutz
what a nuisance that our squadron will be in reserve tomorrow " he thought
"i'll ask leave to go to the front  this may be my only chance of seeing the emperor
it won't be long now before i am off duty
i'll take another turn and when i get back i'll go to the general and ask him " he readjusted himself in the saddle and touched up his horse to ride once more round his hussars it seemed to him that it was getting lighter
to the left he saw a sloping descent lit up  and facing it a black knoll that seemed as steep as a wall
on this knoll there was a white patch that rostov could not at all make out  was it a glade in the wood lit up by the moon  or some unmelted snow  or some white houses  he even thought something moved on that white spot
"i expect it's snow  
that spot  
a spot—une tache " he thought
"there now  
it's not a tache  
natasha  
sister  black eyes  
na  
tasha  
 won't she be surprised when i tell her how i've seen the emperor   natasha  
take my sabretache   "—"keep to the right  your honor  there are bushes here " came the voice of an hussar  past whom rostov was riding in the act of falling asleep
rostov lifted his head that had sunk almost to his horse's mane and pulled up beside the hussar
he was succumbing to irresistible  youthful  childish drowsiness
"but what was i thinking  i mustn't forget
how shall i speak to the emperor  no  that's not it —that's tomorrow
oh yes  natasha  
sabretache  
saber them  
whom  the hussars  
ah  the hussars with mustaches
along the tverskaya street rode the hussar with mustaches  
i thought about him too  just opposite guryev's house  
old guryev   
oh  but denisov's a fine fellow
but that's all nonsense
the chief thing is that the emperor is here
how he looked at me and wished to say something  but dared not   
no  it was i who dared not
but that's nonsense  the chief thing is not to forget the important thing i was thinking of
yes  na tasha  sabretache  oh  yes  yes  that's right " and his head once more sank to his horse's neck
all at once it seemed to him that he was being fired at
"what  what  what   
cut them down  what    " said rostov  waking up
at the moment he opened his eyes he heard in front of him  where the enemy was  the long drawn shouts of thousands of voices
his horse and the horse of the hussar near him pricked their ears at these shouts
over there  where the shouting came from  a fire flared up and went out again  then another  and all along the french line on the hill fires flared up and the shouting grew louder and louder
rostov could hear the sound of french words but could not distinguish them
the din of many voices was too great  all he could hear was  "ahahah " and "rrrr " "what's that  what do you make of it " said rostov to the hussar beside him
"that must be the enemy's camp " the hussar did not reply
"why  don't you hear it " rostov asked again  after waiting for a reply
"who can tell  your honor " replied the hussar reluctantly
"from the direction  it must be the enemy " repeated rostov
"it may be he or it may be nothing " muttered the hussar
"it's dark  
steady " he cried to his fidgeting horse
rostov's horse was also getting restive  it pawed the frozen ground  pricking its ears at the noise and looking at the lights
the shouting grew still louder and merged into a general roar that only an army of several thousand men could produce
the lights spread farther and farther  probably along the line of the french camp
rostov no longer wanted to sleep
the gay triumphant shouting of the enemy army had a stimulating effect on him
"vive l'empereur  l'empereur " he now heard distinctly
"they can't be far off  probably just beyond the stream " he said to the hussar beside him
the hussar only sighed without replying and coughed angrily
the sound of horse's hoofs approaching at a trot along the line of hussars was heard  and out of the foggy darkness the figure of a sergeant of hussars suddenly appeared  looming huge as an elephant
"your honor  the generals " said the sergeant  riding up to rostov
rostov  still looking round toward the fires and the shouts  rode with the sergeant to meet some mounted men who were riding along the line
one was on a white horse
prince bagration and prince dolgorukov with their adjutants had come to witness the curious phenomenon of the lights and shouts in the enemy's camp
rostov rode up to bagration  reported to him  and then joined the adjutants listening to what the generals were saying
"believe me " said prince dolgorukov  addressing bagration  "it is nothing but a trick  he has retreated and ordered the rearguard to kindle fires and make a noise to deceive us " "hardly " said bagration
"i saw them this evening on that knoll  if they had retreated they would have withdrawn from that too   
officer " said bagration to rostov  "are the enemy's skirmishers still there " "they were there this evening  but now i don't know  your excellency
shall i go with some of my hussars to see " replied rostov
bagration stopped and  before replying  tried to see rostov's face in the mist
"well  go and see " he said  after a pause
"yes  sir " rostov spurred his horse  called to sergeant fedchenko and two other hussars  told them to follow him  and trotted downhill in the direction from which the shouting came
he felt both frightened and pleased to be riding alone with three hussars into that mysterious and dangerous misty distance where no one had been before him
bagration called to him from the hill not to go beyond the stream  but rostov pretended not to hear him and did not stop but rode on and on  continually mistaking bushes for trees and gullies for men and continually discovering his mistakes
having descended the hill at a trot  he no longer saw either our own or the enemy's fires  but heard the shouting of the french more loudly and distinctly
in the valley he saw before him something like a river  but when he reached it he found it was a road
having come out onto the road he reined in his horse  hesitating whether to ride along it or cross it and ride over the black field up the hillside
to keep to the road which gleamed white in the mist would have been safer because it would be easier to see people coming along it
"follow me " said he  crossed the road  and began riding up the hill at a gallop toward the point where the french pickets had been standing that evening
"your honor  there he is " cried one of the hussars behind him
and before rostov had time to make out what the black thing was that had suddenly appeared in the fog  there was a flash  followed by a report  and a bullet whizzing high up in the mist with a plaintive sound passed out of hearing
another musket missed fire but flashed in the pan
rostov turned his horse and galloped back
four more reports followed at intervals  and the bullets passed somewhere in the fog singing in different tones
rostov reined in his horse  whose spirits had risen  like his own  at the firing  and went back at a footpace
"well  some more  some more " a merry voice was saying in his soul
but no more shots came
only when approaching bagration did rostov let his horse gallop again  and with his hand at the salute rode up to the general
dolgorukov was still insisting that the french had retreated and had only lit fires to deceive us
"what does that prove " he was saying as rostov rode up
"they might retreat and leave the pickets " "it's plain that they have not all gone yet  prince " said bagration
"wait till tomorrow morning  we'll find out everything tomorrow " "the picket is still on the hill  your excellency  just where it was in the evening " reported rostov  stooping forward with his hand at the salute and unable to repress the smile of delight induced by his ride and especially by the sound of the bullets
"very good  very good " said bagration
"thank you  officer " "your excellency " said rostov  "may i ask a favor " "what is it " "tomorrow our squadron is to be in reserve
may i ask to be attached to the first squadron " "what's your name " "count rostov " "oh  very well  you may stay in attendance on me " "count ilya rostov's son " asked dolgorukov
but rostov did not reply
"then i may reckon on it  your excellency " "i will give the order " "tomorrow very likely i may be sent with some message to the emperor " thought rostov
"thank god " the fires and shouting in the enemy's army were occasioned by the fact that while napoleon's proclamation was being read to the troops the emperor himself rode round his bivouacs the soldiers  on seeing him  lit wisps of straw and ran after him  shouting  "vive l'empereur " napoleon's proclamation was as follows  soldiers  the russian army is advancing against you to avenge the austrian army of ulm
they are the same battalions you broke at hollabrunn and have pursued ever since to this place
the position we occupy is a strong one  and while they are marching to go round me on the right they will expose a flank to me
soldiers  i will myself direct your battalions
i will keep out of fire if you with your habitual valor carry disorder and confusion into the enemy's ranks  but should victory be in doubt  even for a moment  you will see your emperor exposing himself to the first blows of the enemy  for there must be no doubt of victory  especially on this day when what is at stake is the honor of the french infantry  so necessary to the honor of our nation do not break your ranks on the plea of removing the wounded  let every man be fully imbued with the thought that we must defeat these hirelings of england  inspired by such hatred of our nation  this victory will conclude our campaign and we can return to winter quarters  where fresh french troops who are being raised in france will join us  and the peace i shall conclude will be worthy of my people  of you  and of myself
napoleon at five in the morning it was still quite dark
the troops of the center  the reserves  and bagration's right flank had not yet moved  but on the left flank the columns of infantry  cavalry  and artillery  which were to be the first to descend the heights to attack the french right flank and drive it into the bohemian mountains according to plan  were already up and astir
the smoke of the campfires  into which they were throwing everything superfluous  made the eyes smart
it was cold and dark
the officers were hurriedly drinking tea and breakfasting  the soldiers  munching biscuit and beating a tattoo with their feet to warm themselves  gathering round the fires throwing into the flames the remains of sheds  chairs  tables  wheels  tubs  and everything that they did not want or could not carry away with them austrian column guides were moving in and out among the russian troops and served as heralds of the advance
as soon as an austrian officer showed himself near a commanding officer's quarters  the regiment began to move  the soldiers ran from the fires  thrust their pipes into their boots  their bags into the carts  got their muskets ready  and formed rank the officers buttoned up their coats  buckled on their swords and pouches  and moved along the ranks shouting
the train drivers and orderlies harnessed and packed the wagons and tied on the loads
the adjutants and battalion and regimental commanders mounted  crossed themselves  gave final instructions  orders  and commissions to the baggage men who remained behind  and the monotonous tramp of thousands of feet resounded the column moved forward without knowing where and unable  from the masses around them  the smoke and the increasing fog  to see either the place they were leaving or that to which they were going
a soldier on the march is hemmed in and borne along by his regiment as much as a sailor is by his ship
however far he has walked  whatever strange  unknown  and dangerous places he reaches  just as a sailor is always surrounded by the same decks  masts  and rigging of his ship  so the soldier always has around him the same comrades  the same ranks  the same sergeant major ivan mitrich  the same company dog jack  and the same commanders the sailor rarely cares to know the latitude in which his ship is sailing  but on the day of battle—heaven knows how and whence—a stern note of which all are conscious sounds in the moral atmosphere of an army  announcing the approach of something decisive and solemn  and awakening in the men an unusual curiosity
on the day of battle the soldiers excitedly try to get beyond the interests of their regiment  they listen intently  look about  and eagerly ask concerning what is going on around them
the fog had grown so dense that though it was growing light they could not see ten paces ahead
bushes looked like gigantic trees and level ground like cliffs and slopes
anywhere  on any side  one might encounter an enemy invisible ten paces off
but the columns advanced for a long time  always in the same fog  descending and ascending hills  avoiding gardens and enclosures  going over new and unknown ground  and nowhere encountering the enemy
on the contrary  the soldiers became aware that in front  behind  and on all sides  other russian columns were moving in the same direction
every soldier felt glad to know that to the unknown place where he was going  many more of our men were going too
"there now  the kurskies have also gone past " was being said in the ranks
"it's wonderful what a lot of our troops have gathered  lads  last night i looked at the campfires and there was no end of them
a regular moscow " though none of the column commanders rode up to the ranks or talked to the men  the commanders  as we saw at the council of war  were out of humor and dissatisfied with the affair  and so did not exert themselves to cheer the men but merely carried out the orders   yet the troops marched gaily  as they always do when going into action  especially to an attack but when they had marched for about an hour in the dense fog  the greater part of the men had to halt and an unpleasant consciousness of some dislocation and blunder spread through the ranks
how such a consciousness is communicated is very difficult to define  but it certainly is communicated very surely  and flows rapidly  imperceptibly  and irrepressibly  as water does in a creek
had the russian army been alone without any allies  it might perhaps have been a long time before this consciousness of mismanagement became a general conviction  but as it was  the disorder was readily and naturally attributed to the stupid germans  and everyone was convinced that a dangerous muddle had been occasioned by the sausage eaters
"why have we stopped  is the way blocked  or have we already come up against the french " "no  one can't hear them
they'd be firing if we had " "they were in a hurry enough to start us  and now here we stand in the middle of a field without rhyme or reason
it's all those damned germans' muddling  what stupid devils " "yes  i'd send them on in front  but no fear  they're crowding up behind
and now here we stand hungry " "i say  shall we soon be clear  they say the cavalry are blocking the way " said an officer
"ah  those damned germans  they don't know their own country " said another
"what division are you " shouted an adjutant  riding up
"the eighteenth " "then why are you here  you should have gone on long ago  now you won't get there till evening " "what stupid orders  they don't themselves know what they are doing " said the officer and rode off then a general rode past shouting something angrily  not in russian
"tafa lafa  but what he's jabbering no one can make out " said a soldier  mimicking the general who had ridden away
"i'd shoot them  the scoundrels " "we were ordered to be at the place before nine  but we haven't got halfway
fine orders " was being repeated on different sides
and the feeling of energy with which the troops had started began to turn into vexation and anger at the stupid arrangements and at the germans
the cause of the confusion was that while the austrian cavalry was moving toward our left flank  the higher command found that our center was too far separated from our right flank and the cavalry were all ordered to turn back to the right
several thousand cavalry crossed in front of the infantry  who had to wait
at the front an altercation occurred between an austrian guide and a russian general
the general shouted a demand that the cavalry should be halted  the austrian argued that not he  but the higher command  was to blame
the troops meanwhile stood growing listless and dispirited
after an hour's delay they at last moved on  descending the hill
the fog that was dispersing on the hill lay still more densely below  where they were descending
in front in the fog a shot was heard and then another  at first irregularly at varying intervals —trata  
tat—and then more and more regularly and rapidly  and the action at the goldbach stream began
not expecting to come on the enemy down by the stream  and having stumbled on him in the fog  hearing no encouraging word from their commanders  and with a consciousness of being too late spreading through the ranks  and above all being unable to see anything in front or around them in the thick fog  the russians exchanged shots with the enemy lazily and advanced and again halted  receiving no timely orders from the officers or adjutants who wandered about in the fog in those unknown surroundings unable to find their own regiments
in this way the action began for the first  second  and third columns  which had gone down into the valley
the fourth column  with which kutuzov was  stood on the pratzen heights
below  where the fight was beginning  there was still thick fog  on the higher ground it was clearing  but nothing could be seen of what was going on in front
whether all the enemy forces were  as we supposed  six miles away  or whether they were near by in that sea of mist  no one knew till after eight o'clock
it was nine o'clock in the morning
the fog lay unbroken like a sea down below  but higher up at the village of schlappanitz where napoleon stood with his marshals around him  it was quite light
above him was a clear blue sky  and the sun's vast orb quivered like a huge hollow  crimson float on the surface of that milky sea of mist the whole french army  and even napoleon himself with his staff  were not on the far side of the streams and hollows of sokolnitz and schlappanitz beyond which we intended to take up our position and begin the action  but were on this side  so close to our own forces that napoleon with the naked eye could distinguish a mounted man from one on foot napoleon  in the blue cloak which he had worn on his italian campaign  sat on his small gray arab horse a little in front of his marshals
he gazed silently at the hills which seemed to rise out of the sea of mist and on which the russian troops were moving in the distance  and he listened to the sounds of firing in the valley
not a single muscle of his face—which in those days was still thin— moved
his gleaming eyes were fixed intently on one spot
his predictions were being justified
part of the russian force had already descended into the valley toward the ponds and lakes and part were leaving these pratzen heights which he intended to attack and regarded as the key to the position
he saw over the mist that in a hollow between two hills near the village of pratzen  the russian columns  their bayonets glittering  were moving continuously in one direction toward the valley and disappearing one after another into the mist
from information he had received the evening before  from the sound of wheels and footsteps heard by the outposts during the night  by the disorderly movement of the russian columns  and from all indications  he saw clearly that the allies believed him to be far away in front of them  and that the columns moving near pratzen constituted the center of the russian army  and that that center was already sufficiently weakened to be successfully attacked
but still he did not begin the engagement
today was a great day for him—the anniversary of his coronation
before dawn he had slept for a few hours  and refreshed  vigorous  and in good spirits  he mounted his horse and rode out into the field in that happy mood in which everything seems possible and everything succeeds he sat motionless  looking at the heights visible above the mist  and his cold face wore that special look of confident  self complacent happiness that one sees on the face of a boy happily in love
the marshals stood behind him not venturing to distract his attention
he looked now at the pratzen heights  now at the sun floating up out of the mist
when the sun had entirely emerged from the fog  and fields and mist were aglow with dazzling light—as if he had only awaited this to begin the action— he drew the glove from his shapely white hand  made a sign with it to the marshals  and ordered the action to begin
the marshals  accompanied by adjutants  galloped off in different directions  and a few minutes later the chief forces of the french army moved rapidly toward those pratzen heights which were being more and more denuded by russian troops moving down the valley to their left
at eight o'clock kutuzov rode to pratzen at the head of the fourth column  miloradovich's  the one that was to take the place of przebyszewski's and langeron's columns which had already gone down into the valley
he greeted the men of the foremost regiment and gave them the order to march  thereby indicating that he intended to lead that column himself when he had reached the village of pratzen he halted
prince andrew was behind  among the immense number forming the commander in chief's suite
he was in a state of suppressed excitement and irritation  though controlledly calm as a man is at the approach of a long awaited moment
he was firmly convinced that this was the day of his toulon  or his bridge of arcola
how it would come about he did not know  but he felt sure it would do so
the locality and the position of our troops were known to him as far as they could be known to anyone in our army
his own strategic plan  which obviously could not now be carried out  was forgotten
now  entering into weyrother's plan  prince andrew considered possible contingencies and formed new projects such as might call for his rapidity of perception and decision
to the left down below in the mist  the musketry fire of unseen forces could be heard
it was there prince andrew thought the fight would concentrate
"there we shall encounter difficulties  and there " thought he  "i shall be sent with a brigade or division  and there  standard in hand  i shall go forward and break whatever is in front of me " he could not look calmly at the standards of the passing battalions
seeing them he kept thinking  "that may be the very standard with which i shall lead the army " in the morning all that was left of the night mist on the heights was a hoar frost now turning to dew  but in the valleys it still lay like a milk white sea
nothing was visible in the valley to the left into which our troops had descended and from whence came the sounds of firing
above the heights was the dark clear sky  and to the right the vast orb of the sun
in front  far off on the farther shore of that sea of mist  some wooded hills were discernible  and it was there the enemy probably was  for something could be descried
on the right the guards were entering the misty region with a sound of hoofs and wheels and now and then a gleam of bayonets  to the left beyond the village similar masses of cavalry came up and disappeared in the sea of mist
in front and behind moved infantry
the commander in chief was standing at the end of the village letting the troops pass by him
that morning kutuzov seemed worn and irritable
the infantry passing before him came to a halt without any command being given  apparently obstructed by something in front
"do order them to form into battalion columns and go round the village " he said angrily to a general who had ridden up
"don't you understand  your excellency  my dear sir  that you must not defile through narrow village streets when we are marching against the enemy " "i intended to re form them beyond the village  your excellency " answered the general
kutuzov laughed bitterly
"you'll make a fine thing of it  deploying in sight of the enemy  very fine " "the enemy is still far away  your excellency
according to the dispositions   " "the dispositions " exclaimed kutuzov bitterly
"who told you that   
kindly do as you are ordered " "yes  sir " "my dear fellow " nesvitski whispered to prince andrew  "the old man is as surly as a dog " an austrian officer in a white uniform with green plumes in his hat galloped up to kutuzov and asked in the emperor's name had the fourth column advanced into action
kutuzov turned round without answering and his eye happened to fall upon prince andrew  who was beside him
seeing him  kutuzov's malevolent and caustic expression softened  as if admitting that what was being done was not his adjutant's fault  and still not answering the austrian adjutant  he addressed bolkonski
"go  my dear fellow  and see whether the third division has passed the village
tell it to stop and await my orders " hardly had prince andrew started than he stopped him
"and ask whether sharpshooters have been posted " he added
"what are they doing  what are they doing " he murmured to himself  still not replying to the austrian prince andrew galloped off to execute the order
overtaking the battalions that continued to advance  he stopped the third division and convinced himself that there really were no sharpshooters in front of our columns the colonel at the head of the regiment was much surprised at the commander in chief's order to throw out skirmishers
he had felt perfectly sure that there were other troops in front of him and that the enemy must be at least six miles away
there was really nothing to be seen in front except a barren descent hidden by dense mist
having given orders in the commanderin chief's name to rectify this omission  prince andrew galloped back
kutuzov still in the same place  his stout body resting heavily in the saddle with the lassitude of age  sat yawning wearily with closed eyes
the troops were no longer moving  but stood with the butts of their muskets on the ground
"all right  all right " he said to prince andrew  and turned to a general who  watch in hand  was saying it was time they started as all the left flank columns had already descended
"plenty of time  your excellency " muttered kutuzov in the midst of a yawn
"plenty of time " he repeated
just then at a distance behind kutuzov was heard the sound of regiments saluting  and this sound rapidly came nearer along the whole extended line of the advancing russian columns
evidently the person they were greeting was riding quickly
when the soldiers of the regiment in front of which kutuzov was standing began to shout  he rode a little to one side and looked round with a frown
along the road from pratzen galloped what looked like a squadron of horsemen in various uniforms two of them rode side by side in front  at full gallop
one in a black uniform with white plumes in his hat rode a bobtailed chestnut horse  the other who was in a white uniform rode a black one
these were the two emperors followed by their suites
kutuzov  affecting the manners of an old soldier at the front  gave the command "attention " and rode up to the emperors with a salute
his whole appearance and manner were suddenly transformed
he put on the air of a subordinate who obeys without reasoning
with an affectation of respect which evidently struck alexander unpleasantly  he rode up and saluted
this unpleasant impression merely flitted over the young and happy face of the emperor like a cloud of haze across a clear sky and vanished
after his illness he looked rather thinner that day than on the field of olmutz where bolkonski had seen him for the first time abroad  but there was still the same bewitching combination of majesty and mildness in his fine gray eyes  and on his delicate lips the same capacity for varying expression and the same prevalent appearance of goodhearted innocent youth
at the olmutz review he had seemed more majestic  here he seemed brighter and more energetic
he was slightly flushed after galloping two miles  and reining in his horse he sighed restfully and looked round at the faces of his suite  young and animated as his own
czartoryski  novosiltsev  prince volkonsky  strogonov  and the others  all richly dressed gay young men on splendid  well groomed  fresh  only slightly heated horses  exchanging remarks and smiling  had stopped behind the emperor
the emperor francis  a rosy  long faced young man  sat very erect on his handsome black horse  looking about him in a leisurely and preoccupied manner
he beckoned to one of his white adjutants and asked some question—"most likely he is asking at what o'clock they started " thought prince andrew  watching his old acquaintance with a smile he could not repress as he recalled his reception at brunn
in the emperors' suite were the picked young orderly officers of the guard and line regiments  russian and austrian
among them were grooms leading the tsar's beautiful relay horses covered with embroidered cloths as when a window is opened a whiff of fresh air from the fields enters a stuffy room  so a whiff of youthfulness  energy  and confidence of success reached kutuzov's cheerless staff with the galloping advent of all these brilliant young men
"why aren't you beginning  michael ilarionovich " said the emperor alexander hurriedly to kutuzov  glancing courteously at the same time at the emperor francis
"i am waiting  your majesty " answered kutuzov  bending forward respectfully
the emperor  frowning slightly  bent his ear forward as if he had not quite heard
"waiting  your majesty " repeated kutuzov
 prince andrew noted that kutuzov's upper lip twitched unnaturally as he said the word "waiting "  "not all the columns have formed up yet  your majesty " the tsar heard but obviously did not like the reply  he shrugged his rather round shoulders and glanced at novosiltsev who was near him  as if complaining of kutuzov
"you know  michael ilarionovich  we are not on the empress' field where a parade does not begin till all the troops are assembled " said the tsar with another glance at the emperor francis  as if inviting him if not to join in at least to listen to what he was saying
but the emperor francis continued to look about him and did not listen
"that is just why i do not begin  sire " said kutuzov in a resounding voice  apparently to preclude the possibility of not being heard  and again something in his face twitched—"that is just why i do not begin  sire  because we are not on parade and not on the empress' field " said clearly and distinctly
in the emperor's suite all exchanged rapid looks that expressed dissatisfaction and reproach
"old though he may be  he should not  he certainly should not  speak like that " their glances seemed to say
the tsar looked intently and observantly into kutuzov's eye waiting to hear whether he would say anything more
but kutuzov  with respectfully bowed head  seemed also to be waiting
the silence lasted for about a minute
"however  if you command it  your majesty " said kutuzov  lifting his head and again assuming his former tone of a dull  unreasoning  but submissive general
he touched his horse and having called miloradovich  the commander of the column  gave him the order to advance
the troops again began to move  and two battalions of the novgorod and one of the apsheron regiment went forward past the emperor
as this apsheron battalion marched by  the red faced miloradovich  without his greatcoat  with his orders on his breast and an enormous tuft of plumes in his cocked hat worn on one side with its corners front and back  galloped strenuously forward  and with a dashing salute reined in his horse before the emperor
"god be with you  general " said the emperor
"ma foi  sire  nous ferons ce qui sera dans notre possibilite  sire " * he answered gaily  raising nevertheless ironic smiles among the gentlemen of the tsar's suite by his poor french
* "indeed  sire  we shall do everything it is possible to do  sire " miloradovich wheeled his horse sharply and stationed himself a little behind the emperor the apsheron men  excited by the tsar's presence  passed in step before the emperors and their suites at a bold  brisk pace
"lads " shouted miloradovich in a loud  self confident  and cheery voice  obviously so elated by the sound of firing  by the prospect of battle  and by the sight of the gallant apsherons  his comrades in suvorov's time  now passing so gallantly before the emperors  that he forgot the sovereigns' presence "lads  it's not the first village you've had to take " cried he
"glad to do our best " shouted the soldiers
the emperor's horse started at the sudden cry
this horse that had carried the sovereign at reviews in russia bore him also here on the field of austerlitz  enduring the heedless blows of his left foot and pricking its ears at the sound of shots just as it had done on the empress' field  not understanding the significance of the firing  nor of the nearness of the emperor francis' black cob  nor of all that was being said  thought  and felt that day by its rider
the emperor turned with a smile to one of his followers and made a remark to him  pointing to the gallant apsherons
kutuzov accompanied by his adjutants rode at a walking pace behind the carabineers
when he had gone less than half a mile in the rear of the column he stopped at a solitary  deserted house that had probably once been an inn  where two roads parted
both of them led downhill and troops were marching along both
the fog had begun to clear and enemy troops were already dimly visible about a mile and a half off on the opposite heights
down below  on the left  the firing became more distinct
kutuzov had stopped and was speaking to an austrian general
prince andrew  who was a little behind looking at them  turned to an adjutant to ask him for a field glass
"look  look " said this adjutant  looking not at the troops in the distance  but down the hill before him
"it's the french " the two generals and the adjutant took hold of the field glass  trying to snatch it from one another
the expression on all their faces suddenly changed to one of horror
the french were supposed to be a mile and a half away  but had suddenly and unexpectedly appeared just in front of us
"it's the enemy   
no   
yes  see it is   
for certain   
but how is that " said different voices
with the naked eye prince andrew saw below them to the right  not more than five hundred paces from where kutuzov was standing  a dense french column coming up to meet the apsherons
"here it is  the decisive moment has arrived
my turn has come " thought prince andrew  and striking his horse he rode up to kutuzov
"the apsherons must be stopped  your excellency " cried he
but at that very instant a cloud of smoke spread all round  firing was heard quite close at hand  and a voice of naive terror barely two steps from prince andrew shouted  "brothers  all's lost " and at this as if at a command  everyone began to run
confused and ever increasing crowds were running back to where five minutes before the troops had passed the emperors
not only would it have been difficult to stop that crowd  it was even impossible not to be carried back with it oneself
bolkonski only tried not to lose touch with it  and looked around bewildered and unable to grasp what was happening in front of him
nesvitski with an angry face  red and unlike himself  was shouting to kutuzov that if he did not ride away at once he would certainly be taken prisoner kutuzov remained in the same place and without answering drew out a handkerchief
blood was flowing from his cheek
prince andrew forced his way to him
"you are wounded " he asked  hardly able to master the trembling of his lower jaw
"the wound is not here  it is there " said kutuzov  pressing the handkerchief to his wounded cheek and pointing to the fleeing soldiers
"stop them " he shouted  and at the same moment  probably realizing that it was impossible to stop them  spurred his horse and rode to the right
a fresh wave of the flying mob caught him and bore him back with it
the troops were running in such a dense mass that once surrounded by them it was difficult to get out again
one was shouting  "get on  why are you hindering us " another in the same place turned round and fired in the air  a third was striking the horse kutuzov himself rode having by a great effort got away to the left from that flood of men  kutuzov  with his suite diminished by more than half  rode toward a sound of artillery fire near by
having forced his way out of the crowd of fugitives  prince andrew  trying to keep near kutuzov  saw on the slope of the hill amid the smoke a russian battery that was still firing and frenchmen running toward it
higher up stood some russian infantry  neither moving forward to protect the battery nor backward with the fleeing crowd
a mounted general separated himself from the infantry and approached kutuzov of kutuzov's suite only four remained
they were all pale and exchanged looks in silence
"stop those wretches " gasped kutuzov to the regimental commander  pointing to the flying soldiers  but at that instant  as if to punish him for those words  bullets flew hissing across the regiment and across kutuzov's suite like a flock of little birds the french had attacked the battery and  seeing kutuzov  were firing at him
after this volley the regimental commander clutched at his leg  several soldiers fell  and a second lieutenant who was holding the flag let it fall from his hands
it swayed and fell  but caught on the muskets of the nearest soldiers
the soldiers started firing without orders
"oh  oh  oh " groaned kutuzov despairingly and looked around   
"bolkonski " he whispered  his voice trembling from a consciousness of the feebleness of age  "bolkonski " he whispered  pointing to the disordered battalion and at the enemy  "what's that " but before he had finished speaking  prince andrew  feeling tears of shame and anger choking him  had already leapt from his horse and run to the standard
"forward  lads " he shouted in a voice piercing as a child's
"here it is " thought he  seizing the staff of the standard and hearing with pleasure the whistle of bullets evidently aimed at him
several soldiers fell
"hurrah " shouted prince andrew  and  scarcely able to hold up the heavy standard  he ran forward with full confidence that the whole battalion would follow him
and really he only ran a few steps alone
one soldier moved and then another and soon the whole battalion ran forward shouting "hurrah " and overtook him
a sergeant of the battalion ran up and took the flag that was swaying from its weight in prince andrew's hands  but he was immediately killed
prince andrew again seized the standard and  dragging it by the staff  ran on with the battalion
in front he saw our artillerymen  some of whom were fighting  while others  having abandoned their guns  were running toward him
he also saw french infantry soldiers who were seizing the artillery horses and turning the guns round
prince andrew and the battalion were already within twenty paces of the cannon
he heard the whistle of bullets above him unceasingly and to right and left of him soldiers continually groaned and dropped
but he did not look at them  he looked only at what was going on in front of him—at the battery
he now saw clearly the figure of a red haired gunner with his shako knocked awry  pulling one end of a mop while a french soldier tugged at the other
he could distinctly see the distraught yet angry expression on the faces of these two men  who evidently did not realize what they were doing
"what are they about " thought prince andrew as he gazed at them
"why doesn't the red haired gunner run away as he is unarmed  why doesn't the frenchman stab him  he will not get away before the frenchman remembers his bayonet and stabs him    " and really another french soldier  trailing his musket  ran up to the struggling men  and the fate of the red haired gunner  who had triumphantly secured the mop and still did not realize what awaited him  was about to be decided
but prince andrew did not see how it ended
it seemed to him as though one of the soldiers near him hit him on the head with the full swing of a bludgeon
it hurt a little  but the worst of it was that the pain distracted him and prevented his seeing what he had been looking at
"what's this  am i falling  my legs are giving way " thought he  and fell on his back
he opened his eyes  hoping to see how the struggle of the frenchmen with the gunners ended  whether the red haired gunner had been killed or not and whether the cannon had been captured or saved
but he saw nothing
above him there was now nothing but the sky—the lofty sky  not clear yet still immeasurably lofty  with gray clouds gliding slowly across it
"how quiet  peaceful  and solemn  not at all as i ran " thought prince andrew—"not as we ran  shouting and fighting  not at all as the gunner and the frenchman with frightened and angry faces struggled for the mop  how differently do those clouds glide across that lofty infinite sky  how was it i did not see that lofty sky before  and how happy i am to have found it at last  yes  all is vanity  all falsehood  except that infinite sky
there is nothing  nothing  but that
but even it does not exist  there is nothing but quiet and peace
thank god    " on our right flank commanded by bagration  at nine o'clock the battle had not yet begun
not wishing to agree to dolgorukov's demand to commence the action  and wishing to avert responsibility from himself  prince bagration proposed to dolgorukov to send to inquire of the commander in chief bagration knew that as the distance between the two flanks was more than six miles  even if the messenger were not killed  which he very likely would be   and found the commander in chief  which would be very difficult   he would not be able to get back before evening
bagration cast his large  expressionless  sleepy eyes round his suite  and the boyish face rostov  breathless with excitement and hope  was the first to catch his eye
he sent him
"and if i should meet his majesty before i meet the commander in chief  your excellency " said rostov  with his hand to his cap
"you can give the message to his majesty " said dolgorukov  hurriedly interrupting bagration
on being relieved from picket duty rostov had managed to get a few hours' sleep before morning and felt cheerful  bold  and resolute  with elasticity of movement  faith in his good fortune  and generally in that state of mind which makes everything seem possible  pleasant  and easy
all his wishes were being fulfilled that morning  there was to be a general engagement in which he was taking part  more than that  he was orderly to the bravest general  and still more  he was going with a message to kutuzov  perhaps even to the sovereign himself the morning was bright  he had a good horse under him  and his heart was full of joy and happiness
on receiving the order he gave his horse the rein and galloped along the line
at first he rode along the line of bagration's troops  which had not yet advanced into action but were standing motionless  then he came to the region occupied by uvarov's cavalry and here he noticed a stir and signs of preparation for battle  having passed uvarov's cavalry he clearly heard the sound of cannon and musketry ahead of him
the firing grew louder and louder
in the fresh morning air were now heard  not two or three musket shots at irregular intervals as before  followed by one or two cannon shots  but a roll of volleys of musketry from the slopes of the hill before pratzen  interrupted by such frequent reports of cannon that sometimes several of them were not separated from one another but merged into a general roar
he could see puffs of musketry smoke that seemed to chase one another down the hillsides  and clouds of cannon smoke rolling  spreading  and mingling with one another
he could also  by the gleam of bayonets visible through the smoke  make out moving masses of infantry and narrow lines of artillery with green caissons
rostov stopped his horse for a moment on a hillock to see what was going on  but strain his attention as he would he could not understand or make out anything of what was happening  there in the smoke men of some sort were moving about  in front and behind moved lines of troops  but why  whither  and who they were  it was impossible to make out
these sights and sounds had no depressing or intimidating effect on him  on the contrary  they stimulated his energy and determination
"go on  go on  give it them " he mentally exclaimed at these sounds  and again proceeded to gallop along the line  penetrating farther and farther into the region where the army was already in action
"how it will be there i don't know  but all will be well " thought rostov
after passing some austrian troops he noticed that the next part of the line  the guards  was already in action
"so much the better  i shall see it close " he thought
he was riding almost along the front line
a handful of men came galloping toward him
they were our uhlans who with disordered ranks were returning from the attack
rostov got out of their way  involuntarily noticed that one of them was bleeding  and galloped on
"that is no business of mine " he thought
he had not ridden many hundred yards after that before he saw to his left  across the whole width of the field  an enormous mass of cavalry in brilliant white uniforms  mounted on black horses  trotting straight toward him and across his path rostov put his horse to full gallop to get out of the way of these men  and he would have got clear had they continued at the same speed  but they kept increasing their pace  so that some of the horses were already galloping
rostov heard the thud of their hoofs and the jingle of their weapons and saw their horses  their figures  and even their faces  more and more distinctly
they were our horse guards  advancing to attack the french cavalry that was coming to meet them
the horse guards were galloping  but still holding in their horses
rostov could already see their faces and heard the command  "charge " shouted by an officer who was urging his thoroughbred to full speed
rostov  fearing to be crushed or swept into the attack on the french  galloped along the front as hard as his horse could go  but still was not in time to avoid them
the last of the horse guards  a huge pockmarked fellow  frowned angrily on seeing rostov before him  with whom he would inevitably collide
this guardsman would certainly have bowled rostov and his bedouin over  rostov felt himself quite tiny and weak compared to these gigantic men and horses  had it not occurred to rostov to flourish his whip before the eyes of the guardsman's horse the heavy black horse  sixteen hands high  shied  throwing back its ears  but the pockmarked guardsman drove his huge spurs in violently  and the horse  flourishing its tail and extending its neck  galloped on yet faster
hardly had the horse guards passed rostov before he heard them shout  "hurrah " and looking back saw that their foremost ranks were mixed up with some foreign cavalry with red epaulets  probably french
he could see nothing more  for immediately afterwards cannon began firing from somewhere and smoke enveloped everything
at that moment  as the horse guards  having passed him  disappeared in the smoke  rostov hesitated whether to gallop after them or to go where he was sent
this was the brilliant charge of the horse guards that amazed the french themselves rostov was horrified to hear later that of all that mass of huge and handsome men  of all those brilliant  rich youths  officers and cadets  who had galloped past him on their thousand ruble horses  only eighteen were left after the charge
"why should i envy them  my chance is not lost  and maybe i shall see the emperor immediately " thought rostov and galloped on
when he came level with the foot guards he noticed that about them and around them cannon balls were flying  of which he was aware not so much because he heard their sound as because he saw uneasiness on the soldiers' faces and unnatural warlike solemnity on those of the officers
passing behind one of the lines of a regiment of foot guards he heard a voice calling him by name
"rostov " "what " he answered  not recognizing boris
"i say  we've been in the front line  our regiment attacked " said boris with the happy smile seen on the faces of young men who have been under fire for the first time
rostov stopped
"have you " he said
"well  how did it go " "we drove them back " said boris with animation  growing talkative
"can you imagine it " and he began describing how the guards  having taken up their position and seeing troops before them  thought they were austrians  and all at once discovered from the cannon balls discharged by those troops that they were themselves in the front line and had unexpectedly to go into action rostov without hearing boris to the end spurred his horse
"where are you off to " asked boris
"with a message to his majesty " "there he is " said boris  thinking rostov had said "his highness " and pointing to the grand duke who with his high shoulders and frowning brows stood a hundred paces away from them in his helmet and horse guards' jacket  shouting something to a pale  white uniformed austrian officer
"but that's the grand duke  and i want the commander in chief or the emperor " said rostov  and was about to spur his horse
"count  count " shouted berg who ran up from the other side as eager as boris
"count  i am wounded in my right hand"  and he showed his bleeding hand with a handkerchief tied round it  "and i remained at the front
i held my sword in my left hand  count
all our family—the von bergs—have been knights " he said something more  but rostov did not wait to hear it and rode away
having passed the guards and traversed an empty space  rostov  to avoid again getting in front of the first line as he had done when the horse guards charged  followed the line of reserves  going far round the place where the hottest musket fire and cannonade were heard
suddenly he heard musket fire quite close in front of him and behind our troops  where he could never have expected the enemy to be
"what can it be " he thought
"the enemy in the rear of our army  impossible " and suddenly he was seized by a panic of fear for himself and for the issue of the whole battle "but be that what it may " he reflected  "there is no riding round it now
i must look for the commander in chief here  and if all is lost it is for me to perish with the rest " the foreboding of evil that had suddenly come over rostov was more and more confirmed the farther he rode into the region behind the village of pratzen  which was full of troops of all kinds
"what does it mean  what is it  whom are they firing at  who is firing " rostov kept asking as he came up to russian and austrian soldiers running in confused crowds across his path
"the devil knows  they've killed everybody  it's all up now " he was told in russian  german  and czech by the crowd of fugitives who understood what was happening as little as he did
"kill the germans " shouted one
"may the devil take them—the traitors " "zum henker diese russen " * muttered a german
* "hang these russians " several wounded men passed along the road  and words of abuse  screams  and groans mingled in a general hubbub  then the firing died down rostov learned later that russian and austrian soldiers had been firing at one another
"my god  what does it all mean " thought he
"and here  where at any moment the emperor may see them   
but no  these must be only a handful of scoundrels
it will soon be over  it can't be that  it can't be  only to get past them quicker  quicker " the idea of defeat and flight could not enter rostov's head
though he saw french cannon and french troops on the pratzen heights just where he had been ordered to look for the commander in chief  he could not  did not wish to  believe that
rostov had been ordered to look for kutuzov and the emperor near the village of pratzen
but neither they nor a single commanding officer were there  only disorganized crowds of troops of various kinds
he urged on his already weary horse to get quickly past these crowds  but the farther he went the more disorganized they were
the highroad on which he had come out was thronged with caleches  carriages of all sorts  and russian and austrian soldiers of all arms  some wounded and some not this whole mass droned and jostled in confusion under the dismal influence of cannon balls flying from the french batteries stationed on the pratzen heights
"where is the emperor  where is kutuzov " rostov kept asking everyone he could stop  but got no answer from anyone
at last seizing a soldier by his collar he forced him to answer
"eh  brother  they've all bolted long ago " said the soldier  laughing for some reason and shaking himself free having left that soldier who was evidently drunk  rostov stopped the horse of a batman or groom of some important personage and began to question him
the man announced that the tsar had been driven in a carriage at full speed about an hour before along that very road and that he was dangerously wounded
"it can't be " said rostov
"it must have been someone else " "i saw him myself " replied the man with a self confident smile of derision
"i ought to know the emperor by now  after the times i've seen him in petersburg
i saw him just as i see you   
there he sat in the carriage as pale as anything
how they made the four black horses fly  gracious me  they did rattle past  it's time i knew the imperial horses and ilya ivanych
i don't think ilya drives anyone except the tsar " rostov let go of the horse and was about to ride on  when a wounded officer passing by addressed him  "who is it you want " he asked
"the commander in chief  he was killed by a cannon ball—struck in the breast before our regiment " "not killed—wounded " another officer corrected him
"who  kutuzov " asked rostov
"not kutuzov  but what's his name—well  never mind  
there are not many left alive
go that way  to that village  all the commanders are there " said the officer  pointing to the village of hosjeradek  and he walked on
rostov rode on at a footpace not knowing why or to whom he was now going
the emperor was wounded  the battle lost
it was impossible to doubt it now
rostov rode in the direction pointed out to him  in which he saw turrets and a church
what need to hurry  what was he now to say to the tsar or to kutuzov  even if they were alive and unwounded  "take this road  your honor  that way you will be killed at once " a soldier shouted to him
"they'd kill you there " "oh  what are you talking about " said another
"where is he to go  that way is nearer " rostov considered  and then went in the direction where they said he would be killed
"it's all the same now
if the emperor is wounded  am i to try to save myself " he thought
he rode on to the region where the greatest number of men had perished in fleeing from pratzen
the french had not yet occupied that region  and the russians—the uninjured and slightly wounded—had left it long ago
all about the field  like heaps of manure on well kept plowland  lay from ten to fifteen dead and wounded to each couple of acres
the wounded crept together in twos and threes and one could hear their distressing screams and groans  sometimes feigned—or so it seemed to rostov he put his horse to a trot to avoid seeing all these suffering men  and he felt afraid—afraid not for his life  but for the courage he needed and which he knew would not stand the sight of these unfortunates
the french  who had ceased firing at this field strewn with dead and wounded where there was no one left to fire at  on seeing an adjutant riding over it trained a gun on him and fired several shots
the sensation of those terrible whistling sounds and of the corpses around him merged in rostov's mind into a single feeling of terror and pity for himself he remembered his mother's last letter
"what would she feel " thought he  "if she saw me here now on this field with the cannon aimed at me " in the village of hosjeradek there were russian troops retiring from the field of battle  who though still in some confusion were less disordered
the french cannon did not reach there and the musketry fire sounded far away
here everyone clearly saw and said that the battle was lost
no one whom rostov asked could tell him where the emperor or kutuzov was
some said the report that the emperor was wounded was correct  others that it was not  and explained the false rumor that had spread by the fact that the emperor's carriage had really galloped from the field of battle with the pale and terrified ober hofmarschal count tolstoy  who had ridden out to the battlefield with others in the emperor's suite
one officer told rostov that he had seen someone from headquarters behind the village to the left  and thither rostov rode  not hoping to find anyone but merely to ease his conscience
when he had ridden about two miles and had passed the last of the russian troops  he saw  near a kitchen garden with a ditch round it  two men on horseback facing the ditch
one with a white plume in his hat seemed familiar to rostov  the other on a beautiful chestnut horse  which rostov fancied he had seen before  rode up to the ditch  struck his horse with his spurs  and giving it the rein leaped lightly over
only a little earth crumbled from the bank under the horse's hind hoofs
turning the horse sharply  he again jumped the ditch  and deferentially addressed the horseman with the white plumes  evidently suggesting that he should do the same
the rider  whose figure seemed familiar to rostov and involuntarily riveted his attention  made a gesture of refusal with his head and hand and by that gesture rostov instantly recognized his lamented and adored monarch
"but it can't be he  alone in the midst of this empty field " thought rostov
at that moment alexander turned his head and rostov saw the beloved features that were so deeply engraved on his memory
the emperor was pale  his cheeks sunken and his eyes hollow  but the charm  the mildness of his features  was all the greater
rostov was happy in the assurance that the rumors about the emperor being wounded were false
he was happy to be seeing him
he knew that he might and even ought to go straight to him and give the message dolgorukov had ordered him to deliver
but as a youth in love trembles  is unnerved  and dares not utter the thoughts he has dreamed of for nights  but looks around for help or a chance of delay and flight when the longed for moment comes and he is alone with her  so rostov  now that he had attained what he had longed for more than anything else in the world  did not know how to approach the emperor  and a thousand reasons occurred to him why it would be inconvenient  unseemly  and impossible to do so
"what  it is as if i were glad of a chance to take advantage of his being alone and despondent  a strange face may seem unpleasant or painful to him at this moment of sorrow  besides  what can i say to him now  when my heart fails me and my mouth feels dry at the mere sight of him " not one of the innumerable speeches addressed to the emperor that he had composed in his imagination could he now recall
those speeches were intended for quite other conditions  they were for the most part to be spoken at a moment of victory and triumph  generally when he was dying of wounds and the sovereign had thanked him for heroic deeds  and while dying he expressed the love his actions had proved
"besides how can i ask the emperor for his instructions for the right flank now that it is nearly four o'clock and the battle is lost  no  certainly i must not approach him  i must not intrude on his reflections
better die a thousand times than risk receiving an unkind look or bad opinion from him " rostov decided  and sorrowfully and with a heart full despair he rode away  continually looking back at the tsar  who still remained in the same attitude of indecision
while rostov was thus arguing with himself and riding sadly away  captain von toll chanced to ride to the same spot  and seeing the emperor at once rode up to him  offered his services  and assisted him to cross the ditch on foot the emperor  wishing to rest and feeling unwell  sat down under an apple tree and von toll remained beside him
rostov from a distance saw with envy and remorse how von toll spoke long and warmly to the emperor and how the emperor  evidently weeping  covered his eyes with his hand and pressed von toll's hand
"and i might have been in his place " thought rostov  and hardly restraining his tears of pity for the emperor  he rode on in utter despair  not knowing where to or why he was now riding
his despair was all the greater from feeling that his own weakness was the cause of his grief
he might  
not only might but should  have gone up to the sovereign
it was a unique chance to show his devotion to the emperor and he had not made use of it   
"what have i done " thought he
and he turned round and galloped back to the place where he had seen the emperor  but there was no one beyond the ditch now
only some carts and carriages were passing by
from one of the drivers he learned that kutuzov's staff were not far off  in the village the vehicles were going to
rostov followed them
in front of him walked kutuzov's groom leading horses in horsecloths
then came a cart  and behind that walked an old  bandy legged domestic serf in a peaked cap and sheepskin coat
"tit  i say  tit " said the groom
"what " answered the old man absent mindedly
"go  tit  thresh a bit " "oh  you fool " said the old man  spitting angrily
some time passed in silence  and then the same joke was repeated
before five in the evening the battle had been lost at all points
more than a hundred cannon were already in the hands of the french
przebyszewski and his corps had laid down their arms other columns after losing half their men were retreating in disorderly confused masses
the remains of langeron's and dokhturov's mingled forces were crowding around the dams and banks of the ponds near the village of augesd after five o'clock it was only at the augesd dam that a hot cannonade  delivered by the french alone  was still to be heard from numerous batteries ranged on the slopes of the pratzen heights  directed at our retreating forces
in the rearguard  dokhturov and others rallying some battalions kept up a musketry fire at the french cavalry that was pursuing our troops
it was growing dusk
on the narrow augesd dam where for so many years the old miller had been accustomed to sit in his tasseled cap peacefully angling  while his grandson  with shirt sleeves rolled up  handled the floundering silvery fish in the watering can  on that dam over which for so many years moravians in shaggy caps and blue jackets had peacefully driven their two horse carts loaded with wheat and had returned dusty with flour whitening their carts—on that narrow dam amid the wagons and the cannon  under the horses' hoofs and between the wagon wheels  men disfigured by fear of death now crowded together  crushing one another  dying  stepping over the dying and killing one another  only to move on a few steps and be killed themselves in the same way every ten seconds a cannon ball flew compressing the air around  or a shell burst in the midst of that dense throng  killing some and splashing with blood those near them
dolokhov—now an officer—wounded in the arm  and on foot  with the regimental commander on horseback and some ten men of his company  represented all that was left of that whole regiment
impelled by the crowd  they had got wedged in at the approach to the dam and  jammed in on all sides  had stopped because a horse in front had fallen under a cannon and the crowd were dragging it out
a cannon ball killed someone behind them  another fell in front and splashed dolokhov with blood
the crowd  pushing forward desperately  squeezed together  moved a few steps  and again stopped
"move on a hundred yards and we are certainly saved  remain here another two minutes and it is certain death " thought each one
dolokhov who was in the midst of the crowd forced his way to the edge of the dam  throwing two soldiers off their feet  and ran onto the slippery ice that covered the millpool
"turn this way " he shouted  jumping over the ice which creaked under him  "turn this way " he shouted to those with the gun
"it bears    " the ice bore him but it swayed and creaked  and it was plain that it would give way not only under a cannon or a crowd  but very soon even under his weight alone
the men looked at him and pressed to the bank  hesitating to step onto the ice
the general on horseback at the entrance to the dam raised his hand and opened his mouth to address dolokhov
suddenly a cannon ball hissed so low above the crowd that everyone ducked
it flopped into something moist  and the general fell from his horse in a pool of blood
nobody gave him a look or thought of raising him
"get onto the ice  over the ice  go on  turn  don't you hear  go on " innumerable voices suddenly shouted after the ball had struck the general  the men themselves not knowing what  or why  they were shouting one of the hindmost guns that was going onto the dam turned off onto the ice
crowds of soldiers from the dam began running onto the frozen pond
the ice gave way under one of the foremost soldiers  and one leg slipped into the water
he tried to right himself but fell in up to his waist the nearest soldiers shrank back  the gun driver stopped his horse  but from behind still came the shouts  "onto the ice  why do you stop  go on  go on " and cries of horror were heard in the crowd
the soldiers near the gun waved their arms and beat the horses to make them turn and move on the horses moved off the bank
the ice  that had held under those on foot  collapsed in a great mass  and some forty men who were on it dashed  some forward and some back  drowning one another
still the cannon balls continued regularly to whistle and flop onto the ice and into the water and oftenest of all among the crowd that covered the dam  the pond  and the bank
on the pratzen heights  where he had fallen with the flagstaff in his hand  lay prince andrew bolkonski bleeding profusely and unconsciously uttering a gentle  piteous  and childlike moan
toward evening he ceased moaning and became quite still
he did not know how long his unconsciousness lasted
suddenly he again felt that he was alive and suffering from a burning  lacerating pain in his head
"where is it  that lofty sky that i did not know till now  but saw today " was his first thought
"and i did not know this suffering either " he thought
"yes  i did not know anything  anything at all till now
but where am i " he listened and heard the sound of approaching horses  and voices speaking french
he opened his eyes
above him again was the same lofty sky with clouds that had risen and were floating still higher  and between them gleamed blue infinity
he did not turn his head and did not see those who  judging by the sound of hoofs and voices  had ridden up and stopped near him
it was napoleon accompanied by two aides de camp
bonaparte riding over the battlefield had given final orders to strengthen the batteries firing at the augesd dam and was looking at the killed and wounded left on the field
"fine men " remarked napoleon  looking at a dead russian grenadier  who  with his face buried in the ground and a blackened nape  lay on his stomach with an already stiffened arm flung wide
"the ammunition for the guns in position is exhausted  your majesty " said an adjutant who had come from the batteries that were firing at augesd
"have some brought from the reserve " said napoleon  and having gone on a few steps he stopped before prince andrew  who lay on his back with the flagstaff that had been dropped beside him
 the flag had already been taken by the french as a trophy   "that's a fine death " said napoleon as he gazed at bolkonski
prince andrew understood that this was said of him and that it was napoleon who said it
he heard the speaker addressed as sire
but he heard the words as he might have heard the buzzing of a fly
not only did they not interest him  but he took no notice of them and at once forgot them
his head was burning  he felt himself bleeding to death  and he saw above him the remote  lofty  and everlasting sky he knew it was napoleon—his hero—but at that moment napoleon seemed to him such a small  insignificant creature compared with what was passing now between himself and that lofty infinite sky with the clouds flying over it at that moment it meant nothing to him who might be standing over him  or what was said of him  he was only glad that people were standing near him and only wished that they would help him and bring him back to life  which seemed to him so beautiful now that he had today learned to understand it so differently
he collected all his strength  to stir and utter a sound
he feebly moved his leg and uttered a weak  sickly groan which aroused his own pity
"ah  he is alive " said napoleon
"lift this young man up and carry him to the dressing station " having said this  napoleon rode on to meet marshal lannes  who  hat in hand  rode up smiling to the emperor to congratulate him on the victory
prince andrew remembered nothing more  he lost consciousness from the terrible pain of being lifted onto the stretcher  the jolting while being moved  and the probing of his wound at the dressing station he did not regain consciousness till late in the day  when with other wounded and captured russian officers he was carried to the hospital
during this transfer he felt a little stronger and was able to look about him and even speak
the first words he heard on coming to his senses were those of a french convoy officer  who said rapidly  "we must halt here  the emperor will pass here immediately  it will please him to see these gentlemen prisoners " "there are so many prisoners today  nearly the whole russian army  that he is probably tired of them " said another officer
"all the same  they say this one is the commander of all the emperor alexander's guards " said the first one  indicating a russian officer in the white uniform of the horse guards
bolkonski recognized prince repnin whom he had met in petersburg society
beside him stood a lad of nineteen  also a wounded officer of the horse guards
bonaparte  having come up at a gallop  stopped his horse
"which is the senior " he asked  on seeing the prisoners
they named the colonel  prince repnin
"you are the commander of the emperor alexander's regiment of horse guards " asked napoleon
"i commanded a squadron " replied repnin
"your regiment fulfilled its duty honorably " said napoleon
"the praise of a great commander is a soldier's highest reward " said repnin
"i bestow it with pleasure " said napoleon
"and who is that young man beside you " prince repnin named lieutenant sukhtelen
after looking at him napoleon smiled
"he's very young to come to meddle with us " "youth is no hindrance to courage " muttered sukhtelen in a failing voice
"a splendid reply " said napoleon
"young man  you will go far " prince andrew  who had also been brought forward before the emperor's eyes to complete the show of prisoners  could not fail to attract his attention
napoleon apparently remembered seeing him on the battlefield and  addressing him  again used the epithet "young man" that was connected in his memory with prince andrew
"well  and you  young man " said he
"how do you feel  mon brave " though five minutes before  prince andrew had been able to say a few words to the soldiers who were carrying him  now with his eyes fixed straight on napoleon  he was silent   
so insignificant at that moment seemed to him all the interests that engrossed napoleon  so mean did his hero himself with his paltry vanity and joy in victory appear  compared to the lofty  equitable  and kindly sky which he had seen and understood  that he could not answer him everything seemed so futile and insignificant in comparison with the stern and solemn train of thought that weakness from loss of blood  suffering  and the nearness of death aroused in him
looking into napoleon's eyes prince andrew thought of the insignificance of greatness  the unimportance of life which no one could understand  and the still greater unimportance of death  the meaning of which no one alive could understand or explain
the emperor without waiting for an answer turned away and said to one of the officers as he went  "have these gentlemen attended to and taken to my bivouac  let my doctor  larrey  examine their wounds
au revoir  prince repnin " and he spurred his horse and galloped away
his face shone with self satisfaction and pleasure
the soldiers who had carried prince andrew had noticed and taken the little gold icon princess mary had hung round her brother's neck  but seeing the favor the emperor showed the prisoners  they now hastened to return the holy image
prince andrew did not see how and by whom it was replaced  but the little icon with its thin gold chain suddenly appeared upon his chest outside his uniform
"it would be good " thought prince andrew  glancing at the icon his sister had hung round his neck with such emotion and reverence  "it would be good if everything were as clear and simple as it seems to mary how good it would be to know where to seek for help in this life  and what to expect after it beyond the grave  how happy and calm i should be if i could now say  'lord  have mercy on me '  
but to whom should i say that  either to a power indefinable  incomprehensible  which i not only cannot address but which i cannot even express in words—the great all or nothing " said he to himself  "or to that god who has been sewn into this amulet by mary  there is nothing certain  nothing at all except the unimportance of everything i understand  and the greatness of something incomprehensible but all important " the stretchers moved on at every jolt he again felt unendurable pain  his feverishness increased and he grew delirious visions of his father  wife  sister  and future son  and the tenderness he had felt the night before the battle  the figure of the insignificant little napoleon  and above all this the lofty sky  formed the chief subjects of his delirious fancies
the quiet home life and peaceful happiness of bald hills presented itself to him
he was already enjoying that happiness when that little napoleon had suddenly appeared with his unsympathizing look of shortsighted delight at the misery of others  and doubts and torments had followed  and only the heavens promised peace
toward morning all these dreams melted and merged into the chaos and darkness of unconciousness and oblivion which in the opinion of napoleon's doctor  larrey  was much more likely to end in death than in convalescence "he is a nervous  bilious subject " said larrey  "and will not recover " and prince andrew  with others fatally wounded  was left to the care of the inhabitants of the district
napoleon began the war with russia because he could not resist going to dresden  could not help having his head turned by the homage he received  could not help donning a polish uniform and yielding to the stimulating influence of a june morning  and could not refrain from bursts of anger in the presence of kurakin and then of balashev
alexander refused negotiations because he felt himself to be personally insulted barclay de tolly tried to command the army in the best way  because he wished to fulfill his duty and earn fame as a great commander
rostov charged the french because he could not restrain his wish for a gallop across a level field  and in the same way the innumerable people who took part in the war acted in accord with their personal characteristics  habits  circumstances  and aims they were moved by fear or vanity  rejoiced or were indignant  reasoned  imagining that they knew what they were doing and did it of their own free will  but they all were involuntary tools of history  carrying on a work concealed from them but comprehensible to us
such is the inevitable fate of men of action  and the higher they stand in the social hierarchy the less are they free
the actors of 1812 have long since left the stage  their personal interests have vanished leaving no trace  and nothing remains of that time but its historic results
providence compelled all these men  striving to attain personal aims  to further the accomplishment of a stupendous result no one of them at all expected— neither napoleon  nor alexander  nor still less any of those who did the actual fighting the cause of the destruction of the french army in 1812 is clear to us now
no one will deny that that cause was  on the one hand  its advance into the heart of russia late in the season without any preparation for a winter campaign and  on the other  the character given to the war by the burning of russian towns and the hatred of the foe this aroused among the russian people
but no one at the time foresaw  what now seems so evident  that this was the only way an army of eight hundred thousand men—the best in the world and led by the best general—could be destroyed in conflict with a raw army of half its numerical strength  and led by inexperienced commanders as the russian army was not only did no one see this  but on the russian side every effort was made to hinder the only thing that could save russia  while on the french side  despite napoleon's experience and so called military genius  every effort was directed to pushing on to moscow at the end of the summer  that is  to doing the very thing that was bound to lead to destruction
in historical works on the year 1812 french writers are very fond of saying that napoleon felt the danger of extending his line  that he sought a battle and that his marshals advised him to stop at smolensk  and of making similar statements to show that the danger of the campaign was even then understood
russian authors are still fonder of telling us that from the commencement of the campaign a scythian war plan was adopted to lure napoleon into the depths of russia  and this plan some of them attribute to pfuel  others to a certain frenchman  others to toll  and others again to alexander himself— pointing to notes  projects  and letters which contain hints of such a line of action but all these hints at what happened  both from the french side and the russian  are advanced only because they fit in with the event
had that event not occurred these hints would have been forgotten  as we have forgotten the thousands and millions of hints and expectations to the contrary which were current then but have now been forgotten because the event falsified them
there are always so many conjectures as to the issue of any event that however it may end there will always be people to say  "i said then that it would be so " quite forgetting that amid their innumerable conjectures many were to quite the contrary effect
conjectures as to napoleon's awareness of the danger of extending his line  and  on the russian side  as to luring the enemy into the depths of russia  are evidently of that kind  and only by much straining can historians attribute such conceptions to napoleon and his marshals  or such plans to the russian commanders
all the facts are in flat contradiction to such conjectures
during the whole period of the war not only was there no wish on the russian side to draw the french into the heart of the country  but from their first entry into russia everything was done to stop them
and not only was napoleon not afraid to extend his line  but he welcomed every step forward as a triumph and did not seek battle as eagerly as in former campaigns  but very lazily
at the very beginning of the war our armies were divided  and our sole aim was to unite them  though uniting the armies was no advantage if we meant to retire and lure the enemy into the depths of the country
our emperor joined the army to encourage it to defend every inch of russian soil and not to retreat
the enormous drissa camp was formed on pfuel's plan  and there was no intention of retiring farther
the emperor reproached the commanders in chief for every step they retired
he could not bear the idea of letting the enemy even reach smolensk  still less could he contemplate the burning of moscow  and when our armies did unite he was displeased that smolensk was abandoned and burned without a general engagement having been fought under its walls
so thought the emperor  and the russian commanders and people were still more provoked at the thought that our forces were retreating into the depths of the country
napoleon having cut our armies apart advanced far into the country and missed several chances of forcing an engagement
in august he was at smolensk and thought only of how to advance farther  though as we now see that advance was evidently ruinous to him
the facts clearly show that napoleon did not foresee the danger of the advance on moscow  nor did alexander and the russian commanders then think of luring napoleon on  but quite the contrary
the luring of napoleon into the depths of the country was not the result of any plan  for no one believed it to be possible  it resulted from a most complex interplay of intrigues  aims  and wishes among those who took part in the war and had no perception whatever of the inevitable  or of the one way of saving russia everything came about fortuitously
the armies were divided at the commencement of the campaign
we tried to unite them  with the evident intention of giving battle and checking the enemy's advance  and by this effort to unite them while avoiding battle with a much stronger enemy  and necessarily withdrawing the armies at an acute angle—we led the french on to smolensk
but we withdrew at an acute angle not only because the french advanced between our two armies  the angle became still more acute and we withdrew still farther  because barclay de tolly was an unpopular foreigner disliked by bagration  who would come under his command   and bagration —being in command of the second army—tried to postpone joining up and coming under barclay's command as long as he could
bagration was slow in effecting the junction—though that was the chief aim of all at headquarters— because  as he alleged  he exposed his army to danger on this march  and it was best for him to retire more to the left and more to the south  worrying the enemy from flank and rear and securing from the ukraine recruits for his army  and it looks as if he planned this in order not to come under the command of the detested foreigner barclay  whose rank was inferior to his own
the emperor was with the army to encourage it  but his presence and ignorance of what steps to take  and the enormous number of advisers and plans  destroyed the first army's energy and it retired
the intention was to make a stand at the drissa camp  but paulucci  aiming at becoming commander in chief  unexpectedly employed his energy to influence alexander  and pfuel's whole plan was abandoned and the command entrusted to barclay
but as barclay did not inspire confidence his power was limited
the armies were divided  there was no unity of command  and barclay was unpopular  but from this confusion  division  and the unpopularity of the foreign commander in chief  there resulted on the one hand indecision and the avoidance of a battle  which we could not have refrained from had the armies been united and had someone else  instead of barclay  been in command  and on the other an ever increasing indignation against the foreigners and an increase in patriotic zeal
at last the emperor left the army  and as the most convenient and indeed the only pretext for his departure it was decided that it was necessary for him to inspire the people in the capitals and arouse the nation in general to a patriotic war
and by this visit of the emperor to moscow the strength of the russian army was trebled
he left in order not to obstruct the commander in chief's undivided control of the army  and hoping that more decisive action would then be taken  but the command of the armies became still more confused and enfeebled
bennigsen  the tsarevich  and a swarm of adjutants general remained with the army to keep the commander in chief under observation and arouse his energy  and barclay  feeling less free than ever under the observation of all these "eyes of the emperor " became still more cautious of undertaking any decisive action and avoided giving battle
barclay stood for caution
the tsarevich hinted at treachery and demanded a general engagement
lubomirski  bronnitski  wlocki  and the others of that group stirred up so much trouble that barclay  under pretext of sending papers to the emperor  dispatched these polish adjutants general to petersburg and plunged into an open struggle with bennigsen and the tsarevich
at smolensk the armies at last reunited  much as bagration disliked it
bagration drove up in a carriage to the house occupied by barclay
barclay donned his sash and came out to meet and report to his senior officer bagration
despite his seniority in rank bagration  in this contest of magnanimity  took his orders from barclay  but  having submitted  agreed with him less than ever
by the emperor's orders bagration reported direct to him
he wrote to arakcheev  the emperor's confidant  "it must be as my sovereign pleases  but i cannot work with the minister  meaning barclay 
for god's sake send me somewhere else if only in command of a regiment
i cannot stand it here
headquarters are so full of germans that a russian cannot exist and there is no sense in anything
i thought i was really serving my sovereign and the fatherland  but it turns out that i am serving barclay
i confess i do not want to " the swarm of bronnitskis and wintzingerodes and their like still further embittered the relations between the commanders in chief  and even less unity resulted
preparations were made to fight the french before smolensk
a general was sent to survey the position
this general  hating barclay  rode to visit a friend of his own  a corps commander  and  having spent the day with him  returned to barclay and condemned  as unsuitable from every point of view  the battleground he had not seen
while disputes and intrigues were going on about the future field of battle  and while we were looking for the french—having lost touch with them—the french stumbled upon neverovski's division and reached the walls of smolensk
it was necessary to fight an unexpected battle at smolensk to save our lines of communication
the battle was fought and thousands were killed on both sides
smolensk was abandoned contrary to the wishes of the emperor and of the whole people
but smolensk was burned by its own inhabitants who had been misled by their governor
and these ruined inhabitants  setting an example to other russians  went to moscow thinking only of their own losses but kindling hatred of the foe
napoleon advanced farther and we retired  thus arriving at the very result which caused his destruction
the day after his son had left  prince nicholas sent for princess mary to come to his study
"well  are you satisfied now " said he
"you've made me quarrel with my son  satisfied  are you  that's all you wanted  satisfied   
it hurts me  it hurts
i'm old and weak and this is what you wanted
well then  gloat over it  gloat over it " after that princess mary did not see her father for a whole week
he was ill and did not leave his study
princess mary noticed to her surprise that during this illness the old prince not only excluded her from his room  but did not admit mademoiselle bourienne either
tikhon alone attended him
at the end of the week the prince reappeared and resumed his former way of life  devoting himself with special activity to building operations and the arrangement of the gardens and completely breaking off his relations with mademoiselle bourienne his looks and cold tone to his daughter seemed to say  "there  you see  you plotted against me  you lied to prince andrew about my relations with that frenchwoman and made me quarrel with him  but you see i need neither her nor you " princess mary spent half of every day with little nicholas  watching his lessons  teaching him russian and music herself  and talking to dessalles  the folk" who sometimes came by the back door to see her
of the war princess mary thought as women do think about wars
she feared for her brother who was in it  was horrified by and amazed at the strange cruelty that impels men to kill one another  but she did not understand the significance of this war  which seemed to her like all previous wars
she did not realize the significance of this war  though dessalles with whom she constantly conversed was passionately interested in its progress and tried to explain his own conception of it to her  and though the "god's folk" who came to see her reported  in their own way  the rumors current among the people of an invasion by antichrist  and though julie  now princess drubetskaya   who had resumed correspondence with her  wrote patriotic letters from moscow
"i write you in russian  my good friend " wrote julie in her frenchified russian  "because i have a detestation for all the french  and the same for their language which i cannot support to hear spoken   
we in moscow are elated by enthusiasm for our adored emperor
"my poor husband is enduring pains and hunger in jewish taverns  but the news which i have inspires me yet more
"you heard probably of the heroic exploit of raevski  embracing his two sons and saying  'i will perish with them but we will not be shaken ' and truly though the enemy was twice stronger than we  we were unshakable
we pass the time as we can  but in war as in war  the princesses aline and sophie sit whole days with me  and we  unhappy widows of live men  make beautiful conversations over our 'charpie'  only you  my friend  are missing   " and so on
the chief reason princess mary did not realize the full significance of this war was that the old prince never spoke of it  did not recognize it  and laughed at dessalles when he mentioned it at dinner
the prince's tone was so calm and confident that princess mary unhesitatingly believed him
all that july the old prince was exceedingly active and even animated
he planned another garden and began a new building for the domestic serfs
the only thing that made princess mary anxious about him was that he slept very little and  instead of sleeping in his study as usual  changed his sleeping place every day
one day he would order his camp bed to be set up in the glass gallery  another day he remained on the couch or on the lounge chair in the drawing room and dozed there without undressing  while—instead of mademoiselle bourienne—a serf boy read to him
then again he would spend a night in the dining room
on august 1  a second letter was received from prince andrew
in his first letter which came soon after he had left home  prince andrew had dutifully asked his father's forgiveness for what he had allowed himself to say and begged to be restored to his favor to this letter the old prince had replied affectionately  and from that time had kept the frenchwoman at a distance
prince andrew's second letter  written near vitebsk after the french had occupied that town  gave a brief account of the whole campaign  enclosed for them a plan he had drawn and forecasts as to the further progress of the war
in this letter prince andrew pointed out to his father the danger of staying at bald hills  so near the theater of war and on the army's direct line of march  and advised him to move to moscow
at dinner that day  on dessalles' mentioning that the french were said to have already entered vitebsk  the old prince remembered his son's letter
"there was a letter from prince andrew today " he said to princess mary —"haven't you read it " "no  father " she replied in a frightened voice
she could not have read the letter as she did not even know it had arrived
"he writes about this war " said the prince  with the ironic smile that had become habitual to him in speaking of the present war
"that must be very interesting " said dessalles
"prince andrew is in a position to know   " "oh  very interesting " said mademoiselle bourienne
"go and get it for me " said the old prince to mademoiselle bourienne
"you know—under the paperweight on the little table " mademoiselle bourienne jumped up eagerly
"no  don't " he exclaimed with a frown
"you go  michael ivanovich " michael ivanovich rose and went to the study
but as soon as he had left the room the old prince  looking uneasily round  threw down his napkin and went himself "they can't do anything  
always make some muddle " he muttered
while he was away princess mary  dessalles  mademoiselle bourienne  and even little nicholas exchanged looks in silence
the old prince returned with quick steps  accompanied by michael ivanovich  bringing the letter and a plan
these he put down beside him—not letting anyone read them at dinner
on moving to the drawing room he handed the letter to princess mary and  spreading out before him the plan of the new building and fixing his eyes upon it  told her to read the letter aloud
when she had done so princess mary looked inquiringly at her father
he was examining the plan  evidently engrossed in his own ideas
"what do you think of it  prince " dessalles ventured to ask
"i  i    " said the prince as if unpleasantly awakened  and not taking his eyes from the plan of the building
"very possibly the theater of war will move so near to us that   " "ha ha ha  the theater of war " said the prince
"i have said and still say that the theater of war is poland and the enemy will never get beyond the niemen " dessalles looked in amazement at the prince  who was talking of the niemen when the enemy was already at the dnieper  but princess mary  forgetting the geographical position of the niemen  thought that what her father was saying was correct
"when the snow melts they'll sink in the polish swamps
only they could fail to see it " the prince continued  evidently thinking of the campaign of 1807 which seemed to him so recent
"bennigsen should have advanced into prussia sooner  then things would have taken a different turn   " "but  prince " dessalles began timidly  "the letter mentions vitebsk    " "ah  the letter  yes   " replied the prince peevishly
"yes  
yes   " his face suddenly took on a morose expression
he paused
"yes  he writes that the french were beaten at  
at  
what river is it " dessalles dropped his eyes
"the prince says nothing about that " he remarked gently
"doesn't he  but i didn't invent it myself " no one spoke for a long time
"yes  
yes  
well  michael ivanovich " he suddenly went on  raising his head and pointing to the plan of the building  "tell me how you mean to alter it    " michael ivanovich went up to the plan  and the prince after speaking to him about the building looked angrily at princess mary and dessalles and went to his own room
princess mary saw dessalles' embarrassed and astonished look fixed on her father  noticed his silence  and was struck by the fact that her father had forgotten his son's letter on the drawing room table  but she was not only afraid to speak of it and ask dessalles the reason of his confusion and silence  but was afraid even to think about it
in the evening michael ivanovich  sent by the prince  came to princess mary for prince andrew's letter which had been forgotten in the drawing room
she gave it to him and  unpleasant as it was to her to do so  ventured to ask him what her father was doing
"always busy " replied michael ivanovich with a respectfully ironic smile which caused princess mary to turn pale
"he's worrying very much about the new building
he has been reading a little  but now"—michael ivanovich went on  lowering his voice—"now he's at his desk  busy with his will  i expect "  one of the prince's favorite occupations of late had been the preparation of some papers he meant to leave at his death and which he called his "will "  "and alpatych is being sent to smolensk " asked princess mary
"oh  yes  he has been waiting to start for some time " when michael ivanovich returned to the study with the letter  the old prince  with spectacles on and a shade over his eyes  was sitting at his open bureau with screened candles  holding a paper in his outstretched hand  and in a somewhat dramatic attitude was reading his manuscript—his "remarks" as he termed it—which was to be transmitted to the emperor after his death when michael ivanovich went in there were tears in the prince's eyes evoked by the memory of the time when the paper he was now reading had been written
he took the letter from michael ivanovich's hand  put it in his pocket  folded up his papers  and called in alpatych who had long been waiting
the prince had a list of things to be bought in smolensk and  walking up and down the room past alpatych who stood by the door  he gave his instructions
"first  notepaper—do you hear  eight quires  like this sample  gilt edged  
it must be exactly like the sample
varnish  sealing wax  as in michael ivanovich's list " he paced up and down for a while and glanced at his notes
"then hand to the governor in person a letter about the deed " next  bolts for the doors of the new building were wanted and had to be of a special shape the prince had himself designed  and a leather case had to be ordered to keep the "will" in the instructions to alpatych took over two hours and still the prince did not let him go
he sat down  sank into thought  closed his eyes  and dozed off
alpatych made a slight movement
"well  go  go  if anything more is wanted i'll send after you " alpatych went out
the prince again went to his bureau  glanced into it  fingered his papers  closed the bureau again  and sat down at the table to write to the governor
it was already late when he rose after sealing the letter
he wished to sleep  but he knew he would not be able to and that most depressing thoughts came to him in bed
so he called tikhon and went through the rooms with him to show him where to set up the bed for that night he went about looking at every corner
every place seemed unsatisfactory  but worst of all was his customary couch in the study
that couch was dreadful to him  probably because of the oppressive thoughts he had had when lying there
it was unsatisfactory everywhere  but the corner behind the piano in the sitting room was better than other places  he had never slept there yet
with the help of a footman tikhon brought in the bedstead and began putting it up
"that's not right  that's not right " cried the prince  and himself pushed it a few inches from the corner and then closer in again "well  at last i've finished  now i'll rest " thought the prince  and let tikhon undress him
frowning with vexation at the effort necessary to divest himself of his coat and trousers  the prince undressed  sat down heavily on the bed  and appeared to be meditating as he looked contemptuously at his withered yellow legs he was not meditating  but only deferring the moment of making the effort to lift those legs up and turn over on the bed
"ugh  how hard it is  oh  that this toil might end and you would release me " thought he
pressing his lips together he made that effort for the twenty thousandth time and lay down
but hardly had he done so before he felt the bed rocking backwards and forwards beneath him as if it were breathing heavily and jolting
this happened to him almost every night
he opened his eyes as they were closing
"no peace  damn them " he muttered  angry he knew not with whom
"ah yes  there was something else important  very important  that i was keeping till i should be in bed
the bolts  no  i told him about them
no  it was something  something in the drawing room
princess mary talked some nonsense
dessalles  that fool  said something
something in my pocket—can't remember   " "tikhon  what did we talk about at dinner " "about prince michael   " "be quiet  quiet " the prince slapped his hand on the table
"yes  i know  prince andrew's letter  princess mary read it
dessalles said something about vitebsk
now i'll read it " he had the letter taken from his pocket and the table—on which stood a glass of lemonade and a spiral wax candle—moved close to the bed  and putting on his spectacles he began reading
only now in the stillness of the night  reading it by the faint light under the green shade  did he grasp its meaning for a moment
"the french at vitebsk  in four days' march they may be at smolensk  perhaps are already there  tikhon " tikhon jumped up
"no  no  i don't want anything " he shouted
he put the letter under the candlestick and closed his eyes
and there rose before him the danube at bright noonday  reeds  the russian camp  and himself a young general without a wrinkle on his ruddy face  vigorous and alert  entering potemkin's gaily colored tent  and a burning sense of jealousy of "the favorite" agitated him now as strongly as it had done then he recalled all the words spoken at that first meeting with potemkin
and he saw before him a plump  rather sallow faced  short  stout woman  the empress mother  with her smile and her words at her first gracious reception of him  and then that same face on the catafalque  and the encounter he had with zubov over her coffin about his right to kiss her hand
"oh  quicker  quicker  to get back to that time and have done with all the present  quicker  quicker—and that they should leave me in peace " bald hills  prince nicholas bolkonski's estate  lay forty miles east from smolensk and two miles from the main road to moscow
the same evening that the prince gave his instructions to alpatych  dessalles  having asked to see princess mary  told her that  as the prince was not very well and was taking no steps to secure his safety  though from prince andrew's letter it was evident that to remain at bald hills might be dangerous  he respectfully advised her to send a letter by alpatych to the provincial governor at smolensk  asking him to let her know the state of affairs and the extent of the danger to which bald hills was exposed
dessalles wrote this letter to the governor for princess mary  she signed it  and it was given to alpatych with instructions to hand it to the governor and to come back as quickly as possible if there was danger
having received all his orders alpatych  wearing a white beaver hat—a present from the prince—and carrying a stick as the prince did  went out accompanied by his family
three well fed roans stood ready harnessed to a small conveyance with a leather hood
the larger bell was muffled and the little bells on the harness stuffed with paper
the prince allowed no one at bald hills to drive with ringing bells  but on a long journey alpatych liked to have them
his satellites—the senior clerk  a countinghouse clerk  a scullery maid  a cook  two old women  a little pageboy  the coachman  and various domestic serfs—were seeing him off
his daughter placed chintz covered down cushions for him to sit on and behind his back
his old sister in law popped in a small bundle  and one of the coachmen helped him into the vehicle
"there  there  women's fuss  women  women " said alpatych  puffing and speaking rapidly just as the prince did  and he climbed into the trap
after giving the clerk orders about the work to be done  alpatych  not trying to imitate the prince now  lifted the hat from his bald head and crossed himself three times "if there is anything  
come back  yakov alpatych  for christ's sake think of us " cried his wife  referring to the rumors of war and the enemy
"women  women  women's fuss " muttered alpatych to himself and started on his journey  looking round at the fields of yellow rye and the still green  thickly growing oats  and at other quite black fields just being plowed a second time as he went along he looked with pleasure at the year's splendid crop of corn  scrutinized the strips of ryefield which here and there were already being reaped  made his calculations as to the sowing and the harvest  and asked himself whether he had not forgotten any of the prince's orders having baited the horses twice on the way  he arrived at the town toward evening on the fourth of august
alpatych kept meeting and overtaking baggage trains and troops on the road
as he approached smolensk he heard the sounds of distant firing  but these did not impress him
what struck him most was the sight of a splendid field of oats in which a camp had been pitched and which was being mown down by the soldiers  evidently for fodder
this fact impressed alpatych  but in thinking about his own business he soon forgot it
all the interests of his life for more than thirty years had been bounded by the will of the prince  and he never went beyond that limit
everything not connected with the execution of the prince's orders did not interest and did not even exist for alpatych
on reaching smolensk on the evening of the fourth of august he put up in the gachina suburb across the dnieper  at the inn kept by ferapontov  where he had been in the habit of putting up for the last thirty years
some thirty years ago ferapontov  by alpatych's advice  had bought a wood from the prince  had begun to trade  and now had a house  an inn  and a corn dealer's shop in that province
he was a stout  dark  red faced peasant in the forties  with thick lips  a broad knob of a nose  similar knobs over his black frowning brows  and a round belly
wearing a waistcoat over his cotton shirt  ferapontov was standing before his shop which opened onto the street
on seeing alpatych he went up to him
"you're welcome  yakov alpatych
folks are leaving the town  but you have come to it " said he
"why are they leaving the town " asked alpatych
"that's what i say
folks are foolish  always afraid of the french " "women's fuss  women's fuss " said alpatych
"just what i think  yakov alpatych
what i say is  orders have been given not to let them in  so that must be right
and the peasants are asking three rubles for carting—it isn't christian " yakov alpatych heard without heeding
he asked for a samovar and for hay for his horses  and when he had had his tea he went to bed
all night long troops were moving past the inn
next morning alpatych donned a jacket he wore only in town and went out on business
it was a sunny morning and by eight o'clock it was already hot
"a good day for harvesting " thought alpatych
from beyond the town firing had been heard since early morning
at eight o'clock the booming of cannon was added to the sound of musketry
many people were hurrying through the streets and there were many soldiers  but cabs were still driving about  tradesmen stood at their shops  and service was being held in the churches as usual
alpatych went to the shops  to government offices  to the post office  and to the governor's
in the offices and shops and at the post office everyone was talking about the army and about the enemy who was already attacking the town  everybody was asking what should be done  and all were trying to calm one another
in front of the governor's house alpatych found a large number of people  cossacks  and a traveling carriage of the governor's
at the porch he met two of the landed gentry  one of whom he knew
this man  an ex captain of police  was saying angrily  "it's no joke  you know  it's all very well if you're single
'one man though undone is but one ' as the proverb says  but with thirteen in your family and all the property  
they've brought us to utter ruin  what sort of governors are they to do that  they ought to be hanged—the brigands    " "oh come  that's enough " said the other
"what do i care  let him hear  we're not dogs " said the ex captain of police  and looking round he noticed alpatych
"oh  yakov alpatych  what have you come for " "to see the governor by his excellency's order " answered alpatych  lifting his head and proudly thrusting his hand into the bosom of his coat as he always did when he mentioned the prince   
"he has ordered me to inquire into the position of affairs " he added
"yes  go and find out " shouted the angry gentleman
"they've brought things to such a pass that there are no carts or anything   
there it is again  do you hear " said he  pointing in the direction whence came the sounds of firing
"they've brought us all to ruin  
the brigands " he repeated  and descended the porch steps
alpatych swayed his head and went upstairs
in the waiting room were tradesmen  women  and officials  looking silently at one another
the door of the governor's room opened and they all rose and moved forward
an official ran out  said some words to a merchant  called a stout official with a cross hanging on his neck to follow him  and vanished again  evidently wishing to avoid the inquiring looks and questions addressed to him
alpatych moved forward and next time the official came out addressed him  one hand placed in the breast of his buttoned coat  and handed him two letters
"to his honor baron asch  from general in chief prince bolkonski " he announced with such solemnity and significance that the official turned to him and took the letters
a few minutes later the governor received alpatych and hurriedly said to him  "inform the prince and princess that i knew nothing  i acted on the highest instructions—here   " and he handed a paper to alpatych
"still  as the prince is unwell my advice is that they should go to moscow
i am just starting myself
inform them   " but the governor did not finish  a dusty perspiring officer ran into the room and began to say something in french
the governor's face expressed terror
"go " he said  nodding his head to alpatych  and began questioning the officer
eager  frightened  helpless glances were turned on alpatych when he came out of the governor's room
involuntarily listening now to the firing  which had drawn nearer and was increasing in strength  alpatych hurried to his inn
the paper handed to him by the governor said this  "i assure you that the town of smolensk is not in the slightest danger as yet and it is unlikely that it will be threatened with any
i from the one side and prince bagration from the other are marching to unite our forces before smolensk  which junction will be effected on the 22nd instant  and both armies with their united forces will defend our compatriots of the province entrusted to your care till our efforts shall have beaten back the enemies of our fatherland  or till the last warrior in our valiant ranks has perished
from this you will see that you have a perfect right to reassure the inhabitants of smolensk  for those defended by two such brave armies may feel assured of victory "  instructions from barclay de tolly to baron asch  the civil governor of smolensk  1812   people were anxiously roaming about the streets
carts piled high with household utensils  chairs  and cupboards kept emerging from the gates of the yards and moving along the streets
loaded carts stood at the house next to ferapontov's and women were wailing and lamenting as they said good by
a small watchdog ran round barking in front of the harnessed horses
alpatych entered the innyard at a quicker pace than usual and went straight to the shed where his horses and trap were
the coachman was asleep
he woke him up  told him to harness  and went into the passage
from the host's room came the sounds of a child crying  the despairing sobs of a woman  and the hoarse angry shouting of ferapontov
the cook began running hither and thither in the passage like a frightened hen  just as alpatych entered
"he's done her to death
killed the mistress   
beat her  
dragged her about so    " "what for " asked alpatych
"she kept begging to go away
she's a woman  'take me away ' says she  'don't let me perish with my little children  folks ' she says  'are all gone  so why ' she says  'don't we go ' and he began beating and pulling her about so " at these words alpatych nodded as if in approval  and not wishing to hear more went to the door of the room opposite the innkeeper's  where he had left his purchases
"you brute  you murderer " screamed a thin  pale woman who  with a baby in her arms and her kerchief torn from her head  burst through the door at that moment and down the steps into the yard ferapontov came out after her  but on seeing alpatych adjusted his waistcoat  smoothed his hair  yawned  and followed alpatych into the opposite room
"going already " said he
alpatych  without answering or looking at his host  sorted his packages and asked how much he owed
"we'll reckon up  well  have you been to the governor's " asked ferapontov
"what has been decided " alpatych replied that the governor had not told him anything definite
"with our business  how can we get away " said ferapontov
"we'd have to pay seven rubles a cartload to dorogobuzh and i tell them they're not christians to ask it  selivanov  now  did a good stroke last thursday—sold flour to the army at nine rubles a sack
will you have some tea " he added
while the horses were being harnessed alpatych and ferapontov over their tea talked of the price of corn  the crops  and the good weather for harvesting
"well  it seems to be getting quieter " remarked ferapontov  finishing his third cup of tea and getting up "ours must have got the best of it
the orders were not to let them in
so we're in force  it seems    they say the other day matthew ivanych platov drove them into the river marina and drowned some eighteen thousand in one day " alpatych collected his parcels  handed them to the coachman who had come in  and settled up with the innkeeper
the noise of wheels  hoofs  and bells was heard from the gateway as a little trap passed out
it was by now late in the afternoon
half the street was in shadow  the other half brightly lit by the sun
alpatych looked out of the window and went to the door
suddenly the strange sound of a far off whistling and thud was heard  followed by a boom of cannon blending into a dull roar that set the windows rattling
he went out into the street  two men were running past toward the bridge
from different sides came whistling sounds and the thud of cannon balls and bursting shells falling on the town
but these sounds were hardly heard in comparison with the noise of the firing outside the town and attracted little attention from the inhabitants
the town was being bombarded by a hundred and thirty guns which napoleon had ordered up after four o'clock
the people did not at once realize the meaning of this bombardment
at first the noise of the falling bombs and shells only aroused curiosity
ferapontov's wife  who till then had not ceased wailing under the shed  became quiet and with the baby in her arms went to the gate  listening to the sounds and looking in silence at the people the cook and a shop assistant came to the gate
with lively curiosity everyone tried to get a glimpse of the projectiles as they flew over their heads
several people came round the corner talking eagerly
"what force " remarked one
"knocked the roof and ceiling all to splinters " "routed up the earth like a pig " said another
"that's grand  it bucks one up " laughed the first
"lucky you jumped aside  or it would have wiped you out " others joined those men and stopped and told how cannon balls had fallen on a house close to them
meanwhile still more projectiles  now with the swift sinister whistle of a cannon ball  now with the agreeable intermittent whistle of a shell  flew over people's heads incessantly  but not one fell close by  they all flew over
alpatych was getting into his trap
the innkeeper stood at the gate
"what are you staring at " he shouted to the cook  who in her red skirt  with sleeves rolled up  swinging her bare elbows  had stepped to the corner to listen to what was being said
"what marvels " she exclaimed  but hearing her master's voice she turned back  pulling down her tucked up skirt
once more something whistled  but this time quite close  swooping downwards like a little bird  a flame flashed in the middle of the street  something exploded  and the street was shrouded in smoke
"scoundrel  what are you doing " shouted the innkeeper  rushing to the cook
at that moment the pitiful wailing of women was heard from different sides  the frightened baby began to cry  and people crowded silently with pale faces round the cook
the loudest sound in that crowd was her wailing
"oh h h  dear souls  dear kind souls  don't let me die  my good souls    " five minutes later no one remained in the street
the cook  with her thigh broken by a shell splinter  had been carried into the kitchen
alpatych  his coachman  ferapontov's wife and children and the house porter were all sitting in the cellar  listening
the roar of guns  the whistling of projectiles  and the piteous moaning of the cook  which rose above the other sounds  did not cease for a moment
the mistress rocked and hushed her baby and when anyone came into the cellar asked in a pathetic whisper what had become of her husband who had remained in the street
a shopman who entered told her that her husband had gone with others to the cathedral  whence they were fetching the wonder working icon of smolensk toward dusk the cannonade began to subside
alpatych left the cellar and stopped in the doorway
the evening sky that had been so clear was clouded with smoke  through which  high up  the sickle of the new moon shone strangely
now that the terrible din of the guns had ceased a hush seemed to reign over the town  broken only by the rustle of footsteps  the moaning  the distant cries  and the crackle of fires which seemed widespread everywhere
the cook's moans had now subsided
on two sides black curling clouds of smoke rose and spread from the fires
through the streets soldiers in various uniforms walked or ran confusedly in different directions like ants from a ruined ant hill several of them ran into ferapontov's yard before alpatych's eyes
alpatych went out to the gate
a retreating regiment  thronging and hurrying  blocked the street
noticing him  an officer said  "the town is being abandoned
get away  get away " and then  turning to the soldiers  shouted  "i'll teach you to run into the yards " alpatych went back to the house  called the coachman  and told him to set off
ferapontov's whole household came out too  following alpatych and the coachman
the women  who had been silent till then  suddenly began to wail as they looked at the fires—the smoke and even the flames of which could be seen in the failing twilight—and as if in reply the same kind of lamentation was heard from other parts of the street
inside the shed alpatych and the coachman arranged the tangled reins and traces of their horses with trembling hands
as alpatych was driving out of the gate he saw some ten soldiers in ferapontov's open shop  talking loudly and filling their bags and knapsacks with flour and sunflower seeds
just then ferapontov returned and entered his shop
on seeing the soldiers he was about to shout at them  but suddenly stopped and  clutching at his hair  burst into sobs and laughter  "loot everything  lads  don't let those devils get it " he cried  taking some bags of flour himself and throwing them into the street some of the soldiers were frightened and ran away  others went on filling their bags
on seeing alpatych  ferapontov turned to him  "russia is done for " he cried
"alpatych  i'll set the place on fire myself
we're done for    " and ferapontov ran into the yard
soldiers were passing in a constant stream along the street blocking it completely  so that alpatych could not pass out and had to wait
ferapontov's wife and children were also sitting in a cart waiting till it was possible to drive out
night had come
there were stars in the sky and the new moon shone out amid the smoke that screened it
on the sloping descent to the dnieper alpatych's cart and that of the innkeeper's wife  which were slowly moving amid the rows of soldiers and of other vehicles  had to stop
in a side street near the crossroads where the vehicles had stopped  a house and some shops were on fire
this fire was already burning itself out
the flames now died down and were lost in the black smoke  now suddenly flared up again brightly  lighting up with strange distinctness the faces of the people crowding at the crossroads
black figures flitted about before the fire  and through the incessant crackling of the flames talking and shouting could be heard
seeing that his trap would not be able to move on for some time  alpatych got down and turned into the side street to look at the fire
soldiers were continually rushing backwards and forwards near it  and he saw two of them and a man in a frieze coat dragging burning beams into another yard across the street  while others carried bundles of hay alpatych went up to a large crowd standing before a high barn which was blazing briskly
the walls were all on fire and the back wall had fallen in  the wooden roof was collapsing  and the rafters were alight
the crowd was evidently watching for the roof to fall in  and alpatych watched for it too
"alpatych " a familiar voice suddenly hailed the old man
"mercy on us  your excellency " answered alpatych  immediately recognizing the voice of his young prince
prince andrew in his riding cloak  mounted on a black horse  was looking at alpatych from the back of the crowd
"why are you here " he asked
"your  
your excellency " stammered alpatych and broke into sobs
"are we really lost  master    " "why are you here " prince andrew repeated
at that moment the flames flared up and showed his young master's pale worn face
alpatych told how he had been sent there and how difficult it was to get away
"are we really quite lost  your excellency " he asked again
began writing in pencil on a page he tore out
he wrote to his sister  "smolensk is being abandoned
bald hills will be occupied by the enemy within a week
set off immediately for moscow
let me know at once when you will start
send by special messenger to usvyazh " having written this and given the paper to alpatych  he told him how to arrange for departure of the prince  the princess  his son  and the boy's tutor  and how and where to let him know immediately
before he had had time to finish giving these instructions  a chief of staff followed by a suite galloped up to him
"you are a colonel " shouted the chief of staff with a german accent  in a voice familiar to prince andrew
"houses are set on fire in your presence and you stand by  what does this mean  you will answer for it " shouted berg  who was now assistant to the chief of staff of the commander of the left flank of the infantry of the first army  a place  as berg said  "very agreeable and well en evidence " prince andrew looked at him and without replying went on speaking to alpatych
"so tell them that i shall await a reply till the tenth  and if by the tenth i don't receive news that they have all got away i shall have to throw up everything and come myself to bald hills " "prince " said berg  recognizing prince andrew  "i only spoke because i have to obey orders  because i always do obey exactly   
you must please excuse me " he went on apologetically
something cracked in the flames
the fire died down for a moment and wreaths of black smoke rolled from under the roof
there was another terrible crash and something huge collapsed
"ou rou rou " yelled the crowd  echoing the crash of the collapsing roof of the barn  the burning grain in which diffused a cakelike aroma all around
the flames flared up again  lighting the animated  delighted  exhausted faces of the spectators
the man in the frieze coat raised his arms and shouted  "it's fine  lads  now it's raging   it's fine " "that's the owner himself " cried several voices "well then " continued prince andrew to alpatych  "report to them as i have told you"  and not replying a word to berg who was now mute beside him  he touched his horse and rode down the side street
from smolensk the troops continued to retreat  followed by the enemy
on the tenth of august the regiment prince andrew commanded was marching along the highroad past the avenue leading to bald hills
heat and drought had continued for more than three weeks
each day fleecy clouds floated across the sky and occasionally veiled the sun  but toward evening the sky cleared again and the sun set in reddish brown mist
heavy night dews alone refreshed the earth
the unreaped corn was scorched and shed its grain
the marshes dried up
the cattle lowed from hunger  finding no food on the sun parched meadows
only at night and in the forests while the dew lasted was there any freshness
but on the road  the highroad along which the troops marched  there was no such freshness even at night or when the road passed through the forest  the dew was imperceptible on the sandy dust churned up more than six inches deep
as soon as day dawned the march began
the artillery and baggage wagons moved noiselessly through the deep dust that rose to the very hubs of the wheels  and the infantry sank ankle deep in that soft  choking  hot dust that never cooled even at night
some of this dust was kneaded by the feet and wheels  while the rest rose and hung like a cloud over the troops  settling in eyes  ears  hair  and nostrils  and worst of all in the lungs of the men and beasts as they moved along that road
the higher the sun rose the higher rose that cloud of dust  and through the screen of its hot fine particles one could look with naked eye at the sun  which showed like a huge crimson ball in the unclouded sky there was no wind  and the men choked in that motionless atmosphere
they marched with handkerchiefs tied over their noses and mouths
when they passed through a village they all rushed to the wells and fought for the water and drank it down to the mud
prince andrew was in command of a regiment  and the management of that regiment  the welfare of the men and the necessity of receiving and giving orders  engrossed him
the burning of smolensk and its abandonment made an epoch in his life
a novel feeling of anger against the foe made him forget his own sorrow
he was entirely devoted to the affairs of his regiment and was considerate and kind to his men and officers
in the regiment they called him "our prince " were proud of him and loved him
but he was kind and gentle only to those of his regiment  to timokhin and the like—people quite new to him  belonging to a different world and who could not know and understand his past
as soon as he came across a former acquaintance or anyone from the staff  he bristled up immediately and grew spiteful  ironical  and contemptuous
everything that reminded him of his past was repugnant to him  and so in his relations with that former circle he confined himself to trying to do his duty and not to be unfair in truth everything presented itself in a dark and gloomy light to prince andrew  especially after the abandonment of smolensk on the sixth of august  he considered that it could and should have been defended  and after his sick father had had to flee to moscow  abandoning to pillage his dearly beloved bald hills which he had built and peopled
but despite this  thanks to his regiment  prince andrew had something to think about entirely apart from general questions
two days previously he had received news that his father  son  and sister had left for moscow  and though there was nothing for him to do at bald hills  prince andrew with a characteristic desire to foment his own grief decided that he must ride there
he ordered his horse to be saddled and  leaving his regiment on the march  rode to his father's estate where he had been born and spent his childhood
riding past the pond where there used always to be dozens of women chattering as they rinsed their linen or beat it with wooden beetles  prince andrew noticed that there was not a soul about and that the little washing wharf  torn from its place and half submerged  was floating on its side in the middle of the pond
he rode to the keeper's lodge
no one at the stone entrance gates of the drive and the door stood open
grass had already begun to grow on the garden paths  and horses and calves were straying in the english park
prince andrew rode up to the hothouse  some of the glass panes were broken  and of the trees in tubs some were overturned and others dried up
he called for taras the gardener  but no one replied
having gone round the corner of the hothouse to the ornamental garden  he saw that the carved garden fence was broken and branches of the plum trees had been torn off with the fruit
an old peasant whom prince andrew in his childhood had often seen at the gate was sitting on a green garden seat  plaiting a bast shoe
he was deaf and did not hear prince andrew ride up
he was sitting on the seat the old prince used to like to sit on  and beside him strips of bast were hanging on the broken and withered branch of a magnolia
prince andrew rode up to the house
several limes in the old garden had been cut down and a piebald mare and her foal were wandering in front of the house among the rosebushes
the shutters were all closed  except at one window which was open
a little serf boy  seeing prince andrew  ran into the house
alpatych  having sent his family away  was alone at bald hills and was sitting indoors reading the lives of the saints
on hearing that prince andrew had come  he went out with his spectacles on his nose  buttoning his coat  and  hastily stepping up  without a word began weeping and kissing prince andrew's knee
then  vexed at his own weakness  he turned away and began to report on the position of affairs
everything precious and valuable had been removed to bogucharovo
seventy quarters of grain had also been carted away
the hay and the spring corn  of which alpatych said there had been a remarkable crop that year  had been commandeered by the troops and mown down while still green
the peasants were ruined  some of them too had gone to bogucharovo  only a few remained
without waiting to hear him out  prince andrew asked  "when did my father and sister leave " meaning when did they leave for moscow
alpatych  understanding the question to refer to their departure for bogucharovo  replied that they had left on the seventh and again went into details concerning the estate management  asking for instructions
"am i to let the troops have the oats  and to take a receipt for them  we have still six hundred quarters left " he inquired
"what am i to say to him " thought prince andrew  looking down on the old man's bald head shining in the sun and seeing by the expression on his face that the old man himself understood how untimely such questions were and only asked them to allay his grief "yes  let them have it " replied prince andrew
"if you noticed some disorder in the garden " said alpatych  "it was impossible to prevent it
three regiments have been here and spent the night  dragoons mostly
i took down the name and rank of their commanding officer  to hand in a complaint about it " "well  and what are you going to do  will you stay here if the enemy occupies the place " asked prince andrew
alpatych turned his face to prince andrew  looked at him  and suddenly with a solemn gesture raised his arm
"he is my refuge  his will be done " he exclaimed
a group of bareheaded peasants was approaching across the meadow toward the prince
"well  good by " said prince andrew  bending over to alpatych
"you must go away too  take away what you can and tell the serfs to go to the ryazan estate or to the one near moscow " alpatych clung to prince andrew's leg and burst into sobs
gently disengaging himself  the prince spurred his horse and rode down the avenue at a gallop the old man was still sitting in the ornamental garden  like a fly impassive on the face of a loved one who is dead  tapping the last on which he was making the bast shoe  and two little girls  running out from the hot house carrying in their skirts plums they had plucked from the trees there  came upon prince andrew on seeing the young master  the elder one with frightened look clutched her younger companion by the hand and hid with her behind a birch tree  not stopping to pick up some green plums they had dropped prince andrew turned away with startled haste  unwilling to let them see that they had been observed
he was sorry for the pretty frightened little girl  was afraid of looking at her  and yet felt an irresistible desire to do so
a new sensation of comfort and relief came over him when  seeing these girls  he realized the existence of other human interests entirely aloof from his own and just as legitimate as those that occupied him
evidently these girls passionately desired one thing—to carry away and eat those green plums without being caught—and prince andrew shared their wish for the success of their enterprise he could not resist looking at them once more
believing their danger past  they sprang from their ambush and  chirruping something in their shrill little voices and holding up their skirts  their bare little sunburned feet scampered merrily and quickly across the meadow grass
prince andrew was somewhat refreshed by having ridden off the dusty highroad along which the troops were moving
but not far from bald hills he again came out on the road and overtook his regiment at its halting place by the dam of a small pond
it was past one o'clock
the sun  a red ball through the dust  burned and scorched his back intolerably through his black coat
the dust always hung motionless above the buzz of talk that came from the resting troops
there was no wind
as he crossed the dam prince andrew smelled the ooze and freshness of the pond
he longed to get into that water  however dirty it might be  and he glanced round at the pool from whence came sounds of shrieks and laughter
the small  muddy  green pond had risen visibly more than a foot  flooding the dam  because it was full of the naked white bodies of soldiers with brick red hands  necks  and faces  who were splashing about in it
all this naked white human flesh  laughing and shrieking  floundered about in that dirty pool like carp stuffed into a watering can  and the suggestion of merriment in that floundering mass rendered it specially pathetic
one fair haired young soldier of the third company  whom prince andrew knew and who had a strap round the calf of one leg  crossed himself  stepped back to get a good run  and plunged into the water  another  a dark noncommissioned officer who was always shaggy  stood up to his waist in the water joyfully wriggling his muscular figure and snorted with satisfaction as he poured the water over his head with hands blackened to the wrists there were sounds of men slapping one another  yelling  and puffing
everywhere on the bank  on the dam  and in the pond  there was healthy  white  muscular flesh
the officer  timokhin  with his red little nose  standing on the dam wiping himself with a towel  felt confused at seeing the prince  but made up his mind to address him nevertheless "it's very nice  your excellency  wouldn't you like to " said he
"it's dirty " replied prince andrew  making a grimace
"we'll clear it out for you in a minute " said timokhin  and  still undressed  ran off to clear the men out of the pond
"the prince wants to bathe " "what prince  ours " said many voices  and the men were in such haste to clear out that the prince could hardly stop them
he decided that he would rather wash himself with water in the barn "flesh  bodies  cannon fodder " he thought  and he looked at his own naked body and shuddered  not from cold but from a sense of disgust and horror he did not himself understand  aroused by the sight of that immense number of bodies splashing about in the dirty pond on the seventh of august prince bagration wrote as follows from his quarters at mikhaylovna on the smolensk road  dear count alexis andreevich— he was writing to arakcheev but knew that his letter would be read by the emperor  and therefore weighed every word in it to the best of his ability   i expect the minister  barclay de tolly  has already reported the abandonment of smolensk to the enemy
it is pitiable and sad  and the whole army is in despair that this most important place has been wantonly abandoned
i  for my part  begged him personally most urgently and finally wrote him  but nothing would induce him to consent
i swear to you on my honor that napoleon was in such a fix as never before and might have lost half his army but could not have taken smolensk
our troops fought  and are fighting  as never before
with fifteen thousand men i held the enemy at bay for thirty five hours and beat him  but he would not hold out even for fourteen hours
it is disgraceful  a stain on our army  and as for him  he ought  it seems to me  not to live if he reports that our losses were great  it is not true  perhaps about four thousand  not more  and not even that  but even were they ten thousand  that's war  but the enemy has lost masses  
what would it have cost him to hold out for another two days  they would have had to retire of their own accord  for they had no water for men or horses
he gave me his word he would not retreat  but suddenly sent instructions that he was retiring that night
we cannot fight in this way  or we may soon bring the enemy to moscow  
there is a rumor that you are thinking of peace
god forbid that you should make peace after all our sacrifices and such insane retreats  you would set all russia against you and every one of us would feel ashamed to wear the uniform
if it has come to this—we must fight as long as russia can and as long as there are men able to stand  
one man ought to be in command  and not two
your minister may perhaps be good as a minister  but as a general he is not merely bad but execrable  yet to him is entrusted the fate of our whole country   
i am really frantic with vexation  forgive my writing boldly
it is clear that the man who advocates the conclusion of a peace  and that the minister should command the army  does not love our sovereign and desires the ruin of us all
so i write you frankly  call out the militia
for the minister is leading these visitors after him to moscow in a most masterly way
the whole army feels great suspicion of the imperial aide de camp wolzogen
he is said to be more napoleon's man than ours  and he is always advising the minister
i am not merely civil to him but obey him like a corporal  though i am his senior
this is painful  but  loving my benefactor and sovereign  i submit
only i am sorry for the emperor that he entrusts our fine army to such as he
consider that on our retreat we have lost by fatigue and left in the hospital more than fifteen thousand men  and had we attacked this would not have happened
tell me  for god's sake  what will russia  our mother russia  say to our being so frightened  and why are we abandoning our good and gallant fatherland to such rabble and implanting feelings of hatred and shame in all our subjects  what are we scared at and of whom are we afraid  i am not to blame that the minister is vacillating  a coward  dense  dilatory  and has all bad qualities
the whole army bewails it and calls down curses upon him  
among the innumerable categories applicable to the phenomena of human life one may discriminate between those in which substance prevails and those in which form prevails
to the latter—as distinguished from village  country  provincial  or even moscow life—we may allot petersburg life  and especially the life of its salons
that life of the salons is unchanging
since the year 1805 we had made peace and had again quarreled with bonaparte and had made constitutions and unmade them again  but the salons of anna pavlovna and helene remained just as they had been—the one seven and the other five years before
at anna pavlovna's they talked with perplexity of bonaparte's successes just as before and saw in them and in the subservience shown to him by the european sovereigns a malicious conspiracy  the sole object of which was to cause unpleasantness and anxiety to the court circle of which anna pavlovna was the representative
and in helene's salon  which rumyantsev himself honored with his visits  regarding helene as a remarkably intelligent woman  they talked with the same ecstasy in 1812 as in 1808 of the "great nation" and the "great man " and regretted our rupture with france  a rupture which  according to them  ought to be promptly terminated by peace of late  since the emperor's return from the army  there had been some excitement in these conflicting salon circles and some demonstrations of hostility to one another  but each camp retained its own tendency
in anna pavlovna's circle only those frenchmen were admitted who were deep rooted legitimists  and patriotic views were expressed to the effect that one ought not to go to the french theater and that to maintain the french troupe was costing the government as much as a whole army corps
the progress of the war was eagerly followed  and only the reports most flattering to our army were circulated
in the french circle of helene and rumyantsev the reports of the cruelty of the enemy and of the war were contradicted and all napoleon's attempts at conciliation were discussed
in that circle they discountenanced those who advised hurried preparations for a removal to kazan of the court and the girls' educational establishments under the patronage of the dowager empress
in helene's circle the war in general was regarded as a series of formal demonstrations which would very soon end in peace  and the view prevailed expressed by bilibin—who now in petersburg was quite at home in helene's house  which every clever man was obliged to visit—that not by gunpowder but by those who invented it would matters be settled
in that circle the moscow enthusiasm—news of which had reached petersburg simultaneously with the emperor's return—was ridiculed sarcastically and very cleverly  though with much caution
anna pavlovna's circle on the contrary was enraptured by this enthusiasm and spoke of it as plutarch speaks of the deeds of the ancients
prince vasili  who still occupied his former important posts  formed a connecting link between these two circles
he visited his "good friend anna pavlovna" as well as his daughter's "diplomatic salon " and often in his constant comings and goings between the two camps became confused and said at helene's what he should have said at anna pavlovna's and vice versa
soon after the emperor's return prince vasili in a conversation about the war at anna pavlovna's severely condemned barclay de tolly  but was undecided as to who ought to be appointed commander in chief
one of the visitors  usually spoken of as "a man of great merit " having described how he had that day seen kutuzov  the newly chosen chief of the petersburg militia  presiding over the enrollment of recruits at the treasury  cautiously ventured to suggest that kutuzov would be the man to satisfy all requirements
anna pavlovna remarked with a melancholy smile that kutuzov had done nothing but cause the emperor annoyance
"i have talked and talked at the assembly of the nobility " prince vasili interrupted  "but they did not listen to me
i told them his election as chief of the militia would not please the emperor
they did not listen to me
"it's all this mania for opposition " he went on
"and who for  it is all because we want to ape the foolish enthusiasm of those muscovites " prince vasili continued  forgetting for a moment that though at helene's one had to ridicule the moscow enthusiasm  at anna pavlovna's one had to be ecstatic about it
but he retrieved his mistake at once
"now  is it suitable that count kutuzov  the oldest general in russia  should preside at that tribunal  he will get nothing for his pains  how could they make a man commander in chief who cannot mount a horse  who drops asleep at a council  and has the very worst morals  a good reputation he made for himself at bucharest  i don't speak of his capacity as a general  but at a time like this how they appoint a decrepit  blind old man  positively blind  a fine idea to have a blind general  he can't see anything to play blindman's bluff  he can't see at all " no one replied to his remarks
this was quite correct on the twenty fourth of july
but on the twenty ninth of july kutuzov received the title of prince
this might indicate a wish to get rid of him  and therefore prince vasili's opinion continued to be correct though he was not now in any hurry to express it
but on the eighth of august a committee  consisting of field marshal saltykov  arakcheev  vyazmitinov  lopukhin  and kochubey met to consider the progress of the war
this committee came to the conclusion that our failures were due to a want of unity in the command and though the members of the committee were aware of the emperor's dislike of kutuzov  after a short deliberation they agreed to advise his appointment as commander in chief
that same day kutuzov was appointed commander in chief with full powers over the armies and over the whole region occupied by them
on the ninth of august prince vasili at anna pavlovna's again met the "man of great merit " the latter was very attentive to anna pavlovna because he wanted to be appointed director of one of the educational establishments for young ladies
prince vasili entered the room with the air of a happy conqueror who has attained the object of his desires
"well  have you heard the great news  prince kutuzov is field marshal  all dissensions are at an end  i am so glad  so delighted  at last we have a man " said he  glancing sternly and significantly round at everyone in the drawing room
the "man of great merit " despite his desire to obtain the post of director  could not refrain from reminding prince vasili of his former opinion
though this was impolite to prince vasili in anna pavlovna's drawing room  and also to anna pavlovna herself who had received the news with delight  he could not resist the temptation
"but  prince  they say he is blind " said he  reminding prince vasili of his own words
"eh  nonsense  he sees well enough " said prince vasili rapidly  in a deep voice and with a slight cough—the voice and cough with which he was wont to dispose of all difficulties
"he sees well enough " he added
"and what i am so pleased about " he went on  "is that our sovereign has given him full powers over all the armies and the whole region—powers no commander in chief ever had before
he is a second autocrat " he concluded with a victorious smile
"god grant it  god grant it " said anna pavlovna
the "man of great merit " who was still a novice in court circles  wishing to flatter anna pavlovna by defending her former position on this question  observed  "it is said that the emperor was reluctant to give kutuzov those powers
they say he blushed like a girl to whom joconde is read  when he said to kutuzov  'your emperor and the fatherland award you this honor '" "perhaps the heart took no part in that speech " said anna pavlovna
"oh  no  no " warmly rejoined prince vasili  who would not now yield kutuzov to anyone  in his opinion kutuzov was not only admirable himself  but was adored by everybody "no  that's impossible " said he  "for our sovereign appreciated him so highly before " "god grant only that prince kutuzov assumes real power and does not allow anyone to put a spoke in his wheel " observed anna pavlovna
understanding at once to whom she alluded  prince vasili said in a whisper  "i know for a fact that kutuzov made it an absolute condition that the tsarevich should not be with the army
do you know what he said to the emperor " and prince vasili repeated the words supposed to have been spoken by kutuzov to the emperor
"i can neither punish him if he does wrong nor reward him if he does right " "oh  a very wise man is prince kutuzov  i have known him a long time " "they even say " remarked the "man of great merit" who did not yet possess courtly tact  "that his excellency made it an express condition that the sovereign himself should not be with the army " as soon as he said this both prince vasili and anna pavlovna turned away from him and glanced sadly at one another with a sigh at his naivete while this was taking place in petersburg the french had already passed smolensk and were drawing nearer and nearer to moscow
napoleon's historian thiers  like other of his historians  trying to justify his hero says that he was drawn to the walls of moscow against his will
he is as right as other historians who look for the explanation of historic events in the will of one man  he is as right as the russian historians who maintain that napoleon was drawn to moscow by the skill of the russian commanders
here besides the law of retrospection  which regards all the past as a preparation for events that subsequently occur  the law of reciprocity comes in  confusing the whole matter
a good chessplayer having lost a game is sincerely convinced that his loss resulted from a mistake he made and looks for that mistake in the opening  but forgets that at each stage of the game there were similar mistakes and that none of his moves were perfect
he only notices the mistake to which he pays attention  because his opponent took advantage of it
how much more complex than this is the game of war  which occurs under certain limits of time  and where it is not one will that manipulates lifeless objects  but everything results from innumerable conflicts of various wills  after smolensk napoleon sought a battle beyond dorogobuzh at vyazma  and then at tsarevo zaymishche  but it happened that owing to a conjunction of innumerable circumstances the russians could not give battle till they reached borodino  seventy miles from moscow from vyazma napoleon ordered a direct advance on moscow
moscou  la capitale asiatique de ce grand empire  la ville sacree des peuples d'alexandre  moscou avec ses innombrables eglises en forme de pagodes chinoises  * this moscow gave napoleon's imagination no rest
on the march from vyazma to tsarevo zaymishche he rode his light bay bobtailed ambler accompanied by his guards  his bodyguard  his pages  and aides de camp
berthier  his chief of staff  dropped behind to question a russian prisoner captured by the cavalry
followed by lelorgne d'ideville  an interpreter  he overtook napoleon at a gallop and reined in his horse with an amused expression
* "moscow  the asiatic capital of this great empire  the sacred city of alexander's people  moscow with its innumerable churches shaped like chinese pagodas " "well " asked napoleon
"one of platov's cossacks says that platov's corps is joining up with the main army and that kutuzov has been appointed commander in chief
he is a very shrewd and garrulous fellow " napoleon smiled and told them to give the cossack a horse and bring the man to him
he wished to talk to him himself several adjutants galloped off  and an hour later  lavrushka  the serf denisov had handed over to rostov  rode up to napoleon in an orderly's jacket and on a french cavalry saddle  with a merry  and tipsy face
napoleon told him to ride by his side and began questioning him
"you are a cossack " "yes  a cossack  your honor " "the cossack  not knowing in what company he was  for napoleon's plain appearance had nothing about it that would reveal to an oriental mind the presence of a monarch  talked with extreme familiarity of the incidents of the war " says thiers  narrating this episode
in reality lavrushka  having got drunk the day before and left his master dinnerless  had been whipped and sent to the village in quest of chickens  where he engaged in looting till the french took him prisoner
lavrushka was one of those coarse  bare faced lackeys who have seen all sorts of things  consider it necessary to do everything in a mean and cunning way  are ready to render any sort of service to their master  and are keen at guessing their master's baser impulses  especially those prompted by vanity and pettiness
finding himself in the company of napoleon  whose identity he had easily and surely recognized  lavrushka was not in the least abashed but merely did his utmost to gain his new master's favor he knew very well that this was napoleon  but napoleon's presence could no more intimidate him than rostov's  or a sergeant major's with the rods  would have done  for he had nothing that either the sergeant major or napoleon could deprive him of
so he rattled on  telling all the gossip he had heard among the orderlies
much of it true
but when napoleon asked him whether the russians thought they would beat bonaparte or not  lavrushka screwed up his eyes and considered
in this question he saw subtle cunning  as men of his type see cunning in everything  so he frowned and did not answer immediately
"it's like this " he said thoughtfully  "if there's a battle soon  yours will win
that's right
but if three days pass  then after that  well  then that same battle will not soon be over " lelorgne d'ideville smilingly interpreted this speech to napoleon thus  "if a battle takes place within the next three days the french will win  but if later  god knows what will happen " napoleon did not smile  though he was evidently in high good humor  and he ordered these words to be repeated
lavrushka noticed this and to entertain him further  pretending not to know who napoleon was  added  "we know that you have bonaparte and that he has beaten everybody in the world  but we are a different matter   "—without knowing why or how this bit of boastful patriotism slipped out at the end
the interpreter translated these words without the last phrase  and bonaparte smiled
"the young cossack made his mighty interlocutor smile " says thiers
after riding a few paces in silence  napoleon turned to berthier and said he wished to see how the news that he was talking to the emperor himself  to that very emperor who had written his immortally victorious name on the pyramids  would affect this enfant du don * * "child of the don " the fact was accordingly conveyed to lavrushka
lavrushka  understanding that this was done to perplex him and that napoleon expected him to be frightened  to gratify his new masters promptly pretended to be astonished and awe struck  opened his eyes wide  and assumed the expression he usually put on when taken to be whipped
"as soon as napoleon's interpreter had spoken " says thiers  "the cossack  seized by amazement  did not utter another word  but rode on  his eyes fixed on the conqueror whose fame had reached him across the steppes of the east
all his loquacity was suddenly arrested and replaced by a naive and silent feeling of admiration
napoleon  after making the cossack a present  had him set free like a bird restored to its native fields " napoleon rode on  dreaming of the moscow that so appealed to his imagination  and "the bird restored to its native fields" galloped to our outposts  inventing on the way all that had not taken place but that he meant to relate to his comrades what had really taken place he did not wish to relate because it seemed to him not worth telling
he found the cossacks  inquired for the regiment operating with platov's detachment and by evening found his master  nicholas rostov  quartered at yankovo
rostov was just mounting to go for a ride round the neighboring villages with ilyin  he let lavrushka have another horse and took him along with him
princess mary was not in moscow and out of danger as prince andrew supposed
after the return of alpatych from smolensk the old prince suddenly seemed to awake as from a dream
he ordered the militiamen to be called up from the villages and armed  and wrote a letter to the commander in chief informing him that he had resolved to remain at bald hills to the last extremity and to defend it  leaving to the commander in chief's discretion to take measures or not for the defense of bald hills  where one of russia's oldest generals would be captured or killed  and he announced to his household that he would remain at bald hills
but while himself remaining  he gave instructions for the departure of the princess and dessalles with the little prince to bogucharovo and thence to moscow princess mary  alarmed by her father's feverish and sleepless activity after his previous apathy  could not bring herself to leave him alone and for the first time in her life ventured to disobey him
she refused to go away and her father's fury broke over her in a terrible storm
he repeated every injustice he had ever inflicted on her
trying to convict her  he told her she had worn him out  had caused his quarrel with his son  had harbored nasty suspicions of him  making it the object of her life to poison his existence  and he drove her from his study telling her that if she did not go away it was all the same to him
he declared that he did not wish to remember her existence and warned her not to dare to let him see her
the fact that he did not  as she had feared  order her to be carried away by force but only told her not to let him see her cheered princess mary
she knew it was a proof that in the depth of his soul he was glad she was remaining at home and had not gone away
the morning after little nicholas had left  the old prince donned his full uniform and prepared to visit the commander in chief
his caleche was already at the door
princess mary saw him walk out of the house in his uniform wearing all his orders and go down the garden to review his armed peasants and domestic serfs
she sat by the window listening to his voice which reached her from the garden
suddenly several men came running up the avenue with frightened faces
princess mary ran out to the porch  down the flower bordered path  and into the avenue
a large crowd of militiamen and domestics were moving toward her  and in their midst several men were supporting by the armpits and dragging along a little old man in a uniform and decorations
she ran up to him and  in the play of the sunlight that fell in small round spots through the shade of the lime tree avenue  could not be sure what change there was in his face
all she could see was that his former stern and determined expression had altered to one of timidity and submission
on seeing his daughter he moved his helpless lips and made a hoarse sound
it was impossible to make out what he wanted
he was lifted up  carried to his study  and laid on the very couch he had so feared of late
the doctor  who was fetched that same night  bled him and said that the prince had had a seizure paralyzing his right side it was becoming more and more dangerous to remain at bald hills  and next day they moved the prince to bogucharovo  the doctor accompanying him
by the time they reached bogucharovo  dessalles and the little prince had already left for moscow
for three weeks the old prince lay stricken by paralysis in the new house prince andrew had built at bogucharovo  ever in the same state  getting neither better nor worse
he was unconscious and lay like a distorted corpse
he muttered unceasingly  his eyebrows and lips twitching  and it was impossible to tell whether he understood what was going on around him or not
one thing was certain—that he was suffering and wished to say something
but what it was  no one could tell  it might be some caprice of a sick and half crazy man  or it might relate to public affairs  or possibly to family concerns
the doctor said this restlessness did not mean anything and was due to physical causes  but princess mary thought he wished to tell her something  and the fact that her presence always increased his restlessness confirmed her opinion
he was evidently suffering both physically and mentally
there was no hope of recovery
it was impossible for him to travel  it would not do to let him die on the road
"would it not be better if the end did come  the very end " princess mary sometimes thought
night and day  hardly sleeping at all  she watched him and  terrible to say  often watched him not with hope of finding signs of improvement but wishing to find symptoms of the approach of the end strange as it was to her to acknowledge this feeling in herself  yet there it was
and what seemed still more terrible to her was that since her father's illness began  perhaps even sooner  when she stayed with him expecting something to happen   all the personal desires and hopes that had been forgotten or sleeping within her had awakened
thoughts that had not entered her mind for years— thoughts of a life free from the fear of her father  and even the possibility of love and of family happiness—floated continually in her imagination like temptations of the devil
thrust them aside as she would  questions continually recurred to her as to how she would order her life now  after that
these were temptations of the devil and princess mary knew it
she knew that the sole weapon against him was prayer  and she tried to pray
she assumed an attitude of prayer  looked at the icons  repeated the words of a prayer  but she could not pray
she felt that a different world had now taken possession of her—the life of a world of strenuous and free activity  quite opposed to the spiritual world in which till now she had been confined and in which her greatest comfort had been prayer
she could not pray  could not weep  and worldly cares took possession of her
it was becoming dangerous to remain in bogucharovo
news of the approach of the french came from all sides  and in one village  ten miles from bogucharovo  a homestead had been looted by french marauders
the doctor insisted on the necessity of moving the prince  the provincial marshal of the nobility sent an official to princess mary to persuade her to get away as quickly as possible  and the head of the rural police having come to bogucharovo urged the same thing  saying that the french were only some twenty five miles away  that french proclamations were circulating in the villages  and that if the princess did not take her father away before the fifteenth  he could not answer for the consequences
the princess decided to leave on the fifteenth
the cares of preparation and giving orders  for which everyone came to her  occupied her all day
she spent the night of the fourteenth as usual  without undressing  in the room next to the one where the prince lay
several times  waking up  she heard his groans and muttering  the creak of his bed  and the steps of tikhon and the doctor when they turned him over
several times she listened at the door  and it seemed to her that his mutterings were louder than usual and that they turned him over oftener
she could not sleep and several times went to the door and listened  wishing to enter but not deciding to do so
though he did not speak  princess mary saw and knew how unpleasant every sign of anxiety on his account was to him
she had noticed with what dissatisfaction he turned from the look she sometimes involuntarily fixed on him
she knew that her going in during the night at an unusual hour would irritate him
but never had she felt so grieved for him or so much afraid of losing him
she recalled all her life with him and in every word and act of his found an expression of his love of her
occasionally amid these memories temptations of the devil would surge into her imagination  thoughts of how things would be after his death  and how her new  liberated life would be ordered
but she drove these thoughts away with disgust
toward morning he became quiet and she fell asleep
she woke late
that sincerity which often comes with waking showed her clearly what chiefly concerned her about her father's illness
on waking she listened to what was going on behind the door and  hearing him groan  said to herself with a sigh that things were still the same
"but what could have happened  what did i want  i want his death " she cried with a feeling of loathing for herself
she washed  dressed  said her prayers  and went out to the porch
in front of it stood carriages without horses and things were being packed into the vehicles
it was a warm  gray morning
princess mary stopped at the porch  still horrified by her spiritual baseness and trying to arrange her thoughts before going to her father
the doctor came downstairs and went out to her
"he is a little better today " said he
"i was looking for you
one can make out something of what he is saying
his head is clearer
come in  he is asking for you   " princess mary's heart beat so violently at this news that she grew pale and leaned against the wall to keep from falling
to see him  talk to him  feel his eyes on her now that her whole soul was overflowing with those dreadful  wicked temptations  was a torment of joy and terror
"come " said the doctor
princess mary entered her father's room and went up to his bed
he was lying on his back propped up high  and his small bony hands with their knotted purple veins were lying on the quilt  his left eye gazed straight before him  his right eye was awry  and his brows and lips motionless
he seemed altogether so thin  small  and pathetic
his face seemed to have shriveled or melted  his features had grown smaller
princess mary went up and kissed his hand
his left hand pressed hers so that she understood that he had long been waiting for her to come
he twitched her hand  and his brows and lips quivered angrily
she looked at him in dismay trying to guess what he wanted of her
when she changed her position so that his left eye could see her face he calmed down  not taking his eyes off her for some seconds
then his lips and tongue moved  sounds came  and he began to speak  gazing timidly and imploringly at her  evidently afraid that she might not understand
straining all her faculties princess mary looked at him
the comic efforts with which he moved his tongue made her drop her eyes and with difficulty repress the sobs that rose to her throat
he said something  repeating the same words several times
she could not understand them  but tried to guess what he was saying and inquiringly repeated the words he uttered
"mmm   ar   ate   ate   " he repeated several times
it was quite impossible to understand these sounds
the doctor thought he had guessed them  and inquiringly repeated  "mary  are you afraid " the prince shook his head  again repeated the same sounds
"my mind  my mind aches " questioned princess mary
he made a mumbling sound in confirmation of this  took her hand  and began pressing it to different parts of his breast as if trying to find the right place for it
"always thoughts  
about you  
thoughts   " he then uttered much more clearly than he had done before  now that he was sure of being understood
princess mary pressed her head against his hand  trying to hide her sobs and tears
he moved his hand over her hair
"i have been calling you all night   " he brought out
"if only i had known   " she said through her tears
"i was afraid to come in " he pressed her hand
"weren't you asleep " "no  i did not sleep " said princess mary  shaking her head
unconsciously imitating her father  she now tried to express herself as he did  as much as possible by signs  and her tongue too seemed to move with difficulty
"dear one  
dearest   " princess mary could not quite make out what he had said  but from his look it was clear that he had uttered a tender caressing word such as he had never used to her before
"why didn't you come in " "and i was wishing for his death " thought princess mary
he was silent awhile
"thank you  
daughter dear   
for all  for all  
forgive   
thank you   
forgive   
thank you    " and tears began to flow from his eyes
"call andrew " he said suddenly  and a childish  timid expression of doubt showed itself on his face as he spoke
he himself seemed aware that his demand was meaningless so at least it seemed to princess mary
"i have a letter from him " she replied
he glanced at her with timid surprise
"where is he " "he's with the army  father  at smolensk " he closed his eyes and remained silent a long time
then as if in answer to his doubts and to confirm the fact that now he understood and remembered everything  he nodded his head and reopened his eyes
"yes " he said  softly and distinctly
"russia has perished
they've destroyed her " and he began to sob  and again tears flowed from his eyes
princess mary could no longer restrain herself and wept while she gazed at his face
again he closed his eyes
his sobs ceased  he pointed to his eyes  and tikhon  understanding him  wiped away the tears
then he again opened his eyes and said something none of them could understand for a long time  till at last tikhon understood and repeated it
princess mary had sought the meaning of his words in the mood in which he had just been speaking
she thought he was speaking of russia  or prince andrew  of herself  of his grandson  or of his own death  and so she could not guess his words
"put on your white dress
i like it " was what he said
having understood this princess mary sobbed still louder  and the doctor taking her arm led her out to the veranda  soothing her and trying to persuade her to prepare for her journey
when she had left the room the prince again began speaking about his son  about the war  and about the emperor  angrily twitching his brows and raising his hoarse voice  and then he had a second and final stroke
princess mary stayed on the veranda
the day had cleared  it was hot and sunny
she could understand nothing  think of nothing and feel nothing  except passionate love for her father  love such as she thought she had never felt till that moment
she ran out sobbing into the garden and as far as the pond  along the avenues of young lime trees prince andrew had planted
"yes  
i  
i  
i wished for his death  yes  i wanted it to end quicker   
i wished to be at peace   
and what will become of me  what use will peace be when he is no longer here " princess mary murmured  pacing the garden with hurried steps and pressing her hands to her bosom which heaved with convulsive sobs
when she had completed the tour of the garden  which brought her again to the house  she saw mademoiselle bourienne—who had remained at bogucharovo and did not wish to leave it—coming toward her with a stranger
this was the marshal of the nobility of the district  who had come personally to point out to the princess the necessity for her prompt departure
princess mary listened without understanding him  she led him to the house  offered him lunch  and sat down with him
then  excusing herself  she went to the door of the old prince's room
the doctor came out with an agitated face and said she could not enter
"go away  princess  go away  
go away " she returned to the garden and sat down on the grass at the foot of the slope by the pond  where no one could see her
she did not know how long she had been there when she was aroused by the sound of a woman's footsteps running along the path
she rose and saw dunyasha her maid  who was evidently looking for her  and who stopped suddenly as if in alarm on seeing her mistress
"please come  princess  
the prince " said dunyasha in a breaking voice
"immediately  i'm coming  i'm coming " replied the princess hurriedly  not giving dunyasha time to finish what she was saying  and trying to avoid seeing the girl she ran toward the house
"princess  it's god's will  you must be prepared for everything " said the marshal  meeting her at the house door
"let me alone  it's not true " she cried angrily to him
the doctor tried to stop her
she pushed him aside and ran to her father's door
"why are these people with frightened faces stopping me  i don't want any of them  and what are they doing here " she thought
she opened the door and the bright daylight in that previously darkened room startled her
in the room were her nurse and other women
they all drew back from the bed  making way for her
he was still lying on the bed as before  but the stern expression of his quiet face made princess mary stop short on the threshold
"no  he's not dead—it's impossible " she told herself and approached him  and repressing the terror that seized her  she pressed her lips to his cheek
but she stepped back immediately
all the force of the tenderness she had been feeling for him vanished instantly and was replaced by a feeling of horror at what lay there before her
"no  he is no more  he is not  but here where he was is something unfamiliar and hostile  some dreadful  terrifying  and repellent mystery " and hiding her face in her hands  princess mary sank into the arms of the doctor  who held her up in the presence of tikhon and the doctor the women washed what had been the prince  tied his head up with a handkerchief that the mouth should not stiffen while open  and with another handkerchief tied together the legs that were already spreading apart
then they dressed him in uniform with his decorations and placed his shriveled little body on a table
heaven only knows who arranged all this and when  but it all got done as if of its own accord
toward night candles were burning round his coffin  a pall was spread over it  the floor was strewn with sprays of juniper  a printed band was tucked in under his shriveled head  and in a corner of the room sat a chanter reading the psalms just as horses shy and snort and gather about a dead horse  so the inmates of the house and strangers crowded into the drawing room round the coffin—the marshal  the village elder  peasant women—and all with fixed and frightened eyes  crossing themselves  bowed and kissed the old prince's cold and stiffened hand until prince andrew settled in bogucharovo its owners had always been absentees  and its peasants were of quite a different character from those of bald hills
they differed from them in speech  dress  and disposition
they were called steppe peasants
the old prince used to approve of them for their endurance at work when they came to bald hills to help with the harvest or to dig ponds  and ditches  but he disliked them for their boorishness
prince andrew's last stay at bogucharovo  when he introduced hospitals and schools and reduced the quitrent the peasants had to pay  had not softened their disposition but had on the contrary strengthened in them the traits of character the old prince called boorishness
various obscure rumors were always current among them  at one time a rumor that they would all be enrolled as cossacks  at another of a new religion to which they were all to be converted  then of some proclamation of the tsar's and of an oath to the tsar paul in 1797  in connection with which it was rumored that freedom had been granted them but the landowners had stopped it   then of peter fedorovich's return to the throne in seven years' time  when everything would be made free and so "simple" that there would be no restrictions
rumors of the war with bonaparte and his invasion were connected in their minds with the same sort of vague notions of antichrist  the end of the world  and "pure freedom " in the vicinity of bogucharovo were large villages belonging to the crown or to owners whose serfs paid quitrent and could work where they pleased
there were very few resident landlords in the neighborhood and also very few domestic or literate serfs  and in the lives of the peasantry of those parts the mysterious undercurrents in the life of the russian people  the causes and meaning of which are so baffling to contemporaries  were more clearly and strongly noticeable than among others
one instance  which had occurred some twenty years before  was a movement among the peasants to emigrate to some unknown "warm rivers " hundreds of peasants  among them the bogucharovo folk  suddenly began selling their cattle and moving in whole families toward the southeast
as birds migrate to somewhere beyond the sea  so these men with their wives and children streamed to the southeast  to parts where none of them had ever been
they set off in caravans  bought their freedom one by one or ran away  and drove or walked toward the "warm rivers " many of them were punished  some sent to siberia  many died of cold and hunger on the road  many returned of their own accord  and the movement died down of itself just as it had sprung up  without apparent reason
but such undercurrents still existed among the people and gathered new forces ready to manifest themselves just as strangely  unexpectedly  and at the same time simply  naturally  and forcibly now in 1812  to anyone living in close touch with these people it was apparent that these undercurrents were acting strongly and nearing an eruption
alpatych  who had reached bogucharovo shortly before the old prince's death  noticed an agitation among the peasants  and that contrary to what was happening in the bald hills district  where over a radius of forty miles all the peasants were moving away and leaving their villages to be devastated by the cossacks  the peasants in the steppe region round bogucharovo were  it was rumored  in touch with the french  received leaflets from them that passed from hand to hand  and did not migrate
he learned from domestic serfs loyal to him that the peasant karp  who possessed great influence in the village commune and had recently been away driving a government transport  had returned with news that the cossacks were destroying deserted villages  but that the french did not harm them
alpatych also knew that on the previous day another peasant had even brought from the village of visloukhovo  which was occupied by the french  a proclamation by a french general that no harm would be done to the inhabitants  and if they remained they would be paid for anything taken from them
as proof of this the peasant had brought from visloukhovo a hundred rubles in notes  he did not know that they were false  paid to him in advance for hay
more important still  alpatych learned that on the morning of the very day he gave the village elder orders to collect carts to move the princess' luggage from bogucharovo  there had been a village meeting at which it had been decided not to move but to wait
yet there was no time to waste
on the fifteenth  the day of the old prince's death  the marshal had insisted on princess mary's leaving at once  as it was becoming dangerous
he had told her that after the sixteenth he could not be responsible for what might happen
on the evening of the day the old prince died the marshal went away  promising to return next day for the funeral
but this he was unable to do  for he received tidings that the french had unexpectedly advanced  and had barely time to remove his own family and valuables from his estate
for some thirty years bogucharovo had been managed by the village elder  dron  whom the old prince called by the diminutive "dronushka " dron was one of those physically and mentally vigorous peasants who grow big beards as soon as they are of age and go on unchanged till they are sixty or seventy  without a gray hair or the loss of a tooth  as straight and strong at sixty as at thirty
soon after the migration to the "warm rivers " in which he had taken part like the rest  dron was made village elder and overseer of bogucharovo  and had since filled that post irreproachably for twenty three years
the peasants feared him more than they did their master
the masters  both the old prince and the young  and the steward respected him and jestingly called him "the minister " during the whole time of his service dron had never been drunk or ill  never after sleepless nights or the hardest tasks had he shown the least fatigue  and though he could not read he had never forgotten a single money account or the number of quarters of flour in any of the endless cartloads he sold for the prince  nor a single shock of the whole corn crop on any single acre of the bogucharovo fields
alpatych  arriving from the devastated bald hills estate  sent for his dron on the day of the prince's funeral and told him to have twelve horses got ready for the princess' carriages and eighteen carts for the things to be removed from bogucharovo
though the peasants paid quitrent  alpatych thought no difficulty would be made about complying with this order  for there were two hundred and thirty households at work in bogucharovo and the peasants were well to do
but on hearing the order dron lowered his eyes and remained silent
alpatych named certain peasants he knew  from whom he told him to take the carts
dron replied that the horses of these peasants were away carting
alpatych named others  but they too  according to dron  had no horses available  some horses were carting for the government  others were too weak  and others had died for want of fodder
it seemed that no horses could be had even for the carriages  much less for the carting
alpatych looked intently at dron and frowned
just as dron was a model village elder  so alpatych had not managed the prince's estates for twenty years in vain
he was a model steward  possessing in the highest degree the faculty of divining the needs and instincts of those he dealt with
having glanced at dron he at once understood that his answers did not express his personal views but the general mood of the bogucharovo commune  by which the elder had already been carried away
but he also knew that dron  who had acquired property and was hated by the commune  must be hesitating between the two camps  the masters' and the serfs'
he noticed this hesitation in dron's look and therefore frowned and moved closer up to him
"now just listen  dronushka " said he
"don't talk nonsense to me
his excellency prince andrew himself gave me orders to move all the people away and not leave them with the enemy  and there is an order from the tsar about it too anyone who stays is a traitor to the tsar
do you hear " "i hear " dron answered without lifting his eyes
alpatych was not satisfied with this reply
"eh  dron  it will turn out badly " he said  shaking his head
"the power is in your hands " dron rejoined sadly
"eh  dron  drop it " alpatych repeated  withdrawing his hand from his bosom and solemnly pointing to the floor at dron's feet
"i can see through you and three yards into the ground under you " he continued  gazing at the floor in front of dron
dron was disconcerted  glanced furtively at alpatych and again lowered his eyes
"you drop this nonsense and tell the people to get ready to leave their homes and go to moscow and to get carts ready for tomorrow morning for the princess' things
and don't go to any meeting yourself  do you hear " dron suddenly fell on his knees
"yakov alpatych  discharge me  take the keys from me and discharge me  for christ's sake " "stop that " cried alpatych sternly
"i see through you and three yards under you " he repeated  knowing that his skill in beekeeping  his knowledge of the right time to sow the oats  and the fact that he had been able to retain the old prince's favor for twenty years had long since gained him the reputation of being a wizard  and that the power of seeing three yards under a man is considered an attribute of wizards
dron got up and was about to say something  but alpatych interrupted him
"what is it you have got into your heads  eh   
what are you thinking of  eh " "what am i to do with the people " said dron
"they're quite beside themselves  i have already told them   " "'told them ' i dare say " said alpatych "are they drinking " he asked abruptly
"quite beside themselves  yakov alpatych  they've fetched another barrel " "well  then  listen  i'll go to the police officer  and you tell them so  and that they must stop this and the carts must be got ready " "i understand " alpatych did not insist further he had managed people for a long time and knew that the chief way to make them obey is to show no suspicion that they can possibly disobey having wrung a submissive "i understand" from dron  alpatych contented himself with that  though he not only doubted but felt almost certain that without the help of troops the carts would not be forthcoming and so it was  for when evening came no carts had been provided
in the village  outside the drink shop  another meeting was being held  which decided that the horses should be driven out into the woods and the carts should not be provided
without saying anything of this to the princess  alpatych had his own belongings taken out of the carts which had arrived from bald hills and had those horses got ready for the princess' carriages
meanwhile he went himself to the police authorities after her father's funeral princess mary shut herself up in her room and did not admit anyone
a maid came to the door to say that alpatych was asking for orders about their departure
 this was before his talk with dron   princess mary raised herself on the sofa on which she had been lying and replied through the closed door that she did not mean to go away and begged to be left in peace
the windows of the room in which she was lying looked westward
she lay on the sofa with her face to the wall  fingering the buttons of the leather cushion and seeing nothing but that cushion  and her confused thoughts were centered on one subject—the irrevocability of death and her own spiritual baseness  which she had not suspected  but which had shown itself during her father's illness
she wished to pray but did not dare to  dared not in her present state of mind address herself to god
she lay for a long time in that position
the sun had reached the other side of the house  and its slanting rays shone into the open window  lighting up the room and part of the morocco cushion at which princess mary was looking
the flow of her thoughts suddenly stopped
unconsciously she sat up  smoothed her hair  got up  and went to the window  involuntarily inhaling the freshness of the clear but windy evening
"yes  you can well enjoy the evening now  he is gone and no one will hinder you " she said to herself  and sinking into a chair she let her head fall on the window sill
someone spoke her name in a soft and tender voice from the garden and kissed her head
she looked up
it was mademoiselle bourienne in a black dress and weepers
she softly approached princess mary  sighed  kissed her  and immediately began to cry
the princess looked up at her
all their former disharmony and her own jealousy recurred to her mind
but she remembered too how he had changed of late toward mademoiselle bourienne and could not bear to see her  thereby showing how unjust were the reproaches princess mary had mentally addressed to her
"besides  is it for me  for me who desired his death  to condemn anyone " she thought
princess mary vividly pictured to herself the position of mademoiselle bourienne  whom she had of late kept at a distance  but who yet was dependent on her and living in her house
she felt sorry for her and held out her hand with a glance of gentle inquiry
mademoiselle bourienne at once began crying again and kissed that hand  speaking of the princess' sorrow and making herself a partner in it
she said her only consolation was the fact that the princess allowed her to share her sorrow  that all the old misunderstandings should sink into nothing but this great grief  that she felt herself blameless in regard to everyone  and that he  from above  saw her affection and gratitude
the princess heard her  not heeding her words but occasionally looking up at her and listening to the sound of her voice
"your position is doubly terrible  dear princess " said mademoiselle bourienne after a pause
"i understand that you could not  and cannot  think of yourself  but with my love for you i must do so   
has alpatych been to you  has he spoken to you of going away " she asked
princess mary did not answer
she did not understand who was to go or where to
"is it possible to plan or think of anything now  is it not all the same " she thought  and did not reply
"you know  chere marie " said mademoiselle bourienne  "that we are in danger—are surrounded by the french
it would be dangerous to move now
if we go we are almost sure to be taken prisoners  and god knows   " princess mary looked at her companion without understanding what she was talking about
"oh  if anyone knew how little anything matters to me now " she said
"of course i would on no account wish to go away from him   
alpatych did say something about going   
speak to him  i can do nothing  nothing  and don't want to    " "i've spoken to him
he hopes we should be in time to get away tomorrow  but i think it would now be better to stay here " said mademoiselle bourienne
"because  you will agree  chere marie  to fall into the hands of the soldiers or of riotous peasants would be terrible " mademoiselle bourienne took from her reticule a proclamation  not printed on ordinary russian paper  of general rameau's  telling people not to leave their homes and that the french authorities would afford them proper protection
she handed this to the princess
"i think it would be best to appeal to that general " she continued  "and i am sure that all due respect would be shown you " princess mary read the paper  and her face began to quiver with stifled sobs
"from whom did you get this " she asked
"they probably recognized that i am french  by my name " replied mademoiselle bourienne blushing
princess mary  with the paper in her hand  rose from the window and with a pale face went out of the room and into what had been prince andrew's study
"dunyasha  send alpatych  or dronushka  or somebody to me " she said  "and tell mademoiselle bourienne not to come to me " she added  hearing mademoiselle bourienne's voice
"we must go at once  at once " she said  appalled at the thought of being left in the hands of the french
"if prince andrew heard that i was in the power of the french  that i  the daughter of prince nicholas bolkonski  asked general rameau for protection and accepted his favor " this idea horrified her  made her shudder  blush  and feel such a rush of anger and pride as she had never experienced before
all that was distressing  and especially all that was humiliating  in her position rose vividly to her mind
"they  the french  would settle in this house  m
le general rameau would occupy prince andrew's study and amuse himself by looking through and reading his letters and papers mademoiselle bourienne would do the honors of bogucharovo for him
i should be given a small room as a favor  the soldiers would violate my father's newly dug grave to steal his crosses and stars  they would tell me of their victories over the russians  and would pretend to sympathize with my sorrow   " thought princess mary  not thinking her own thoughts but feeling bound to think like her father and her brother
for herself she did not care where she remained or what happened to her  but she felt herself the representative of her dead father and of prince andrew
involuntarily she thought their thoughts and felt their feelings
what they would have said and what they would have done she felt bound to say and do
she went into prince andrew's study  trying to enter completely into his ideas  and considered her position
the demands of life  which had seemed to her annihilated by her father's death  all at once rose before her with a new  previously unknown force and took possession of her
agitated and flushed she paced the room  sending now for michael ivanovich and now for tikhon or dron
dunyasha  the nurse  and the other maids could not say in how far mademoiselle bourienne's statement was correct
alpatych was not at home  he had gone to the police
neither could the architect michael ivanovich  who on being sent for came in with sleepy eyes  tell princess mary anything
with just the same smile of agreement with which for fifteen years he had been accustomed to answer the old prince without expressing views of his own  he now replied to princess mary  so that nothing definite could be got from his answers
the old valet tikhon  with sunken  emaciated face that bore the stamp of inconsolable grief  replied  "yes  princess" to all princess mary's questions and hardly refrained from sobbing as he looked at her
at length dron  the village elder  entered the room and with a deep bow to princess mary came to a halt by the doorpost
princess mary walked up and down the room and stopped in front of him
"dronushka " she said  regarding as a sure friend this dronushka who always used to bring a special kind of gingerbread from his visit to the fair at vyazma every year and smilingly offer it to her  "dronushka  now since our misfortune   " she began  but could not go on
"we are all in god's hands " said he  with a sigh
they were silent for a while
"dronushka  alpatych has gone off somewhere and i have no one to turn to
is it true  as they tell me  that i can't even go away " "why shouldn't you go away  your excellency  you can go " said dron
"i was told it would be dangerous because of the enemy
dear friend  i can do nothing
i understand nothing
i have nobody  i want to go away tonight or early tomorrow morning " dron paused
he looked askance at princess mary and said  "there are no horses  i told yakov alpatych so " "why are there none " asked the princess
"it's all god's scourge " said dron
"what horses we had have been taken for the army or have died—this is such a year  it's not a case of feeding horses— we may die of hunger ourselves  as it is  some go three days without eating
we've nothing  we've been ruined " princess mary listened attentively to what he told her
"the peasants are ruined  they have no bread " she asked
"they're dying of hunger " said dron
"it's not a case of carting " "but why didn't you tell me  dronushka  isn't it possible to help them  i'll do all i can    " to princess mary it was strange that now  at a moment when such sorrow was filling her soul  there could be rich people and poor  and the rich could refrain from helping the poor
she had heard vaguely that there was such a thing as "landlord's corn" which was sometimes given to the peasants
she also knew that neither her father nor her brother would refuse to help the peasants in need  she only feared to make some mistake in speaking about the distribution of the grain she wished to give
she was glad such cares presented themselves  enabling her without scruple to forget her own grief she began asking dron about the peasants' needs and what there was in bogucharovo that belonged to the landlord
"but we have grain belonging to my brother " she said
"the landlord's grain is all safe " replied dron proudly
"our prince did not order it to be sold " "give it to the peasants  let them have all they need  i give you leave in my brother's name " said she
dron made no answer but sighed deeply
"give them that corn if there is enough of it
distribute it all
i give this order in my brother's name  and tell them that what is ours is theirs
we do not grudge them anything
tell them so " dron looked intently at the princess while she was speaking
"discharge me  little mother  for god's sake  order the keys to be taken from me " said he
"i have served twenty three years and have done no wrong
discharge me  for god's sake " princess mary did not understand what he wanted of her or why he was asking to be discharged
she replied that she had never doubted his devotion and that she was ready to do anything for him and for the peasants
an hour later dunyasha came to tell the princess that dron had come  and all the peasants had assembled at the barn by the princess' order and wished to have word with their mistress
"but i never told them to come " said princess mary
"i only told dron to let them have the grain " "only  for god's sake  princess dear  have them sent away and don't go out to them
it's all a trick " said dunyasha  "and when yakov alpatych returns let us get away  
and please don't   " "what is a trick " asked princess mary in surprise
"i know it is  only listen to me for god's sake  ask nurse too
they say they don't agree to leave bogucharovo as you ordered " "you're making some mistake
i never ordered them to go away " said princess mary
"call dronushka " dron came and confirmed dunyasha's words  the peasants had come by the princess' order
"but i never sent for them " declared the princess
"you must have given my message wrong
i only said that you were to give them the grain " dron only sighed in reply
"if you order it they will go away " said he
"no  no
i'll go out to them " said princess mary  and in spite of the nurse's and dunyasha's protests she went out into the porch  dron  dunyasha  the nurse  and michael ivanovich following her
"they probably think i am offering them the grain to bribe them to remain here  while i myself go away leaving them to the mercy of the french " thought princess mary
"i will offer them monthly rations and housing at our moscow estate
i am sure andrew would do even more in my place " she thought as she went out in the twilight toward the crowd standing on the pasture by the barn
the men crowded closer together  stirred  and rapidly took off their hats
princess mary lowered her eyes and  tripping over her skirt  came close up to them
so many different eyes  old and young  were fixed on her  and there were so many different faces  that she could not distinguish any of them and  feeling that she must speak to them all at once  did not know how to do it
but again the sense that she represented her father and her brother gave her courage  and she boldly began her speech
"i am very glad you have come " she said without raising her eyes  and feeling her heart beating quickly and violently
"dronushka tells me that the war has ruined you
that is our common misfortune  and i shall grudge nothing to help you
i am myself going away because it is dangerous here  
the enemy is near  
because  
i am giving you everything  my friends  and i beg you to take everything  all our grain  so that you may not suffer want  and if you have been told that i am giving you the grain to keep you here—that is not true
on the contrary  i ask you to go with all your belongings to our estate near moscow  and i promise you i will see to it that there you shall want for nothing
you shall be given food and lodging " the princess stopped
sighs were the only sound heard in the crowd
"i am not doing this on my own account " she continued  "i do it in the name of my dead father  who was a good master to you  and of my brother and his son " again she paused
no one broke the silence
"ours is a common misfortune and we will share it together
all that is mine is yours " she concluded  scanning the faces before her
all eyes were gazing at her with one and the same expression
she could not fathom whether it was curiosity  devotion  gratitude  or apprehension and distrust—but the expression on all the faces was identical
"we are all very thankful for your bounty  but it won't do for us to take the landlord's grain " said a voice at the back of the crowd
"but why not " asked the princess
no one replied and princess mary  looking round at the crowd  found that every eye she met now was immediately dropped
"but why don't you want to take it " she asked again
no one answered
the silence began to oppress the princess and she tried to catch someone's eye
"why don't you speak " she inquired of a very old man who stood just in front of her leaning on his stick
"if you think something more is wanted  tell me  i will do anything " said she  catching his eye
but as if this angered him  he bent his head quite low and muttered  "why should we agree  we don't want the grain " "why should we give up everything  we don't agree
don't agree   
we are sorry for you  but we're not willing
go away yourself  alone   " came from various sides of the crowd
and again all the faces in that crowd bore an identical expression  though now it was certainly not an expression of curiosity or gratitude  but of angry resolve
"but you can't have understood me " said princess mary with a sad smile
"why don't you want to go  i promise to house and feed you  while here the enemy would ruin you   " but her voice was drowned by the voices of the crowd
"we're not willing
let them ruin us  we won't take your grain
we don't agree " again princess mary tried to catch someone's eye  but not a single eye in the crowd was turned to her  evidently they were all trying to avoid her look
she felt strange and awkward
"oh yes  an artful tale  follow her into slavery  pull down your houses and go into bondage  i dare say  'i'll give you grain  indeed ' she says " voices in the crowd were heard saying
with drooping head princess mary left the crowd and went back to the house
having repeated her order to dron to have horses ready for her departure next morning  she went to her room and remained alone with her own thoughts
for a long time that night princess mary sat by the open window of her room hearing the sound of the peasants' voices that reached her from the village  but it was not of them she was thinking
she felt that she could not understand them however much she might think about them
she thought only of one thing  her sorrow  which  after the break caused by cares for the present  seemed already to belong to the past
now she could remember it and weep or pray
after sunset the wind had dropped
the night was calm and fresh
toward midnight the voices began to subside  a cock crowed  the full moon began to show from behind the lime trees  a fresh white dewy mist began to rise  and stillness reigned over the village and the house
pictures of the near past—her father's illness and last moments—rose one after another to her memory
with mournful pleasure she now lingered over these images  repelling with horror only the last one  the picture of his death  which she felt she could not contemplate even in imagination at this still and mystic hour of night
and these pictures presented themselves to her so clearly and in such detail that they seemed now present  now past  and now future she vividly recalled the moment when he had his first stroke and was being dragged along by his armpits through the garden at bald hills  muttering something with his helpless tongue  twitching his gray eyebrows and looking uneasily and timidly at her
"even then he wanted to tell me what he told me the day he died " she thought
"he had always thought what he said then " and she recalled in all its detail the night at bald hills before he had the last stroke  when with a foreboding of disaster she had remained at home against his will
she had not slept and had stolen downstairs on tiptoe  and going to the door of the conservatory where he slept that night had listened at the door
in a suffering and weary voice he was saying something to tikhon  speaking of the crimea and its warm nights and of the empress
evidently he had wanted to talk
"and why didn't he call me  why didn't he let me be there instead of tikhon " princess mary had thought and thought again now
"now he will never tell anyone what he had in his soul
never will that moment return for him or for me when he might have said all he longed to say  and not tikhon but i might have heard and understood him
why didn't i enter the room " she thought
"perhaps he would then have said to me what he said the day he died
while talking to tikhon he asked about me twice
he wanted to see me  and i was standing close by  outside the door
it was sad and painful for him to talk to tikhon who did not understand him
i remember how he began speaking to him about lise as if she were alive—he had forgotten she was dead—and tikhon reminded him that she was no more  and he shouted  'fool ' he was greatly depressed
from behind the door i heard how he lay down on his bed groaning and loudly exclaimed  'my god ' why didn't i go in then  what could he have done to me  what could i have lost  and perhaps he would then have been comforted and would have said that word to me " and princess mary uttered aloud the caressing word he had said to her on the day of his death
"dear est " she repeated  and began sobbing  with tears that relieved her soul
she now saw his face before her
and not the face she had known ever since she could remember and had always seen at a distance  but the timid  feeble face she had seen for the first time quite closely  with all its wrinkles and details  when she stooped near to his mouth to catch what he said
"dear est " she repeated again
"what was he thinking when he uttered that word  what is he thinking now " this question suddenly presented itself to her  and in answer she saw him before her with the expression that was on his face as he lay in his coffin with his chin bound up with a white handkerchief
and the horror that had seized her when she touched him and convinced herself that that was not he  but something mysterious and horrible  seized her again
she tried to think of something else and to pray  but could do neither
with wide open eyes she gazed at the moonlight and the shadows  expecting every moment to see his dead face  and she felt that the silence brooding over the house and within it held her fast
"dunyasha " she whispered
"dunyasha " she screamed wildly  and tearing herself out of this silence she ran to the servants' quarters to meet her old nurse and the maidservants who came running toward her
on the seventeenth of august rostov and ilyin  accompanied by lavrushka who had just returned from captivity and by an hussar orderly  left their quarters at yankovo  ten miles from bogucharovo  and went for a ride—to try a new horse ilyin had bought and to find out whether there was any hay to be had in the villages
for the last three days bogucharovo had lain between the two hostile armies  so that it was as easy for the russian rearguard to get to it as for the french vanguard  rostov  as a careful squadron commander  wished to take such provisions as remained at bogucharovo before the french could get them
rostov and ilyin were in the merriest of moods
on the way to bogucharovo  a princely estate with a dwelling house and farm where they hoped to find many domestic serfs and pretty girls  they questioned lavrushka about napoleon and laughed at his stories  and raced one another to try ilyin's horse
rostov had no idea that the village he was entering was the property of that very bolkonski who had been engaged to his sister
rostov and ilyin gave rein to their horses for a last race along the incline before reaching bogucharovo  and rostov  outstripping ilyin  was the first to gallop into the village street
"you're first " cried ilyin  flushed
"yes  always first both on the grassland and here " answered rostov  stroking his heated donets horse
"and i'd have won on my frenchy  your excellency " said lavrushka from behind  alluding to his shabby cart horse  "only i didn't wish to mortify you " they rode at a footpace to the barn  where a large crowd of peasants was standing
some of the men bared their heads  others stared at the new arrivals without doffing their caps
two tall old peasants with wrinkled faces and scanty beards emerged from the tavern  smiling  staggering  and singing some incoherent song  and approached the officers
"fine fellows " said rostov laughing
"is there any hay here " "and how like one another " said ilyin
"a mo o st me r r y co o m pa    " sang one of the peasants with a blissful smile
one of the men came out of the crowd and went up to rostov
"who do you belong to " he asked
"the french " replied ilyin jestingly  "and here is napoleon himself"—and he pointed to lavrushka "then you are russians " the peasant asked again
"and is there a large force of you here " said another  a short man  coming up
"very large " answered rostov
"but why have you collected here " he added
"is it a holiday " "the old men have met to talk over the business of the commune " replied the peasant  moving away
at that moment  on the road leading from the big house  two women and a man in a white hat were seen coming toward the officers
"the one in pink is mine  so keep off " said ilyin on seeing dunyasha running resolutely toward him
"she'll be ours " said lavrushka to ilyin  winking
"what do you want  my pretty " said ilyin with a smile
"the princess ordered me to ask your regiment and your name " "this is count rostov  squadron commander  and i am your humble servant " "co o om pa ny " roared the tipsy peasant with a beatific smile as he looked at ilyin talking to the girl
following dunyasha  alpatych advanced to rostov  having bared his head while still at a distance
"may i make bold to trouble your honor " said he respectfully  but with a shade of contempt for the youthfulness of this officer and with a hand thrust into his bosom
"my mistress  daughter of general in chief prince nicholas bolkonski who died on the fifteenth of this month  finding herself in difficulties owing to the boorishness of these people"—he pointed to the peasants—"asks you to come up to the house   
won't you  please  ride on a little farther " said alpatych with a melancholy smile  "as it is not convenient in the presence of    " he pointed to the two peasants who kept as close to him as horseflies to a horse
"ah   
alpatych  
ah  yakov alpatych  
grand  forgive us for christ's sake  eh " said the peasants  smiling joyfully at him
rostov looked at the tipsy peasants and smiled
"or perhaps they amuse your honor " remarked alpatych with a staid air  as he pointed at the old men with his free hand
"no  there's not much to be amused at here " said rostov  and rode on a little way
"what's the matter " he asked
"i make bold to inform your honor that the rude peasants here don't wish to let the mistress leave the estate  and threaten to unharness her horses  so that though everything has been packed up since morning  her excellency cannot get away " "impossible " exclaimed rostov
"i have the honor to report to you the actual truth " said alpatych
rostov dismounted  gave his horse to the orderly  and followed alpatych to the house  questioning him as to the state of affairs
it appeared that the princess' offer of corn to the peasants the previous day  and her talk with dron and at the meeting  had actually had so bad an effect that dron had finally given up the keys and joined the peasants and had not appeared when alpatych sent for him  and that in the morning when the princess gave orders to harness for her journey  the peasants had come in a large crowd to the barn and sent word that they would not let her leave the village  that there was an order not to move  and that they would unharness the horses
alpatych had gone out to admonish them  but was told  it was chiefly karp who did the talking  dron not showing himself in the crowd  that they could not let the princess go  that there was an order to the contrary  but that if she stayed they would serve her as before and obey her in everything at the moment when rostov and ilyin were galloping along the road  princess mary  despite the dissuasions of alpatych  her nurse  and the maids  had given orders to harness and intended to start  but when the cavalrymen were espied they were taken for frenchmen  the coachman ran away  and the women in the house began to wail
"father  benefactor  god has sent you " exclaimed deeply moved voices as rostov passed through the anteroom
princess mary was sitting helpless and bewildered in the large sitting room  when rostov was shown in
she could not grasp who he was and why he had come  or what was happening to her
when she saw his russian face  and by his walk and the first words he uttered recognized him as a man of her own class  she glanced at him with her deep radiant look and began speaking in a voice that faltered and trembled with emotion
this meeting immediately struck rostov as a romantic event
"a helpless girl overwhelmed with grief  left to the mercy of coarse  rioting peasants  and what a strange fate sent me here  what gentleness and nobility there are in her features and expression " thought he as he looked at her and listened to her timid story
when she began to tell him that all this had happened the day after her father's funeral  her voice trembled
she turned away  and then  as if fearing he might take her words as meant to move him to pity  looked at him with an apprehensive glance of inquiry
there were tears in rostov's eyes
princess mary noticed this and glanced gratefully at him with that radiant look which caused the plainness of her face to be forgotten
"i cannot express  princess  how glad i am that i happened to ride here and am able to show my readiness to serve you " said rostov  rising
"go when you please  and i give you my word of honor that no one shall dare to cause you annoyance if only you will allow me to act as your escort " and bowing respectfully  as if to a lady of royal blood  he moved toward the door
rostov's deferential tone seemed to indicate that though he would consider himself happy to be acquainted with her  he did not wish to take advantage of her misfortunes to intrude upon her princess mary understood this and appreciated his delicacy
"i am very  very grateful to you " she said in french  "but i hope it was all a misunderstanding and that no one is to blame for it " she suddenly began to cry
"excuse me " she said
rostov  knitting his brows  left the room with another low bow
"well  is she pretty  ah  friend—my pink one is delicious  her name is dunyasha    " but on glancing at rostov's face ilyin stopped short
he saw that his hero and commander was following quite a different train of thought
rostov glanced angrily at ilyin and without replying strode off with rapid steps to the village
"i'll show them  i'll give it to them  the brigands " said he to himself alpatych at a gliding trot  only just managing not to run  kept up with him with difficulty
"what decision have you been pleased to come to " said he
rostov stopped and  clenching his fists  suddenly and sternly turned on alpatych
"decision  what decision  old dotard    " cried he
"what have you been about  eh  the peasants are rioting  and you can't manage them  you're a traitor yourself  i know you
i'll flay you all alive    " and as if afraid of wasting his store of anger  he left alpatych and went rapidly forward
alpatych  mastering his offended feelings  kept pace with rostov at a gliding gait and continued to impart his views
he said the peasants were obdurate and that at the present moment it would be imprudent to "overresist" them without an armed force  and would it not be better first to send for the military  "i'll give them armed force  
i'll 'overresist' them " uttered rostov meaninglessly  breathless with irrational animal fury and the need to vent it
without considering what he would do he moved unconciously with quick  resolute steps toward the crowd
and the nearer he drew to it the more alpatych felt that this unreasonable action might produce good results
the peasants in the crowd were similarly impressed when they saw rostov's rapid  firm steps and resolute  frowning face
after the hussars had come to the village and rostov had gone to see the princess  a certain confusion and dissension had arisen among the crowd
some of the peasants said that these new arrivals were russians and might take it amiss that the mistress was being detained
dron was of this opinion  but as soon as he expressed it karp and others attacked their ex elder
"how many years have you been fattening on the commune " karp shouted at him
"it's all one to you  you'll dig up your pot of money and take it away with you   
what does it matter to you whether our homes are ruined or not " "we've been told to keep order  and that no one is to leave their homes or take away a single grain  and that's all about it " cried another
"it was your son's turn to be conscripted  but no fear  you begrudged your lump of a son " a little old man suddenly began attacking dron—"and so they took my vanka to be shaved for a soldier  but we all have to die " "to be sure  we all have to die
i'm not against the commune " said dron
"that's it—not against it  you've filled your belly    " the two tall peasants had their say
as soon as rostov  followed by ilyin  lavrushka  and alpatych  came up to the crowd  karp  thrusting his fingers into his belt and smiling a little  walked to the front
dron on the contrary retired to the rear and the crowd drew closer together
"who is your elder here  hey " shouted rostov  coming up to the crowd with quick steps
"the elder  what do you want with him    " asked karp
but before the words were well out of his mouth  his cap flew off and a fierce blow jerked his head to one side
"caps off  traitors " shouted rostov in a wrathful voice
"where's the elder " he cried furiously
"the elder   
he wants the elder   
dron zakharych  you " meek and flustered voices here and there were heard calling and caps began to come off their heads
"we don't riot  we're following the orders " declared karp  and at that moment several voices began speaking together
"it's as the old men have decided—there's too many of you giving orders " "arguing  mutiny   
brigands  traitors " cried rostov unmeaningly in a voice not his own  gripping karp by the collar
"bind him  bind him " he shouted  though there was no one to bind him but lavrushka and alpatych
lavrushka  however  ran up to karp and seized him by the arms from behind "shall i call up our men from beyond the hill " he called out
alpatych turned to the peasants and ordered two of them by name to come and bind karp
the men obediently came out of the crowd and began taking off their belts
"where's the elder " demanded rostov in a loud voice
with a pale and frowning face dron stepped out of the crowd
"are you the elder  bind him  lavrushka " shouted rostov  as if that order  too  could not possibly meet with any opposition
and in fact two more peasants began binding dron  who took off his own belt and handed it to them  as if to aid them
"and you all listen to me " said rostov to the peasants
"be off to your houses at once  and don't let one of your voices be heard " "why  we've not done any harm  we did it just out of foolishness
it's all nonsense  
i said then that it was not in order " voices were heard bickering with one another
"there  what did i say " said alpatych  coming into his own again
"it's wrong  lads " "all our stupidity  yakov alpatych " came the answers  and the crowd began at once to disperse through the village
the two bound men were led off to the master's house
the two drunken peasants followed them
"aye  when i look at you    " said one of them to karp
"how can one talk to the masters like that  what were you thinking of  you fool " added the other—"a real fool " two hours later the carts were standing in the courtyard of the bogucharovo house
the peasants were briskly carrying out the proprietor's goods and packing them on the carts  and dron  liberated at princess mary's wish from the cupboard where he had been confined  was standing in the yard directing the men
"don't put it in so carelessly " said one of the peasants  a man with a round smiling face  taking a casket from a housemaid
"you know it has cost money  how can you chuck it in like that or shove it under the cord where it'll get rubbed  i don't like that way of doing things
let it all be done properly  according to rule
look here  put it under the bast matting and cover it with hay—that's the way " "yes  they worked all day and didn't play " remarked the tall  round faced peasant gravely  pointing with a significant wink at the dictionaries that were on the top
unwilling to obtrude himself on the princess  rostov did not go back to the house but remained in the village awaiting her departure when her carriage drove out of the house  he mounted and accompanied her eight miles from bogucharovo to where the road was occupied by our troops
at the inn at yankovo he respectfully took leave of her  for the first time permitting himself to kiss her hand "how can you speak so " he blushingly replied to princess mary's expressions of gratitude for her deliverance  as she termed what had occurred
"any police officer would have done as much  if we had had only peasants to fight  we should not have let the enemy come so far " said he with a sense of shame and wishing to change the subject
"i am only happy to have had the opportunity of making your acquaintance
good bye  princess
i wish you happiness and consolation and hope to meet you again in happier circumstances if you don't want to make me blush  please don't thank me " but the princess  if she did not again thank him in words  thanked him with the whole expression of her face  radiant with gratitude and tenderness
she could not believe that there was nothing to thank him for
on the contrary  it seemed to her certain that had he not been there she would have perished at the hands of the mutineers and of the french  and that he had exposed himself to terrible and obvious danger to save her  and even more certain was it that he was a man of lofty and noble soul  able to understand her position and her sorrow his kind  honest eyes  with the tears rising in them when she herself had begun to cry as she spoke of her loss  did not leave her memory
when she had taken leave of him and remained alone she suddenly felt her eyes filling with tears  and then not for the first time the strange question presented itself to her  did she love him  on the rest of the way to moscow  though the princess' position was not a cheerful one  dunyasha  who went with her in the carriage  more than once noticed that her mistress leaned out of the window and smiled at something with an expression of mingled joy and sorrow
"well  supposing i do love him " thought princess mary
ashamed as she was of acknowledging to herself that she had fallen in love with a man who would perhaps never love her  she comforted herself with the thought that no one would ever know it and that she would not be to blame if  without ever speaking of it to anyone  she continued to the end of her life to love the man with whom she had fallen in love for the first and last time in her life
sometimes when she recalled his looks  his sympathy  and his words  happiness did not appear impossible to her
it was at those moments that dunyasha noticed her smiling as she looked out of the carriage window
"was it not fate that brought him to bogucharovo  and at that very moment " thought princess mary
"and that caused his sister to refuse my brother " and in all this princess mary saw the hand of providence
the impression the princess made on rostov was a very agreeable one
to remember her gave him pleasure  and when his comrades  hearing of his adventure at bogucharovo  rallied him on having gone to look for hay and having picked up one of the wealthiest heiresses in russia  he grew angry it made him angry just because the idea of marrying the gentle princess mary  who was attractive to him and had an enormous fortune  had against his will more than once entered his head
for himself personally nicholas could not wish for a better wife  by marrying her he would make the countess his mother happy  would be able to put his father's affairs in order  and would even—he felt it—ensure princess mary's happiness but sonya  and his plighted word  that was why rostov grew angry when he was rallied about princess bolkonskaya
on receiving command of the armies kutuzov remembered prince andrew and sent an order for him to report at headquarters
prince andrew arrived at tsarevo zaymishche on the very day and at the very hour that kutuzov was reviewing the troops for the first time
he stopped in the village at the priest's house in front of which stood the commander inchief's carriage  and he sat down on the bench at the gate awaiting his serene highness  as everyone now called kutuzov
from the field beyond the village came now sounds of regimental music and now the roar of many voices shouting "hurrah " to the new commander in chief
two orderlies  a courier and a major domo  stood near by  some ten paces from prince andrew  availing themselves of kutuzov's absence and of the fine weather a short  swarthy lieutenant colonel of hussars with thick mustaches and whiskers rode up to the gate and  glancing at prince andrew  inquired whether his serene highness was putting up there and whether he would soon be back
prince andrew replied that he was not on his serene highness' staff but was himself a new arrival the lieutenant colonel turned to a smart orderly  who  with the peculiar contempt with which a commander in chief's orderly speaks to officers  replied  "what  his serene highness  i expect he'll be here soon
what do you want " the lieutenant colonel of hussars smiled beneath his mustache at the orderly's tone  dismounted  gave his horse to a dispatch runner  and approached bolkonski with a slight bow
bolkonski made room for him on the bench and the lieutenant colonel sat down beside him
"you're also waiting for the commander in chief " said he
"they say he weceives evewyone  thank god   
it's awful with those sausage eaters  ermolov had weason to ask to be pwomoted to be a german  now p'waps wussians will get a look in
as it was  devil only knows what was happening
we kept wetweating and wetweating
did you take part in the campaign " he asked
"i had the pleasure " replied prince andrew  "not only of taking part in the retreat but of losing in that retreat all i held dear—not to mention the estate and home of my birth—my father  who died of grief
i belong to the province of smolensk " "ah  you're pwince bolkonski  vewy glad to make your acquaintance  i'm lieutenant colonel denisov  better known as 'vaska '" said denisov  pressing prince andrew's hand and looking into his face with a particularly kindly attention
"yes  i heard " said he sympathetically  and after a short pause added  "yes  it's scythian warfare
it's all vewy well—only not for those who get it in the neck
so you are pwince andwew bolkonski " he swayed his head
"vewy pleased  pwince  to make your acquaintance " he repeated again  smiling sadly  and he again pressed prince andrew's hand
prince andrew knew denisov from what natasha had told him of her first suitor
this memory carried him sadly and sweetly back to those painful feelings of which he had not thought lately  but which still found place in his soul
of late he had received so many new and very serious impressions— such as the retreat from smolensk  his visit to bald hills  and the recent news of his father's death—and had experienced so many emotions  that for a long time past those memories had not entered his mind  and now that they did  they did not act on him with nearly their former strength
for denisov  too  the memories awakened by the name of bolkonski belonged to a distant  romantic past  when after supper and after natasha's singing he had proposed to a little girl of fifteen without realizing what he was doing
he smiled at the recollection of that time and of his love for natasha  and passed at once to what now interested him passionately and exclusively
this was a plan of campaign he had devised while serving at the outposts during the retreat
he had proposed that plan to barclay de tolly and now wished to propose it to kutuzov
the plan was based on the fact that the french line of operation was too extended  and it proposed that instead of  or concurrently with  action on the front to bar the advance of the french  we should attack their line of communication
he began explaining his plan to prince andrew
"they can't hold all that line
it's impossible
i will undertake to bweak thwough
give me five hundwed men and i will bweak the line  that's certain  there's only one way—guewilla warfare " denisov rose and began gesticulating as he explained his plan to bolkonski
in the midst of his explanation shouts were heard from the army  growing more incoherent and more diffused  mingling with music and songs and coming from the field where the review was held
sounds of hoofs and shouts were nearing the village
"he's coming  he's coming " shouted a cossack standing at the gate
bolkonski and denisov moved to the gate  at which a knot of soldiers  a guard of honor  was standing  and they saw kutuzov coming down the street mounted on a rather small sorrel horse
a huge suite of generals rode behind him
barclay was riding almost beside him  and a crowd of officers ran after and around them shouting  "hurrah " his adjutants galloped into the yard before him
kutuzov was impatiently urging on his horse  which ambled smoothly under his weight  and he raised his hand to his white horse guard's cap with a red band and no peak  nodding his head continually
when he came up to the guard of honor  a fine set of grenadiers mostly wearing decorations  who were giving him the salute  he looked at them silently and attentively for nearly a minute with the steady gaze of a commander and then turned to the crowd of generals and officers surrounding him
suddenly his face assumed a subtle expression  he shrugged his shoulders with an air of perplexity
"and with such fine fellows to retreat and retreat  well  good by  general " he added  and rode into the yard past prince andrew and denisov
"hurrah  hurrah  hurrah " shouted those behind him
since prince andrew had last seen him kutuzov had grown still more corpulent  flaccid  and fat
but the bleached eyeball  the scar  and the familiar weariness of his expression were still the same
he was wearing the white horse guard's cap and a military overcoat with a whip hanging over his shoulder by a thin strap
he sat heavily and swayed limply on his brisk little horse
"whew  
whew  
whew " he whistled just audibly as he rode into the yard
his face expressed the relief of relaxed strain felt by a man who means to rest after a ceremony
he drew his left foot out of the stirrup and  lurching with his whole body and puckering his face with the effort  raised it with difficulty onto the saddle  leaned on his knee  groaned  and slipped down into the arms of the cossacks and adjutants who stood ready to assist him he pulled himself together  looked round  screwing up his eyes  glanced at prince andrew  and  evidently not recognizing him  moved with his waddling gait to the porch "whew  
whew  
whew " he whistled  and again glanced at prince andrew
as often occurs with old men  it was only after some seconds that the impression produced by prince andrew's face linked itself up with kutuzov's remembrance of his personality
"ah  how do you do  my dear prince  how do you do  my dear boy  come along   " said he  glancing wearily round  and he stepped onto the porch which creaked under his weight
he unbuttoned his coat and sat down on a bench in the porch
"and how's your father " "i received news of his death  yesterday " replied prince andrew abruptly
kutuzov looked at him with eyes wide open with dismay and then took off his cap and crossed himself  "may the kingdom of heaven be his  god's will be done to us all " he sighed deeply  his whole chest heaving  and was silent for a while "i loved him and respected him  and sympathize with you with all my heart " he embraced prince andrew  pressing him to his fat breast  and for some time did not let him go
when he released him prince andrew saw that kutuzov's flabby lips were trembling and that tears were in his eyes
he sighed and pressed on the bench with both hands to raise himself "come  come with me  we'll have a talk " said he
but at that moment denisov  no more intimidated by his superiors than by the enemy  came with jingling spurs up the steps of the porch  despite the angry whispers of the adjutants who tried to stop him
kutuzov  his hands still pressed on the seat  glanced at him glumly
denisov  having given his name  announced that he had to communicate to his serene highness a matter of great importance for their country's welfare
kutuzov looked wearily at him and  lifting his hands with a gesture of annoyance  folded them across his stomach  repeating the words  "for our country's welfare  well  what is it  speak " denisov blushed like a girl  it was strange to see the color rise in that shaggy  bibulous  time worn face  and boldly began to expound his plan of cutting the enemy's lines of communication between smolensk and vyazma
denisov came from those parts and knew the country well
his plan seemed decidedly a good one  especially from the strength of conviction with which he spoke
kutuzov looked down at his own legs  occasionally glancing at the door of the adjoining hut as if expecting something unpleasant to emerge from it
and from that hut  while denisov was speaking  a general with a portfolio under his arm really did appear
"what " said kutuzov  in the midst of denisov's explanations  "are you ready so soon " "ready  your serene highness " replied the general
kutuzov swayed his head  as much as to say  "how is one man to deal with it all " and again listened to denisov
"i give my word of honor as a wussian officer " said denisov  "that i can bweak napoleon's line of communication " "what relation are you to intendant general kiril andreevich denisov " asked kutuzov  interrupting him
"he is my uncle  your sewene highness " "ah  we were friends " said kutuzov cheerfully
"all right  all right  friend  stay here at the staff and tomorrow we'll have a talk " with a nod to denisov he turned away and put out his hand for the papers konovnitsyn had brought him
"would not your serene highness like to come inside " said the general on duty in a discontented voice  "the plans must be examined and several papers have to be signed " an adjutant came out and announced that everything was in readiness within
but kutuzov evidently did not wish to enter that room till he was disengaged
he made a grimace  
"no  tell them to bring a small table out here  my dear boy
i'll look at them here " said he
"don't go away " he added  turning to prince andrew  who remained in the porch and listened to the general's report
while this was being given  prince andrew heard the whisper of a woman's voice and the rustle of a silk dress behind the door
several times on glancing that way he noticed behind that door a plump  rosy  handsome woman in a pink dress with a lilac silk kerchief on her head  holding a dish and evidently awaiting the entrance of the commander in chief
kutuzov's adjutant whispered to prince andrew that this was the wife of the priest whose home it was  and that she intended to offer his serene highness bread and salt
"her husband has welcomed his serene highness with the cross at the church  and she intends to welcome him in the house   
she's very pretty " added the adjutant with a smile
at those words kutuzov looked round
he was listening to the general's report—which consisted chiefly of a criticism of the position at tsarevo zaymishche—as he had listened to denisov  and seven years previously had listened to the discussion at the austerlitz council of war
he evidently listened only because he had ears which  though there was a piece of tow in one of them  could not help hearing  but it was evident that nothing the general could say would surprise or even interest him  that he knew all that would be said beforehand  and heard it all only because he had to  as one has to listen to the chanting of a service of prayer
all that denisov had said was clever and to the point
what the general was saying was even more clever and to the point  but it was evident that kutuzov despised knowledge and cleverness  and knew of something else that would decide the matter— something independent of cleverness and knowledge
prince andrew watched the commander in chief's face attentively  and the only expression he could see there was one of boredom  curiosity as to the meaning of the feminine whispering behind the door  and a desire to observe propriety
it was evident that kutuzov despised cleverness and learning and even the patriotic feeling shown by denisov  but despised them not because of his own intellect  feelings  or knowledge—he did not try to display any of these—but because of something else
he despised them because of his old age and experience of life
the only instruction kutuzov gave of his own accord during that report referred to looting by the russian troops
at the end of the report the general put before him for signature a paper relating to the recovery of payment from army commanders for green oats mown down by the soldiers  when landowners lodged petitions for compensation
after hearing the matter  kutuzov smacked his lips together and shook his head
"into the stove  
into the fire with it  i tell you once for all  my dear fellow " said he  "into the fire with all such things  let them cut the crops and burn wood to their hearts' content
i don't order it or allow it  but i don't exact compensation either
one can't get on without it
'when wood is chopped the chips will fly '" he looked at the paper again
"oh  this german precision " he muttered  shaking his head
"well  that's all " said kutuzov as he signed the last of the documents  and rising heavily and smoothing out the folds in his fat white neck he moved toward the door with a more cheerful expression
the priest's wife  flushing rosy red  caught up the dish she had after all not managed to present at the right moment  though she had so long been preparing for it  and with a low bow offered it to kutuzov
he screwed up his eyes  smiled  lifted her chin with his hand  and said  "ah  what a beauty  thank you  sweetheart " he took some gold pieces from his trouser pocket and put them on the dish for her
"well  my dear  and how are we getting on " he asked  moving to the door of the room assigned to him
the priest's wife smiled  and with dimples in her rosy cheeks followed him into the room
the adjutant came out to the porch and asked prince andrew to lunch with him
half an hour later prince andrew was again called to kutuzov
he found him reclining in an armchair  still in the as prince andrew entered  marking the place with a knife
prince andrew saw by the cover that it was les chevaliers du cygne by madame de genlis
"well  sit down  sit down here
let's have a talk " said kutuzov
"it's sad  very sad
but remember  my dear fellow  that i am a father to you  a second father    " prince andrew told kutuzov all he knew of his father's death  and what he had seen at bald hills when he passed through it
"what  
what they have brought us to " kutuzov suddenly cried in an agitated voice  evidently picturing vividly to himself from prince andrew's story the condition russia was in "but give me time  give me time " he said with a grim look  evidently not wishing to continue this agitating conversation  and added  "i sent for you to keep you with me " "i thank your serene highness  but i fear i am no longer fit for the staff " replied prince andrew with a smile which kutuzov noticed
kutuzov glanced inquiringly at him
"but above all " added prince andrew  "i have grown used to my regiment  am fond of the officers  and i fancy the men also like me
i should be sorry to leave the regiment
if i decline the honor of being with you  believe me   " a shrewd  kindly  yet subtly derisive expression lit up kutuzov's podgy face
he cut bolkonski short
"i am sorry  for i need you
but you're right  you're right  it's not here that men are needed
advisers are always plentiful  but men are not
the regiments would not be what they are if the would be advisers served there as you do
i remember you at austerlitz   
i remember  yes  i remember you with the standard " said kutuzov  and a flush of pleasure suffused prince andrew's face at this recollection
taking his hand and drawing him downwards  kutuzov offered his cheek to be kissed  and again prince andrew noticed tears in the old man's eyes
though prince andrew knew that kutuzov's tears came easily  and that he was particularly tender to and considerate of him from a wish to show sympathy with his loss  yet this reminder of austerlitz was both pleasant and flattering to him
"go your way and god be with you
i know your path is the path of honor " he paused
"i missed you at bucharest  but i needed someone to send " and changing the subject  kutuzov began to speak of the turkish war and the peace that had been concluded
"yes  i have been much blamed " he said  "both for that war and the peace  
but everything came at the right time
tout vient a point a celui qui sait attendre
* and there were as many advisers there as here   " he went on  returning to the subject of "advisers" which evidently occupied him
"ah  those advisers " said he
"if we had listened to them all we should not have made peace with turkey and should not have been through with that war
everything in haste  but more haste  less speed
kamenski would have been lost if he had not died
he stormed fortresses with thirty thousand men
it is not difficult to capture a fortress but it is difficult to win a campaign
for that  not storming and attacking but patience and time are wanted
kamenski sent soldiers to rustchuk  but i only employed these two things and took more fortresses than kamenski and made them turks eat horseflesh " he swayed his head
"and the french shall too  believe me " he went on  growing warmer and beating his chest  "i'll make them eat horseflesh " and tears again dimmed his eyes
* "everything comes in time to him who knows how to wait " "but shan't we have to accept battle " remarked prince andrew
"we shall if everybody wants it  it can't be helped   
but believe me  my dear boy  there is nothing stronger than those two  patience and time  they will do it all
but the advisers n'entendent pas de cette oreille  voila le mal
* some want a thing—others don't
what's one to do " he asked  evidently expecting an answer
"well  what do you want us to do " he repeated and his eye shone with a deep  shrewd look
"i'll tell you what to do " he continued  as prince andrew still did not reply  "i will tell you what to do  and what i do
dans le doute  mon cher " he paused  "abstiens toi" * 2 —he articulated the french proverb deliberately
* "don't see it that way  that's the trouble " *  2  "when in doubt  my dear fellow  do nothing " "well  good by  my dear fellow  remember that with all my heart i share your sorrow  and that for you i am not a serene highness  nor a prince  nor a commander in chief  but a father  if you want anything come straight to me
good bye  my dear boy " again he embraced and kissed prince andrew  but before the latter had left the room kutuzov gave a sigh of relief and went on with his unfinished novel  les chevaliers du cygne by madame de genlis
prince andrew could not have explained how or why it was  but after that interview with kutuzov he went back to his regiment reassured as to the general course of affairs and as to the man to whom it had been entrusted
the more he realized the absence of all personal motive in that old man—in whom there seemed to remain only the habit of passions  and in place of an intellect  grouping events and drawing conclusions  only the capacity calmly to contemplate the course of events—the more reassured he was that everything would be as it should
"he will not bring in any plan of his own
he will not devise or undertake anything " thought prince andrew  "but he will hear everything  remember everything  and put everything in its place
he will not hinder anything useful nor allow anything harmful
he understands that there is something stronger and more important than his own will—the inevitable course of events  and he can see them and grasp their significance  and seeing that significance can refrain from meddling and renounce his personal wish directed to something else
and above all " thought prince andrew  "one believes in him because he's russian  despite the novel by genlis and the french proverbs  and because his voice shook when he said  'what they have brought us to ' and had a sob in it when he said he would 'make them eat horseflesh '" on such feelings  more or less dimly shared by all  the unanimity and general approval were founded with which  despite court influences  the popular choice of kutuzov as commander in chief was received
after the emperor had left moscow  life flowed on there in its usual course  and its course was so very usual that it was difficult to remember the recent days of patriotic elation and ardor  hard to believe that russia was really in danger and that the members of the english club were also sons of the fatherland ready to sacrifice everything for it
the one thing that recalled the patriotic fervor everyone had displayed during the emperor's stay was the call for contributions of men and money  a necessity that as soon as the promises had been made assumed a legal  official form and became unavoidable
with the enemy's approach to moscow  the moscovites' view of their situation did not grow more serious but on the contrary became even more frivolous  as always happens with people who see a great danger approaching
at the approach of danger there are always two voices that speak with equal power in the human soul  one very reasonably tells a man to consider the nature of the danger and the means of escaping it  the other  still more reasonably  says that it is too depressing and painful to think of the danger  since it is not in man's power to foresee everything and avert the general course of events  and it is therefore better to disregard what is painful till it comes  and to think about what is pleasant
in solitude a man generally listens to the first voice  but in society to the second
so it was now with the inhabitants of moscow
it was long since people had been as gay in moscow as that year
rostopchin's broadsheets  headed by woodcuts of a drink shop  a potman  and a moscow burgher called karpushka chigirin  "who—having been a militiaman and having had rather too much at the pub—heard that napoleon wished to come to moscow  grew angry  abused the french in very bad language  came out of the drink shop  and  under the sign of the eagle  began to address the assembled people " were read and discussed  together with the latest of vasili lvovich pushkin's bouts rimes
in the corner room at the club  members gathered to read these broadsheets  and some liked the way karpushka jeered at the french  saying  "they will swell up with russian cabbage  burst with our buckwheat porridge  and choke themselves with cabbage soup they are all dwarfs and one peasant woman will toss three of them with a hayfork " others did not like that tone and said it was stupid and vulgar
it was said that rostopchin had expelled all frenchmen and even all foreigners from moscow  and that there had been some spies and agents of napoleon among them  but this was told chiefly to introduce rostopchin's witty remark on that occasion
the foreigners were deported to nizhni by boat  and rostopchin had said to them in french  "rentrez en vousmemes  entrez dans la barque  et n'en faites pas une barque de charon " * there was talk of all the government offices having been already removed from moscow  and to this shinshin's witticism was added—that for that alone moscow ought to be grateful to napoleon
it was said that mamonov's regiment would cost him eight hundred thousand rubles  and that bezukhov had spent even more on his  but that the best thing about bezukhov's action was that he himself was going to don a uniform and ride at the head of his regiment without charging anything for the show * "think it over  get into the barque  and take care not to make it a barque of charon " "you don't spare anyone " said julie drubetskaya as she collected and pressed together a bunch of raveled lint with her thin  beringed fingers
julie was preparing to leave moscow next day and was giving a farewell soiree
"bezukhov est ridicule  but he is so kind and good natured
what pleasure is there to be so caustique " "a forfeit " cried a young man in militia uniform whom julie called "mon chevalier " and who was going with her to nizhni
in julie's set  as in many other circles in moscow  it had been agreed that they would speak nothing but russian and that those who made a slip and spoke french should pay fines to the committee of voluntary contributions
"another forfeit for a gallicism " said a russian writer who was present
"'what pleasure is there to be' is not russian " "you spare no one " continued julie to the young man without heeding the author's remark
"for caustique—i am guilty and will pay  and i am prepared to pay again for the pleasure of telling you the truth
for gallicisms i won't be responsible " she remarked  turning to the author  "i have neither the money nor the time  like prince galitsyn  to engage a master to teach me russian " "ah  here he is " she added "quand on  
no  no " she said to the militia officer  "you won't catch me
speak of the sun and you see its rays " and she smiled amiably at pierre
"we were just talking of you " she said with the facility in lying natural to a society woman
"we were saying that your regiment would be sure to be better than mamonov's " "oh  don't talk to me of my regiment " replied pierre  kissing his hostess' hand and taking a seat beside her
"i am so sick of it " "you will  of course  command it yourself " said julie  directing a sly  sarcastic glance toward the militia officer
the latter in pierre's presence had ceased to be caustic  and his face expressed perplexity as to what julie's smile might mean
in spite of his absentmindedness and good nature  pierre's personality immediately checked any attempt to ridicule him to his face
"no " said pierre  with a laughing glance at his big  stout body
"i should make too good a target for the french  besides i am afraid i should hardly be able to climb onto a horse " among those whom julie's guests happened to choose to gossip about were the rostovs
"i hear that their affairs are in a very bad way " said julie
"and he is so unreasonable  the count himself i mean the razumovskis wanted to buy his house and his estate near moscow  but it drags on and on
he asks too much " "no  i think the sale will come off in a few days " said someone
"though it is madness to buy anything in moscow now " "why " asked julie
"you don't think moscow is in danger " "then why are you leaving " "i  what a question  i am going because  
well  because everyone is going  and besides—i am not joan of arc or an amazon " "well  of course  of course  let me have some more strips of linen " "if he manages the business properly he will be able to pay off all his debts " said the militia officer  speaking of rostov
"a kindly old man but not up to much
and why do they stay on so long in moscow  they meant to leave for the country long ago
natalie is quite well again now  isn't she " julie asked pierre with a knowing smile
"they are waiting for their younger son " pierre replied
"he joined obolenski's cossacks and went to belaya tserkov where the regiment is being formed
but now they have had him transferred to my regiment and are expecting him every day
the count wanted to leave long ago  but the countess won't on any account leave moscow till her son returns " "i met them the day before yesterday at the arkharovs'
natalie has recovered her looks and is brighter
she sang a song
how easily some people get over everything " "get over what " inquired pierre  looking displeased
julie smiled
"you know  count  such knights as you are only found in madame de souza's novels " "what knights  what do you mean " demanded pierre  blushing
"oh  come  my dear count  c'est la fable de tout moscou
je vous admire  ma parole d'honneur " * * "it is the talk of all moscow
my word  i admire you " "forfeit  forfeit " cried the militia officer
"all right  one can't talk—how tiresome " "what is 'the talk of all moscow' " pierre asked angrily  rising to his feet
"come now  count  you know " "i don't know anything about it " said pierre
"i know you were friendly with natalie  and so  
but i was always more friendly with vera—that dear vera " "no  madame " pierre continued in a tone of displeasure  "i have not taken on myself the role of natalie rostova's knight at all  and have not been to their house for nearly a month
but i cannot understand the cruelty   " "qui s'excuse s'accuse " * said julie  smiling and waving the lint triumphantly  and to have the last word she promptly changed the subject
"do you know what i heard today  poor mary bolkonskaya arrived in moscow yesterday
do you know that she has lost her father " * "who excuses himself  accuses himself " "really  where is she  i should like very much to see her " said pierre "i spent the evening with her yesterday
she is going to their estate near moscow either today or tomorrow morning  with her nephew " "well  and how is she " asked pierre
"she is well  but sad
but do you know who rescued her  it is quite a romance
nicholas rostov  she was surrounded  and they wanted to kill her and had wounded some of her people
he rushed in and saved her    " "another romance " said the militia officer
"really  this general flight has been arranged to get all the old maids married off
catiche is one and princess bolkonskaya another " "do you know  i really believe she is un petit peu amoureuse du jeune homme " * * "a little bit in love with the young man " "forfeit  forfeit  forfeit " "but how could one say that in russian " when pierre returned home he was handed two of rostopchin's broadsheets that had been brought that day
the first declared that the report that count rostopchin had forbidden people to leave moscow was false  on the contrary he was glad that ladies and tradesmen's wives were leaving the city
"there will be less panic and less gossip " ran the broadsheet "but i will stake my life on it that scoundrel will not enter moscow " these words showed pierre clearly for the first time that the french would enter moscow
the second broadsheet stated that our headquarters were at vyazma  that count wittgenstein had defeated the french  but that as many of the inhabitants of moscow wished to be armed  weapons were ready for them at the arsenal  sabers  pistols  and muskets which could be had at a low price
the tone of the proclamation was not as jocose as in the former chigirin talks
pierre pondered over these broadsheets
evidently the terrible stormcloud he had desired with the whole strength of his soul but which yet aroused involuntary horror in him was drawing near
"shall i join the army and enter the service  or wait " he asked himself for the hundredth time he took a pack of cards that lay on the table and began to lay them out for a game of patience
"if this patience comes out " he said to himself after shuffling the cards  holding them in his hand  and lifting his head  "if it comes out  it means   what does it mean " he had not decided what it should mean when he heard the voice of the eldest princess at the door asking whether she might come in
"then it will mean that i must go to the army " said pierre to himself "come in  come in " he added to the princess
only the eldest princess  the one with the stony face and long waist  was still living in pierre's house
the two younger ones had both married
"excuse my coming to you  cousin " she said in a reproachful and agitated voice
"you know some decision must be come to
what is going to happen  everyone has left moscow and the people are rioting
how is it that we are staying on " "on the contrary  things seem satisfactory  ma cousine " said pierre in the bantering tone he habitually adopted toward her  always feeling uncomfortable in the role of her benefactor
"satisfactory  indeed  very satisfactory  barbara ivanovna told me today how our troops are distinguishing themselves it certainly does them credit  and the people too are quite mutinous—they no longer obey  even my maid has taken to being rude
at this rate they will soon begin beating us
one can't walk in the streets
but  above all  the french will be here any day now  so what are we waiting for  i ask just one thing of you  cousin " she went on  "arrange for me to be taken to petersburg
whatever i may be  i can't live under bonaparte's rule " "oh  come  ma cousine  where do you get your information from  on the contrary   " "i won't submit to your napoleon  others may if they please   
if you don't want to do this   " "but i will  i'll give the order at once " the princess was apparently vexed at not having anyone to be angry with
muttering to herself  she sat down on a chair
"but you have been misinformed " said pierre
"everything is quiet in the city and there is not the slightest danger
see  i've just been reading   " he showed her the broadsheet
"count rostopchin writes that he will stake his life on it that the enemy will not enter moscow " "oh  that count of yours " said the princess malevolently
"he is a hypocrite  a rascal who has himself roused the people to riot didn't he write in those idiotic broadsheets that anyone  'whoever it might be  should be dragged to the lockup by his hair'   how silly   'and honor and glory to whoever captures him ' he says
this is what his cajolery has brought us to  barbara ivanovna told me the mob near killed her because she said something in french " "oh  but it's so  
you take everything so to heart " said pierre  and began laying out his cards for patience
although that patience did come out  pierre did not join the army  but remained in deserted moscow ever in the same state of agitation  irresolution  and alarm  yet at the same time joyfully expecting something terrible
next day toward evening the princess set off  and pierre's head steward came to inform him that the money needed for the equipment of his regiment could not be found without selling one of the estates
in general the head steward made out to pierre that his project of raising a regiment would ruin him
pierre listened to him  scarcely able to repress a smile
"well then  sell it " said he
"what's to be done  i can't draw back now " the worse everything became  especially his own affairs  the better was pierre pleased and the more evident was it that the catastrophe he expected was approaching
hardly anyone he knew was left in town
julie had gone  and so had princess mary
of his intimate friends only the rostovs remained  but he did not go to see them
to distract his thoughts he drove that day to the village of vorontsovo to see the great balloon leppich was constructing to destroy the foe  and a trial balloon that was to go up next day
the balloon was not yet ready  but pierre learned that it was being constructed by the emperor's desire
the emperor had written to count rostopchin as follows  as soon as leppich is ready  get together a crew of reliable and intelligent men for his car and send a courier to general kutuzov to let him know
i have informed him of the matter
please impress upon leppich to be very careful where he descends for the first time  that he may not make a mistake and fall into the enemy's hands
it is essential for him to combine his movements with those of the commander inchief
on his way home from vorontsovo  as he was passing the bolotnoe place pierre  seeing a large crowd round the lobnoe place  stopped and got out of his trap
a french cook accused of being a spy was being flogged
the flogging was only just over  and the executioner was releasing from the flogging bench a stout man with red whiskers  in blue stockings and a green jacket  who was moaning piteously
another criminal  thin and pale  stood near
judging by their faces they were both frenchmen
with a frightened and suffering look resembling that on the thin frenchman's face  pierre pushed his way in through the crowd
"what is it  who is it  what is it for " he kept asking
but the attention of the crowd—officials  burghers  shopkeepers  peasants  and women in cloaks and in pelisses—was so eagerly centered on what was passing in lobnoe place that no one answered him
the stout man rose  frowned  shrugged his shoulders  and evidently trying to appear firm began to pull on his jacket without looking about him  but suddenly his lips trembled and he began to cry  in the way full blooded grown up men cry  though angry with himself for doing so in the crowd people began talking loudly  to stifle their feelings of pity as it seemed to pierre
"he's cook to some prince " "eh  mounseer  russian sauce seems to be sour to a frenchman   sets his teeth on edge " said a wrinkled clerk who was standing behind pierre  when the frenchman began to cry
the clerk glanced round  evidently hoping that his joke would be appreciated
some people began to laugh  others continued to watch in dismay the executioner who was undressing the other man
pierre choked  his face puckered  and he turned hastily away  went back to his trap muttering something to himself as he went  and took his seat as they drove along he shuddered and exclaimed several times so audibly that the coachman asked him  "what is your pleasure " "where are you going " shouted pierre to the man  who was driving to lubyanka street
"to the governor's  as you ordered " answered the coachman
"fool  idiot " shouted pierre  abusing his coachman—a thing he rarely did
"home  i told you  and drive faster  blockhead " "i must get away this very day " he murmured to himself at the sight of the tortured frenchman and the crowd surrounding the lobnoe place  pierre had so definitely made up his mind that he could no longer remain in moscow and would leave for the army that very day that it seemed to him that either he had told the coachman this or that the man ought to have known it for himself on reaching home pierre gave orders to evstafey—his head coachman who knew everything  could do anything  and was known to all moscow—that he would leave that night for the army at mozhaysk  and that his saddle horses should be sent there
this could not all be arranged that day  so on evstafey's representation pierre had to put off his departure till next day to allow time for the relay horses to be sent on in advance
on the twenty fourth the weather cleared up after a spell of rain  and after dinner pierre left moscow
when changing horses that night in perkhushkovo  he learned that there had been a great battle that evening
 this was the battle of shevardino   he was told that there in perkhushkovo the earth trembled from the firing  but nobody could answer his questions as to who had won
at dawn next day pierre was approaching mozhaysk
every house in mozhaysk had soldiers quartered in it  and at the hostel where pierre was met by his groom and coachman there was no room to be had
it was full of officers
everywhere in mozhaysk and beyond it  troops were stationed or on the march
cossacks  foot and horse soldiers  wagons  caissons  and cannon were everywhere
pierre pushed forward as fast as he could  and the farther he left moscow behind and the deeper he plunged into that sea of troops the more was he overcome by restless agitation and a new and joyful feeling he had not experienced before
it was a feeling akin to what he had felt at the sloboda palace during the emperor's visit—a sense of the necessity of undertaking something and sacrificing something
he now experienced a glad consciousness that everything that constitutes men's happiness—the comforts of life  wealth  even life itself—is rubbish it is pleasant to throw away  compared with something  
with what  pierre could not say  and he did not try to determine for whom and for what he felt such particular delight in sacrificing everything
he was not occupied with the question of what to sacrifice for  the fact of sacrificing in itself afforded him a new and joyous sensation
on the twenty fourth of august the battle of the shevardino redoubt was fought  on the twenty fifth not a shot was fired by either side  and on the twenty sixth the battle of borodino itself took place
why and how were the battles of shevardino and borodino given and accepted  why was the battle of borodino fought  there was not the least sense in it for either the french or the russians
its immediate result for the russians was  and was bound to be  that we were brought nearer to the destruction of moscow—which we feared more than anything in the world  and for the french its immediate result was that they were brought nearer to the destruction of their whole army—which they feared more than anything in the world
what the result must be was quite obvious  and yet napoleon offered and kutuzov accepted that battle
if the commanders had been guided by reason  it would seem that it must have been obvious to napoleon that by advancing thirteen hundred miles and giving battle with a probability of losing a quarter of his army  he was advancing to certain destruction  and it must have been equally clear to kutuzov that by accepting battle and risking the loss of a quarter of his army he would certainly lose moscow
for kutuzov this was mathematically clear  as it is that if when playing draughts i have one man less and go on exchanging  i shall certainly lose  and therefore should not exchange
when my opponent has sixteen men and i have fourteen  i am only one eighth weaker than he  but when i have exchanged thirteen more men he will be three times as strong as i am
before the battle of borodino our strength in proportion to the french was about as five to six  but after that battle it was little more than one to two  previously we had a hundred thousand against a hundred and twenty thousand  afterwards little more than fifty thousand against a hundred thousand
yet the shrewd and experienced kutuzov accepted the battle  while napoleon  who was said to be a commander of genius  gave it  losing a quarter of his army and lengthening his lines of communication still more
if it is said that he expected to end the campaign by occupying moscow as he had ended a previous campaign by occupying vienna  there is much evidence to the contrary
napoleon's historians themselves tell us that from smolensk onwards he wished to stop  knew the danger of his extended position  and knew that the occupation of moscow would not be the end of the campaign  for he had seen at smolensk the state in which russian towns were left to him  and had not received a single reply to his repeated announcements of his wish to negotiate in giving and accepting battle at borodino  kutuzov acted involuntarily and irrationally
but later on  to fit what had occurred  the historians provided cunningly devised evidence of the foresight and genius of the generals who  of all the blind tools of history were the most enslaved and involuntary
the ancients have left us model heroic poems in which the heroes furnish the whole interest of the story  and we are still unable to accustom ourselves to the fact that for our epoch histories of that kind are meaningless on the other question  how the battle of borodino and the preceding battle of shevardino were fought  there also exists a definite and well known  but quite false  conception
all the historians describe the affair as follows  the russian army  they say  in its retreat from smolensk sought out for itself the best position for a general engagement and found such a position at borodino
the russians  they say  fortified this position in advance on the left of the highroad  from moscow to smolensk  and almost at a right angle to it  from borodino to utitsa  at the very place where the battle was fought
in front of this position  they say  a fortified outpost was set up on the shevardino mound to observe the enemy
on the twenty fourth  we are told  napoleon attacked this advanced post and took it  and  on the twenty sixth  attacked the whole russian army  which was in position on the field of borodino
so the histories say  and it is all quite wrong  as anyone who cares to look into the matter can easily convince himself the russians did not seek out the best position but  on the contrary  during the retreat passed many positions better than borodino
they did not stop at any one of these positions because kutuzov did not wish to occupy a position he had not himself chosen  because the popular demand for a battle had not yet expressed itself strongly enough  and because miloradovich had not yet arrived with the militia  and for many other reasons the fact is that other positions they had passed were stronger  and that the position at borodino  the one where the battle was fought   far from being strong  was no more a position than any other spot one might find in the russian empire by sticking a pin into the map at hazard
not only did the russians not fortify the position on the field of borodino to the left of  and at a right angle to  the highroad  that is  the position on which the battle took place   but never till the twenty fifth of august  1812  did they think that a battle might be fought there
this was shown first by the fact that there were no entrenchments there by the twenty fifth and that those begun on the twenty fifth and twenty sixth were not completed  and secondly  by the position of the shevardino redoubt
that redoubt was quite senseless in front of the position where the battle was accepted
why was it more strongly fortified than any other post  and why were all efforts exhausted and six thousand men sacrificed to defend it till late at night on the twenty fourth  a cossack patrol would have sufficed to observe the enemy
thirdly  as proof that the position on which the battle was fought had not been foreseen and that the shevardino redoubt was not an advanced post of that position  we have the fact that up to the twenty fifth  barclay de tolly and bagration were convinced that the shevardino redoubt was the left flank of the position  and that kutuzov himself in his report  written in hot haste after the battle  speaks of the shevardino redoubt as the left flank of the position it was much later  when reports on the battle of borodino were written at leisure  that the incorrect and extraordinary statement was invented  probably to justify the mistakes of a commander in chief who had to be represented as infallible  that the shevardino redoubt was an advanced post—whereas in reality it was simply a fortified point on the left flank—and that the battle of borodino was fought by us on an entrenched position previously selected  where as it was fought on a quite unexpected spot which was almost unentrenched
the case was evidently this  a position was selected along the river kolocha— which crosses the highroad not at a right angle but at an acute angle—so that the left flank was at shevardino  the right flank near the village of novoe  and the center at borodino at the confluence of the rivers kolocha and voyna
to anyone who looks at the field of borodino without thinking of how the battle was actually fought  this position  protected by the river kolocha  presents itself as obvious for an army whose object was to prevent an enemy from advancing along the smolensk road to moscow
napoleon  riding to valuevo on the twenty fourth  did not see  as the history could not have seen that position because it did not exist   nor did he see an advanced post of the russian army  but while pursuing the russian rearguard he came upon the left flank of the russian position—at the shevardino redoubt—and unexpectedly for the russians moved his army across the kolocha
and the russians  not having time to begin a general engagement  withdrew their left wing from the position they had intended to occupy and took up a new position which had not been foreseen and was not fortified
by crossing to the other side of the kolocha to the left of the highroad  napoleon shifted the whole forthcoming battle from right to left  looking from the russian side  and transferred it to the plain between utitsa  semenovsk  and borodino—a plain no more advantageous as a position than any other plain in russia—and there the whole battle of the twenty sixth of august took place
had napoleon not ridden out on the evening of the twenty fourth to the kolocha  and had he not then ordered an immediate attack on the redoubt but had begun the attack next morning  no one would have doubted that the shevardino redoubt was the left flank of our position  and the battle would have taken place where we expected it
in that case we should probably have defended the shevardino redoubt—our left flank—still more obstinately
we should have attacked napoleon in the center or on the right  and the engagement would have taken place on the twenty fifth  in the position we intended and had fortified
but as the attack on our left flank took place in the evening after the retreat of our rear guard  that is  immediately after the fight at gridneva   and as the russian commanders did not wish  or were not in time  to begin a general engagement then on the evening of the twenty fourth  the first and chief action of the battle of borodino was already lost on the twenty fourth  and obviously led to the loss of the one fought on the twentysixth
after the loss of the shevardino redoubt  we found ourselves on the morning of the twenty fifth without a position for our left flank  and were forced to bend it back and hastily entrench it where it chanced to be
not only was the russian army on the twenty sixth defended by weak  unfinished entrenchments  but the disadvantage of that position was increased by the fact that the russian commanders—not having fully realized what had happened  namely the loss of our position on the left flank and the shifting of the whole field of the forthcoming battle from right to left—maintained their extended position from the village of novoe to utitsa  and consequently had to move their forces from right to left during the battle
so it happened that throughout the whole battle the russians opposed the entire french army launched against our left flank with but half as many men
 poniatowski's action against utitsa  and uvarov's on the right flank against the french  were actions distinct from the main course of the battle   so the battle of borodino did not take place at all as  in an effort to conceal our commanders' mistakes even at the cost of diminishing the glory due to the russian army and people  it has been described
the battle of borodino was not fought on a chosen and entrenched position with forces only slightly weaker than those of the enemy  but  as a result of the loss of the shevardino redoubt  the russians fought the battle of borodino on an open and almost unentrenched position  with forces only half as numerous as the french  that is to say  under conditions in which it was not merely unthinkable to fight for ten hours and secure an indecisive result  but unthinkable to keep an army even from complete disintegration and flight
on the morning of the twenty fifth pierre was leaving mozhaysk
at the descent of the high steep hill  down which a winding road led out of the town past the cathedral on the right  where a service was being held and the bells were ringing  pierre got out of his vehicle and proceeded on foot
behind him a cavalry regiment was coming down the hill preceded by its singers
coming up toward him was a train of carts carrying men who had been wounded in the engagement the day before
the peasant drivers  shouting and lashing their horses  kept crossing from side to side
the carts  in each of which three or four wounded soldiers were lying or sitting  jolted over the stones that had been thrown on the steep incline to make it something like a road
the wounded  bandaged with rags  with pale cheeks  compressed lips  and knitted brows  held on to the sides of the carts as they were jolted against one another
almost all of them stared with naive  childlike curiosity at pierre's white hat and green swallow tail coat
pierre's coachman shouted angrily at the convoy of wounded to keep to one side of the road
the cavalry regiment  as it descended the hill with its singers  surrounded pierre's carriage and blocked the road
pierre stopped  being pressed against the side of the cutting in which the road ran
the sunshine from behind the hill did not penetrate into the cutting and there it was cold and damp  but above pierre's head was the bright august sunshine and the bells sounded merrily
one of the carts with wounded stopped by the side of the road close to pierre
the driver in his bast shoes ran panting up to it  placed a stone under one of its tireless hind wheels  and began arranging the breechband on his little horse
one of the wounded  an old soldier with a bandaged arm who was following the cart on foot  caught hold of it with his sound hand and turned to look at pierre
"i say  fellow countryman  will they set us down here or take us on to moscow " he asked
pierre was so deep in thought that he did not hear the question
he was looking now at the cavalry regiment that had met the convoy of wounded  now at the cart by which he was standing  in which two wounded men were sitting and one was lying
one of those sitting up in the cart had probably been wounded in the cheek
his whole head was wrapped in rags and one cheek was swollen to the size of a baby's head
his nose and mouth were twisted to one side
this soldier was looking at the cathedral and crossing himself another  a young lad  a fair haired recruit as white as though there was no blood in his thin face  looked at pierre kindly  with a fixed smile
the third lay prone so that his face was not visible
the cavalry singers were passing close by  ah lost  quite lost  
is my head so keen  living in a foreign land
they sang their soldiers' dance song
as if responding to them but with a different sort of merriment  the metallic sound of the bells reverberated high above and the hot rays of the sun bathed the top of the opposite slope with yet another sort of merriment
but beneath the slope  by the cart with the wounded near the panting little nag where pierre stood  it was damp  somber  and sad
the soldier with the swollen cheek looked angrily at the cavalry singers
"oh  the coxcombs " he muttered reproachfully
"it's not the soldiers only  but i've seen peasants today  too   
the peasants— even they have to go " said the soldier behind the cart  addressing pierre with a sad smile
"no distinctions made nowadays   
they want the whole nation to fall on them—in a word  it's moscow  they want to make an end of it " in spite of the obscurity of the soldier's words pierre understood what he wanted to say and nodded approval
the road was clear again  pierre descended the hill and drove on
he kept looking to either side of the road for familiar faces  but only saw everywhere the unfamiliar faces of various military men of different branches of the service  who all looked with astonishment at his white hat and green tail coat
having gone nearly three miles he at last met an acquaintance and eagerly addressed him
this was one of the head army doctors
he was driving toward pierre in a covered gig  sitting beside a young surgeon  and on recognizing pierre he told the cossack who occupied the driver's seat to pull up
"count  your excellency  how come you to be here " asked the doctor
"well  you know  i wanted to see   " "yes  yes  there will be something to see    " pierre got out and talked to the doctor  explaining his intention of taking part in a battle
the doctor advised him to apply direct to kutuzov
"why should you be god knows where out of sight  during the battle " he said  exchanging glances with his young companion
"anyhow his serene highness knows you and will receive you graciously
that's what you must do " the doctor seemed tired and in a hurry
"you think so   
ah  i also wanted to ask you where our position is exactly " said pierre
"the position " repeated the doctor
"well  that's not my line
drive past tatarinova  a lot of digging is going on there
go up the hillock and you'll see " "can one see from there   
if you would   " but the doctor interrupted him and moved toward his gig
"i would go with you but on my honor i'm up to here"—and he pointed to his throat
"i'm galloping to the commander of the corps
how do matters stand   
you know  count  there'll be a battle tomorrow
out of an army of a hundred thousand we must expect at least twenty thousand wounded  and we haven't stretchers  or bunks  or dressers  or doctors enough for six thousand we have ten thousand carts  but we need other things as well—we must manage as best we can " the strange thought that of the thousands of men  young and old  who had stared with merry surprise at his hat  perhaps the very men he had noticed   twenty thousand were inevitably doomed to wounds and death amazed pierre
"they may die tomorrow  why are they thinking of anything but death " and by some latent sequence of thought the descent of the mozhaysk hill  the carts with the wounded  the ringing bells  the slanting rays of the sun  and the songs of the cavalrymen vividly recurred to his mind
"the cavalry ride to battle and meet the wounded and do not for a moment think of what awaits them  but pass by  winking at the wounded
yet from among these men twenty thousand are doomed to die  and they wonder at my hat  strange " thought pierre  continuing his way to tatarinova
in front of a landowner's house to the left of the road stood carriages  wagons  and crowds of orderlies and sentinels
the commander in chief was putting up there  but just when pierre arrived he was not in and hardly any of the staff were there—they had gone to the church service
pierre drove on toward gorki
when he had ascended the hill and reached the little village street  he saw for the first time peasant militiamen in their white shirts and with crosses on their caps  who  talking and laughing loudly  animated and perspiring  were at work on a huge knoll overgrown with grass to the right of the road
some of them were digging  others were wheeling barrowloads of earth along planks  while others stood about doing nothing
two officers were standing on the knoll  directing the men
on seeing these peasants  who were evidently still amused by the novelty of their position as soldiers  pierre once more thought of the wounded men at mozhaysk and understood what the soldier had meant when he said  "they want the whole nation to fall on them " the sight of these bearded peasants at work on the battlefield  with their queer  clumsy boots and perspiring necks  and their shirts opening from the left toward the middle  unfastened  exposing their sunburned collarbones  impressed pierre more strongly with the solemnity and importance of the moment than anything he had yet seen or heard pierre stepped out of his carriage and  passing the toiling militiamen  ascended the knoll from which  according to the doctor  the battlefield could be seen
it was about eleven o'clock
the sun shone somewhat to the left and behind him and brightly lit up the enormous panorama which  rising like an amphitheater  extended before him in the clear rarefied atmosphere
from above on the left  bisecting that amphitheater  wound the smolensk highroad  passing through a village with a white church some five hundred paces in front of the knoll and below it
this was borodino
below the village the road crossed the river by a bridge and  winding down and up  rose higher and higher to the village of valuevo visible about four miles away  where napoleon was then stationed
beyond valuevo the road disappeared into a yellowing forest on the horizon
far in the distance in that birch and fir forest to the right of the road  the cross and belfry of the kolocha monastery gleamed in the sun
here and there over the whole of that blue expanse  to right and left of the forest and the road  smoking campfires could be seen and indefinite masses of troops—ours and the enemy's
the ground to the right— along the course of the kolocha and moskva rivers—was broken and hilly
between the hollows the villages of bezubova and zakharino showed in the distance
on the left the ground was more level  there were fields of grain  and the smoking ruins of semenovsk  which had been burned down  could be seen
all that pierre saw was so indefinite that neither the left nor the right side of the field fully satisfied his expectations
nowhere could he see the battlefield he had expected to find  but only fields  meadows  troops  woods  the smoke of campfires  villages  mounds  and streams  and try as he would he could descry no military "position" in this place which teemed with life  nor could he even distinguish our troops from the enemy's "i must ask someone who knows " he thought  and addressed an officer who was looking with curiosity at his huge unmilitary figure
"may i ask you " said pierre  "what village that is in front " "burdino  isn't it " said the officer  turning to his companion
"borodino " the other corrected him
the officer  evidently glad of an opportunity for a talk  moved up to pierre
"are those our men there " pierre inquired
"yes  and there  further on  are the french " said the officer
"there they are  there  
you can see them " "where  where " asked pierre
"one can see them with the naked eye  
why  there " the officer pointed with his hand to the smoke visible on the left beyond the river  and the same stern and serious expression that pierre had noticed on many of the faces he had met came into his face
"ah  those are the french  and over there    " pierre pointed to a knoll on the left  near which some troops could be seen
"those are ours " "ah  ours  and there    " pierre pointed to another knoll in the distance with a big tree on it  near a village that lay in a hollow where also some campfires were smoking and something black was visible
"that's his again " said the officer
 it was the shevardino redoubt   "it was ours yesterday  but now it is his " "then how about our position " "our position " replied the officer with a smile of satisfaction
"i can tell you quite clearly  because i constructed nearly all our entrenchments
there  you see  there's our center  at borodino  just there " and he pointed to the village in front of them with the white church
"that's where one crosses the kolocha
you see down there where the rows of hay are lying in the hollow  there's the bridge
that's our center
our right flank is over there"—he pointed sharply to the right  far away in the broken ground—"that's where the moskva river is  and we have thrown up three redoubts there  very strong ones
the left flank   " here the officer paused
"well  you see  that's difficult to explain   
yesterday our left flank was there at shevardino  you see  where the oak is  but now we have withdrawn our left wing—now it is over there  do you see that village and the smoke  that's semenovsk  yes  there " he pointed to raevski's knoll
"but the battle will hardly be there
his having moved his troops there is only a ruse  he will probably pass round to the right of the moskva
but wherever it may be  many a man will be missing tomorrow " he remarked
