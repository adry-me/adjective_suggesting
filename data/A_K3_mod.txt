alexey alexandrovitch took leave of betsy in the drawing room  and went to his wife
she was lying down  but hearing his steps she sat up hastily in her former attitude  and looked in a scared way at him
he saw she had been crying
‘i am very grateful for your confidence in me ’ he repeated gently in russian the phrase he had said in betsy’s presence in french  and sat down beside her
when he spoke to her in russian  using the russian ‘thou’ of intimacy and affection  it was insufferably irritating to anna
‘and i am very grateful for your decision
i  too  imagine that since he is going away  there is no sort of necessity for count vronsky to come here
however  if  ’ ‘but i’ve said so already  so why repeat it ’ anna suddenly interrupted him with an irritation she could not succeed in repressing
‘no sort of necessity ’ she thought  ‘for a man to come and say good bye to the woman he loves  for whom he was ready to ruin himself  and has ruined himself  and who cannot live without him no sort of necessity ’ she compressed her lips  and dropped her anna karenina 925 of 1759 burning eyes to his hands with their swollen veins
they were rubbing each other
‘let us never speak of it ’ she added more calmly
‘i have left this question to you to decide  and i am very glad to see   ’ alexey alexandrovitch was beginning
‘that my wish coincides with your own ’ she finished quickly  exasperated at his talking so slowly while she knew beforehand all he would say
‘yes ’ he assented  ‘and princess tverskaya’s interference in the most difficult private affairs is utterly uncalled for
she especially  ’ ‘i don’t believe a word of what’s said about her ’ said anna quickly
‘i know she really cares for me ’ alexey alexandrovitch sighed and said nothing
she played nervously with the tassel of her dressing gown  glancing at him with that torturing sensation of physical repulsion for which she blamed herself  though she could not control it
her only desire now was to be rid of his oppressive presence
‘i have just sent for the doctor ’ said alexey alexandrovitch
‘i am very well  what do i want the doctor for ’ ‘no  the little one cries  and they say the nurse hasn’t enough milk ’ anna karenina 926 of 1759 ‘why didn’t you let me nurse her  when i begged to  anyway’ (alexey alexandrovitch knew what was meant by that ‘anyway’)  ‘she’s a baby  and they’re killing her ’ she rang the bell and ordered the baby to be brought her
‘i begged to nurse her  i wasn’t allowed to  and now i’m blamed for it ’ ‘i don’t blame  ’ ‘yes  you do blame me  my god  why didn’t i die ’ and she broke into sobs
‘forgive me  i’m nervous  i’m unjust ’ she said  controlling herself  ‘but do go away  ’ ‘no  it can’t go on like this ’ alexey alexandrovitch said to himself decidedly as he left his wife’s room never had the impossibility of his position in the world’s eyes  and his wife’s hatred of him  and altogether the might of that mysterious brutal force that guided his life against his spiritual inclinations  and exacted conformity with its decrees and change in his attitude to his wife  been presented to him with such distinctness as that day
he saw clearly that all the world and his wife expected of him something  but what exactly  he could not make out
he felt that this was rousing in his soul a feeling of anger destructive of his peace of mind and of all the good of his achievement
he believed that for anna herself it would be better to break off all relations with anna karenina 927 of 1759 vronsky  but if they all thought this out of the question  he was even ready to allow these relations to be renewed  so long as the children were not disgraced  and he was not deprived of them nor forced to change his position
bad as this might be  it was anyway better than a rupture  which would put her in a hopeless and shameful position  and deprive him of everything he cared for
but he felt helpless  he knew beforehand that every one was against him  and that he would not be allowed to do what seemed to him now so natural and right  but would be forced to do what was wrong  though it seemed the proper thing to them
anna karenina 928 of 1759 before betsy had time to walk out of the drawingroom  she was met in the doorway by stepan arkadyevitch  who had just come from yeliseev’s  where a consignment of fresh oysters had been received
‘ah  princess  what a delightful meeting ’ he began
‘i’ve been to see you ’ ‘a meeting for one minute  for i’m going ’ said betsy  smiling and putting on her glove
‘don’t put on your glove yet  princess  let me kiss your hand
there’s nothing i’m so thankful to the revival of the old fashions for as the kissing the hand ’ he kissed betsy’s hand
‘when shall we see each other ’ ‘you don’t deserve it ’ answered betsy  smiling
‘oh  yes  i deserve a great deal  for i’ve become a most serious person
i don’t only manage my own affairs  but other people’s too ’ he said with a significant expression
‘oh  i’m so glad ’ answered betsy  at once understanding that he was speaking of anna
and going back into the drawing room  they stood in a corner
‘he’s killing her ’ said betsy in a whisper full of meaning
‘it’s impossible  impossible  ’ anna karenina 929 of 1759 ‘i’m so glad you think so ’ said stepan arkadyevitch  shaking his head with a serious and sympathetically distressed expression  ‘that’s what i’ve come to petersburg for ’ ‘the whole town’s talking of it ’ she said
‘it’s an impossible position
she pines and pines away
he doesn’t understand that she’s one of those women who can’t trifle with their feelings
one of two things  either let him take her away  act with energy  or give her a divorce
this is stifling her ’ ‘yes  yes   just so   ’ oblonsky said  sighing
‘that’s what i’ve come for
at least not solely for that   i’ve been made a kammerherr  of course  one has to say thank you
but the chief thing was having to settle this ’ ‘well  god help you ’ said betsy
after accompanying betsy to the outside hall  once more kissing her hand above the glove  at the point where the pulse beats  and murmuring to her such unseemly nonsense that she did not know whether to laugh or be angry  stepan arkadyevitch went to his sister
he found her in tears
although he happened to be bubbling over with good spirits  stepan arkadyevitch immediately and quite naturally fell into the sympathetic  poetically emotional anna karenina 930 of 1759 tone which harmonized with her mood
he asked her how she was  and how she had spent the morning
‘very  very miserably
today and this morning and all past days and days to come ’ she said
‘i think you’re giving way to pessimism
you must rouse yourself  you must look life in the face
i know it’s hard  but  ’ ‘i have heard it said that women love men even for their vices ’ anna began suddenly  ‘but i hate him for his virtues
i can’t live with him
do you understand  the sight of him has a physical effect on me  it makes me beside myself
i can’t  i can’t live with him
what am i to do  i have been unhappy  and used to think one couldn’t be more unhappy  but the awful state of things i am going through now  i could never have conceived
would you believe it  that knowing he’s a good man  a splendid man  that i’m not worth his little finger  still i hate him
i hate him for his generosity
and there’s nothing left for me but  ’ she would have said death  but stepan arkadyevitch would not let her finish
‘you are ill and overwrought ’ he said  ‘believe me  you’re exaggerating dreadfully
there’s nothing so terrible in it ’ anna karenina 931 of 1759 and stepan arkadyevitch smiled
no one else in stepan arkadyevitch’s place  having to do with such despair  would have ventured to smile (the smile would have seemed brutal)  but in his smile there was so much of sweetness and almost feminine tenderness that his smile did not wound  but softened and soothed
his gentle  soothing words and smiles were as soothing and softening as almond oil
and anna soon felt this
‘no  stiva ’ she said  ‘i’m lost  lost  worse than lost  i can’t say yet that all is over  on the contrary  i feel that it’s not over
i’m an overstrained string that must snap
but it’s not ended yet   and it will have a fearful end ’ ‘no matter  we must let the string be loosened  little by little
there’s no position from which there is no way of escape ’ ‘i have thought  and thought
only one  ’ again he knew from her terrified eyes that this one way of escape in her thought was death  and he would not let her say it
‘not at all ’ he said
‘listen to me
you can’t see your own position as i can
let me tell you candidly my opinion ’ again he smiled discreetly his almond oil smile
‘i’ll begin from the beginning
you married a man twenty years older than yourself
you married him without love anna karenina 932 of 1759 and not knowing what love was
it was a mistake  let’s admit ’ ‘a fearful mistake ’ said anna
‘but i repeat  it’s an accomplished fact
then you had  let us say  the misfortune to love a man not your husband
that was a misfortune  but that  too  is an accomplished fact
and your husband knew it and forgave it ’ he stopped at each sentence  waiting for her to object  but she made no answer
‘that’s so
now the question is  can you go on living with your husband  do you wish it  does he wish it ’ ‘i know nothing  nothing ’ ‘but you said yourself that you can’t endure him ’ ‘no  i didn’t say so
i deny it
i can’t tell  i don’t know anything about it ’ ‘yes  but let  ’ ‘you can’t understand
i feel i’m lying head downwards in a sort of pit  but i ought not to save myself
and i can’t

 ’ ‘never mind  we’ll slip something under and pull you out
i understand you  i understand that you can’t take it on yourself to express your wishes  your feelings ’ ‘there’s nothing  nothing i wish   except for it to be all over ’ anna karenina 933 of 1759 ‘but he sees this and knows it
and do you suppose it weighs on him any less than on you  you’re wretched  he’s wretched  and what good can come of it  while divorce would solve the difficulty completely ’ with some effort stepan arkadyevitch brought out his central idea  and looked significantly at her she said nothing  and shook her cropped head in dissent
but from the look in her face  that suddenly brightened into its old beauty  he saw that if she did not desire this  it was simply because it seemed to her unattainable happiness
‘i’m awfully sorry for you  and how happy i should be if i could arrange things ’ said stepan arkadyevitch  smiling more boldly
‘don’t speak  don’t say a word  god grant only that i may speak as i feel
i’m going to him ’ anna looked at him with dreamy  shining eyes  and said nothing
anna karenina 934 of 1759 stepan arkadyevitch  with the same somewhat solemn expression with which he used to take his presidential chair at his board  walked into alexey alexandrovitch’s room
alexey alexandrovitch was walking about his room with his hands behind his back  thinking of just what stepan arkadyevitch had been discussing with his wife
‘i’m not interrupting you ’ said stepan arkadyevitch  on the sight of his brother in law becoming suddenly aware of a sense of embarrassment unusual with him
to conceal this embarrassment he took out a cigarette case he had just bought that opened in a new way  and sniffing the leather  took a cigarette out of it
‘no
do you want anything ’ alexey alexandrovitch asked without eagerness
‘yes  i wished   i wanted   yes  i wanted to talk to you ’ said stepan arkadyevitch  with surprise aware of an unaccustomed timidity
this feeling was so unexpected and so strange that he did not believe it was the voice of conscience telling him that what he was meaning to do was wrong
anna karenina 935 of 1759 stepan arkadyevitch made an effort and struggled with the timidity that had come over him
‘i hope you believe in my love for my sister and my sincere affection and respect for you ’ he said  reddening
alexey alexandrovitch stood still and said nothing  but his face struck stepan arkadyevitch by its expression of an unresisting sacrifice
‘i intended   i wanted to have a little talk with you about my sister and your mutual position ’ he said  still struggling with an unaccustomed constraint
alexey alexandrovitch smiled mournfully  looked at his brother in law  and without answering went up to the table  took from it an unfinished letter  and handed it to his brother in law
‘i think unceasingly of the same thing
and here is what i had begun writing  thinking i could say it better by letter  and that my presence irritates her ’ he said  as he gave him the letter
stepan arkadyevitch took the letter  looked with incredulous surprise at the lusterless eyes fixed so immovably on him  and began to read
‘i see that my presence is irksome to you
painful as it is to me to believe it  i see that it is so  and cannot be otherwise
i don’t blame you  and god is my witness that anna karenina 936 of 1759 on seeing you at the time of your illness i resolved with my whole heart to forget all that had passed between us and to begin a new life
i do not regret  and shall never regret  what i have done  but i have desired one thing— your good  the good of your soul—and now i see i have not attained that
tell me yourself what will give you true happiness and peace to your soul
i put myself entirely in your hands  and trust to your feeling of what’s right ’ stepan arkadyevitch handed back the letter  and with the same surprise continued looking at his brother in law  not knowing what to say
this silence was so awkward for both of them that stepan arkadyevitch’s lips began twitching nervously  while he still gazed without speaking at karenin’s face
‘that’s what i wanted to say to her ’ said alexey alexandrovitch  turning away
‘yes  yes   ’ said stepan arkadyevitch  not able to answer for the tears that were choking him
‘yes  yes  i understand you ’ he brought out at last
‘i want to know what she would like ’ said alexey alexandrovitch
‘i am afraid she does not understand her own position
she is not a judge ’ said stepan arkadyevitch  recovering himself ‘she is crushed  simply crushed by your anna karenina 937 of 1759 generosity
if she were to read this letter  she would be incapable of saying anything  she would only hang her head lower than ever ’ ‘yes  but what’s to be done in that case  how explain  how find out her wishes ’ ‘if you will allow me to give my opinion  i think that it lies with you to point out directly the steps you consider necessary to end the position ’ ‘so you consider it must be ended ’ alexey alexandrovitch interrupted him
‘but how ’ he added  with a gesture of his hands before his eyes not usual with him
‘i see no possible way out of it ’ ‘there is some way of getting out of every position ’ said stepan arkadyevitch  standing up and becoming more cheerful
‘there was a time when you thought of breaking off   
if you are convinced now that you cannot make each other happy  ’ ‘happiness may be variously understood
but suppose that i agree to everything  that i want nothing  what way is there of getting out of our position ’ ‘if you care to know my opinion ’ said stepan arkadyevitch with the same smile of softening  almond oil tenderness with which he had been talking to anna
his kindly smile was so winning that alexey alexandrovitch  anna karenina 938 of 1759 feeling his own weakness and unconsciously swayed by it  was ready to believe what stepan arkadyevitch was saying
‘she will never speak out about it
but one thing is possible  one thing she might desire ’ he went on  ‘that is the cessation of your relations and all memories associated with them
to my thinking  in your position what’s essential is the formation of a new attitude to one another
and that can only rest on a basis of freedom on both sides ’ ‘divorce ’ alexey alexandrovitch interrupted  in a tone of aversion
‘yes  i imagine that divorce—yes  divorce ’ stepan arkadyevitch repeated  reddening
‘that is from every point of view the most rational course for married people who find themselves in the position you are in what can be done if married people find that life is impossible for them together  that may always happen ’ alexey alexandrovitch sighed heavily and closed his eyes
‘there’s only one point to be considered  is either of the parties desirous of forming new ties  if not  it is very simple ’ said stepan arkadyevitch  feeling more and more free from constraint
anna karenina 939 of 1759 alexey alexandrovitch  scowling with emotion  muttered something to himself  and made no answer all that seemed so simple to stepan arkadyevitch  alexey alexandrovitch had thought over thousands of times
and  so far from being simple  it all seemed to him utterly impossible
divorce  the details of which he knew by this time  seemed to him now out of the question  because the sense of his own dignity and respect for religion forbade his taking upon himself a fictitious charge of adultery  and still more suffering his wife  pardoned and beloved by him  to be caught in the fact and put to public shame divorce appeared to him impossible also on other still more weighty grounds
what would become of his son in case of a divorce  to leave him with his mother was out of the question
the divorced mother would have her own illegitimate family  in which his position as a stepson and his education would not be good
keep him with him  he knew that would be an act of vengeance on his part  and that he did not want
but apart from this  what more than all made divorce seem impossible to alexey alexandrovitch was  that by consenting to a divorce he would be completely ruining anna
the saying of darya alexandrovna at moscow  that in deciding on a divorce he was thinking of himself  and anna karenina 940 of 1759 not considering that by this he would be ruining her irrevocably  had sunk into his heart and connecting this saying with his forgiveness of her  with his devotion to the children  he understood it now in his own way
to consent to a divorce  to give her her freedom  meant in his thoughts to take from himself the last tie that bound him to life—the children whom he loved  and to take from her the last prop that stayed her on the path of right  to thrust her down to her ruin if she were divorced  he knew she would join her life to vronsky’s  and their tie would be an illegitimate and criminal one  since a wife  by the interpretation of the ecclesiastical law  could not marry while her husband was living
‘she will join him  and in a year or two he will throw her over  or she will form a new tie ’ thought alexey alexandrovitch
‘and i  by agreeing to an unlawful divorce  shall be to blame for her ruin ’ he had thought it all over hundreds of times  and was convinced that a divorce was not at all simple  as stepan arkadyevitch had said  but was utterly impossible
he did not believe a single word stepan arkadyevitch said to him  to every word he had a thousand objections to make  but he listened to him  feeling that his words were the expression of that mighty brutal force which controlled his life and to which he would have to submit
anna karenina 941 of 1759 ‘the only question is on what terms you agree to give her a divorce she does not want anything  does not dare ask you for anything  she leaves it all to your generosity ’ ‘my god  my god  what for ’ thought alexey alexandrovitch  remembering the details of divorce proceedings in which the husband took the blame on himself  and with just the same gesture with which vronsky had done the same  he hid his face for shame in his hands ‘you are distressed  i understand that
but if you think it over  ’ ‘whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek  turn to him the other also  and if any man take away thy coat  let him have thy cloak also ’ thought alexey alexandrovitch
‘yes  yes ’ he cried in a shrill voice
‘i will take the disgrace on myself  i will give up even my son  but   but wouldn’t it be better to let it alone  still you may do as you like  ’ and turning away so that his brother in law could not see him  he sat down on a chair at the window
there was bitterness  there was shame in his heart  but with bitterness and shame he felt joy and emotion at the height of his own meekness
anna karenina 942 of 1759 stepan arkadyevitch was touched
he was silent for a space
‘alexey alexandrovitch  believe me  she appreciates your generosity ’ he said
‘but it seems it was the will of god ’ he added  and as he said it felt how foolish a remark it was  and with difficulty repressed a smile at his own foolishness alexey alexandrovitch would have made some reply  but tears stopped him
‘this is an unhappy fatality  and one must accept it as such
i accept the calamity as an accomplished fact  and am doing my best to help both her and you ’ said stepan arkadyevitch
when he went out of his brother in law’s room he was touched  but that did not prevent him from being glad he had successfully brought the matter to a conclusion  for he felt certain alexey alexandrovitch would not go back on his words
to this satisfaction was added the fact that an idea had just struck him for a riddle turning on his successful achievement  that when the affair was over he would ask his wife and most intimate friends
he put this riddle into two or three different ways
‘but i’ll work it out better than that ’ he said to himself with a smile anna karenina 943 of 1759 vronsky’s wound had been a dangerous one  though it did not touch the heart  and for several days he had lain between life and death
the first time he was able to speak  varya  his brother’s wife  was alone in the room
‘varya ’ he said  looking sternly at her  ‘i shot myself by accident
and please never speak of it  and tell everyone so
or else it’s too ridiculous ’ without answering his words  varya bent over him  and with a delighted smile gazed into his face
his eyes were clear  not feverish  but their expression was stern
‘thank god ’ she said
‘you’re not in pain ’ ‘a little here ’ he pointed to his breast
‘then let me change your bandages ’ in silence  stiffening his broad jaws  he looked at her while she bandaged him up
when she had finished he said  ‘i’m not delirious
please manage that there may be no talk of my having shot myself on purpose ’ ‘no one does say so
only i hope you won’t shoot yourself by accident any more ’ she said  with a questioning smile
anna karenina 944 of 1759 ‘of course i won’t  but it would have been better  ’ and he smiled gloomily
in spite of these words and this smile  which so frightened varya  when the inflammation was over and he began to recover  he felt that he was completely free from one part of his misery
by his action he had  as it were  washed away the shame and humiliation he had felt before
he could now think calmly of alexey alexandrovitch
he recognized all his magnanimity  but he did not now feel himself humiliated by it besides  he got back again into the beaten track of his life
he saw the possibility of looking men in the face again without shame  and he could live in accordance with his own habits
one thing he could not pluck out of his heart  though he never ceased struggling with it  was the regret  amounting to despair  that he had lost her forever
that now  having expiated his sin against the husband  he was bound to renounce her  and never in future to stand between her with her repentance and her husband  he had firmly decided in his heart  but he could not tear out of his heart his regret at the loss of her love  he could not erase from his memory those moments of happiness that he had so little prized at the time  and that haunted him in all their charm
anna karenina 945 of 1759 serpuhovskoy had planned his appointment at tashkend  and vronsky agreed to the proposition without the slightest hesitation
but the nearer the time of departure came  the bitterer was the sacrifice he was making to what he thought his duty
his wound had healed  and he was driving about making preparations for his departure for tashkend
‘to see her once and then to bury myself  to die ’ he thought  and as he was paying farewell visits  he uttered this thought to betsy
charged with this commission  betsy had gone to anna  and brought him back a negative reply
‘so much the better ’ thought vronsky  when he received the news
‘it was a weakness  which would have shattered what strength i have left ’ next day betsy herself came to him in the morning  and announced that she had heard through oblonsky as a positive fact that alexey alexandrovitch had agreed to a divorce  and that therefore vronsky could see anna
without even troubling himself to see betsy out of his fiat  forgetting all his resolutions  without asking when he could see her  where her husband was  vronsky drove straight to the karenins’ he ran up the stairs seeing no one and nothing  and with a rapid step  almost breaking anna karenina 946 of 1759 into a run  he went into her room
and without considering  without noticing whether there was anyone in the room or not  he flung his arms round her  and began to cover her face  her hands  her neck with kisses anna had been preparing herself for this meeting  had thought what she would say to him  but she did not succeed in saying anything of it  his passion mastered her
she tried to calm him  to calm herself  but it was too late
his feeling infected her
her lips trembled so that for a long while she could say nothing
‘yes  you have conquered me  and i am yours ’ she said at last  pressing his hands to her bosom
‘so it had to be ’ he said
‘so long as we live  it must be so
i know it now ’ ‘that’s true ’ she said  getting whiter and whiter  and embracing his head
‘still there is something terrible in it after all that has happened ’ ‘it will all pass  it will all pass  we shall be so happy
our love  if it could be stronger  will be strengthened by there being something terrible in it ’ he said  lifting his head and parting his strong teeth in a smile
and she could not but respond with a smile—not to his words  but to the love in his eyes
she took his hand and stroked her chilled cheeks and cropped head with it
anna karenina 947 of 1759 ‘i don’t know you with this short hair
you’ve grown so pretty
a boy
but how pale you are ’ ‘yes  i’m very weak ’ she said  smiling
and her lips began trembling again
‘we’ll go to italy  you will get strong ’ he said
‘can it be possible we could be like husband and wife  alone  your family with you ’ she said  looking close into his eyes
‘it only seems strange to me that it can ever have been otherwise ’ ‘stiva says that he has agreed to everything  but i can’t accept his generosity ’ she said  looking dreamily past vronsky’s face ‘i don’t want a divorce  it’s all the same to me now
only i don’t know what he will decide about seryozha ’ he could not conceive how at this moment of their meeting she could remember and think of her son  of divorce
what did it all matter  ‘don’t speak of that  don’t think of it ’ he said  turning her hand in his  and trying to draw her attention to him  but still she did not look at him
‘oh  why didn’t i die  it would have been better ’ she said  and silent tears flowed down both her cheeks  but she tried to smile  so as not to wound him
anna karenina 948 of 1759 to decline the flattering and dangerous appointment at tashkend would have been  vronsky had till then considered  disgraceful and impossible
but now  without an instant’s consideration  he declined it  and observing dissatisfaction in the most exalted quarters at this step  he immediately retired from the army
a month later alexey alexandrovitch was left alone with his son in his house at petersburg  while anna and vronsky had gone abroad  not having obtained a divorce  but having absolutely declined all idea of one
anna karenina 949 of 1759 part five anna karenina 950 of 1759 princess shtcherbatskaya considered that it was out of the question for the wedding to take place before lent  just five weeks off  since not half the trousseau could possibly be ready by that time
but she could not but agree with levin that to fix it for after lent would be putting it off too late  as an old aunt of prince shtcherbatsky’s was seriously ill and might die  and then the mourning would delay the wedding still longer
and therefore  deciding to divide the trousseau into two parts—a larger and smaller trousseau—the princess consented to have the wedding before lent
she determined that she would get the smaller part of the trousseau all ready now  and the larger part should be made later  and she was much vexed with levin because he was incapable of giving her a serious answer to the question whether he agreed to this arrangement or not
the arrangement was the more suitable as  immediately after the wedding  the young people were to go to the country  where the more important part of the trousseau would not be wanted
levin still continued in the same delirious condition in which it seemed to him that he and his happiness constituted the chief and sole aim of all existence  and that anna karenina 951 of 1759 he need not now think or care about anything  that everything was being done and would be done for him by others
he had not even plans and aims for the future  he left its arrangement to others  knowing that everything would be delightful his brother sergey ivanovitch  stepan arkadyevitch  and the princess guided him in doing what he had to do
all he did was to agree entirely with everything suggested to him
his brother raised money for him  the princess advised him to leave moscow after the wedding
stepan arkadyevitch advised him to go abroad
he agreed to everything
‘do what you choose  if it amuses you
i’m happy  and my happiness can be no greater and no less for anything you do ’ he thought
when he told kitty of stepan arkadyevitch’s advice that they should go abroad  he was much surprised that she did not agree to this  and had some definite requirements of her own in regard to their future
she knew levin had work he loved in the country
she did not  as he saw  understand this work  she did not even care to understand it
but that did not prevent her from regarding it as a matter of great importance
and then she knew their home would be in the country  and she wanted to go  not abroad where she was not going to live  but to the place where their home would be
this definitely expressed anna karenina 952 of 1759 purpose astonished levin
but since he did not care either way  he immediately asked stepan arkadyevitch  as though it were his duty  to go down to the country and to arrange everything there to the best of his ability with the taste of which he had so much
‘but i say ’ stepan arkadyevitch said to him one day after he had come back from the country  where he had got everything ready for the young people’s arrival  ‘have you a certificate of having been at confession ’ ‘no
but what of it ’ ‘you can’t be married without it ’ ‘aie  aie  aie ’ cried levin
‘why  i believe it’s nine years since i’ve taken the sacrament  i never thought of it ’ ‘you’re a pretty fellow ’ said stepan arkadyevitch laughing  ‘and you call me a nihilist  but this won’t do  you know
you must take the sacrament ’ ‘when  there are four days left now ’ stepan arkadyevitch arranged this also  and levin had to go to confession
to levin  as to any unbeliever who respects the beliefs of others  it was exceedingly disagreeable to be present at and take part in church ceremonies
at this moment  in his present softened state of feeling  sensitive to everything  this inevitable act of hypocrisy was not merely painful to levin  it seemed to anna karenina 953 of 1759 him utterly impossible
now  in the heyday of his highest glory  his fullest flower  he would have to be a liar or a scoffer
he felt incapable of being either
but though he repeatedly plied stepan arkadyevitch with questions as to the possibility of obtaining a certificate without actually communicating  stepan arkadyevitch maintained that it was out of the question
‘besides  what is it to you—two days  and he’s an awfully nice clever old fellow
he’ll pull the tooth out for you so gently  you won’t notice it ’ standing at the first litany  levin attempted to revive in himself his youthful recollections of the intense religious emotion he had passed through between the ages of sixteen and seventeen but he was at once convinced that it was utterly impossible to him
he attempted to look at it all as an empty custom  having no sort of meaning  like the custom of paying calls
but he felt that he could not do that either
levin found himself  like the majority of his contemporaries  in the vaguest position in regard to religion believe he could not  and at the same time he had no firm conviction that it was all wrong
and consequently  not being able to believe in the significance of what he was doing nor to regard it with indifference as anna karenina 954 of 1759 an empty formality  during the whole period of preparing for the sacrament he was conscious of a feeling of discomfort and shame at doing what he did not himself understand  and what  as an inner voice told him  was therefore false and wrong during the service he would first listen to the prayers  trying to attach some meaning to them not discordant with his own views  then feeling that he could not understand and must condemn them  he tried not to listen to them  but to attend to the thoughts  observations  and memories which floated through his brain with extreme vividness during this idle time of standing in church
he had stood through the litany  the evening service and the midnight service  and the next day he got up earlier than usual  and without having tea went at eight o’clock in the morning to the church for the morning service and the confession
there was no one in the church but a beggar soldier  two old women  and the church officials
a young deacon  whose long back showed in two distinct halves through his thin undercassock  met him  and at once going to a little table at the wall read the exhortation
during the reading  especially at the frequent and rapid repetition of the same words  ‘lord  have mercy on us ’ anna karenina 955 of 1759 which resounded with an echo  levin felt that thought was shut and sealed up  and that it must not be touched or stirred now or confusion would be the result  and so standing behind the deacon he went on thinking of his own affairs  neither listening nor examining what was said
‘it’s wonderful what expression there is in her hand ’ he thought  remembering how they had been sitting the day before at a corner table
they had nothing to talk about  as was almost always the case at this time  and laying her hand on the table she kept opening and shutting it  and laughed herself as she watched her action
he remembered how he had kissed it and then had examined the lines on the pink palm
‘have mercy on us again ’ thought levin  crossing himself  bowing  and looking at the supple spring of the deacon’s back bowing before him ‘she took my hand then and examined the lines ‘you’ve got a splendid hand ’ she said ’ and he looked at his own hand and the short hand of the deacon
‘yes  now it will soon be over ’ he thought
‘no  it seems to be beginning again ’ he thought  listening to the prayers ‘no  it’s just ending  there he is bowing down to the ground
that’s always at the end ’ the deacon’s hand in a plush cuff accepted a threerouble note unobtrusively  and the deacon said he would anna karenina 956 of 1759 put it down in the register  and his new boots creaking jauntily over the flagstones of the empty church  he went to the altar
a moment later he peeped out thence and beckoned to levin
thought  till then locked up  began to stir in levin’s head  but he made haste to drive it away
‘it will come right somehow ’ he thought  and went towards the altar rails
he went up the steps  and turning to the right saw the priest
the priest  a little old man with a scanty grizzled beard and weary  good natured eyes  was standing at the altar rails  turning over the pages of a missal
with a slight bow to levin he began immediately reading prayers in the official voice
when he had finished them he bowed down to the ground and turned  facing levin
‘christ is present here unseen  receiving your confession ’ he said  pointing to the crucifix
‘do you believe in all the doctrines of the holy apostolic church ’ the priest went on  turning his eyes away from levin’s face and folding his hands under his stole
‘i have doubted  i doubt everything ’ said levin in a voice that jarred on himself  and he ceased speaking the priest waited a few seconds to see if he would not say more  and closing his eyes he said quickly  with a broad  vladimirsky accent  anna karenina 957 of 1759 ‘doubt is natural to the weakness of mankind  but we must pray that god in his mercy will strengthen us
what are your special sins ’ he added  without the slightest interval  as though anxious not to waste time
‘my chief sin is doubt
i have doubts of everything  and for the most part i am in doubt ’ ‘doubt is natural to the weakness of mankind ’ the priest repeated the same words
‘what do you doubt about principally ’ ‘i doubt of everything
i sometimes even have doubts of the existence of god ’ levin could not help saying  and he was horrified at the impropriety of what he was saying
but levin’s words did not  it seemed  make much impression on the priest
‘what sort of doubt can there be of the existence of god ’ he said hurriedly  with a just perceptible smile
levin did not speak
‘what doubt can you have of the creator when you behold his creation ’ the priest went on in the rapid customary jargon
‘who has decked the heavenly firmament with its lights  who has clothed the earth in its beauty  how explain it without the creator ’ he said  looking inquiringly at levin
anna karenina 958 of 1759 levin felt that it would be improper to enter upon a metaphysical discussion with the priest  and so he said in reply merely what was a direct answer to the question
‘i don’t know ’ he said
‘you don’t know  then how can you doubt that god created all ’ the priest said  with good humored perplexity
‘i don’t understand it at all ’ said levin  blushing  and feeling that his words were stupid  and that they could not be anything but stupid n such a position
‘pray to god and beseech him
even the holy fathers had doubts  and prayed to god to strengthen their faith
the devil has great power  and we must resist him
pray to god  beseech him
pray to god ’ he repeated hurriedly
the priest paused for some time  as though meditating
‘you’re about  i hear  to marry the daughter of my parishioner and son in the spirit  prince shtcherbatsky ’ he resumed  with a smile
‘an excellent young lady ’ ‘yes ’ answered levin  blushing for the priest
‘what does he want to ask me about this at confession for ’ he thought
and  as though answering his thought  the priest said to him  anna karenina 959 of 1759 ‘you are about to enter into holy matrimony  and god may bless you with offspring
well  what sort of bringingup can you give your babes if you do not overcome the temptation of the devil  enticing you to infidelity ’ he said  with gentle reproachfulness
‘if you love your child as a good father  you will not desire only wealth  luxury  honor for your infant  you will be anxious for his salvation  his spiritual enlightenment with the light of truth
eh  what answer will you make him when the innocent babe asks you  ‘papa  who made all that enchants me in this world—the earth  the waters  the sun  the flowers  the grass ’ can you say to him  ‘i don’t know’  you cannot but know  since the lord god in his infinite mercy has revealed it to us
or your child will ask you  ‘what awaits me in the life beyond the tomb ’ what will you say to him when you know nothing  how will you answer him  will you leave him to the allurements of the world and the devil  that’s not right ’ he said  and he stopped  putting his head on one side and looking at levin with his kindly  gentle eyes
levin made no answer this time  not because he did not want to enter upon a discussion with the priest  but because  so far  no one had ever asked him such questions  anna karenina 960 of 1759 and when his babes did ask him those questions  it would be time enough to think about answering them
‘you are entering upon a time of life ’ pursued the priest  ‘when you must choose your path and keep to it
pray to god that he may in his mercy aid you and have mercy on you ’ he concluded
‘our lord and god  jesus christ  in the abundance and riches of his lovingkindness  forgives this child   ’ and  finishing the prayer of absolution  the priest blessed him and dismissed him
on getting home that day  levin had a delightful sense of relief at the awkward position being over and having been got through without his having to tell a lie
apart from this  there remained a vague memory that what the kind  nice old fellow had said had not been at all so stupid as he had fancied at first  and that there was something in it that must be cleared up
‘of course  not now ’ thought levin  ‘but some day later on ’ levin felt more than ever now that there was something not clear and not clean in his soul  and that  in regard to religion  he was in the same position which he perceived so clearly and disliked in others  and for which he blamed his friend sviazhsky
levin spent that evening with his betrothed at dolly’s  and was in very high spirits
to explain to stepan anna karenina 961 of 1759 arkadyevitch the state of excitement in which he found himself  he said that he was happy like a dog being trained to jump through a hoop  who  having at last caught the idea  and done what was required of him  whines and wags its tail  and jumps up to the table and the windows in its delight anna karenina 962 of 1759 on the day of the wedding  according to the russian custom (the princess and darya alexandrovna insisted on strictly keeping all the customs)  levin did not see his betrothed  and dined at his hotel with three bachelor friends  casually brought together at his rooms these were sergey ivanovitch  katavasov  a university friend  now professor of natural science  whom levin had met in the street and insisted on taking home with him  and tchirikov  his best man  a moscow conciliation board judge  levin’s companion in his bear hunts
the dinner was a very merry one  sergey ivanovitch was in his happiest mood  and was much amused by katavasov’s originality
katavasov  feeling his originality was appreciated and understood  made the most of it
tchirikov always gave a lively and good humored support to conversation of any sort
‘see  now ’ said katavasov  drawling his words from a habit acquired in the lecture room  ‘what a capable fellow was our friend konstantin dmitrievitch
i’m not speaking of present company  for he’s absent
at the time he left the university he was fond of science  took an interest in anna karenina 963 of 1759 humanity  now one half of his abilities is devoted to deceiving himself  and the other to justifying the deceit ’ ‘a more determined enemy of matrimony than you i never saw ’ said sergey ivanovitch ‘oh  no  i’m not an enemy of matrimony
i’m in favor of division of labor
people who can do nothing else ought to rear people while the rest work for their happiness and enlightenment
that’s how i look at it
to muddle up two trades is the error of the amateur  i’m not one of their number ’ ‘how happy i shall be when i hear that you’re in love ’ said levin
‘please invite me to the wedding ’ ‘i’m in love now ’ ‘yes  with a cuttlefish  you know ’ levin turned to his brother  ‘mihail semyonovitch is writing a work on the digestive organs of the  ’ ‘now  make a muddle of it  it doesn’t matter what about
and the fact is  i certainly do love cuttlefish ’ ‘but that’s no hindrance to your loving your wife ’ ‘the cuttlefish is no hindrance
the wife is the hindrance ’ ‘why so ’ ‘oh  you’ll see  you care about farming  hunting — well  you’d better look out ’ anna karenina 964 of 1759 ‘arhip was here today  he said there were a lot of elks in prudno  and two bears ’ said tchirikov
‘well  you must go and get them without me ’ ‘ah  that’s the truth ’ said sergey ivanovitch
‘and you may say good bye to bear hunting for the future—your wife won’t allow it ’ levin smiled
the picture of his wife not letting him go was so pleasant that he was ready to renounce the delights of looking upon bears forever
‘still  it’s a pity they should get those two bears without you
do you remember last time at hapilovo  that was a delightful hunt ’ said tchirikov
levin had not the heart to disillusion him of the notion that there could be something delightful apart from her  and so said nothing
‘there’s some sense in this custom of saying good bye to bachelor life ’ said sergey ivanovitch
‘however happy you may be  you must regret your freedom ’ ‘and confess there is a feeling that you want to jump out of the window  like gogol’s bridegroom ’ ‘of course there is  but it isn’t confessed ’ said katavasov  and he broke into loud laughter
‘oh  well  the window’s open
let’s start off this instant to tver  there’s a big she bear  one can go right up to the anna karenina 965 of 1759 lair
seriously  let’s go by the five o’clock  and here let them do what they like ’ said tchirikov  smiling
‘well  now  on my honor ’ said levin  smiling  ‘i can’t find in my heart that feeling of regret for my freedom ’ ‘yes  there’s such a chaos in your heart just now that you can’t find anything there ’ said katavasov
‘wait a bit  when you set it to rights a little  you’ll find it ’ ‘no  if so  i should have felt a little  apart from my feeling’ (he could not say love before them) ‘and happiness  a certain regret at losing my freedom   
on the contrary  i am glad at the very loss of my freedom ’ ‘awful  it’s a hopeless case ’ said katavasov
‘well  let’s drink to his recovery  or wish that a hundredth part of his dreams may be realized—and that would be happiness such as never has been seen on earth ’ soon after dinner the guests went away to be in time to be dressed for the wedding when he was left alone  and recalled the conversation of these bachelor friends  levin asked himself  had he in his heart that regret for his freedom of which they had spoken  he smiled at the question ‘freedom  what is freedom for  happiness is only in loving and wishing her wishes  thinking her thoughts  that is to say  not freedom at all—that’s happiness ’ anna karenina 966 of 1759 ‘but do i know her ideas  her wishes  her feelings ’ some voice suddenly whispered to him
the smile died away from his face  and he grew thoughtful
and suddenly a strange feeling came upon him
there came over him a dread and doubt—doubt of everything
‘what if she does not love me  what if she’s marrying me simply to be married  what if she doesn’t see herself what she’s doing ’ he asked himself ‘she may come to her senses  and only when she is being married realize that she does not and cannot love me ’ and strange  most evil thoughts of her began to come to him
he was jealous of vronsky  as he had been a year ago  as though the evening he had seen her with vronsky had been yesterday
he suspected she had not told him everything
he jumped up quickly
‘no  this can’t go on ’ he said to himself in despair ‘i’ll go to her  i’ll ask her  i’ll say for the last time  we are free  and hadn’t we better stay so  anything’s better than endless misery  disgrace  unfaithfulness ’ with despair in his heart and bitter anger against all men  against himself  against her  he went out of the hotel and drove to her house he found her in one of the back rooms she was sitting on a chest and making some arrangements with her maid  anna karenina 967 of 1759 sorting over heaps of dresses of different colors  spread on the backs of chairs and on the floor
‘ah ’ she cried  seeing him  and beaming with delight
‘kostya  konstantin dmitrievitch ’ (these latter days she used these names almost alternately ) ‘i didn’t expect you  i’m going through my wardrobe to see what’s for whom  ’ ‘oh  that’s very nice ’ he said gloomily  looking at the maid
‘you can go  dunyasha  i’ll call you presently ’ said kitty
‘kostya  what’s the matter ’ she asked  definitely adopting this familiar name as soon as the maid had gone out
she noticed his strange face  agitated and gloomy  and a panic came over her
‘kitty  i’m in torture
i can’t suffer alone ’ he said with despair in his voice  standing before her and looking imploringly into her eyes
he saw already from her loving  truthful face  that nothing could come of what he had meant to say  but yet he wanted her to reassure him herself
‘i’ve come to say that there’s still time
this can all be stopped and set right ’ ‘what  i don’t understand
what is the matter ’ ‘what i have said a thousand times over  and can’t help thinking    that i’m not worthy of you
you couldn’t consent to marry me
think a little
you’ve made a anna karenina 968 of 1759 mistake
think it over thoroughly
you can’t love me   
if   better say so ’ he said  not looking at her
‘i shall be wretched let people say what they like  anything’s better than misery   
far better now while there’s still time   ’ ‘i don’t understand ’ she answered  panic stricken  ‘you mean you want to give it up   don’t want it ’ ‘yes  if you don’t love me ’ ‘you’re out of your mind ’ she cried  turning crimson with vexation but his face was so piteous  that she restrained her vexation  and flinging some clothes off an arm chair  she sat down beside him
‘what are you thinking  tell me all ’ ‘i am thinking you can’t love me
what can you love me for ’ ‘my god  what can i do    ’ she said  and burst into tears
‘oh  what have i done ’ he cried  and kneeling before her  he fell to kissing her hands
when the princess came into the room five minutes later  she found them completely reconciled
kitty had not simply assured him that she loved him  but had gone so far—in answer to his question  what she loved him for—as to explain what for
she told him that she loved him because she understood him completely  because she knew anna karenina 969 of 1759 what he would like  and because everything he liked was good
and this seemed to him perfectly clear
when the princess came to them  they were sitting side by side on the chest  sorting the dresses and disputing over kitty’s wanting to give dunyasha the brown dress she had been wearing when levin proposed to her  while he insisted that that dress must never be given away  but dunyasha must have the blue one
‘how is it you don’t see  she’s a brunette  and it won’t suit her   
i’ve worked it all out ’ hearing why he had come  the princess was half humorously  half seriously angry with him  and sent him home to dress and not to hinder kitty’s hair dressing  as charles the hair dresser was just coming
‘as it is  she’s been eating nothing lately and is losing her looks  and then you must come and upset her with your nonsense ’ she said to him
‘get along with you  my dear ’ levin  guilty and shamefaced  but pacified  went back to his hotel
his brother  darya alexandrovna  and stepan arkadyevitch  all in full dress  were waiting for him to bless him with the holy picture
there was no time to lose
darya alexandrovna had to drive home again to fetch her curled and pomaded son  who was to carry the anna karenina 970 of 1759 holy pictures after the bride then a carriage had to be sent for the best man  and another that would take sergey ivanovitch away would have to be sent back   
altogether there were a great many most complicated matters to be considered and arranged
one thing was unmistakable  that there must be no delay  as it was already half past six
nothing special happened at the ceremony of benediction with the holy picture
stepan arkadyevitch stood in a comically solemn pose beside his wife  took the holy picture  and telling levin to bow down to the ground  he blessed him with his kindly  ironical smile  and kissed him three times  darya alexandrovna did the same  and immediately vas in a hurry to get off  and again plunged into the intricate question of the destinations of the various carriages
‘come  i’ll tell you how we’ll manage  you drive in our carriage to fetch him  and sergey ivanovitch  if he’ll be so good  will drive there and then send his carriage ’ ‘of course  i shall be delighted ’ ‘we’ll come on directly with him are your things sent off ’ said stepan arkadyevitch
‘yes ’ answered levin  and he told kouzma to put out his clothes for him to dress
anna karenina 971 of 1759 a crowd of people  principally women  was thronging round the church lighted up for the wedding
those who had not succeeded in getting into the main entrance were crowding about the windows  pushing  wrangling  and peeping through the gratings
more than twenty carriages had already been drawn up in ranks along the street by the police
a police officer  regardless of the frost  stood at the entrance  gorgeous in his uniform
more carriages were continually driving up  and ladies wearing flowers and carrying their trains  and men taking off their helmets or black hats kept walking into the church
iside the church both lusters were already lighted  and all the candles before the holy pictures
the gilt on the red ground of the holy picture stand  and the gilt relief on the pictures  and the silver of the lusters and candlesticks  and the stones of the floor  and the rugs  and the banners above in the choir  and the steps of the altar  and the old blackened books  and the cassocks and surplices—all were flooded with light
on the right side of the warm church  in the crowd of frock coats and white ties  uniforms and broadcloth  velvet  satin  hair and anna karenina 972 of 1759 flowers  bare shoulders and arms and long gloves  there was discreet but lively conversation that echoed strangely in the high cupola every time there was heard the creak of the opened door the conversation in the crowd died away  and everybody looked round expecting to see the bride and bridegroom come in
but the door had opened more than ten times  and each time it was either a belated guest or guests  who joined the circle of the invited on the right  or a spectator  who had eluded or softened the police officer  and went to join the crowd of outsiders on the left
both the guests and the outside public had by now passed through all the phases of anticipation
at first they imagined that the bride and bridegroom would arrive immediately  and attached no importance at all to their being late
then they began to look more and more often towards the door  and to talk of whether anything could have happened
then the long delay began to be positively discomforting  and relations and guests tried to look as if they were not thinking of the bridegroom but were engrossed in conversation
the head deacon  as though to remind them of the value of his time  coughed impatiently  making the window panes quiver in their frames
in the choir the bored choristers could be heard trying their voices and anna karenina 973 of 1759 blowing their noses
the priest was continually sending first the beadle and then the deacon to find out whether the bridegroom had not come  more and more often he went himself  in a lilac vestment and an embroidered sash  to the side door  expecting to see the bridegroom at last one of the ladies  glancing at her watch  said  ‘it really is strange  though ’ and all the guests became uneasy and began loudly expressing their wonder and dissatisfaction
one of the bridegroom’s best men went to find out what had happened
kitty meanwhile had long ago been quite ready  and in her white dress and long veil and wreath of orange blossoms she was standing in the drawing room of the shtcherbatskys’ house with her sister  madame lvova  who was her bridal mother she was looking out of the window  and had been for over half an hour anxiously expecting to hear from her best man that her bridegroom was at the church
levin meanwhile  in his trousers  but without his coat and waistcoat  was walking to and fro in his room at the hotel  continually putting his head out of the door and looking up and down the corridor
but in the corridor there was no sign of the person he was looking for and he came back in despair  and frantically waving his hands anna karenina 974 of 1759 addressed stepan arkadyevitch  who was smoking serenely
‘was ever a man in such a fearful fool’s position ’ he said
‘yes  it is stupid ’ stepan arkadyevitch asserted  smiling soothingly
‘but don’t worry  it’ll be brought directly ’ ‘no  what is to be done ’ said levin  with smothered fury
‘and these fools of open waistcoats  out of the question ’ he said  looking at the crumpled front of his shirt
‘and what if the things have been taken on to the railway station ’ he roared in desperation
‘then you must put on mine ’ ‘i ought to have done so long ago  if at all ’ ‘it’s not nice to look ridiculous   
wait a bit  it will come round ’ the point was that when levin asked for his evening suit  kouzma  his old servant  had brought him the coat  waistcoat  and everything that was wanted
‘but the shirt ’ cried levin
‘you’ve got a shirt on ’ konzma answered  with a placid smile
kouzma had not thought of leaving out a clean shirt  and on receiving instructions to pack up everything and send it round to the shtcherbatskys’ house  from which anna karenina 975 of 1759 the young people were to set out the same evening  he had done so  packing everything but the dress suit
the shirt worn since the morning was crumpled and out of the question with the fashionable open waistcoat
it was a long way to send to the shtcherbatskys’
they sent out to buy a shirt
the servant came back  everything was shut up—it was sunday
they sent to stepan arkadyevitch’s and brought a shirt—it was impossibly wide and short
they sent finally to the shtcherbatskys’ to unpack the things
the bridegroom was expected at the church while he was pacing up and down his room like a wild beast in a cage  peeping out into the corridor  and with horror and despair recalling what absurd things he had said to kitty and what she might be thinking now
at last the guilty kouzma flew panting into the room with the shirt
‘only just in time
they were just lifting it into the van ’ said kouzma
three minutes later levin ran full speed into the corridor  not looking at his watch for fear of aggravating his sufferings
‘you won’t help matters like this ’ said stepan arkadyevitch with a smile  hurrying with more anna karenina 976 of 1759 deliberation after him
‘it will come round  it will come round   i tell you ’ anna karenina 977 of 1759 ‘they’ve come ’ ‘here he is ’ ‘which one ’ ‘rather young  eh ’ ‘why  my dear soul  she looks more dead than alive ’ were the comments in the crowd  when levin  meeting his bride in the entrance  walked with her into the church
stepan arkadyevitch told his wife the cause of the delay  and the guests were whispering it with smiles to one another
levin saw nothing and no one  he did not take his eyes off his bride
everyone said she had lost her looks dreadfully of late  and was not nearly so pretty on her wedding day as usual  but levin did not think so
he looked at her hair done up high  with the long white veil and white flowers and the high  stand up  scalloped collar  that in such a maidenly fashion hid her long neck at the sides and only showed it in front  her strikingly slender figure  and it seemed to him that she looked better than ever—not because these flowers  this veil  this gown from paris added anything to her beauty  but because  in spite of the elaborate sumptuousness of her attire  the expression of her sweet anna karenina 978 of 1759 face  of her eyes  of her lips was still her own characteristic expression of guileless truthfulness
‘i was beginning to think you meant to run away ’ she said  and smiled to him
‘it’s so stupid  what happened to me  i’m ashamed to speak of it ’ he said  reddening  and he was obliged to turn to sergey ivanovitch  who came up to him
‘this is a pretty story of yours about the shirt ’ said sergey ivanovitch  shaking his head and smiling
‘yes  yes ’ answered levin  without an idea of what they were talking about
‘now  kostya  you have to decide ’ said stepan arkadyevitch with an air of mock dismay  ‘a weighty question
you are at this moment just in the humor to appreciate all its gravity
they ask me  are they to light the candles that have been lighted before or candles that have never been lighted  it’s a matter of ten roubles ’ he added  relaxing his lips into a smile
‘i have decided  but i was afraid you might not agree ’ levin saw it was a joke  but he could not smile
‘well  how’s it to be then —unlighted or lighted candles  that’s the question ’ ‘yes  yes  unlighted ’ anna karenina 979 of 1759 ‘oh  i’m very glad
the question’s decided ’ said stepan arkadyevitch  smiling
‘how silly men are  though  in this position ’ he said to tchirikov  when levin  after looking absently at him  had moved back to his bride
‘kitty  mind you’re the first to step on the carpet ’ said countess nordston  coming up
‘you’re a nice person ’ she said to levin
‘aren’t you frightened  eh ’ said marya dmitrievna  an old aunt
‘are you cold  you’re pale
stop a minute  stoop down ’ said kitty’s sister  madame lvova  and with her plump  handsome arms she smilingly set straight the flowers on her head dolly came up  tried to say something  but could not speak  cried and then laughed unnaturally
kitty looked at all of them with the same absent eyes as levin
meanwhile the officiating clergy had got into their vestments  and the priest and deacon came out to the lectern  which stood in the forepart of the church
the priest turned to levin saying something
levin did not hear what the priest said
‘take the bride’s hand and lead her up ’ the best man said to levin
anna karenina 980 of 1759 it was a long while before levin could make out what was expected of him
for a long time they tried to set him right and made him begin again—because he kept taking kitty by the wrong arm or with the wrong arm—till he understood at last that what he had to do was  without changing his position  to take her right hand in his right hand
when at last he had taken the bride’s hand in the correct way  the priest walked a few paces in front of them and stopped at the lectern
the crowd of friends and relations moved after them  with a buzz of talk and a rustle of skirts
someone stooped down and pulled out the bride’s train
the church became so still that the drops of wax could be heard falling from the candles
the little old priest in his ecclesiastical cap  with his long silvery gray locks of hair parted behind his ears  was fumbling with something at the lectern  putting out his little old hands from under the heavy silver vestment with the gold cross on the back of it
stepan arkadyevitch approached him cautiously  whispered something  and making a sign to levin  walked back again
the priest lighted two candles  wreathed with flowers  and holding them sideways so that the wax dropped slowly from them he turned  facing the bridal pair
the anna karenina 981 of 1759 priest was the same old man that had confessed levin
he looked with weary and melancholy eyes at the bride and bridegroom  sighed  and putting his right hand out from his vestment  blessed the bridegroom with it  and also with a shade of solicitous tenderness laid the crossed fingers on the bowed head of kitty
then he gave them the candles  and taking the censer  moved slowly away from them
‘can it be true ’ thought levin  and he looked round at his bride
looking down at her he saw her face in profile  and from the scarcely perceptible quiver of her lips and eyelashes he knew she was aware of his eyes upon her
she did not look round  but the high scalloped collar  that reached her little pink ear  trembled faintly
he saw that a sigh was held back in her throat  and the little hand in the long glove shook as it held the candle
all the fuss of the shirt  of being late  all the talk of friends and relations  their annoyance  his ludicrous position—all suddenly passed way and he was filled with joy and dread
the handsome  stately head deacon wearing a silver robe and his curly locks standing out at each side of his head  stepped smartly forward  and lifting his stole on two fingers  stood opposite the priest
anna karenina 982 of 1759 ‘blessed be the name of the lord ’ the solemn syllables rang out slowly one after another  setting the air quivering with waves of sound
‘blessed is the name of our god  from the beginning  is now  and ever shall be ’ the little old priest answered in a submissive  piping voice  still fingering something at the lectern
and the full chorus of the unseen choir rose up  filling the whole church  from the windows to the vaulted roof  with broad waves of melody
it grew stronger  rested for an instant  and slowly died away
they prayed  as they always do  for peace from on high and for salvation  for the holy synod  and for the tsar  they prayed  too  for the servants of god  konstantin and ekaterina  now plighting their troth
‘vouchsafe to them love made perfect  peace and help  o lord  we beseech thee ’ the whole church seemed to breathe with the voice of the head deacon
levin heard the words  and they impressed him
‘how did they guess that it is help  just help that one wants ’ he thought  recalling all his fears and doubts of late
‘what do i know  what can i do in this fearful business ’ he thought  ‘without help  yes  it is help i want now ’ when the deacon had finished the prayer for the imperial family  the priest turned to the bridal pair with a anna karenina 983 of 1759 book  ‘eternal god  that joinest together in love them that were separate ’ he read in a gentle  piping voice  ‘who hast ordained the union of holy wedlock that cannot be set asunder  thou who didst bless isaac and rebecca and their descendants  according to thy holy covenant  bless thy servants  konstantin and ekaterina  leading them in the path of all good works
for gracious and merciful art thou  our lord  and glory be to thee  the father  the son  and the holy ghost  now and ever shall be ’ ‘amen ’ the unseen choir sent rolling again upon the air
’ ‘joinest together in love them that were separate ’ what deep meaning in those words  and how they correspond with what one feels at this moment ’ thought levin
‘is she feeling the same as i ’ and looking round  he met her eyes  and from their expression he concluded that she was understanding it just as he was
but this was a mistake  she almost completely missed the meaning of the words of the service  she had not heard them  in fact
she could not listen to them and take them in  so strong was the one feeling that filled her breast and grew stronger and stronger
that feeling was joy at the completion of the process that for the last month and a half had been going on in her soul  and had during anna karenina 984 of 1759 those six weeks been a joy and a torture to her
on the day when in the drawing room of the house in arbaty street she had gone up to him in her brown dress  and given herself to him without a word—on that day  at that hour  there took place in her heart a complete severance from all her old life  and a quite different  new  utterly strange life had begun for her  while the old life was actually going on as before
those six weeks had for her been a time of the utmost bliss and the utmost misery
all her life  all her desires and hopes were concentrated on this one man  still uncomprehended by her  to whom she was bound by a feeling of alternate attraction and repulsion  even less comprehended than the man himself  and all the while she was going on living in the outward conditions of her old life living the old life  she was horrified at herself  at her utter insurmountable callousness to all her own past  to things  to habits  to the people she had loved  who loved her—to her mother  who was wounded by her indifference  to her kind  tender father  till then dearer than all the world
at one moment she was horrified at this indifference  at another she rejoiced at what had brought her to this indifference
she could not frame a thought  not a wish apart from life with this man  but this new life was not yet  and she could not even anna karenina 985 of 1759 picture it clearly to herself
there was only anticipation  the dread and joy of the new and the unknown
and now behold—anticipation and uncertainty and remorse at the abandonment of the old life—all was ending  and the new was beginning
this new life could not but have terrors for her inexperience  but  terrible or not  the change had been wrought six weeks before in her soul  and this was merely the final sanction of what had long been completed in her heart
turning again to the lectern  the priest with some difficulty took kitty’s little ring  and asking levin for his hand  put it on the first joint of his finger
‘the servant of god  konstantin  plights his troth to the servant of god  ekaterina ’ and putting his big ring on kitty’s touchingly weak  pink little finger  the priest said the same thing
and the bridal pair tried several times to understand what they had to do  and each time made some mistake and were corrected by the priest in a whisper
at last  having duly performed the ceremony  having signed the rings with the cross  the priest handed kitty the big ring  and levin the little one
again they were puzzled and passed the rings from hand to hand  still without doing what was expected
anna karenina 986 of 1759 dolly  tchirikov  and stepan arkadyevitch stepped forward to set them right
there was an interval of hesitation  whispering  and smiles  but the expression of solemn emotion on the faces of the betrothed pair did not change  on the contrary  in their perplexity over their hands they looked more grave and deeply moved than before  and the smile with which stepan arkadyevitch whispered to them that now they would each put on their own ring died away on his lips
he had a feeling that any smile would jar on them
‘thou who didst from the beginning create male and female ’ the priest read after the exchange of rings  ‘from thee woman was given to man to be a helpmeet to him  and for the procreation of children
o lord  our god  who hast poured down the blessings of thy truth according to thy holy covenant upon thy chosen servants  our fathers  from generation to generation  bless thy servants konstantin and ekaterina  and make their troth fast in faith  and union of hearts  and truth  and love   ’ levin felt more and more that all his ideas of marriage  all his dreams of how he would order his life  were mere childishness  and that it was something he had not understood hitherto  and now understood less than ever  anna karenina 987 of 1759 though it was being performed upon him the lump in his throat rose higher and higher  tears that would not be checked came into his eyes
anna karenina 988 of 1759 in the church there was all moscow  all the friends and relations  and during the ceremony of plighting troth  in the brilliantly lighted church  there was an incessant flow of discreetly subdued talk in the circle of gaily dressed women and girls  and men in white ties  frockcoats  and uniforms the talk was principally kept up by the men  while the women were absorbed in watching every detail of the ceremony  which always means so much to them
in the little group nearest to the bride were her two sisters  dolly  and the other one  the self possessed beauty  madame lvova  who had just arrived from abroad
‘why is it marie’s in lilac  as bad as black  at a wedding ’ said madame korsunskaya
‘with her complexion  it’s the one salvation ’ responded madame trubetskaya
‘i wonder why they had the wedding in the evening  it’s like shop people  ’ ‘so much prettier
i was married in the evening too   ’ answered madame korsunskaya  and she sighed  remembering how charming she had been that day  and how absurdly in love her husband was  and how different it all was now
anna karenina 989 of 1759 ‘they say if anyone’s best man more than ten times  he’ll never be married
i wanted to be for the tenth time  but the post was taken ’ said count siniavin to the pretty princess tcharskaya  who had designs on him
princess tcharskaya only answered with a smile
she looked at kitty  thinking how and when she would stand with count siniavin in kitty’s place  and how she would remind him then of his joke today
shtcherbatsky told the old maid of honor  madame nikolaeva  that he meant to put the crown on kitty’s chignon for luck
‘she ought not to have worn a chignon ’ answered madame nikolaeva  who had long ago made up her mind that if the elderly widower she was angling for married her  the wedding should be of the simplest
‘i don’t like such grandeur ’ sergey ivanovitch was talking to darya dmitrievna  jestingly assuring her that the custom of going away after the wedding was becoming common because newly married people always felt a little ashamed of themselves ‘your brother may feel proud of himself she’s a marvel of sweetness
i believe you’re envious ’ anna karenina 990 of 1759 ‘oh  i’ve got over that  darya dmitrievna ’ he answered  and a melancholy and serious expression suddenly came over his face
stepan arkadyevitch was telling his sister in law his joke about divorce
‘the wreath wants setting straight ’ she answered  not hearing him
‘what a pity she’s lost her looks so ’ countess nordston said to madame lvova
‘still he’s not worth her little finger  is he ’ ‘oh  i like him so—not because he’s my future beaufrere ’ answered madame lvova
‘and how well he’s behaving  it’s so difficult  too  to look well in such a position  not to be ridiculous
and he’s not ridiculous  and not affected  one can see he’s moved ’ ‘you expected it  i suppose ’ ‘almost
she always cared for him ’ ‘well  we shall see which of them will step on the rug first
i warned kitty ’ ‘it will make no difference ’ said madame lvova  ‘we’re all obedient wives  it’s in our family ’ ‘oh  i stepped on the rug before vassily on purpose
and you  dolly ’ anna karenina 991 of 1759 dolly stood beside them  she heard them  but she did not answer
she was deeply moved
the tears stood in her eyes  and she could not have spoken without crying
she was rejoicing over kitty and levin  going back in thought to her own wedding  she glanced at the radiant figure of stepan arkadyevitch  forgot all the present  and remembered only her own innocent love
she recalled not herself only  but all her women friends and acquaintances
she thought of them on the one day of their triumph  when they had stood like kitty under the wedding crown  with love and hope and dread in their hearts  renouncing the past  and stepping forward into the mysterious future
among the brides that came back to her memory  she thought too of her darling anna  of whose proposed divorce she had just been hearing
and she had stood just as innocent in orange flowers and bridal veil
and now  ‘it’s terribly strange ’ she said to herself
it was not merely the sisters  the women friends and female relations of the bride who were following every detail of the ceremony
women who were quite strangers  mere spectators  were watching it excitedly  holding their breath  in fear of losing a single movement or expression of the bride and bridegroom  and angrily not answering  often not hearing  anna karenina 992 of 1759 the remarks of the callous men  who kept making joking or irrelevant observations
‘why has she been crying  is she being married against her will ’ ‘against her will to a fine fellow like that  a prince  isn’t he ’ ‘is that her sister in the white satin  just listen how the deacon booms out  ‘and fearing her husband ’’ ‘are the choristers from tchudovo ’ ‘no  from the synod ’ ‘i asked the footman he says he’s going to take her home to his country place at once
awfully rich  they say
that’s why she’s being married to him ’ ‘no  they’re a well matched pair ’ ‘i say  marya vassilievna  you were making out those fly away crinolines were not being worn
just look at her in the puce dress—an ambassador’s wife they say she is— how her skirt bounces out from side to sides ’ ‘what a pretty dear the bride is—like a lamb decked with flowers  well  say what you will  we women feel for our sister ’ such were the comments in the crowd of gazing women who had succeeded in slipping in at the church doors
anna karenina 993 of 1759 when the ceremony of plighting troth was over  the beadle spread before the lectern in the middle of the church a piece of pink silken stuff  the choir sang a complicated and elaborate psalm  in which the bass and tenor sang responses to one another  and the priest turning round pointed the bridal pair to the pink silk rug
though both had often heard a great deal about the saying that the one who steps first on the rug will be the head of the house  neither levin nor kitty were capable of recollecting it  as they took the few steps towards it
they did not hear the loud remarks and disputes that followed  some maintaining he had stepped on first  and others that both had stepped on together
after the customary questions  whether they desired to enter upon matrimony  and whether they were pledged to anyone else  and their answers  which sounded strange to themselves  a new ceremony began kitty listened to the words of the prayer  trying to make out their meaning  but she could not
the feeling of triumph and radiant happiness flooded her soul more and more as the anna karenina 994 of 1759 ceremony went on  and deprived her of all power of attention
they prayed  ‘endow them with continence and fruitfulness  and vouchsafe that their hearts may rejoice looking upon their sons and daughters ’ they alluded to god’s creation of a wife from adam’s rib ‘and for this cause a man shall leave father and mother  and cleave unto his wife  and they two shall be one flesh ’ and that ‘this is a great mystery"  they prayed that god would make them fruitful and bless them  like isaac and rebecca  joseph  moses and zipporah  and that they might look upon their children’s children
‘that’s all splendid ’ thought kitty  catching the words  ‘all that’s just as it should be ’ and a smile of happiness  unconsciously reflected in everyone who looked at her  beamed on her radiant face
‘put it on quite ’ voices were heard urging when the priest had put on the wedding crowns and shtcherbatsky  his hand shaking in its three button glove  held the crown high above her head
‘put it on ’ she whispered  smiling
levin looked round at her  and was struck by the joyful radiance on her face  and unconsciously her feeling infected him
he too  like her felt glad and happy
anna karenina 995 of 1759 they enjoyed hearing the epistle read  and the roll of the head deacon’s voice at the last verse  awaited with such impatience by the outside public
they enjoyed drinking out of the shallow cup of warm red wine and water  and they were still more pleased when the priest  flinging back his stole and taking both their hands in his  led them round the lectern to the accompaniment of bass voices chanting ‘glory to god ’ shtcherbatsky and tchirikov  supporting the crowns and stumbling over the bride’s train  smiling too and seeming delighted at something  were at one moment left behind  at the next treading on the bridal pair as the priest came to a halt
the spark of joy kindled in kitty seemed to have infected everyone in the church
it seemed to levin that the priest and the deacon too wanted to smile just as he did
taking the crowns off their heads the priest read the last prayer and congratulated the young people
levin looked at kitty  and he had never before seen her look as she did
she was charming with the new radiance of happiness in her face
levin longed to say something to her  but he did not know whether it was all over
the priest got him out of his difficulty
he smiled his kindly anna karenina 996 of 1759 smile and said gently  ‘kiss your wife  and you kiss your husband ’ and took the candles out of their hands
levin kissed her smiling lips with timid care  gave her his arm  and with a new strange sense of closeness  walked out of the church
he did not believe  he could not believe  that it was true
it was only when their wondering and timid eyes met that he believed in it  because he felt that they were one
after supper  the same night  the young people left for the country
anna karenina 997 of 1759 vronsky and anna had been traveling for three months together in europe
they had visited venice  rome  and naples  and had just arrived at a small italian town where they meant to stay some time
a handsome head waiter  with thick pomaded hair parted from the neck upwards  an evening coat  a broad white cambric shirt front  and a bunch of trinkets hanging above his rounded stomach  stood with his hands in the full curve of his pockets  looking contemptuously from under his eyelids while he gave some frigid reply to a gentleman who had stopped him
catching the sound of footsteps coming from the other side of the entry towards the staircase  the head waiter turned round  and seeing the russian count  who had taken their best rooms  he took his hands out of his pockets deferentially  and with a bow informed him that a courier had been  and that the business about the palazzo had been arranged the steward was prepared to sign the agreement
‘ah  i’m glad to hear it ’ said vronsky
‘is madame at home or not ’ anna karenina 998 of 1759 ‘madame has been out for a walk but has returned now ’ answered the waiter
vronsky took off his soft  wide brimmed hat and passed his handkerchief over his heated brow and hair  which had grown half over his ears  and was brushed back covering the bald patch on his head
and glancing casually at the gentleman  who still stood there gazing intently at him  he would have gone on
‘this gentleman is a russian  and was inquiring after you ’ said the head waiter
with mingled feelings of annoyance at never being able to get away from acquaintances anywhere  and longing to find some sort of diversion from the monotony of his life  vronsky looked once more at the gentleman  who had retreated and stood still again  and at the same moment a light came into the eyes of both
‘golenishtchev ’ ‘vronsky ’ it really was golenishtchev  a comrade of vronsky’s in the corps of pages in the corps golenishtchev had belonged to the liberal party  he left the corps without entering the army  and had never taken office under the government
vronsky and he had gone completely anna karenina 999 of 1759 different ways on leaving the corps  and had only met once since
at that meeting vronsky perceived that golenishtchev had taken up a sort of lofty  intellectually liberal line  and was consequently disposed to look down upon vronsky’s interests and calling in life
hence vronsky had met him with the chilling and haughty manner he so well knew how to assume  the meaning of which was  ‘you may like or dislike my way of life  that’s a matter of the most perfect indifference to me  you will have to treat me with respect if you want to know me ’ golenishtchev had been contemptuously indifferent to the tone taken by vronsky
this second meeting might have been expected  one would have supposed  to estrange them still more
but now they beamed and exclaimed with delight on recognizing one another
vronsky would never have expected to be so pleased to see golenishtchev  but probably he was not himself aware how bored he was he forgot the disagreeable impression of their last meeting  and with a face of frank delight held out his hand to his old comrade the same expression of delight replaced the look of uneasiness on golenishtchev’s face
‘how glad i am to meet you ’ said vronsky  showing his strong white teeth in a friendly smile
anna karenina 1000 of 1759 ‘i heard the name vronsky  but i didn’t know which one
i’m very  very glad ’ ‘let’s go in
come  tell me what you’re doing ’ ‘i’ve been living here for two years
i’m working ’ ‘ah ’ said vronsky  with sympathy  ‘let’s go in ’ and with the habit common with russians  instead of saying in russian what he wanted to keep from the servants  he began to speak in french
‘do you know madame karenina  we are traveling together
i am going to see her now ’ he said in french  carefully scrutinizing golenishtchev’s face
‘ah  i did not know’ (though he did know)  golenishtchev answered carelessly
‘have you been here long ’ he added
‘four days ’ vronsky answered  once more scrutinizing his friend’s face intently
‘yes  he’s a decent fellow  and will look at the thing properly ’ vronsky said to himself  catching the significance of golenishtchev’s face and the change of subject ‘i can introduce him to anna  he looks at it properly ’ during those three months that vronsky had spent abroad with anna  he had always on meeting new people asked himself how the new person would look at his anna karenina 1001 of 1759 relations with anna  and for the most part  in men  he had met with the ‘proper’ way of looking at it but if he had been asked  and those who looked at it ‘properly’ had been asked  exactly how they did look at it  both he and they would have been greatly puzzled to answer
in reality  those who in vronsky’s opinion had the ‘proper’ view had no sort of view at all  but behaved in general as well bred persons do behave in regard to all the complex and insoluble problems with which life is encompassed on all sides  they behaved with propriety  avoiding allusions and unpleasant questions they assumed an air of fully comprehending the import and force of the situation  of accepting and even approving of it  but of considering it superfluous and uncalled for to put all this into words
vronsky at once divined that golenishtchev was of this class  and therefore was doubly pleased to see him
and in fact  golenishtchev’s manner to madame karenina  when he was taken to call on her  was all that vronsky could have desired
obviously without the slightest effort he steered clear of all subjects which might lead to embarrassment
he had never met anna before  and was struck by her beauty  and still more by the frankness with which she anna karenina 1002 of 1759 accepted her position
she blushed when vronsky brought in golenishtchev  and he was extremely charmed by this childish blush overspreading her candid and handsome face
but what he liked particularly was the way in which at once  as though on purpose that there might be no misunderstanding with an outsider  she called vronsky simply alexey  and said they were moving into a house they had just taken  what was here called a palazzo
golenishtchev liked this direct and simple attitude to her own position
looking at anna’s manner of simplehearted  spirited gaiety  and knowing alexey alexandrovitch and vronsky  golenishtchev fancied that he understood her perfectly
he fancied that he understood what she was utterly unable to understand  how it was that  having made her husband wretched  having abandoned him and her son and lost her good name  she yet felt full of spirits  gaiety  and happiness ‘it’s in the guide book ’ said golenishtchev  referring to the palazzo vronsky had taken
‘there’s a first rate tintoretto there
one of his latest period ’ ‘i tell you what  it’s a lovely day  let’s go and have another look at it ’ said vronsky  addressing anna
‘i shall be very glad to  i’ll go and put on my hat
would you say it’s hot ’ she said  stopping short in the anna karenina 1003 of 1759 doorway and looking inquiringly at vronsky
and again a vivid flush overspread her face
vronsky saw from her eyes that she did not know on what terms he cared to be with golenishtchev  and so was afraid of not behaving as he would wish he looked a long  tender look at her
‘no  not very ’ he said
and it seemed to her that she understood everything  most of all  that he was pleased with her  and smiling to him  she walked with her rapid step out at the door
the friends glanced at one another  and a look of hesitation came into both faces  as though golenishtchev  unmistakably admiring her  would have liked to say something about her  and could not find the right thing to say  while vronsky desired and dreaded his doing so
‘well then ’ vronsky began to start a conversation of some sort  ‘so you’re settled here  you’re still at the same work  then ’ he went on  recalling that he had been told golenishtchev was writing something
‘yes  i’m writing the second part of the two elements ’ said golenishtchev  coloring with pleasure at the question—‘that is  to be exact  i am not writing it yet  i am preparing  collecting materials
it will be of far wider scope  and will touch on almost all questions
we in anna karenina 1004 of 1759 russia refuse to see that we are the heirs of byzantium ’ and he launched into a long and heated explanation of his views
vronsky at the first moment felt embarrassed at not even knowing of the first part of the two elements  of which the author spoke as something well known
but as golenishtchev began to lay down his opinions and vronsky was able to follow them even without knowing the two elements  he listened to him with some interest  for golenishtchev spoke well
but vronsky was startled and annoyed by the nervous irascibility with which golenishtchev talked of the subject that engrossed him
as he went on talking  his eyes glittered more and more angrily  he was more and more hurried in his replies to imaginary opponents  and his face grew more and more excited and worried
remembering golenishtchev  a thin  lively  good natured and well bred boy  always at the head of the class  vronsky could not make out the reason of his irritability  and he did not like it
what he particularly disliked was that golenishtchev  a man belonging to a good set  should put himself on a level with some scribbling fellows  with whom he was irritated and angry was it worth it  vronsky disliked it  yet he felt that golenishtchev was unhappy  and was sorry for him
anna karenina 1005 of 1759 unhappiness  almost mental derangement  was visible on his mobile  rather handsome face  while without even noticing anna’s coming in  he went on hurriedly and hotly expressing his views
when anna came in in her hat and cape  and her lovely hand rapidly swinging her parasol  and stood beside him  it was with a feeling of relief that vronsky broke away from the plaintive eyes of golenishtchev which fastened persistently upon him  and with a fresh rush of love looked at his charming companion  full of life and happiness
golenishtchev recovered himself with an effort  and at first was dejected and gloomy  but anna  disposed to feel friendly with everyone as she was at that time  soon revived his spirits by her direct and lively manner after trying various subjects of conversation  she got him upon painting  of which he talked very well  and she listened to him attentively
they walked to the house they had taken  and looked over it
‘i am very glad of one thing ’ said anna to golenishtchev when they were on their way back  ‘alexey will have a capital atelier
you must certainly take that room ’ she said to vronsky in russian  using the affectionately familiar form as though she saw that golenishtchev would become intimate with them in their anna karenina 1006 of 1759 isolation  and that there was no need of reserve before him
‘do you paint ’ said golenishtchev  turning round quickly to vronsky
‘yes  i used to study long ago  and now i have begun to do a little ’ said vronsky  reddening
‘he has great talent ’ said anna with a delighted smile
‘i’m no judge  of course
but good judges have said the same ’ anna karenina 1007 of 1759 anna  in that first period of her emancipation and rapid return to health  felt herself unpardonably happy and full of the joy of life
the thought of her husband’s unhappiness did not poison her happiness
on one side that memory was too awful to be thought of
on the other side her husband’s unhappiness had given her too much happiness to be regretted
the memory of all that had happened after her illness  her reconciliation with her husband  its breakdown  the news of vronsky’s wound  his visit  the preparations for divorce  the departure from her husband’s house  the parting from her son—all that seemed to her like a delirious dream  from which she had waked up alone with vronsky abroad
the thought of the harm caused to her husband aroused in her a feeling like repulsion  and akin to what a drowning man might feel who has shaken off another man clinging to him
that man did drown
it was an evil action  of course  but it was the sole means of escape  and better not to brood over these fearful facts
one consolatory reflection upon her conduct had occurred to her at the first moment of the final rupture  anna karenina 1008 of 1759 and when now she recalled all the past  she remembered that one reflection
‘i have inevitably made that man wretched ’ she thought  ‘but i don’t want to profit by his misery i too am suffering  and shall suffer  i am losing what i prized above everything—i am losing my good name and my son
i have done wrong  and so i don’t want happiness  i don’t want a divorce  and shall suffer from my shame and the separation from my child ’ but  however sincerely anna had meant to suffer  she was not suffering
shame there was not
with the tact of which both had such a large share  they had succeeded in avoiding russian ladies abroad  and so had never placed themselves in a false position  and everywhere they had met people who pretended that they perfectly understood their position  far better indeed than they did themselves separation from the son she loved—even that did not cause her anguish in these early days
the baby girl—his child—was so sweet  and had so won anna’s heart  since she was all that was left her  that anna rarely thought of her son
the desire for life  waxing stronger with recovered health  was so intense  and the conditions of life were so new and pleasant  that anna felt unpardonably happy
the more she got to know vronsky  the more she loved him
she loved him for himself  and for his love for her her anna karenina 1009 of 1759 complete ownership of him was a continual joy to her
his presence was always sweet to her
all the traits of his character  which she learned to know better and better  were unutterably dear to her
his appearance  changed by his civilian dress  was as fascinating to her as though she were some young girl in love
in everything he said  thought  and did  she saw something particularly noble and elevated
her adoration of him alarmed her indeed  she sought and could not find in him anything not fine
she dared not show him her sense of her own insignificance beside him
it seemed to her that  knowing this  he might sooner cease to love her  and she dreaded nothing now so much as losing his love  though she had no grounds for fearing it
but she could not help being grateful to him for his attitude to her  and showing that she appreciated it
he  who had in her opinion such a marked aptitude for a political career  in which he would have been certain to play a leading part—he had sacrificed his ambition for her sake  and never betrayed the slightest regret
he was more lovingly respectful to her than ever  and the constant care that she should not feel the awkwardness of her position never deserted him for a single instant
he  so manly a man  never opposed her  had indeed  with her  no will of his own  and was anxious  anna karenina 1010 of 1759 it seemed  for nothing but to anticipate her wishes
and she could not but appreciate this  even though the very intensity of his solicitude for her  the atmosphere of care with which he surrounded her  sometimes weighed upon her
vronsky  meanwhile  in spite of the complete realization of what he had so long desired  was not perfectly happy
he soon felt that the realization of his desires gave him no more than a grain of sand out of the mountain of happiness he had expected
it showed him the mistake men make in picturing to themselves happiness as the realization of their desires for a time after joining his life to hers  and putting on civilian dress  he had felt all the delight of freedom in general of which he had known nothing before  and of freedom in his love — and he was content  but not for long
he was soon aware that there was springing up in his heart a desire for desires—ennui
without conscious intention he began to clutch at every passing caprice  taking it for a desire and an object
sixteen hours of the day must be occupied in some way  since they were living abroad in complete freedom  outside the conditions of social life which filled up time in petersburg
as for the amusements of bachelor existence  which had provided vronsky with entertainment on anna karenina 1011 of 1759 previous tours abroad  they could not be thought of  since the sole attempt of the sort had led to a sudden attack of depression in anna  quite out of proportion with the cause—a late supper with bachelor friends
relations with the society of the place—foreign and russian—were equally out of the question owing to the irregularity of their position
the inspection of objects of interest  apart from the fact that everything had been seen already  had not for vronsky  a russian and a sensible man  the immense significance englishmen are able to attach to that pursuit
and just as the hungry stomach eagerly accepts every object it can get  hoping to find nourishment in it  vronsky quite unconsciously clutched first at politics  then at new books  and then at pictures
as he had from a child a taste for painting  and as  not knowing what to spend his money on  he had begun collecting engravings  he came to a stop at painting  began to take interest in it  and concentrated upon it the unoccupied mass of desires which demanded satisfaction
he had a ready appreciation of art  and probably  with a taste for imitating art  he supposed himself to have the real thing essential for an artist  and after hesitating for some time which style of painting to select—religious  anna karenina 1012 of 1759 historical  realistic  or genre painting—he set to work to paint he appreciated all kinds  and could have felt inspired by any one of them  but he had no conception of the possibility of knowing nothing at all of any school of painting  and of being inspired directly by what is within the soul  without caring whether what is painted will belong to any recognized school
since he knew nothing of this  and drew his inspiration  not directly from life  but indirectly from life embodied in art  his inspiration came very quickly and easily  and as quickly and easily came his success in painting something very similar to the sort of painting he was trying to imitate
more than any other style he liked the french— graceful and effective—and in that style he began to paint anna’s portrait in italian costume  and the portrait seemed to him  and to everyone who saw it  extremely successful
anna karenina 1013 of 1759 the old neglected palazzo  with its lofty carved ceilings and frescoes on the walls  with its floors of mosaic  with its heavy yellow stuff curtains on the windows  with its vases on pedestals  and its open fireplaces  its carved doors and gloomy reception rooms  hung with pictures—this palazzo did much  by its very appearance after they had moved into it  to confirm in vronsky the agreeable illusion that he was not so much a russian country gentleman  a retired army officer  as an enlightened amateur and patron of the arts  himself a modest artist who had renounced the world  his connections  and his ambition for the sake of the woman he loved the pose chosen by vronsky with their removal into the palazzo was completely successful  and having  through golenishtchev  made acquaintance with a few interesting people  for a time he was satisfied
he painted studies from nature under the guidance of an italian professor of painting  and studied medieval italian life
medieval italian life so fascinated vronsky that he even wore a hat and flung a cloak over his shoulder in the medieval style  which  indeed  was extremely becoming to him
anna karenina 1014 of 1759 ‘here we live  and know nothing of what’s going on ’ vronsky said to golenishtchev as he came to see him one morning
‘have you seen mihailov’s picture ’ he said  handing him a russian gazette he had received that morning  and pointing to an article on a russian artist  living in the very same town  and just finishing a picture which had long been talked about  and had been bought beforehand
the article reproached the government and the academy for letting so remarkable an artist be left without encouragement and support
‘i’ve seen it ’ answered golenishtchev
‘of course  he’s not without talent  but it’s all in a wrong direction
it’s all the ivanov strauss renan attitude to christ and to religious painting ’ ‘what is the subject of the picture ’ asked anna
‘christ before pilate
christ is represented as a jew with all the realism of the new school ’ and the question of the subject of the picture having brought him to one of his favorite theories  golenishtchev launched forth into a disquisition on it
‘i can’t understand how they can fall into such a gross mistake
christ always has his definite embodiment in the art of the great masters
and therefore  if they want to depict  not god  but a revolutionist or a sage  let them anna karenina 1015 of 1759 take from history a socrates  a franklin  a charlotte corday  but not christ
they take the very figure which cannot be taken for their art  and then  ’ ‘and is it true that this mihailov is in such poverty ’ asked vronsky  thinking that  as a russian maecenas  it was his duty to assist the artist regardless of whether the picture were good or bad
‘i should say not
he’s a remarkable portrait painter
have you ever seen his portrait of madame vassiltchikova  but i believe he doesn’t care about painting any more portraits  and so very likely he is in want
i maintain that  ’ ‘couldn’t we ask him to paint a portrait of anna arkadyevna ’ said vronsky
‘why mine ’ said anna
‘after yours i don’t want another portrait
better have one of annie’ (so she called her baby girl)
‘here she is ’ she added  looking out of the window at the handsome italian nurse  who was carrying the child out into the garden  and immediately glancing unnoticed at vronsky
the handsome nurse  from whom vronsky was painting a head for his picture  was the one hidden grief in anna’s life
he painted with her as his model  admired her beauty and medievalism  and anna dared not confess to herself that she was afraid of anna karenina 1016 of 1759 becoming jealous of this nurse  and was for that reason particularly gracious and condescending both to her and her little son
vronsky  too  glanced out of the window and into anna’s eyes  and  turning at once to golenishtchev  he said  ‘do you know this mihailov ’ ‘i have met him
but he’s a queer fish  and quite without breeding
you know  one of those uncouth new people one’s so often coming across nowadays  one of those free thinkers you know  who are reared d’emblee in theories of atheism  scepticism  and materialism
in former days ’ said golenishtchev  not observing  or not willing to observe  that both anna and vronsky wanted to speak  ‘in former days the free thinker was a man who had been brought up in ideas of religion  law  and morality  and only through conflict and struggle came to free thought  but now there has sprung up a new type of born freethinkers who grow up without even having heard of principles of morality or of religion  of the existence of authorities  who grow up directly in ideas of negation in everything  that is to say  savages
well  he’s of that class
he’s the son  it appears  of some moscow butler  and has never had any sort of bringing up
when he got into the academy and made his reputation he tried  as he’s no fool  anna karenina 1017 of 1759 to educate himself and he turned to what seemed to him the very source of culture—the magazines
in old times  you see  a man who wanted to educate himself—a frenchman  for instance—would have set to work to study all the classics and theologians and tragedians and historiaris and philosophers  and  you know  all the intellectual work that came in his way but in our day he goes straight for the literature of negation  very quickly assimilates all the extracts of the science of negation  and he’s ready
and that’s not all—twenty years ago he would have found in that literature traces of conflict with authorities  with the creeds of the ages  he would have perceived from this conflict that there was something else  but now he comes at once upon a literature in which the old creeds do not even furnish matter for discussion  but it is stated baldly that there is nothing else—evolution  natural selection  struggle for existence—and that’s all
in my article i’ve  ’ ‘i tell you what ’ said anna  who had for a long while been exchanging wary glances with vronsky  and knew that he was not in the least interested in the education of this artist  but was simply absorbed by the idea of assisting him  and ordering a portrait of him  ‘i tell you what ’ she anna karenina 1018 of 1759 said  resolutely interrupting golenishtchev  who was still talking away  ‘let’s go and see him ’ golenishtchev recovered his self possession and readily agreed
but as the artist lived in a remote suburb  it was decided to take the carriage
an hour later anna  with golenishtchev by her side and vronsky on the front seat of the carriage  facing them  drove up to a new ugly house in the remote suburb
on learning from the porter’s wife  who came out to them  that mihailov saw visitors at his studio  but that at that moment he was in his lodging only a couple of steps off  they sent her to him with their cards  asking permission to see his picture
anna karenina 1019 of 1759 the artist mihailov was  as always  at work when the cards of count vronsky and golenishtchev were brought to him
in the morning he had been working in his studio at his big picture
on getting home he flew into a rage with his wife for not having managed to put off the landlady  who had been asking for money
‘i’ve said it to you twenty times  don’t enter into details
you’re fool enough at all times  and when you start explaining things in italian you’re a fool three times as foolish ’ he said after a long dispute
‘don’t let it run so long  it’s not my fault
if i had the money  ’ ‘leave me in peace  for god’s sake ’ mihailov shrieked  with tears in his voice  and  stopping his ears  he went off into his working room  the other side of a partition wall  and closed the door after him
‘idiotic woman ’ he said to himself  sat down to the table  and  opening a portfolio  he set to work at once with peculiar fervor at a sketch he had begun never did he work with such fervor and success as when things went ill with him  and especially when he anna karenina 1020 of 1759 quarreled with his wife ‘oh  damn them all ’ he thought as he went on working
he was making a sketch for the figure of a man in a violent rage a sketch had been made before  but he was dissatisfied with it ‘no  that one was better   where is it ’ he went back to his wife  and scowling  and not looking at her  asked his eldest little girl  where was that piece of paper he had given them  the paper with the discarded sketch on it was found  but it was dirty  and spotted with candle grease still  he took the sketch  laid it on his table  and  moving a little away  screwing up his eyes  he fell to gazing at it all at once he smiled and gesticulated gleefully
‘that’s it  that’s it ’ he said  and  at once picking up the pencil  he began rapidly drawing
the spot of tallow had given the man a new pose
he had sketched this new pose  when all at once he recalled the face of a shopkeeper of whom he had bought cigars  a vigorous face with a prominent chin  and he sketched this very face  this chin on to the figure of the man he laughed aloud with delight
the figure from a lifeless imagined thing had become living  and such that it could never be changed
that figure lived  and was clearly and unmistakably defined
the sketch might be corrected in accordance with the requirements of the figure  the anna karenina 1021 of 1759 legs  indeed  could and must be put differently  and the position of the left hand must be quite altered  the hair too might be thrown back but in making these corrections he was not altering the figure but simply getting rid of what concealed the figure
he was  as it were  stripping off the wrappings which hindered it from being distinctly seen
each new feature only brought out the whole figure in all its force and vigor  as it had suddenly come to him from the spot of tallow
he was carefully finishing the figure when the cards were brought him
‘coming  coming ’ he went in to his wife
‘come  sasha  don’t be cross ’ he said  smiling timidly and affectionately at her
‘you were to blame
i was to blame
i’ll make it all right ’ and having made peace with his wife he put on an olive green overcoat with a velvet collar and a hat  and went towards his studio
the successful figure he had already forgotten
now he was delighted and excited at the visit of these people of consequence  russians  who had come in their carriage
of his picture  the one that stood now on his easel  he had at the bottom of his heart one conviction—that no one had ever painted a picture like it
he did not believe that his picture was better than all the pictures of raphael  anna karenina 1022 of 1759 but he knew that what he tried to convey in that picture  no one ever had conveyed
this he knew positively  and had known a long while  ever since he had begun to paint it
but other people’s criticisms  whatever they might be  had yet immense consequence in his eyes  and they agitated him to the depths of his soul any remark  the most insignificant  that showed that the critic saw even the tiniest part of what he saw in the picture  agitated him to the depths of his soul
he always attributed to his critics a more profound comprehension than he had himself  and always expected from them something he did not himself see in the picture and often in their criticisms he fancied that he had found this he walked rapidly to the door of his studio  and in spite of his excitement he was struck by the soft light on anna’s figure as she stood in the shade of the entrance listening to golenishtchev  who was eagerly telling her something  while she evidently wanted to look round at the artist
he was himself unconscious how  as he approached them  he seized on this impression and absorbed it  as he had the chin of the shopkeeper who had sold him the cigars  and put it away somewhere to be brought out when he wanted it the visitors  not agreeably impressed beforehand by golenishtchev’s anna karenina 1023 of 1759 account of the artist  were still less so by his personal appearance
thick set and of middle height  with nimble movements  with his brown hat  olive green coat and narrow trousers—though wide trousers had been a long while in fashion —most of all  with the ordinariness of his broad face  and the combined expression of timidity and anxiety to keep up his dignity  mihailov made an unpleasant impression
‘please step in ’ he said  trying to look indifferent  and going into the passage he took a key out of his pocket and opened the door
anna karenina 1024 of 1759 on entering the studio  mihailov once more scanned his visitors and noted down in his imagination vronsky’s expression too  and especially his jaws
although his artistic sense was unceasingly at work collecting materials  although he felt a continually increasing excitement as the moment of criticizing his work drew nearer  he rapidly and subtly formed  from imperceptible signs  a mental image of these three persons
that fellow (golenishtchev) was a russian living here
mihailov did not remember his surname nor where he had met him  nor what he had said to him
he only remembered his face as he remembered all the faces he had ever seen  but he remembered  too  that it was one of the faces laid by in his memory in the immense class of the falsely consequential and poor in expression
the abundant hair and very open forehead gave an appearance of consequence to the face  which had only one expression— a petty  childish  peevish expression  concentrated just above the bridge of the narrow nose
vronsky and madame karenina must be  mihailov supposed  distinguished and wealthy russians  knowing nothing anna karenina 1025 of 1759 about art  like all those wealthy russians  but posing as amateurs and connoisseurs
‘most likely they’ve already looked at all the antiques  and now they’re making the round of the studios of the new people  the german humbug  and the cracked pre raphaelite english fellow  and have only come to me to make the point of view complete ’ he thought
he was well acquainted with the way dilettanti have (the cleverer they were the worse he found them) of looking at the works of contemporary artists with the sole object of being in a position to say that art is a thing of the past  and that the more one sees of the new men the more one sees how inimitable the works of the great old masters have remained
he expected all this  he saw it all in their faces  he saw it in the careless indifference with which they talked among themselves  stared at the lay figures and busts  and walked about in leisurely fashion  waiting for him to uncover his picture but in spite of this  while he was turning over his studies  pulling up the blinds and taking off the sheet  he was in intense excitement  especially as  in spite of his conviction that all distinguished and wealthy russians were certain to be beasts and fools  he liked vronsky  and still more anna
‘here  if you please ’ he said  moving on one side with his nimble gait and pointing to his picture  ‘it’s the anna karenina 1026 of 1759 feeling his lips were beginning to tremble with emotion
he moved away and stood behind them
for the few seconds during which the visitors were gazing at the picture in silence mihailov too gazed at it with the indifferent eye of an outsider
for those few seconds he was sure in anticipation that a higher  juster criticism would be uttered by them  by those very visitors whom he had been so despising a moment before
he forgot all he had thought about his picture before during the three years he had been painting it  he forgot all its qualities which had been absolutely certain to him—he saw the picture with their indifferent  new  outside eyes  and saw nothing good in it
he saw in the foreground pilate’s irritated face and the serene face of christ  and in the background the figures of pilate’s retinue and the face of john watching what was happening
every face that  with such agony  such blunders and corrections had grown up within him with its special character  every face that had given him such torments and such raptures  and all these faces so many times transposed for the sake of the harmony of the whole  all the shades of color and tones that he had attained with such labor—all of this together seemed to him now  looking at it with their eyes  the anna karenina 1027 of 1759 merest vulgarity  something that had been done a thousand times over
the face dearest to him  the face of christ  the center of the picture  which had given him such ecstasy as it unfolded itself to him  was utterly lost to him when he glanced at the picture with their eyes
he saw a well painted (no  not even that—he distinctly saw now a mass of defects) repetition of those endless christs of titian  raphael  rubens  and the same soldiers and pilate
it was all common  poor  and stale  and positively badly painted—weak and unequal
they would be justified in repeating hypocritically civil speeches in the presence of the painter  and pitying him and laughing at him when they were alone again
the silence (though it lasted no more than a minute) became too intolerable to him
to break it  and to show he was not agitated  he made an effort and addressed golenishtchev
‘i think i’ve had the pleasure of meeting you ’ he said  looking uneasily first at anna  then at vronsky  in fear of losing any shade of their expression
‘to be sure  we met at rossi’s  do you remember  at that soiree when that italian lady recited—the new rachel ’ golenishtchev answered easily  removing his eyes anna karenina 1028 of 1759 without the slightest regret from the picture and turning to the artist
noticing  however  that mihailov was expecting a criticism of the picture  he said  ‘your picture has got on a great deal since i saw it last time  and what strikes me particularly now  as it did then  is the figure of pilate
one so knows the man  a goodnatured  capital fellow  but an official through and through  who does not know what it is he’s doing
but i fancy  ’ all mihailov’s mobile face beamed at once  his eyes sparkled
he tried to say something  but he could not speak for excitement  and pretended to be coughing
low as was his opinion of golenishtchev’s capacity for understanding art  trifling as was the true remark upon the fidelity of the expression of pilate as an official  and offensive as might have seemed the utterance of so unimportant an observation while nothing was said of more serious points  mihailov was in an ecstasy of delight at this observation
he had himself thought about pilate’s figure just what golenishtchev said the fact that this reflection was but one of millions of reflections  which as mihailov knew for certain would be true  did not diminish for him the significance of golenishtchev’s anna karenina 1029 of 1759 remark
his heart warmed to golenishtchev for this remark  and from a state of depression he suddenly passed to ecstasy
at once the whole of his picture lived before him in all the indescribable complexity of everything living
mihailov again tried to say that that was how he understood pilate  but his lips quivered intractably  and he could not pronounce the words
vronsky and anna too said something in that subdued voice in which  partly to avoid hurting the artist’s feelings and partly to avoid saying out loud something silly—so easily said when talking of art—people usually speak at exhibitions of pictures
mihailov fancied that the picture had made an impression on them too
he went up to them
‘how marvelous christ’s expression is ’ said anna
of all she saw she liked that expression most of all  and she felt that it was the center of the picture  and so praise of it would be pleasant to the artist
‘one can see that he is pitying pilate ’ this again was one of the million true reflections that could be found in his picture and in the figure of christ
she said that he was pitying pilate
in christ’s expression there ought to be indeed an expression of pity  since there is an expression of love  of heavenly peace  of readiness for death  and a sense of the vanity of words
of course there anna karenina 1030 of 1759 is the expression of an official in pilate and of pity in christ  seeing that one is the incarnation of the fleshly and the other of the spiritual life
all this and much more flashed into mihailov’s thoughts
‘yes  and how that figure is done—what atmosphere  one can walk round it ’ said golenishtchev  unmistakably betraying by this remark that he did not approve of the meaning and idea of the figure
‘yes  there’s a wonderful mastery ’ said vronsky
‘how those figures in the background stand out  there you have technique ’ he said  addressing golenishtchev  alluding to a conversation between them about vronsky’s despair of attaining this technique
‘yes  yes  marvelous ’ golenishtchev and anna assented
in spite of the excited condition in which he was  the sentence about technique had sent a pang to mihailov’s heart  and looking angrily at vronsky he suddenly scowled
he had often heard this word technique  and was utterly unable to understand what was understood by it
he knew that by this term was understood a mechanical facility for painting or drawing  entirely apart from its subject
he had noticed often that even in actual praise technique was opposed to essential quality  as though one could paint well something that was anna karenina 1031 of 1759 bad
he knew that a great deal of attention and care was necessary in taking off the coverings  to avoid injuring the creation itself  and to take off all the coverings  but there was no art of painting—no technique of any sort—about it
if to a little child or to his cook were revealed what he saw  it or she would have been able to peel the wrappings off what was seen
and the most experienced and adroit painter could not by mere mechanical facility paint anything if the lines of the subject were not revealed to him first
besides  he saw that if it came to talking about technique  it was impossible to praise him for it
in all he had painted and repainted he saw faults that hurt his eyes  coming from want of care in taking off the wrappings— faults he could not correct now without spoiling the whole
and in almost all the figures and faces he saw  too  remnants of the wrappings not perfectly removed that spoiled the picture
‘one thing might be said  if you will allow me to make the remark   ’ observed golenishtchev
‘oh  i shall be delighted  i beg you ’ said mihailov with a forced smile
‘that is  that you make him the man god  and not the god man
but i know that was what you meant to do ’ anna karenina 1032 of 1759 ‘i cannot paint a christ that is not in my heart ’ said mihailov gloomily
‘yes  but in that case  if you will allow me to say what i think   
your picture is so fine that my observation cannot detract from it  and  besides  it is only my personal opinion
with you it is different
your very motive is different
but let us take ivanov
i imagine that if christ is brought down to the level of an historical character  it would have been better for ivanov to select some other historical subject  fresh  untouched ’ ‘but if this is the greatest subject presented to art ’ ‘if one looked one would find others
but the point is that art cannot suffer doubt and discussion
and before the picture of ivanov the question arises for the believer and the unbeliever alike  ‘is it god  or is it not god ’ and the unity of the impression is destroyed ’ ‘why so  i think that for educated people ’ said mihailov  ‘the question cannot exist ’ golenishtchev did not agree with this  and confounded mihailov by his support of his first idea of the unity of the impression being essential to art
mihailov was greatly perturbed  but he could say nothing in defense of his own idea
anna karenina 1033 of 1759 anna and vronsky had long been exchanging glances  regretting their friend’s flow of cleverness
at last vronsky  without waiting for the artist  walked away to another small picture
‘oh  how exquisite  what a lovely thing  a gem  how exquisite ’ they cried with one voice
‘what is it they’re so pleased with ’ thought mihailov
he had positively forgotten that picture he had painted three years ago
he had forgotten all the agonies and the ecstasies he had lived through with that picture when for several months it had been the one thought haunting him day and night
he had forgotten  as he always forgot  the pictures he had finished
he did not even like to look at it  and had only brought it out because he was expecting an englishman who wanted to buy it
‘oh  that’s only an old study ’ he said
‘how fine ’ said golenishtchev  he too  with unmistakable sincerity  falling under the spell of the picture
two boys were angling in the shade of a willow tree
the elder had just dropped in the hook  and was carefully anna karenina 1034 of 1759 pulling the float from behind a bush  entirely absorbed in what he was doing
the other  a little younger  was lying in the grass leaning on his elbows  with his tangled  flaxen head in his hands  staring at the water with his dreamy blue eyes
what was he thinking of  the enthusiasm over this picture stirred some of the old feeling for it in mihailov  but he feared and disliked this waste of feeling for things past  and so  even though this praise was grateful to him  he tried to draw his visitors away to a third picture
but vronsky asked whether the picture was for sale
to mihailov at that moment  excited by visitors  it was extremely distasteful to speak of money matters
‘it is put up there to be sold ’ he answered  scowling gloomily
when the visitors had gone  mihailov sat down opposite the picture of pilate and christ  and in his mind went over what had been said  and what  though not said  had been implied by those visitors
and  strange to say  what had had such weight with him  while they were there and while he mentally put himself at their point of view  suddenly lost all importance for him he began to look at his picture with all his own full artist vision  and was soon in that mood of conviction of the perfectibility  anna karenina 1035 of 1759 and so of the significance  of his picture—a conviction essential to the most intense fervor  excluding all other interests—in which alone he could work
christ’s foreshortened leg was not right  though
he took his palette and began to work
as he corrected the leg he looked continually at the figure of john in the background  which his visitors had not even noticed  but which he knew was beyond perfection
when he had finished the leg he wanted to touch that figure  but he felt too much excited for it
he was equally unable to work when he was cold and when he was too much affected and saw everything too much
there was only one stage in the transition from coldness to inspiration  at which work was possible
today he was too much agitated
he would have covered the picture  but he stopped  holding the cloth in his hand  and  smiling blissfully  gazed a long while at the figure of john
at last  as it were regretfully tearing himself away  he dropped the cloth  and  exhausted but happy  went home vronsky  anna  and golenishtchev  on their way home  were particularly lively and cheerful
they talked of mihailov and his pictures
the word talent  by which they meant an inborn  almost physical  aptitude apart from brain and heart  and in which they tried to find an anna karenina 1036 of 1759 expression for all the artist had gained from life  recurred particularly often in their talk  as though it were necessary for them to sum up what they had no conception of  though they wanted to talk of it
they said that there was no denying his talent  but that his talent could not develop for want of education—the common defect of our russian artists
but the picture of the boys had imprinted itself on their memories  and they were continually coming back to it
‘what an exquisite thing  how he has succeeded in it  and how simply  he doesn’t even comprehend how good it is
yes  i mustn’t let it slip  i must buy it ’ said vronsky
anna karenina 1037 of 1759 mihailov sold vronsky his picture  and agreed to paint a portrait of anna
on the day fixed he came and began the work
from the fifth sitting the portrait impressed everyone  especially vronsky  not only by its resemblance  but by its characteristic beauty
it was strange how mihailov could have discovered just her characteristic beauty
‘one needs to know and love her as i have loved her to discover the very sweetest expression of her soul ’ vronsky thought  though it was only from this portrait that he had himself learned this sweetest expression of her soul but the expression was so true that he  and others too  fancied they had long known it
‘i have been struggling on for ever so long without doing anything ’ he said of his own portrait of her  ‘and he just looked and painted it
that’s where technique comes in ’ ‘that will come ’ was the consoling reassurance given him by golenishtchev  in whose view vronsky had both talent  and what was most important  culture  giving him a wider outlook on art
golenishtchev’s faith in vronsky’s anna karenina 1038 of 1759 talent was propped up by his own need of vronsky’s sympathy and approval for his own articles and ideas  and he felt that the praise and support must be mutual
in another man’s house  and especially in vronsky’s palazzo  mihailov was quite a different man from what he was in his studio
he behaved with hostile courtesy  as though he were afraid of coming closer to people he did not respect
he called vronsky ‘your excellency ’ and notwithstanding anna’s and vronsky’s invitations  he would never stay to dinner  nor come except for the sittings
anna was even more friendly to him than to other people  and was very grateful for her portrait
vronsky was more than cordial with him  and was obviously interested to know the artist’s opinion of his picture
golenishtchev never let slip an opportunity of instilling sound ideas about art into mihailov
but mihailov remained equally chilly to all of them
anna was aware from his eyes that he liked looking at her  but he avoided conversation with her
vronsky’s talk about his painting he met with stubborn silence  and he was as stubbornly silent when he was shown vronsky’s picture
he was unmistakably bored by golenishtchev’s conversation  and he did not attempt to oppose him
anna karenina 1039 of 1759 altogether mihailov  with his reserved and disagreeable  as it were  hostile attitude  was quite disliked by them as they got to know him better  and they were glad when the sittings were over  and they were left with a magnificent portrait in their possession  and he gave up coming
golenishtchev was the first to give expression to an idea that had occurred to all of them  which was that mihailov was simply jealous of vronsky
‘not envious  let us say  since he has talent  but it annoys him that a wealthy man of the highest society  and a count  too (you know they all detest a title)  can  without any particular trouble  do as well  if not better  than he who has devoted all his life to it
and more than all  it’s a question of culture  which he is without ’ vronsky defended mihailov  but at the bottom of his heart he believed it  because in his view a man of a different  lower world would be sure to be envious
anna’s portrait—the same subject painted from nature both by him and by mihailov—ought to have shown vronsky the difference between him and mihailov  but he did not see it
only after mihailov’s portrait was painted he left off painting his portrait of anna  deciding that it was now not needed
his picture of medieval life he went on with
and he himself  and golenishtchev  and still anna karenina 1040 of 1759 more anna  thought it very good  because it was far more like the celebrated pictures they knew than mihailov’s picture mihailov meanwhile  although anna’s portrait greatly fascinated him  was even more glad than they were when the sittings were over  and he had no longer to listen to golenishtchev’s disquisitions upon art  and could forget about vronsky’s painting
he knew that vronsky could not be prevented from amusing himself with painting  he knew that he and all dilettanti had a perfect right to paint what they liked  but it was distasteful to him a man could not be prevented from making himself a big wax doll  and kissing it but if the man were to come with the doll and sit before a man in love  and begin caressing his doll as the lover caressed the woman he loved  it would be distasteful to the lover
just such a distasteful sensation was what mihailov felt at the sight of vronsky’s painting  he felt it both ludicrous and irritating  both pitiable and offensive
vronsky’s interest in painting and the middle ages did not last long
he had enough taste for painting to be unable to finish his picture
the picture came to a standstill
he was vaguely aware that its defects  inconspicuous at first  would be glaring if he were to go on with it
the same experience befell him as anna karenina 1041 of 1759 golenishtchev  who felt that he had nothing to say  and continually deceived himself with the theory that his idea was not yet mature  that he was working it out and collecting materials this exasperated and tortured golenishtchev  but vronsky was incapable of deceiving and torturing himself  and even more incapable of exasperation with his characteristic decision  without explanation or apology  he simply ceased working at painting
but without this occupation  the life of vronsky and of anna  who wondered at his loss of interest in it  struck them as intolerably tedious in an italian town
the palazzo suddenly seemed so obtrusively old and dirty  the spots on the curtains  the cracks in the floors  the broken plaster on the cornices became so disagreeably obvious  and the everlasting sameness of golenishtchev  and the italian professor and the german traveler became so wearisome  that they had to make some change
they resolved to go to russia  to the country
in petersburg vronsky intended to arrange a partition of the land with his brother  while anna meant to see her son
the summer they intended to spend on vronsky’s great family estate
anna karenina 1042 of 1759 levin had been married three months
he was happy  but not at all in the way he had expected to be
at every step he found his former dreams disappointed  and new  unexpected surprises of happiness he was happy  but on entering upon family life he saw at every step that it was utterly different from what he had imagined
at every step he experienced what a man would experience who  after admiring the smooth  happy course of a little boat on a lake  should get himself into that little boat he saw that it was not all sitting still  floating smoothly  that one had to think too  not for an instant to forget where one was floating  and that there was water under one  and that one must row  and that his unaccustomed hands would be sore  and that it was only to look at it that was easy  but that doing it  though very delightful  was very difficult
as a bachelor  when he had watched other people’s married life  seen the petty cares  the squabbles  the jealousy  he had only smiled contemptuously in his heart
in his future married life there could be  he was convinced  nothing of that sort  even the external forms  indeed  he fancied  must be utterly unlike the life of others anna karenina 1043 of 1759 in everything and all of a sudden  instead of his life with his wife being made on an individual pattern  it was  on the contrary  entirely made up of the pettiest details  which he had so despised before  but which now  by no will of his own  had gained an extraordinary importance that it was useless to contend against
and levin saw that the organization of all these details was by no means so easy as he had fancied before
although levin believed himself to have the most exact conceptions of domestic life  unconsciously  like all men  he pictured domestic life as the happiest enjoyment of love  with nothing to hinder and no petty cares to distract he ought  as he conceived the position  to do his work  and to find repose from it in the happiness of love
she ought to be beloved  and nothing more
but  like all men  he forgot that she too would want work
and he was surprised that she  his poetic  exquisite kitty  could  not merely in the first weeks  but even in the first days of their married life  think  remember  and busy herself about tablecloths  and furniture  about mattresses for visitors  about a tray  about the cook  and the dinner  and so on
while they were still engaged  he had been struck by the definiteness with which she had declined the tour abroad and decided to go into the country  as though she knew of something she anna karenina 1044 of 1759 wanted  and could still think of something outside her love
this had jarred upon him then  and now her trivial cares and anxieties jarred upon him several times
but he saw that this was essential for her
and  loving her as he did  though he did not understand the reason of them  and jeered at these domestic pursuits  he could not help admiring them
he jeered at the way in which she arranged the furniture they had brought from moscow  rearranged their room  hung up curtains  prepared rooms for visitors  a room for dolly  saw after an abode for her new maid  ordered dinner of the old cook  came into collision with agafea mihalovna  taking from her the charge of the stores he saw how the old cook smiled  admiring her  and listening to her inexperienced  impossible orders  how mournfully and tenderly agafea mihalovna shook her head over the young mistress’s new arrangements
he saw that kitty was extraordinarily sweet when  laughing and crying  she came to tell him that her maid  masha  was used to looking upon her as her young lady  and so no one obeyed her
it seemed to him sweet  but strange  and he thought it would have been better without this
he did not know how great a sense of change she was experiencing  she  who at home had sometimes wanted anna karenina 1045 of 1759 some favorite dish  or sweets  without the possibility of getting either  now could order what she liked  buy pounds of sweets  spend as much money as she liked  and order any puddings she pleased
she was dreaming with delight now of dolly’s coming to them with her children  especially because she would order for the children their favorite puddings and dolly would appreciate all her new housekeeping
she did not know herself why and wherefore  but the arranging of her house had an irresistible attraction for her
istinctively feeling the approach of spring  and knowing that there would be days of rough weather too  she built her nest as best she could  and was in haste at the same time to build it and to learn how to do it
this care for domestic details in kitty  so opposed to levin’s ideal of exalted happiness  was at first one of the disappointments  and this sweet care of her household  the aim of which he did not understand  but could not help loving  was one of the new happy surprises
another disappointment and happy surprise came in their quarrels
levin could never have conceived that between him and his wife any relations could arise other than tender  respectful and loving  and all at once in the very early days they quarreled  so that she said he did not anna karenina 1046 of 1759 care for her  that he cared for no one but himself  burst into tears  and wrung her arms this first quarrel arose from levin’s having gone out to a new farmhouse and having been away half an hour too long  because he had tried to get home by a short cut and had lost his way
he drove home thinking of nothing but her  of her love  of his own happiness  and the nearer he drew to home  the warmer was his tenderness for her
he ran into the room with the same feeling  with an even stronger feeling than he had had when he reached the shtcherbatskys’ house to make his offer
and suddenly he was met by a lowering expression he had never seen in her
he would have kissed her  she pushed him away
‘what is it ’ ‘you’ve been enjoying yourself ’ she began  trying to be calm and spiteful
but as soon as she opened her mouth  a stream of reproach  of senseless jealousy  of all that had been torturing her during that half hour which she had spent sitting motionless at the window  burst from her
it was only then  for the first time  that he clearly understood what he had not understood when he led her out of the church after the wedding
he felt now that he was not simply close to her  but that he did not know where he ended and she began
he felt this from the anna karenina 1047 of 1759 agonizing sensation of division that he experienced at that instant
he was offended for the first instant  but the very same second he felt that he could not be offended by her  that she was himself he felt for the first moment as a man feels when  having suddenly received a violent blow from behind  he turns round  angry and eager to avenge himself  to look for his antagonist  and finds that it is he himself who has accidentally struck himself  that there is no one to be angry with  and that he must put up with and try to soothe the pain never afterwards did he feel it with such intensity  but this first time he could not for a long while get over it
his natural feeling urged him to defend himself  to prove to her she was wrong  but to prove her wrong would mean irritating her still more and making the rupture greater that was the cause of all his suffering one habitual feeling impelled him to get rid of the blame and to pass it on her
another feeling  even stronger  impelled him as quickly as possible to smooth over the rupture without letting it grow greater
to remain under such undeserved reproach was wretched  but to make her suffer by justifying himself was worse still like a man half awake in an agony of pain  he wanted to tear out  to fling away the aching place  and coming to his senses  he felt that the aching place was anna karenina 1048 of 1759 himself he could do nothing but try to help the aching place to bear it  and this he tried to do they made peace
she  recognizing that she was wrong  though she did not say so  became tenderer to him  and they experienced new  redoubled happiness in their love
but that did not prevent such quarrels from happening again  and exceedingly often too  on the most unexpected and trivial grounds
these quarrels frequently arose from the fact that they did not yet know what was of importance to each other and that all this early period they were both often in a bad temper
when one was in a good temper  and the other in a bad temper  the peace was not broken  but when both happened to be in an ill humor  quarrels sprang up from such incomprehensibly trifling causes  that they could never remember afterwards what they had quarreled about
it is true that when they were both in a good temper their enjoyment of life was redoubled
but still this first period of their married life was a difficult time for them
during all this early time they had a peculiarly vivid sense of tension  as it were  a tugging in opposite directions of the chain by which they were bound
altogether their honeymoon—that is to say  the month after their wedding—from which from tradition levin anna karenina 1049 of 1759 expected so much  was not merely not a time of sweetness  but remained in the memories of both as the bitterest and most humiliating period in their lives
they both alike tried in later life to blot out from their memories all the monstrous  shameful incidents of that morbid period  when both were rarely in a normal frame of mind  both were rarely quite themselves it was only in the third month of their married life  after their return from moscow  where they had been staying for a month  that their life began to go more smoothly
anna karenina 1050 of 1759 they had just come back from moscow  and were glad to be alone
he was sitting at the writing table in his study  writing
she  wearing the dark lilac dress she had worn during the first days of their married life  and put on again today  a dress particularly remembered and loved by him  was sitting on the sofa  the same old fashioned leather sofa which had always stood in the study in levin’s father’s and grandfather’s days
she was sewing at broderie anglaise
he thought and wrote  never losing the happy consciousness of her presence
his work  both on the land and on the book  in which the principles of the new land system were to be laid down  had not been abandoned  but just as formerly these pursuits and ideas had seemed to him petty and trivial in comparison with the darkness that overspread all life  now they seemed as unimportant and petty in comparison with the life that lay before him suffused with the brilliant light of happiness
he went on with his work  but he felt now that the center of gravity of his attention had passed to something else  and that consequently he looked at his work quite differently and more clearly
formerly this work had been for him an anna karenina 1051 of 1759 escape from life
formerly he had felt that without this work his life would be too gloomy
now these pursuits were necessary for him that life might not be too uniformly bright
taking up his manuscript  reading through what he had written  he found with pleasure that the work was worth his working at
many of his old ideas seemed to him superfluous and extreme  but many blanks became distinct to him when he reviewed the whole thing causes of the present disastrous condition of agriculture in russia
he maintained that the poverty of russia arises not merely from the anomalous distribution of landed property and misdirected reforms  but that what had contributed of late years to this result was the civilization from without abnormally grafted upon russia  especially facilities of communication  as railways  leading to centralization in towns  the development of luxury  and the consequent development of manufactures  credit and its accompaniment of speculation—all to the detriment of agriculture it seemed to him that in a normal development of wealth in a state all these phenomena would arise only when a considerable amount of labor had been put into agriculture  when it had come under regular  or at least definite  conditions  that the wealth of a anna karenina 1052 of 1759 country ought to increase proportionally  and especially in such a way that other sources of wealth should not outstrip agriculture  that in harmony with a certain stage of agriculture there should be means of communication corresponding to it  and that in our unsettled condition of the land  railways  called into being by political and not by economic needs  were premature  and instead of promoting agriculture  as was expected of them  they were competing with agriculture and promoting the development of manufactures and credit  and so arresting its progress  and that just as the one sided and premature development of one organ in an animal would hinder its general development  so in the general development of wealth in russia  credit  facilities of communication  manufacturing activity  indubitably necessary in europe  where they had arisen in their proper time  had with us only done harm  by throwing into the background the chief question calling for settlement—the question of the organization of agriculture
while he was writing his ideas she was thinking how unnaturally cordial her husband had been to young prince tcharsky  who had  with great want of tact  flirted with her the day before they left moscow
‘he’s jealous ’ she thought
‘goodness  how sweet and silly he is  he’s anna karenina 1053 of 1759 jealous of me  if he knew that i think no more of them than of piotr the cook ’ she thought  looking at his head and red neck with a feeling of possession strange to herself
‘though it’s a pity to take him from his work (but he has plenty of time )  i must look at his face  will he feel i’m looking at him  i wish he’d turn round   i’ll will him to ’ and she opened her eyes wide  as though to intensify the influence of her gaze
‘yes  they draw away all the sap and give a false appearance of prosperity ’ he muttered  stopping to write  and  feeling that she was looking at him and smiling  he looked round
‘well ’ he queried  smiling  and getting up
‘he looked round ’ she thought
‘it’s nothing  i wanted you to look round ’ she said  watching him  and trying to guess whether he was vexed at being interrupted or not
‘how happy we are alone together —i am  that is ’ he said  going up to her with a radiant smile of happiness
‘i’m just as happy
i’ll never go anywhere  especially not to moscow ’ ‘and what were you thinking about ’ anna karenina 1054 of 1759 ‘i  i was thinking   
no  no  go along  go on writing  don’t break off ’ she said  pursing up her lips  ‘and i must cut out these little holes now  do you see ’ she took up her scissors and began cutting them out
‘no  tell me  what was it ’ he said  sitting down beside her and watching the tiny scissors moving round
‘oh  what was i thinking about  i was thinking about moscow  about the back of your head ’ ‘why should i  of all people  have such happiness  it’s unnatural  too good ’ he said  kissing her hand
‘i feel quite the opposite  the better things are  the more natural it seems to me ’ ‘and you’ve got a little curl loose ’ he said  carefully turning her head round ‘a little curl  oh yes
no  no  we are busy at our work ’ work did not progress further  and they darted apart from one another like culprits when kouzma came in to announce that tea was ready
‘have they come from the town ’ levin asked kouzma
‘they’ve just come  they’re unpacking the things ’ ‘come quickly ’ she said to him as she went out of the study  ‘or else i shall read your letters without you ’ anna karenina 1055 of 1759 left alone  after putting his manuscripts together in the new portfolio bought by her  he washed his hands at the new washstand with the elegant fittings  that had all made their appearance with her
levin smiled at his own thoughts  and shook his head disapprovingly at those thoughts  a feeling akin to remorse fretted him
there was something shameful  effeminate  capuan  as he called it to himself  in his present mode of life ‘it’s not right to go on like this ’ he thought
‘it’ll soon be three months  and i’m doing next to nothing
today  almost for the first time  i set to work seriously  and what happened  i did nothing but begin and throw it aside
even my ordinary pursuits i have almost given up
on the land i scarcely walk or drive about at all to look after things
either i am loath to leave her  or i see she’s dull alone
and i used to think that  before marriage  life was nothing much  somehow didn’t count  but that after marriage  life began in earnest
and here almost three months have passed  and i have spent my time so idly and unprofitably
no  this won’t do  i must begin
of course  it’s not her fault
she’s not to blame in any way
i ought myself to be firmer  to maintain my masculine independence of action  or else i shall get into such ways  and she’ll get used to them too   
of course she’s not to blame ’ he told himself anna karenina 1056 of 1759 but it is hard for anyone who is dissatisfied not to blame someone else  and especially the person nearest of all to him  for the ground of his dissatisfaction
and it vaguely came into levin’s mind that she herself was not to blame (she could not be to blame for anything)  but what was to blame was her education  too superficial and frivolous
("that fool tcharsky  she wanted  i know  to stop him  but didn’t know how to ’) ‘yes  apart from her interest in the house (that she has)  apart from dress and broderie anglaise  she has no serious interests
no interest in her work  in the estate  in the peasants  nor in music  though she’s rather good at it  nor in reading
she does nothing  and is perfectly satisfied ’ levin  in his heart  censured this  and did not as yet understand that she was preparing for that period of activity which was to come for her when she would at once be the wife of her husband and mistress of the house  and would bear  and nurse  and bring up children
he knew not that she was instinctively aware of this  and preparing herself for this time of terrible toil  did not reproach herself for the moments of carelessness and happiness in her love that she enjoyed now while gaily building her nest for the future
anna karenina 1057 of 1759 when levin went upstairs  his wife was sitting near the new silver samovar behind the new tea service  and  having settled old agafea mihalovna at a little table with a full cup of tea  was reading a letter from dolly  with whom they were in continual and frequent correspondence
‘you see  your good lady’s settled me here  told me to sit a bit with her ’ said agafea mihalovna  smiling affectionately at kitty
in these words of agafea mihalovna  levin read the final act of the drama which had been enacted of late between her and kitty
he saw that  in spite of agafea mihalovna’s feelings being hurt by a new mistress taking the reins of government out of her hands  kitty had yet conquered her and made her love her
‘here  i opened your letter too ’ said kitty  handing him an illiterate letter
‘it’s from that woman  i think  your brother’s   ’ she said
‘i did not read it through
this is from my people and from dolly
fancy  dolly took tanya and grisha to a children’s ball at the sarmatskys’  tanya was a french marquise ’ anna karenina 1058 of 1759 but levin did not hear her
flushing  he took the letter from marya nikolaevna  his brother’s former mistress  and began to read it
this was the second letter he had received from marya nikolaevna
in the first letter  marya nikolaevna wrote that his brother had sent her away for no fault of hers  and  with touching simplicity  added that though she was in want again  she asked for nothing  and wished for nothing  but was only tormented by the thought that nikolay dmitrievitch would come to grief without her  owing to the weak state of his health  and begged his brother to look after him
now she wrote quite differently
she had found nikolay dmitrievitch  had again made it up with him in moscow  and had moved with him to a provincial town  where he had received a post in the government service
but that he had quarreled with the head official  and was on his way back to moscow  only he had been taken so ill on the road that it was doubtful if he would ever leave his bed again  she wrote
‘it’s always of you he has talked  and  besides  he has no more money left ’ ‘read this  dolly writes about you ’ kitty was beginning  with a smile  but she stopped suddenly  noticing the changed expression on her husband’s face
‘what is it  what’s the matter ’ anna karenina 1059 of 1759 ‘she writes to me that nikolay  my brother  is at death’s door
i shall go to him ’ kitty’s face changed at once
thoughts of tanya as a marquise  of dolly  all had vanished
‘when are you going ’ she said
‘tomorrow ’ ‘and i will go with you  can i ’ she said
‘kitty  what are you thinking of ’ he said reproachfully
‘how do you mean ’ offended that he should seem to take her suggestion unwillingly and with vexation
‘why shouldn’t i go  i shan’t be in your way
i  ’ ‘i’m going because my brother is dying ’ said levin
‘why should you  ’ ‘why  for the same reason as you ’ ‘and  at a moment of such gravity for me  she only thinks of her being dull by herself ’ thought levin
and this lack of candor in a matter of such gravity infuriated him
‘it’s out of the question ’ he said sternly
agafea mihalovna  seeing that it was coming to a quarrel  gently put down her cup and withdrew
kitty did not even notice her
the tone in which her husband had anna karenina 1060 of 1759 said the last words wounded her  especially because he evidently did not believe what she had said
‘i tell you  that if you go  i shall come with you  i shall certainly come ’ she said hastily and wrathfully
‘why out of the question  why do you say it’s out of the question ’ ‘because it’ll be going god knows where  by all sorts of roads and to all sorts of hotels
you would be a hindrance to me ’ said levin  trying to be cool
‘not at all
i don’t want anything
where you can go  i can   ’ ‘well  for one thing then  because this woman’s there whom you can’t meet ’ ‘i don’t know and don’t care to know who’s there and what
i know that my husband’s brother is dying and my husband is going to him  and i go with my husband too   ’ ‘kitty  don’t get angry
but just think a little  this is a matter of such importance that i can’t bear to think that you should bring in a feeling of weakness  of dislike to being left alone
come  you’ll be dull alone  so go and stay at moscow a little ’ ‘there  you always ascribe base  vile motives to me ’ she said with tears of wounded pride and fury
‘i didn’t mean  it wasn’t weakness  it wasn’t   i feel that it’s my duty to be with my husband when he’s in trouble  but you try anna karenina 1061 of 1759 on purpose to hurt me  you try on purpose not to understand   ’ ‘no  this is awful  to be such a slave ’ cried levin  getting up  and unable to restrain his anger any longer
but at the same second he felt that he was beating himself ‘then why did you marry  you could have been free
why did you  if you regret it ’ she said  getting up and running away into the drawing room
when he went to her  she was sobbing
he began to speak  trying to find words not to dissuade but simply to soothe her
but she did not heed him  and would not agree to anything
he bent down to her and took her hand  which resisted him
he kissed her hand  kissed her hair  kissed her hand again—still she was silent
but when he took her face in both his hands and said ‘kitty ’ she suddenly recovered herself  and began to cry  and they were reconciled
it was decided that they should go together the next day
levin told his wife that he believed she wanted to go simply in order to be of use  agreed that marya nikolaevna’s being with his brother did not make her going improper  but he set off at the bottom of his heart dissatisfied both with her and with himself he was dissatisfied with her for being unable to make up her mind anna karenina 1062 of 1759 to let him go when it was necessary (and how strange it was for him to think that he  so lately hardly daring to believe in such happiness as that she could love him—now was unhappy because she loved him too much )  and he was dissatisfied with himself for not showing more strength of will even greater was the feeling of disagreement at the bottom of his heart as to her not needing to consider the woman who was with his brother  and he thought with horror of all the contingencies they might meet with
the mere idea of his wife  his kitty  being in the same room with a common wench  set him shuddering with horror and loathing
anna karenina 1063 of 1759 the hotel of the provincial town where nikolay levin was lying ill was one of those provincial hotels which are constructed on the newest model of modern improvements  with the best intentions of cleanliness  comfort  and even elegance  but owing to the public that patronizes them  are with astounding rapidity transformed into filthy taverns with a pretension of modern improvement that only makes them worse than the oldfashioned  honestly filthy hotels
this hotel had already reached that stage  and the soldier in a filthy uniform smoking in the entry  supposed to stand for a hall porter  and the cast iron  slippery  dark  and disagreeable staircase  and the free and easy waiter in a filthy frock coat  and the common dining room with a dusty bouquet of wax flowers adorning the table  and filth  dust  and disorder everywhere  and at the same time the sort of modern upto date self complacent railway uneasiness of this hotel  aroused a most painful feeling in levin after their fresh young life  especially because the impression of falsity made by the hotel was so out of keeping with what awaited them
anna karenina 1064 of 1759 as is invariably the case  after they had been asked at what price they wanted rooms  it appeared that there was not one decent room for them  one decent room had been taken by the inspector of railroads  another by a lawyer from moscow  a third by princess astafieva from the country there remained only one filthy room  next to which they promised that another should be empty by the evening
feeling angry with his wife because what he had expected had come to pass  which was that at the moment of arrival  when his heart throbbed with emotion and anxiety to know how his brother was getting on  he should have to be seeing after her  instead of rushing straight to his brother  levin conducted her to the room assigned them
‘go  do go ’ she said  looking at him with timid and guilty eyes
he went out of the door without a word  and at once stumbled over marya nikolaevna  who had heard of his arrival and had not dared to go in to see him
she was just the same as when he saw her in moscow  the same woolen gown  and bare arms and neck  and the same good naturedly stupid  pockmarked face  only a little plumper ‘well  how is he  how is he ’ anna karenina 1065 of 1759 ‘very bad
he can’t get up
he has kept expecting you
he   
are you   with your wife ’ levin did not for the first moment understand what it was confused her  but she immediately enlightened him
‘i’ll go away
i’ll go down to the kitchen ’ she brought out
‘nikolay dmitrievitch will be delighted
he heard about it  and knows your lady  and remembers her abroad ’ levin realized that she meant his wife  and did not know what answer to make
‘come along  come along to him ’ he said
but as soon as he moved  the door of his room opened and kitty peeped out
levin crimsoned both from shame and anger with his wife  who had put herself and him in such a difficult position  but marya nikolaevna crimsoned still more she positively shrank together and flushed to the point of tears  and clutching the ends of her apron in both hands  twisted them in her red fingers without knowing what to say and what to do
for the first instant levin saw an expression of eager curiosity in the eyes with which kitty looked at this awful woman  so incomprehensible to her  but it lasted only a single instant
anna karenina 1066 of 1759 ‘well  how is he ’ she turned to her husband and then to her
‘but one can’t go on talking in the passage like this ’ levin said  looking angrily at a gentleman who walked jauntily at that instant across the corridor  as though about his affairs
‘well then  come in ’ said kitty  turning to marya nikolaevna  who had recovered herself  but noticing her husband’s face of dismay  ‘or go on  go  and then come for me ’ she said  and went back into the room
levin went to his brother’s room
he had not in the least expected what he saw and felt in his brother’s room
he had expected to find him in the same state of selfdeception which he had heard was so frequent with the consumptive  and which had struck him so much during his brother’s visit in the autumn
he had expected to find the physical signs of the approach of death more marked— greater weakness  greater emaciation  but still almost the same condition of things
he had expected himself to feel the same distress at the loss of the brother he loved and the same horror in face of death as he had felt then  only in a greater degree and he had prepared himself for this  but he found something utterly different anna karenina 1067 of 1759 in a little dirty room with the painted panels of its walls filthy with spittle  and conversation audible through the thin partition from the next room  in a stifling atmosphere saturated with impurities  on a bedstead moved away from the wall  there lay covered with a quilt  a body
one arm of this body was above the quilt  and the wrist  huge as a rake handle  was attached  inconceivably it seemed  to the thin  long bone of the arm smooth from the beginning to the middle
the head lay sideways on the pillow
levin could see the scanty locks wet with sweat on the temples and tense  transparent looking forehead
‘it cannot be that that fearful body was my brother nikolay ’ thought levin
but he went closer  saw the face  and doubt became impossible
in spite of the terrible change in the face  levin had only to glance at those eager eyes raised at his approach  only to catch the faint movement of the mouth under the sticky mustache  to realize the terrible truth that this death like body was his living brother
the glittering eyes looked sternly and reproachfully at his brother as he drew near
and immediately this glance established a living relationship between living men
levin immediately felt the reproach in the eyes fixed on him  and felt remorse at his own happiness
anna karenina 1068 of 1759 when konstantin took him by the hand  nikolay smiled
the smile was faint  scarcely perceptible  and in spite of the smile the stern expression of the eyes was unchanged
‘you did not expect to find me like this ’ he articulated with effort
‘yes   no ’ said levin  hesitating over his words
‘how was it you didn’t let me know before  that is  at the time of my wedding  i made inquiries in all directions ’ he had to talk so as not to be silent  and he did not know what to say  especially as his brother made no reply  and simply stared without dropping his eyes  and evidently penetrated to the inner meaning of each word
levin told his brother that his wife had come with him
nikolay expressed pleasure  but said he was afraid of frightening her by his condition
a silence followed
suddenly nikolay stirred  and began to say something
levin expected something of peculiar gravity and importance from the expression of his face  but nikolay began speaking of his health
he found fault with the doctor  regretting he had not a celebrated moscow doctor
levin saw that he still hoped
anna karenina 1069 of 1759 seizing the first moment of silence  levin got up  anxious to escape  if only for an instant  from his agonizing emotion  and said that he would go and fetch his wife ‘very well  and i’ll tell her to tidy up here
it’s dirty and stinking here  i expect
marya  clear up the room ’ the sick man said with effort
‘oh  and when you’ve cleared up  go away yourself ’ he added  looking inquiringly at his brother
levin made no answer
going out into the corridor  he stopped short
he had said he would fetch his wife  but now  taking stock of the emotion he was feeling  he decided that he would try on the contrary to persuade her not to go in to the sick man ‘why should she suffer as i am suffering ’ he thought
‘well  how is he ’ kitty asked with a frightened face
‘oh  it’s awful  it’s awful  what did you come for ’ said levin
kitty was silent for a few seconds  looking timidly and ruefully at her husband  then she went up and took him by the elbow with both hands
‘kostya  take me to him  it will be easier for us to bear it together
you only take me  take me to him  please  and go away ’ she said
‘you must understand that for me to see you  and not to see him  is far more painful
there i anna karenina 1070 of 1759 might be a help to you and to him
please  let me ’ she besought her husband  as though the happiness of her life depended on it
levin was obliged to agree  and regaining his composure  and completely forgetting about marya nikolaevna by now  he went again in to his brother with kitty
stepping lightly  and continually glancing at her husband  showing him a valorous and sympathetic face  kitty went into the sick room  and  turning without haste  noiselessly closed the door
with inaudible steps she went quickly to the sick man’s bedside  and going up so that he had not to turn his head  she immediately clasped in her fresh young hand the skeleton of his huge hand  pressed it  and began speaking with that soft eagerness  sympathetic and not jarring  which is peculiar to women
‘we have met  though we were not acquainted  at soden ’ she said
‘you never thought i was to be your sister ’ ‘you would not have recognized me ’ he said  with a radiant smile at her entrance
‘yes  i should
what a good thing you let us know  not a day has passed that kostya has not mentioned you  and been anxious ’ anna karenina 1071 of 1759 but the sick man’s interest did not last long
before she had finished speaking  there had come back into his face the stern  reproachful expression of the dying man’s envy of the living
‘i am afraid you are not quite comfortable here ’ she said  turning away from his fixed stare  and looking about the room
‘we must ask about another room ’ she said to her husband  ‘so that we might be nearer ’ anna karenina 1072 of 1759 levin could not look calmly at his brother  he could not himself be natural and calm in his presence when he went in to the sick man  his eyes and his attention were unconsciously dimmed  and he did not see and did not distinguish the details of his brother’s position
he smelt the awful odor  saw the dirt  disorder  and miserable condition  and heard the groans  and felt that nothing could be done to help
it never entered his head to analyze the details of the sick man’s situation  to consider how that body was lying under the quilt  how those emaciated legs and thighs and spine were lying huddled up  and whether they could not be made more comfortable  whether anything could not be done to make things  if not better  at least less bad
it made his blood run cold when he began to think of all these details
he was absolutely convinced that nothing could be done to prolong his brother’s life or to relieve his suffering
but a sense of his regarding all aid as out of the question was felt by the sick man  and exasperated him
and this made it still more painful for levin
to be in the sick room was agony to him  not to be there still worse
and he was continually  on various anna karenina 1073 of 1759 pretexts  going out of the room  and coming in again  because he was unable to remain alone
but kitty thought  and felt  and acted quite differently
on seeing the sick man  she pitied him
and pity in her womanly heart did not arouse at all that feeling of horror and loathing that it aroused in her husband  but a desire to act  to find out all the details of his state  and to remedy them
and since she had not the slightest doubt that it was her duty to help him  she had no doubt either that it was possible  and immediately set to work
the very details  the mere thought of which reduced her husband to terror  immediately engaged her attention
she sent for the doctor  sent to the chemist’s  set the maid who had come with her and marya nikolaevna to sweep and dust and scrub  she herself washed up something  washed out something else  laid something under the quilt
something was by her directions brought into the sick room  something else was carried out
she herself went several times to her room  regardless of the men she met in the corridor  got out and brought in sheets  pillow cases  towels  and shirts
the waiter who was busy with a party of engineers dining in the dining hall  came several times with an irate countenance in answer to her summons  and could not anna karenina 1074 of 1759 avoid carrying out her orders  as she gave them with such gracious insistence that there was no evading her
levin did not approve of all this  he did not believe it would be of any good to the patient
above all  he feared the patient would be angry at it
but the sick man  though he seemed and was indifferent about it  was not angry  but only abashed  and on the whole as it were interested in what she was doing with him
coming back from the doctor to whom kitty had sent him  levin  on opening the door  came upon the sick man at the instant when  by kitty’s directions  they were changing his linen
the long white ridge of his spine  with the huge  prominent shoulder blades and jutting ribs and vertebrae  was bare  and marya nikolaevna and the waiter were struggling with the sleeve of the night shirt  and could not get the long  limp arm into it
kitty  hurriedly closing the door after levin  was not looking that way  but the sick man groaned  and she moved rapidly towards him
‘make haste ’ she said
‘oh  don’t you come ’ said the sick man angrily
‘i’ll do it my myself   ’ ‘what say ’ queried marya nikolaevna
but kitty heard and saw he was ashamed and uncomfortable at being naked before her
anna karenina 1075 of 1759 ‘i’m not looking  i’m not looking ’ she said  putting the arm in
‘marya nikolaevna  you come this side  you do it ’ she added
‘please go for me  there’s a little bottle in my small bag ’ she said  turning to her husband  ‘you know  in the side pocket  bring it  please  and meanwhile they’ll finish clearing up here ’ returning with the bottle  levin found the sick man settled comfortably and everything about him completely changed
the heavy smell was replaced by the smell of aromatic vinegar  which kitty with pouting lips and puffed out  rosy cheeks was squirting through a little pipe
there was no dust visible anywhere  a rug was laid by the bedside
on the table stood medicine bottles and decanters tidily arranged  and the linen needed was folded up there  and kitty’s broderie anglaise
on the other table by the patient’s bed there were candles and drink and powders
the sick man himself  washed and combed  lay in clean sheets on high raised pillows  in a clean night shirt with a white collar about his astoundingly thin neck  and with a new expression of hope looked fixedly at kitty the doctor brought by levin  and found by him at the club  was not the one who had been attending nikolay levin  as the patient was dissatisfied with him
the new anna karenina 1076 of 1759 doctor took up a stethoscope and sounded the patient  shook his head  prescribed medicine  and with extreme minuteness explained first how to take the medicine and then what diet was to be kept to
he advised eggs  raw or hardly cooked  and seltzer water  with warm milk at a certain temperature
when the doctor had gone away the sick man said something to his brother  of which levin could distinguish only the last words  ‘your katya ’ by the expression with which he gazed at her  levin saw that he was praising her
he called indeed to katya  as he called her
‘i’m much better already ’ he said
‘why  with you i should have got well long ago
how nice it is ’ he took her hand and drew it towards his lips  but as though afraid she would dislike it he changed his mind  let it go  and only stroked it
kitty took his hand in both hers and pressed it
‘now turn me over on the left side and go to bed ’ he said
no one could make out what he said but kitty  she alone understood
she understood because she was all the while mentally keeping watch on what he needed
‘on the other side ’ she said to her husband  ‘he always sleeps on that side
turn him over  it’s so disagreeable anna karenina 1077 of 1759 calling the servants
i’m not strong enough
can you ’ she said to marya nikolaevna
‘i’m afraid not ’ answered marya nikolaevna
terrible as it was to levin to put his arms round that terrible body  to take hold of that under the quilt  of which he preferred to know nothing  under his wife’s influence he made his resolute face that she knew so well  and putting his arms into the bed took hold of the body  but in spite of his own strength he was struck by the strange heaviness of those powerless limbs while he was turning him over  conscious of the huge emaciated arm about his neck  kitty swiftly and noiselessly turned the pillow  beat it up and settled in it the sick man’s head  smoothing back his hair  which was sticking again to his moist brow
the sick man kept his brother’s hand in his own
levin felt that he meant to do something with his hand and was pulling it somewhere
levin yielded with a sinking heart  yes  he drew it to his mouth and kissed it
levin  shaking with sobs and unable to articulate a word  went out of the room
anna karenina 1078 of 1759 ‘thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent  and hast revealed them unto babes ’ so levin thought about his wife as he talked to her that evening
levin thought of the text  not because he considered himself ‘wise and prudent ’ he did not so consider himself  but he could not help knowing that he had more intellect than his wife and agafea mihalovna  and he could not help knowing that when he thought of death  he thought with all the force of his intellect he knew too that the brains of many great men  whose thoughts he had read  had brooded over death and yet knew not a hundredth part of what his wife and agafea mihalovna knew about it
different as those two women were  agafea mihalovna and katya  as his brother nikolay had called her  and as levin particularly liked to call her now  they were quite alike in this
both knew  without a shade of doubt  what sort of thing life was and what was death  and though neither of them could have answered  and would even not have understood the questions that presented themselves to levin  both had no doubt of the significance of this event  and were precisely alike in their anna karenina 1079 of 1759 way of looking at it  which they shared with millions of people the proof that they knew for a certainty the nature of death lay in the fact that they knew without a second of hesitation how to deal with the dying  and were not frightened of them
levin and other men like him  though they could have said a great deal about death  obviously did not know this since they were afraid of death  and were absolutely at a loss what to do when people were dying
if levin had been alone now with his brother nikolay  he would have looked at him with terror  and with still greater terror waited  and would not have known what else to do
more than that  he did not know what to say  how to look  how to move
to talk of outside things seemed to him shocking  impossible  to talk of death and depressing subjects—also impossible
to be silent  also impossible
‘if i look at him he will think i am studying him  i am afraid  if i don’t look at him  he’ll think i’m thinking of other things
if i walk on tiptoe  he will be vexed  to tread firmly  i’m ashamed ’ kitty evidently did not think of herself  and had no time to think about herself  she was thinking about him because she knew something  and all went well
she told him about herself even and about her wedding  and smiled and sympathized with him and anna karenina 1080 of 1759 petted him  and talked of cases of recovery and all went well  so then she must know
the proof that her behavior and agafea mihalovna’s was not instinctive  animal  irrational  was that apart from the physical treatment  the relief of suffering  both agafea mihalovna and kitty required for the dying man something else more important than the physical treatment  and something which had nothing in common with physical conditions
agafea mihalovna  speaking of the man just dead  had said  ‘well  thank god  he took the sacrament and received absolution  god grant each one of us such a death ’ katya in just the same way  besides all her care about linen  bedsores  drink  found time the very first day to persuade the sick man of the necessity of taking the sacrament and receiving absolution
on getting back from the sick room to their own two rooms for the night  levin sat with hanging head not knowing what to do not to speak of supper  of preparing for bed  of considering what they were going to do  he could not even talk to his wife  he was ashamed to
kitty  on the contrary  was more active than usual
she was even livelier than usual
she ordered supper to be brought  herself unpacked their things  and herself helped to make the beds  and did not even forget to sprinkle them with anna karenina 1081 of 1759 persian powder
she showed that alertness  that swiftness of reflection comes out in men before a battle  in conflict  in the dangerous and decisive moments of life—those moments when a man shows once and for all his value  and that all his past has not been wasted but has been a preparation for these moments
everything went rapidly in her hands  and before it was twelve o’clock all their things were arranged cleanly and tidily in her rooms  in such a way that the hotel rooms seemed like home  the beds were made  brushes  combs  looking glasses were put out  table napkins were spread levin felt that it was unpardonable to eat  to sleep  to talk even now  and it seemed to him that every movement he made was unseemly
she arranged the brushes  but she did it all so that there was nothing shocking in it
they could neither of them eat  however  and for a long while they could not sleep  and did not even go to bed
‘i am very glad i persuaded him to receive extreme unction tomorrow ’ she said  sitting in her dressing jacket before her folding looking glass  combing her soft  fragrant hair with a fine comb
‘i have never seen it  but i know  mamma has told me  there are prayers said for recovery ’ anna karenina 1082 of 1759 ‘do you suppose he can possibly recover ’ said levin  watching a slender tress at the back of her round little head that was continually hidden when she passed the comb through the front
‘i asked the doctor  he said he couldn’t live more than three days
but can they be sure  i’m very glad  anyway  that i persuaded him ’ she said  looking askance at her husband through her hair
‘anything is possible ’ she added with that peculiar  rather sly expression that was always in her face when she spoke of religion
since their conversation about religion when they were engaged neither of them had ever started a discussion of the subject  but she performed all the ceremonies of going to church  saying her prayers  and so on  always with the unvarying conviction that this ought to be so
in spite of his assertion to the contrary  she was firmly persuaded that he was as much a christian as she  and indeed a far better one  and all that he said about it was simply one of his absurd masculine freaks  just as he would say about her broderie anglaise that good people patch holes  but that she cut them on purpose  and so on
‘yes  you see this woman  marya nikolaevna  did not know how to manage all this ’ said levin
‘and   i must own i’m very  very glad you came
you are such purity anna karenina 1083 of 1759 that    ’ he took her hand and did not kiss it (to kiss her hand in such closeness to death seemed to him improper)  he merely squeezed it with a penitent air  looking at her brightening eyes
‘it would have been miserable for you to be alone ’ she said  and lifting her hands which hid her cheeks flushing with pleasure  twisted her coil of hair on the nape of her neck and pinned it there
‘no ’ she went on  ‘she did not know how   
luckily  i learned a lot at soden ’ ‘surely there are not people there so ill ’ ‘worse ’ ‘what’s so awful to me is that i can’t see him as he was when he was young
you would not believe how charming he was as a youth  but i did not understand him then ’ ‘i can quite  quite believe it
how i feel that we might have been friends ’ she said  and  distressed at what she had said  she looked round at her husband  and tears came into her eyes
‘yes  might have been ’ he said mournfully
‘he’s just one of those people of whom they say they’re not for this world ’ ‘but we have many days before us  we must go to bed ’ said kitty  glancing at her tiny watch
anna karenina 1084 of 1759 the next day the sick man received the sacrament and extreme unction
during the ceremony nikolay levin prayed fervently
his great eyes  fastened on the holy image that was set out on a card table covered with a colored napkin  expressed such passionate prayer and hope that it was awful to levin to see it
levin knew that this passionate prayer and hope would only make him feel more bitterly parting from the life he so loved
levin knew his brother and the workings of his intellect  he knew that his unbelief came not from life being easier for him without faith  but had grown up because step by step the contemporary scientific interpretation of natural phenomena crushed out the possibility of faith  and so he knew that his present return was not a legitimate one  brought about by way of the same working of his intellect  but simply a temporary  interested return to faith in a desperate hope of recovery
levin knew too that kitty had strengthened his hope by accounts of the marvelous recoveries she had heard of
levin knew all this  and it was agonizingly painful to him to behold the supplicating  hopeful eyes and the emaciated wrist  lifted with difficulty  anna karenina 1085 of 1759 making the sign of the cross on the tense brow  and the prominent shoulders and hollow  gasping chest  which one could not feel consistent with the life the sick man was praying for
during the sacrament levin did what he  an unbeliever  had done a thousand times
he said  addressing god  ‘if thou dost exist  make this man to recover’ (of course this same thing has been repeated many times)  ‘and thou wilt save him and me ’ after extreme unction the sick man became suddenly much better
he did not cough once in the course of an hour  smiled  kissed kitty’s hand  thanking her with tears  and said he was comfortable  free from pain  and that he felt strong and had an appetite
he even raised himself when his soup was brought  and asked for a cutlet as well hopelessly ill as he was  obvious as it was at the first glance that he could not recover  levin and kitty were for that hour both in the same state of excitement  happy  though fearful of being mistaken
‘is he better ’ ‘yes  much ’ ‘it’s wonderful ’ ‘there’s nothing wonderful in it ’ ‘anyway  he’s better ’ they said in a whisper  smiling to one another
anna karenina 1086 of 1759 this self deception was not of long duration
the sick man fell into a quiet sleep  but he was waked up half an hour later by his cough
and all at once every hope vanished in those about him and in himself the reality of his suffering crushed all hopes in levin and kitty and in the sick man himself  leaving no doubt  no memory even of past hopes without referring to what he had believed in half an hour before  as though ashamed even to recall it  he asked for iodine to inhale in a bottle covered with perforated paper
levin gave him the bottle  and the same look of passionate hope with which he had taken the sacrament was now fastened on his brother  demanding from him the confirmation of the doctor’s words that inhaling iodine worked wonders
‘is katya not here ’ he gasped  looking round while levin reluctantly assented to the doctor’s words
‘no  so i can say it   
it was for her sake i went through that farce
she’s so sweet  but you and i can’t deceive ourselves
this is what i believe in ’ he said  and  squeezing the bottle in his bony hand  he began breathing over it
at eight o’clock in the evening levin and his wife were drinking tea in their room when marya nikolaevna ran in to them breathlessly
she was pale  and her lips were anna karenina 1087 of 1759 quivering
‘he is dying ’ she whispered
‘i’m afraid will die this minute ’ both of them ran to him
he was sitting raised up with one elbow on the bed  his long back bent  and his head hanging low
‘how do you feel ’ levin asked in a whisper  after a silence
‘i feel i’m setting off ’ nikolay said with difficulty  but with extreme distinctness  screwing the words out of himself he did not raise his head  but simply turned his eyes upwards  without their reaching his brother’s face
‘katya  go away ’ he added
levin jumped up  and with a peremptory whisper made her go out
‘i’m setting off ’ he said again
‘why do you think so ’ said levin  so as to say something
‘because i’m setting off ’ he repeated  as though he had a liking for the phrase
‘it’s the end ’ marya nikolaevna went up to him
‘you had better lie down  you’d be easier ’ she said
‘i shall lie down soon enough ’ he pronounced slowly  ‘when i’m dead ’ he said sarcastically  wrathfully
‘well  you can lay me down if you like ’ anna karenina 1088 of 1759 levin laid his brother on his back  sat down beside him  and gazed at his face  holding his breath
the dying man lay with closed eyes  but the muscles twitched from time to time on his forehead  as with one thinking deeply and intensely
levin involuntarily thought with him of what it was that was happening to him now  but in spite of all his mental efforts to go along with him he saw by the expression of that calm  stern face that for the dying man all was growing clearer and clearer that was still as dark as ever for levin
‘yes  yes  so ’ the dying man articulated slowly at intervals
‘wait a little ’ he was silent
‘right ’ he pronounced all at once reassuringly  as though all were solved for him
‘o lord ’ he murmured  and sighed deeply
marya nikolaevna felt his feet
‘they’re getting cold ’ she whispered
for a long while  a very long while it seemed to levin  the sick man lay motionless
but he was still alive  and from time to time he sighed
levin by now was exhausted from mental strain
he felt that  with no mental effort  could he understand what it was that was right
he could not even think of the problem of death itself  but with no will of his own thoughts kept coming to him of what he anna karenina 1089 of 1759 had to do next  closing the dead man’s eyes  dressing him  ordering the coffin
and  strange to say  he felt utterly cold  and was not conscious of sorrow nor of loss  less still of pity for his brother
if he had any feeling for his brother at that moment  it was envy for the knowledge the dying man had now that he could not have
a long time more he sat over him so  continually expecting the end
but the end did not come
the door opened and kitty appeared
levin got up to stop her
but at the moment he was getting up  he caught the sound of the dying man stirring
‘don’t go away ’ said nikolay and held out his hand
levin gave him his  and angrily waved to his wife to go away
with the dying man’s hand in his hand  he sat for half an hour  an hour  another hour
he did not think of death at all now
he wondered what kitty was doing  who lived in the next room  whether the doctor lived in a house of his own
he longed for food and for sleep
he cautiously drew away his hand and felt the feet
the feet were cold  but the sick man was still breathing
levin tried again to move away on tiptoe  but the sick man stirred again and said  ‘don’t go ’ anna karenina 1090 of 1759 * * * * * * * * the dawn came  the sick man’s condition was unchanged
levin stealthily withdrew his hand  and without looking at the dying man  went off to his own room and went to sleep
when he woke up  instead of news of his brother’s death which he expected  he learned that the sick man had returned to his earlier condition
he had begun sitting up again  coughing  had begun eating again  talking again  and again had ceased to talk of death  again had begun to express hope of his recovery  and had become more irritable and more gloomy than ever
no one  neither his brother nor kitty  could soothe him
he was angry with everyone  and said nasty things to everyone  reproached everyone for his sufferings  and insisted that they should get him a celebrated doctor from moscow
to all inquiries made him as to how he felt  he made the same answer with an expression of vindictive reproachfulness  ‘i’m suffering horribly  intolerably ’ the sick man was suffering more and more  especially from bedsores  which it was impossible now to remedy  and grew more and more angry with everyone about him  blaming them for everything  and especially for not having brought him a doctor from moscow
kitty tried in every anna karenina 1091 of 1759 possible way to relieve him  to soothe him  but it was all in vain  and levin saw that she herself was exhausted both physically and morally  though she would not admit it
the sense of death  which had been evoked in all by his taking leave of life on the night when he had sent for his brother  was broken up
everyone knew that he must inevitably die soon  that he was half dead already
everyone wished for nothing but that he should die as soon as possible  and everyone  concealing this  gave him medicines  tried to find remedies and doctors  and deceived him and themselves and each other all this was falsehood  disgusting  irreverent deceit
and owing to the bent of his character  and because he loved the dying man more than anyone else did  levin was most painfully conscious of this deceit
levin  who had long been possessed by the idea of reconciling his brothers  at least in face of death  had written to his brother  sergey ivanovitch  and having received an answer from him  he read this letter to the sick man
sergey ivanovitch wrote that he could not come himself  and in touching terms he begged his brother’s forgiveness the sick man said nothing
anna karenina 1092 of 1759 ‘what am i to write to him ’ said levin
‘i hope you are not angry with him ’ ‘no  not the least ’ nikolay answered  vexed at the question
‘tell him to send me a doctor ’ three more days of agony followed  the sick man was still in the same condition
the sense of longing for his death was felt by everyone now at the mere sight of him  by the waiters and the hotel keeper and all the people staying in the hotel  and the doctor and marya nikolaevna and levin and kitty
the sick man alone did not express this feeling  but on the contrary was furious at their not getting him doctors  and went on taking medicine and talking of life
only at rare moments  when the opium gave him an instant’s relief from the never ceasing pain  he would sometimes  half asleep  utter what was ever more intense in his heart than in all the others  ‘oh  if it were only the end ’ or  ‘when will it be over ’ his sufferings  steadily growing more intense  did their work and prepared him for death
there was no position in which he was not in pain  there was not a minute in which he was unconscious of it  not a limb  not a part of his body that did not ache and cause him agony
even the memories  the impressions  the thoughts of this body awakened in him now the same aversion as the body itself
anna karenina 1093 of 1759 the sight of other people  their remarks  his own reminiscences  everything was for him a source of agony
those about him felt this  and instinctively did not allow themselves to move freely  to talk  to express their wishes before him all his life was merged in the one feeling of suffering and desire to be rid of it
there was evidently coming over him that revulsion that would make him look upon death as the goal of his desires  as happiness
hitherto each individual desire  aroused by suffering or privation  such as hunger  fatigue  thirst  had been satisfied by some bodily function giving pleasure
but now no physical craving or suffering received relief  and the effort to relieve them only caused fresh suffering
and so all desires were merged in one— the desire to be rid of all his sufferings and their source  the body
but he had no words to express this desire of deliverance  and so he did not speak of it  and from habit asked for the satisfaction of desires which could not now be satisfied
‘turn me over on the other side ’ he would say  and immediately after he would ask to be turned back again as before
‘give me some broth
take away the broth
talk of something  why are you silent ’ and directly they began to talk ho would close his eyes  and would show weariness  indifference  and loathing
anna karenina 1094 of 1759 on the tenth day from their arrival at the town  kitty was unwell
she suffered from headache and sickness  and she could not get up all the morning
the doctor opined that the indisposition arose from fatigue and excitement  and prescribed rest
after dinner  however  kitty got up and went as usual with her work to the sick man
he looked at her sternly when she came in  and smiled contemptuously when she said she had been unwell
that day he was continually blowing his nose  and groaning piteously
‘how do you feel ’ she asked him
‘worse ’ he articulated with difficulty
‘in pain ’ ‘in pain  where ’ ‘everywhere ’ ‘it will be over today  you will see ’ said marya nikolaevna
though it was said in a whisper  the sick man  whose hearing levin had noticed was very keen  must have heard
levin said hush to her  and looked round at the sick man
nikolay had heard  but these words produced no effect on him
his eyes had still the same intense  reproachful look
‘why do you think so ’ levin asked her  when she had followed him into the corridor
anna karenina 1095 of 1759 ‘he has begun picking at himself ’ said marya nikolaevna ‘how do you mean ’ ‘like this ’ she said  tugging at the folds of her woolen skirt
levin noticed  indeed  that all that day the patient pulled at himself  as it were  trying to snatch something away marya nikolaevna’s prediction came true
towards night the sick man was not able to lift his hands  and could only gaze before him with the same intensely concentrated expression in his eyes
even when his brother or kitty bent over him  so that he could see them  he looked just the same
kitty sent for the priest to read the prayer for the dying
while the priest was reading it  the dying man did not show any sign of life  his eyes were closed
levin  kitty  and marya nikolaevna stood at the bedside
the priest had not quite finished reading the prayer when the dying man stretched  sighed  and opened his eyes the priest  on finishing the prayer  put the cross to the cold forehead  then slowly returned it to the stand  and after standing for two minutes more in silence  he touched the huge  bloodless hand that was turning cold
anna karenina 1096 of 1759 ‘he is gone ’ said the priest  and would have moved away  but suddenly there was a faint stir in the mustaches of the dead man that seemed glued together  and quite distinctly in the hush they heard from the bottom of the chest the sharply defined sounds  ‘not quite   soon ’ and a minute later the face brightened  a smile came out under the mustaches  and the women who had gathered round began carefully laying out the corpse
the sight of his brother  and the nearness of death  revived in levin that sense of horror in face of the insoluble enigma  together with the nearness and inevitability of death  that had come upon him that autumn evening when his brother had come to him
this feeling was now even stronger than before  even less than before did he feel capable of apprehending the meaning of death  and its inevitability rose up before him more terrible than ever
but now  thanks to his wife’s presence  that feeling did not reduce him to despair
in spite of death  he felt the need of life and love
he felt that love saved him from despair  and that this love  under the menace of despair  had become still stronger and purer
the one mystery of death  still unsolved  had scarcely anna karenina 1097 of 1759 passed before his eyes  when another mystery had arisen  as insoluble  urging him to love and to life
the doctor confirmed his suppositions in regard to kitty
her indisposition was a symptom that she was with child
anna karenina 1098 of 1759 from the moment when alexey alexandrovitch understood from his interviews with betsy and with stepan arkadyevitch that all that was expected of him was to leave his wife in peace  without burdening her with his presence  and that his wife herself desired this  he felt so distraught that he could come to no decision of himself  he did not know himself what he wanted now  and putting himself in the hands of those who were so pleased to interest themselves in his affairs  he met everything with unqualified assent it was only when anna had left his house  and the english governess sent to ask him whether she should dine with him or separately  that for the first time he clearly comprehended his position  and was appalled by it
most difficult of all in this position was the fact that he could not in any way connect and reconcile his past with what was now
it was not the past when he had lived happily with his wife that troubled him
the transition from that past to a knowledge of his wife’s unfaithfulness he had lived through miserably already  that state was painful  but he could understand it
if his wife had then  on declaring to him her unfaithfulness  left him  anna karenina 1099 of 1759 he would have been wounded  unhappy  but he would not have been in the hopeless position—incomprehensible to himself—in which he felt himself now he could not now reconcile his immediate past  his tenderness  his love for his sick wife  and for the other man’s child with what was now the case  that is with the fact that  as it were  in return for all this he now found himself alone  put to shame  a laughing stock  needed by no one  and despised by everyone for the first two days after his wife’s departure alexey alexandrovitch received applicants for assistance and his chief secretary  drove to the committee  and went down to dinner in the dining room as usual
without giving himself a reason for what he was doing  he strained every nerve of his being for those two days  simply to preserve an appearance of composure  and even of indifference answering inquiries about the disposition of anna arkadyevna’s rooms and belongings  he had exercised immense self control to appear like a man in whose eyes what had occurred was not unforeseen nor out of the ordinary course of events  and he attained his aim  no one could have detected in him signs of despair but on the second day after her departure  when korney gave him a bill from a fashionable draper’s shop  which anna had anna karenina 1100 of 1759 forgotten to pay  and announced that the clerk from the shop was waiting  alexey alexandrovitch told him to show the clerk up
‘excuse me  your excellency  for venturing to trouble you
but if you direct us to apply to her excellency  would you graciously oblige us with her address ’ alexey alexandrovitch pondered  as it seemed to the clerk  and all at once  turning round  he sat down at the table
letting his head sink into his hands  he sat for a long while in that position  several times attempted to speak and stopped short
korney  perceiving his master’s emotion  asked the clerk to call another time
left alone  alexey alexandrovitch recognized that he had not the strength to keep up the line of firmness and composure any longer
he gave orders for the carriage that was awaiting him to be taken back  and for no one to be admitted  and he did not go down to dinner
he felt that he could not endure the weight of universal contempt and exasperation  which he had distinctly seen in the face of the clerk and of korney  and of everyone  without exception  whom he had met during those two days
he felt that he could not turn aside from himself the hatred of men  because that hatred did not come from his being bad (in that case he could have tried anna karenina 1101 of 1759 to be better)  but from his being shamefully and repulsively unhappy he knew that for this  for the very fact that his heart was torn with grief  they would be merciless to him
he felt that men would crush him as dogs strangle a torn dog yelping with pain
he knew that his sole means of security against people was to hide his wounds from them  and instinctively he tried to do this for two days  but now he felt incapable of keeping up the unequal struggle
his despair was even intensified by the consciousness that he was utterly alone in his sorrow
in all petersburg there was not a human being to whom he could express what he was feeling  who would feel for him  not as a high official  not as a member of society  but simply as a suffering man  indeed he had not such a one in the whole world
alexey alexandrovitch grew up an orphan
there were two brothers
they did not remember their father  and their mother died when alexey alexandrovitch was ten years old
the property was a small one
their uncle  karenin  a government official of high standing  at one time a favorite of the late tsar  had brought them up
on completing his high school and university courses with medals  alexey alexandrovitch had  with his uncle’s anna karenina 1102 of 1759 aid  immediately started in a prominent position in the service  and from that time forward he had devoted himself exclusively to political ambition in the high school and the university  and afterwards in the service  alexey alexandrovitch had never formed a close friendship with anyone
his brother had been the person nearest to his heart  but he had a post in the ministry of foreign affairs  and was always abroad  where he had died shortly after alexey alexandrovitch’s marriage
while he was governor of a province  anna’s aunt  a wealthy provincial lady  had thrown him—middle aged as he was  though young for a governor—with her niece  and had succeeded in putting him in such a position that he had either to declare himself or to leave the town alexey alexandrovitch was not long in hesitation
there were at the time as many reasons for the step as against it  and there was no overbalancing consideration to outweigh his invariable rule of abstaining when in doubt
but anna’s aunt had through a common acquaintance insinuated that he had already compromised the girl  and that he was in honor bound to make her an offer
he made the offer  and concentrated on his betrothed and his wife all the feeling of which he was capable
anna karenina 1103 of 1759 the attachment he felt to anna precluded in his heart every need of intimate relations with others
and now among all his acquaintances he had not one friend
he had plenty of so called connections  but no friendships
alexey alexandrovitch had plenty of people whom he could invite to dinner  to whose sympathy he could appeal in any public affair he was concerned about  whose interest he could reckon upon for anyone he wished to help  with whom he could candidly discuss other people’s business and affairs of state
but his relations with these people were confined to one clearly defined channel  and had a certain routine from which it was impossible to depart
there was one man  a comrade of his at the university  with whom he had made friends later  and with whom he could have spoken of a personal sorrow  but this friend had a post in the department of education in a remote part of russia of the people in petersburg the most intimate and most possible were his chief secretary and his doctor
mihail vassilievitch sludin  the chief secretary  was a straightforward  intelligent  good hearted  and conscientious man  and alexey alexandrovitch was aware of his personal goodwill
but their five years of official anna karenina 1104 of 1759 work together seemed to have put a barrier between them that cut off warmer relations
after signing the papers brought him  alexey alexandrovitch had sat for a long while in silence  glancing at mihail vassilievitch  and several times he attempted to speak  but could not
he had already prepared the phrase  ‘you have heard of my trouble ’ but he ended by saying  as usual  ‘so you’ll get this ready for me ’ and with that dismissed him
the other person was the doctor  who had also a kindly feeling for him  but there had long existed a taciturn understanding between them that both were weighed down by work  and always in a hurry
of his women friends  foremost amongst them countess lidia ivanovna  alexey alexandrovitch never thought
all women  simply as women  were terrible and distasteful to him
anna karenina 1105 of 1759 alexey alexandrovitch had forgotten the countess lidia ivanovna  but she had not forgotten him
at the bitterest moment of his lonely despair she came to him  and without waiting to be announced  walked straight into his study
she found him as he was sitting with his head in both hands
‘j’ai force la consigne ’ she said  walking in with rapid steps and breathing hard with excitement and rapid exercise
‘i have heard all  alexey alexandrovitch  dear friend ’ she went on  warmly squeezing his hand in both of hers and gazing with her fine pensive eyes into his
alexey alexandrovitch  frowning  got up  and disengaging his hand  moved her a chair
‘won’t you sit down  countess  i’m seeing no one because i’m unwell  countess ’ he said  and his lips twitched
‘dear friend ’ repeated countess lidia ivanovna  never taking her eyes off his  and suddenly her eyebrows rose at the inner corners  describing a triangle on her forehead  her ugly yellow face became still uglier  but alexey alexandrovitch felt that she was sorry for him and was anna karenina 1106 of 1759 preparing to cry
and he too was softened  he snatched her plump hand and proceeded to kiss it
‘dear friend ’ she said in a voice breaking with emotion
‘you ought not to give way to grief
your sorrow is a great one  but you ought to find consolation ’ ‘i am crushed  i am annihilated  i am no longer a man ’ said alexey alexandrovitch  letting go her hand  but still gazing into her brimming eyes
‘my position is so awful because i can find nowhere  i cannot find within me strength to support me ’ ‘you will find support  seek it—not in me  though i beseech you to believe in my friendship ’ she said  with a sigh
‘our support is love  that love that he has vouchsafed us
his burden is light ’ she said  with the look of ecstasy alexey alexandrovitch knew so well
‘he will be your support and your succor ’ although there was in these words a flavor of that sentimental emotion at her own lofty feelings  and that new mystical fervor which had lately gained ground in petersburg  and which seemed to alexey alexandrovitch disproportionate  still it was pleasant to him to hear this now
‘i am weak
i am crushed
i foresaw nothing  and now i understand nothing ’ anna karenina 1107 of 1759 ‘dear friend ’ repeated lidia ivanovna
‘it’s not the loss of what i have not now  it’s not that ’ pursued alexey alexandrovitch
‘i do not grieve for that
but i cannot help feeling humiliated before other people for the position i am placed in
it is wrong  but i can’t help it  i can’t help it ’ ‘not you it was performed that noble act of forgiveness  at which i was moved to ecstasy  and everyone else too  but he  working within your heart ’ said countess lidia ivanovna  raising her eyes rapturously  ‘and so you cannot be ashamed of your act ’ alexey alexandrovitch knitted his brows  and crooking his hands  he cracked his fingers
‘one must know all the facts ’ he said in his thin voice
‘a man’s strength has its limits  countess  and i have reached my limits
the whole day i have had to be making arrangements  arrangements about household matters arising’ (he emphasized the word arising) ‘from my new  solitary position
the servants  the governess  the accounts   
these pinpricks have stabbed me to the heart  and i have not the strength to bear it
at dinner  
yesterday  i was almost getting up from the dinner table
i could not bear the way my son looked at me
he did not ask me the meaning of it all  but he wanted to ask  and i anna karenina 1108 of 1759 could not bear the look in his eyes
he was afraid to look at me  but that is not all    ’ alexey alexandrovitch would have referred to the bill that had been brought him  but his voice shook  and he stopped
that bill on blue paper  for a hat and ribbons  he could not recall without a rush of self pity
‘i understand  dear friend ’ said lidia ivanovna
‘i understand it all
succor and comfort you will find not in me  though i have come only to aid you if i can
if i could take from off you all these petty  humiliating cares   i understand that a woman’s word  a woman’s superintendence is needed
you will intrust it to me ’ silently and gratefully alexey alexandrovitch pressed her hand
‘together we will take care of seryozha
practical affairs are not my strong point
but i will set to work
i will be your housekeeper
don’t thank me
i do it not from myself  ’ ‘i cannot help thanking you ’ ‘but  dear friend  do not give way to the feeling of which you spoke—being ashamed of what is the christian’s highest glory  *he who humbles himself shall be exalted* and you cannot thank me
you must thank him  and pray to him for succor
in him alone we find anna karenina 1109 of 1759 peace  consolation  salvation  and love ’ she said  and turning her eyes heavenwards  she began praying  as alexey alexandrovitch gathered from her silence
alexey alexandrovitch listened to her now  and those expressions which had seemed to him  if not distasteful  at least exaggerated  now seemed to him natural and consolatory
alexey alexandrovitch had disliked this new enthusiastic fervor
he was a believer  who was interested in religion primarily in its political aspect  and the new doctrine which ventured upon several new interpretations  just because it paved the way to discussion and analysis  was in principle disagreeable to him
he had hitherto taken up a cold and even antagonistic attitude to this new doctrine  and with countess lidia ivanovna  who had been carried away by it  he had never argued  but by silence had assiduously parried her attempts to provoke him into argument
now for the first time he heard her words with pleasure  and did not inwardly oppose them
‘i am very  very grateful to you  both for your deeds and for your words ’ he said  when she had finished praying
countess lidia ivanovna once more pressed both her friend’s hands
anna karenina 1110 of 1759 ‘now i will enter upon my duties ’ she said with a smile after a pause  as she wiped away the traces of tears
‘i am going to seryozha
only in the last extremity shall i apply to you ’ and she got up and went out
countess lidia ivanovna went into seryozha’s part of the house  and dropping tears on the scared child’s cheeks  she told him that his father was a saint and his mother was dead
countess lidia ivanovna kept her promise
she did actually take upon herself the care of the organization and management of alexey alexandrovitch’s household
but she had not overstated the case when saying that practical affairs were not her strong point
all her arrangements had to be modified because they could not be carried out  and they were modified by korney  alexey alexandrovitch’s valet  who  though no one was aware of the fact  now managed karenin’s household  and quietly and discreetly reported to his master while he was dressing all it was necessary for him to know
but lidia ivanovna’s help was none the less real  she gave alexey alexandrovitch moral support in the consciousness of her love and respect for him  and still more  as it was soothing to her to believe  in that she almost turned him to christianity—that is  from an indifferent and apathetic believer she turned him into anna karenina 1111 of 1759 an ardent and steadfast adherent of the new interpretation of christian doctrine  which had been gaining ground of late in petersburg
it was easy for alexey alexandrovitch to believe in this teaching
alexey alexandrovitch  like lidia ivanovna indeed  and others who shared their views  was completely devoid of vividness of imagination  that spiritual faculty in virtue of which the conceptions evoked by the imagination become so vivid that they must needs be in harmony with other conceptions  and with actual fact
he saw nothing impossible and inconceivable in the idea that death  though existing for unbelievers  did not exist for him  and that  as he was possessed of the most perfect faith  of the measure of which he was himself the judge  therefore there was no sin in his soul  and he was experiencing complete salvation here on earth it is true that the erroneousness and shallowness of this conception of his faith was dimly perceptible to alexey alexandrovitch  and he knew that when  without the slightest idea that his forgiveness was the action of a higher power  he had surrendered directly to the feeling of forgiveness  he had felt more happiness than now when he was thinking every instant that christ was in his heart  and that in signing official papers he was doing his will
but for alexey alexandrovitch it was a necessity to think in anna karenina 1112 of 1759 that way  it was such a necessity for him in his humiliation to have some elevated standpoint  however imaginary  from which  looked down upon by all  he could look down on others  that he clung  as to his one salvation  to his delusion of salvation
anna karenina 1113 of 1759 the countess lidia ivanovna had  as a very young and sentimental girl  been married to a wealthy man of high rank  an extremely good natured  jovial  and extremely dissipated rake
two months after marriage her husband abandoned her  and her impassioned protestations of affection he met with a sarcasm and even hostility that people knowing the count’s good heart  and seeing no defects in the sentimental lidia  were at loss to explain
though they were divorced and lived apart  yet whenever the husband met the wife  he invariably behaved to her with the same malignant irony  the cause of which was incomprehensible
countess lidia ivanovna had long given up being in love with her husband  but from that time she had never given up being in love with someone
she was in love with several people at once  both men and women  she had been in love with almost everyone who had been particularly distinguished in any way
she was in love with all the new princes and princesses who married into the imperial family  she had been in love with a high dignitary of the church  a vicar  and a parish priest  she had been in anna karenina 1114 of 1759 love with a journalist  three slavophiles  with komissarov  with a minister  a doctor  an english missionary and karenin
all these passions constantly waning or growing more ardent  did not prevent her from keeping up the most extended and complicated relations with the court and fashionable society
but from the time that after karenin’s trouble she took him under her special protection  from the time that she set to work in karenin’s household looking after his welfare  she felt that all her other attachments were not the real thing  and that she was now genuinely in love  and with no one but karenin
the feeling she now experienced for him seemed to her stronger than any of her former feelings
analyzing her feeling  and comparing it with former passions  she distinctly perceived that she would not have been in love with komissarov if he had not saved the life of the tsar  that she would not have been in love with ristitchkudzhitsky if there had been no slavonic question  but that she loved karenin for himself  for his lofty  uncomprehended soul  for the sweet—to her—high notes of his voice  for his drawling intonation  his weary eyes  his character  and his soft white hands with their swollen veins she was not simply overjoyed at meeting him  but she sought in his face signs of the impression she was anna karenina 1115 of 1759 making on him
she tried to please him  not by her words only  but in her whole person
for his sake it was that she now lavished more care on her dress than before
she caught herself in reveries on what might have been  if she had not been married and he had been free
she blushed with emotion when he came into the room  she could not repress a smile of rapture when he said anything amiable to her
for several days now countess lidia ivanovna had been in a state of intense excitement
she had learned that anna and vronsky were in petersburg
alexey alexandrovitch must be saved from seeing her  he must be saved even from the torturing knowledge that that awful woman was in the same town with him  and that he might meet her any minute
lidia ivanovna made inquiries through her friends as to what those infamous people  as she called anna and vronsky  intended doing  and she endeavored so to guide every movement of her friend during those days that he could not come across them
the young adjutant  an acquaintance of vronsky  through whom she obtained her information  and who hoped through countess lidia ivanovna to obtain a concession  told her that they had finished their business and were going away next day
anna karenina 1116 of 1759 lidia ivanovna had already begun to calm down  when the next morning a note was brought her  the handwriting of which she recognized with horror
it was the handwriting of anna karenina
the envelope was of paper as thick as bark  on the oblong yellow paper there was a huge monogram  and the letter smelt of agreeable scent
‘who brought it ’ ‘a commissionaire from the hotel ’ it was some time before countess lidia ivanovna could sit down to read the letter
her excitement brought on an attack of asthma  to which she was subject
when she had recovered her composure  she read the following letter in french  ‘madame la comtesse  ‘the christian feelings with which your heart is filled give me the  i feel  unpardonable boldness to write to you
i am miserable at being separated from my son
i entreat permission to see him once before my departure
forgive me for recalling myself to your memory
i apply to you and not to alexey alexandrovitch  simply because i do not wish to cause that generous man to suffer in remembering me
knowing your friendship for him  i know you will understand me
could you send seryozha to me  or should i come to the house at some fixed hour  anna karenina 1117 of 1759 or will you let me know when and where i could see him away from home  i do not anticipate a refusal  knowing the magnanimity of him with whom it rests
you cannot conceive the craving i have to see him  and so cannot conceive the gratitude your help will arouse in me
anna ’ everything in this letter exasperated countess lidia ivanovna  its contents and the allusion to magnanimity  and especially its free and easy—as she considered—tone
‘say that there is no answer ’ said countess lidia ivanovna  and immediately opening her blotting book  she wrote to alexey alexandrovitch that she hoped to see him at one o’clock at the levee
‘i must talk with you of a grave and painful subject
there we will arrange where to meet
best of all at my house  where i will order tea as you like it
urgent
he lays the cross  but he gives the strength to bear it ’ she added  so as to give him some slight preparation
countess lidia ivanovna usually wrote some two or three letters a day to alexey alexandrovitch
she enjoyed that form of communication  which gave opportunity for a refinement and air of mystery not afforded by their personal interviews
anna karenina 1118 of 1759 the levee was drawing to a close
people met as they were going away  and gossiped of the latest news  of the newly bestowed honors and the changes in the positions of the higher functionaries
‘if only countess marya borissovna were minister of war  and princess vatkovskaya were commander inchief ’ said a gray headed  little old man in a goldembroidered uniform  addressing a tall  handsome maid of honor who had questioned him about the new appointments
‘and me among the adjutants ’ said the maid of honor  smiling
‘you have an appointment already
you’re over the ecclesiastical department
and your assistant’s karenin ’ ‘good day  prince ’ said the little old man to a man who came up to him
‘what were you saying of karenin ’ said the prince
‘he and putyatov have received the alexander nevsky ’ ‘i thought he had it already ’ anna karenina 1119 of 1759 ‘no
just look at him ’ said the little old man  pointing with his embroidered hat to karenin in a court uniform with the new red ribbon across his shoulders  standing in the doorway of the hall with an influential member of the imperial council
‘pleased and happy as a brass farthing ’ he added  stopping to shake hands with a handsome gentleman of the bedchamber of colossal proportions
‘no  he’s looking older ’ said the gentleman of the bedchamber
‘from overwork
he’s always drawing up projects nowadays
he won’t let a poor devil go nowadays till he’s explained it all to him under heads ’ ‘looking older  did you say  il fait des passions
i believe countess lidia ivanovna’s jealous now of his wife ’ ‘oh  come now  please don’t say any harm of countess lidia ivanovna ’ ‘why  is there any harm in her being in love with karenin ’ ‘but is it true madame karenina’s here ’ ‘well  not here in the palace  but in petersburg
i met her yesterday with alexey vronsky  bras dessous  bras dessous  in the morsky ’ ‘c’est un homme qui n’a pas   ’ the gentleman of the bedchamber was beginning  but he stopped to make anna karenina 1120 of 1759 room  bowing  for a member of the imperial family to pass
thus people talked incessantly of alexey alexandrovitch  finding fault with him and laughing at him  while he  blocking up the way of the member of the imperial council he had captured  was explaining to him point by point his new financial project  never interrupting his discourse for an instant for fear he should escape
almost at the same time that his wife left alexey alexandrovitch there had come to him that bitterest moment in the life of an official—the moment when his upward career comes to a full stop
this full stop had arrived and everyone perceived it  but alexey alexandrovitch himself was not yet aware that his career was over whether it was due to his feud with stremov  or his misfortune with his wife  or simply that alexey alexandrovitch had reached his destined limits  it had become evident to everyone in the course of that year that his career was at an end
he still filled a position of consequence  he sat on many commissions and committees  but he was a man whose day was over  and from whom nothing was expected
whatever he said  whatever he proposed  was heard as though it were anna karenina 1121 of 1759 something long familiar  and the very thing that was not needed
but alexey alexandrovitch was not aware of this  and  on the contrary  being cut off from direct participation in governmental activity  he saw more clearly than ever the errors and defects in the action of others  and thought it his duty to point out means for their correction
shortly after his separation from his wife  he began writing his first note on the new judicial procedure  the first of the endless series of notes he was destined to write in the future
alexey alexandrovitch did not merely fail to observe his hopeless position in the official world  he was not merely free from anxiety on this head  he was positively more satisfied than ever with his own activity
‘he that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the lord  how he may please the lord  but he that is married careth for the things that are of the world  how he may please his wife ’ says the apostle paul  and alexey alexandrovitch  who was now guided in every action by scripture  often recalled this text
it seemed to him that ever since he had been left without a wife  he had in these very projects of reform been serving the lord more zealously than before
anna karenina 1122 of 1759 the unmistakable impatience of the member of the council trying to get away from him did not trouble alexey alexandrovitch  he gave up his exposition only when the member of the council  seizing his chance when one of the imperial family was passing  slipped away from him
left alone  alexey alexandrovitch looked down  collecting his thoughts  then looked casually about him and walked towards the door  where he hoped to meet countess lidia ivanovna
‘and how strong they all are  how sound physically ’ thought alexey alexandrovitch  looking at the powerfully built gentleman of the bedchamber with his well combed  perfumed whiskers  and at the red neck of the prince  pinched by his tight uniform
he had to pass them on his way
‘truly is it said that all the world is evil ’ he thought  with another sidelong glance at the calves of the gentleman of the bedchamber
moving forward deliberately  alexey alexandrovitch bowed with his customary air of weariness and dignity to the gentleman who had been talking about him  and looking towards the door  his eyes sought countess lidia ivanovna
anna karenina 1123 of 1759 ‘ah  alexey alexandrovitch ’ said the little old man  with a malicious light in his eyes  at the moment when karenin was on a level with them  and was nodding with a frigid gesture  ‘i haven’t congratulated you yet ’ said the old man  pointing to his newly received ribbon
‘thank you ’ answered alexey alexandrovitch
‘what an exquisite day to day ’ he added  laying emphasis in his peculiar way on the word exquisite
that they laughed at him he was well aware  but he did not expect anything but hostility from them  he was used to that by now
catching sight of the yellow shoulders of lidia ivanovna jutting out above her corset  and her fine pensive eyes bidding him to her  alexey alexandrovitch smiled  revealing untarnished white teeth  and went towards her
lidia ivanovna’s dress had cost her great pains  as indeed all her dresses had done of late
her aim in dress was now quite the reverse of that she had pursued thirty years before
then her desire had been to adorn herself with something  and the more adorned the better
now  on the contrary  she was perforce decked out in a way so inconsistent with her age and her figure  that her one anxiety was to contrive that the contrast between these anna karenina 1124 of 1759 adornments and her own exterior should not be too appalling
and as far as alexey alexandrovitch was concerned she succeeded  and was in his eyes attractive
for him she was the one island not only of goodwill to him  but of love in the midst of the sea of hostility and jeering that surrounded him
passing through rows of ironical eyes  he was drawn as naturally to her loving glance as a plant to the sun
‘i congratulate you ’ she said to him  her eyes on his ribbon
suppressing a smile of pleasure  he shrugged his shoulders  closing his eyes  as though to say that that could not be a source of joy to him
countess lidia ivanovna was very well aware that it was one of his chief sources of satisfaction  though he never admitted it
‘how is our angel ’ said countess lidia ivanovna  meaning seryozha
‘i can’t say i was quite pleased with him ’ said alexey alexandrovitch  raising his eyebrows and opening his eyes
‘and sitnikov is not satisfied with him ’ (sitnikov was the tutor to whom seryozha’s secular education had been intrusted ) ‘as i have mentioned to you  there’s a sort of coldness in him towards the most important questions which ought to touch the heart of every man and every anna karenina 1125 of 1759 child    ’ alexey alexandrovitch began expounding his views on the sole question that interested him besides the service—the education of his son
when alexey alexandrovitch with lidia ivanovna’s help had been brought back anew to life and activity  he felt it his duty to undertake the education of the son left on his hands
having never before taken any interest in educational questions  alexey alexandrovitch devoted some time to the theoretical study of the subject
after reading several books on anthropology  education  and didactics  alexey alexandrovitch drew up a plan of education  and engaging the best tutor in petersburg to superintend it  he set to work  and the subject continually absorbed him
‘yes  but the heart
i see in him his father’s heart  and with such a heart a child cannot go far wrong ’ said lidia ivanovna with enthusiasm
‘yes  perhaps   
as for me  i do my duty
it’s all i can do ’ ‘you’re coming to me ’ said countess lidia ivanovna  after a pause  ‘we have to speak of a subject painful for you
i would give anything to have spared you certain memories  but others are not of the same mind
i have received a letter from her
she is here in petersburg ’ anna karenina 1126 of 1759 alexey alexandrovitch shuddered at the allusion to his wife  but immediately his face assumed the deathlike rigidity which expressed utter helplessness in the matter
‘i was expecting it ’ he said
countess lidia ivanovna looked at him ecstatically  and tears of rapture at the greatness of his soul came into her eyes
anna karenina 1127 of 1759 when alexey alexandrovitch came into the countess lidia ivanovna’s snug little boudoir  decorated with old china and hung with portraits  the lady herself had not yet made her appearance
she was changing her dress
a cloth was laid on a round table  and on it stood a china tea service and a silver spirit lamp and tea kettle
alexey alexandrovitch looked idly about at the endless familiar portraits which adorned the room  and sitting down to the table  he opened a new testament lying upon it
the rustle of the countess’s silk skirt drew his attention off
‘well now  we can sit quietly ’ said countess lidia ivanovna  slipping hurriedly with an agitated smile between the table and the sofa  ‘and talk over our tea ’ after some words of preparation  countess lidia ivanovna  breathing hard and flushing crimson  gave into alexey alexandrovitch’s hands the letter she had received after reading the letter  he sat a long while in silence
‘i don’t think i have the right to refuse her ’ he said  timidly lifting his eyes
anna karenina 1128 of 1759 ‘dear friend  you never see evil in anyone ’ ‘on the contrary  i see that all is evil
but whether it is just  ’ his face showed irresolution  and a seeking for counsel  support  and guidance in a matter he did not understand
‘no ’ countess lidia ivanovna interrupted him  ‘there are limits to everything
i can understand immorality ’ she said  not quite truthfully  since she never could understand that which leads women to immorality  ‘but i don’t understand cruelty  to whom  to you  how can she stay in the town where you are  no  the longer one lives the more one learns
and i’m learning to understand your loftiness and her baseness ’ ‘who is to throw a stone ’ said alexey alexandrovitch  unmistakably pleased with the part he had to play
‘i have forgiven all  and so i cannot deprive her of what is exacted by love in her—by her love for her son   ’ ‘but is that love  my friend  is it sincere  admitting that you have forgiven—that you forgive—have we the right to work on the feelings of that angel  he looks on her as dead
he prays for her  and beseeches god to have mercy on her sins
and it is better so
but now what will he think ’ anna karenina 1129 of 1759 ‘i had not thought of that ’ said alexey alexandrovitch  evidently agreeing
countess lidia ivanovna hid her face in her hands and was silent
she was praying
‘if you ask my advice ’ she said  having finished her prayer and uncovered her face  ‘i do not advise you to do this
do you suppose i don’t see how you are suffering  how this has torn open your wounds  but supposing that  as always  you don’t think of yourself  what can it lead to —to fresh suffering for you  to torture for the child
if there were a trace of humanity left in her  she ought not to wish for it herself
no  i have no hesitation in saying i advise not  and if you will intrust it to me  i will write to her ’ and alexey alexandrovitch consented  and countess lidia ivanovna sent the following letter in french  ‘dear madame  ‘to be reminded of you might have results for your son in leading to questions on his part which could not be answered without implanting in the child’s soul a spirit of censure towards what should be for him sacred  and therefore i beg you to interpret your husband’s refusal in the spirit of christian love
i pray to almighty god to have mercy on you
anna karenina 1130 of 1759 countess lidia ’ this letter attained the secret object which countess lidia ivanovna had concealed from herself
it wounded anna to the quick
for his part  alexey alexandrovitch  on returning home from lidia ivanovna’s  could not all that day concentrate himself on his usual pursuits  and find that spiritual peace of one saved and believing which he had felt of late the thought of his wife  who had so greatly sinned against him  and towards whom he had been so saintly  as countess lidia ivanovna had so justly told him  ought not to have troubled him  but he was not easy  he could not understand the book he was reading  he could not drive away harassing recollections of his relations with her  of the mistake which  as it now seemed  he had made in regard to her
the memory of how he had received her confession of infidelity on their way home from the races (especially that he had insisted only on the observance of external decorum  and had not sent a challenge) tortured him like a remorse
he was tortured too by the thought of the letter he had written her  and most of all  his forgiveness  which nobody wanted  and his care of the anna karenina 1131 of 1759 other man’s child made his heart burn with shame and remorse
and just the same feeling of shame and regret he felt now  as he reviewed all his past with her  recalling the awkward words in which  after long wavering  he had made her an offer
‘but how have i been to blame ’ he said to himself and this question always excited another question in him—whether they felt differently  did their loving and marrying differently  these vronskys and oblonskys   these gentlemen of the bedchamber  with their fine calves
and there passed before his mind a whole series of these mettlesome  vigorous  self  confident men  who always and everywhere drew his inquisitive attention in spite of himself he tried to dispel these thoughts  he tried to persuade himself that he was not living for this transient life  but for the life of eternity  and that there was peace and love in his heart but the fact that he had in this transient  trivial life made  as it seemed to him  a few trivial mistakes tortured him as though the eternal salvation in which he believed had no existence
but this temptation did not last long  and soon there was reestablished once more in alexey alexandrovitch’s soul the peace and the elevation by anna karenina 1132 of 1759 virtue of which he could forget what he did not want to remember
anna karenina 1133 of 1759 ‘well  kapitonitch ’ said seryozha  coming back rosy and good  humored from his walk the day before his birthday  and giving his overcoat to the tall old hall porter  who smiled down at the little person from the height of his long figure
‘well  has the bandaged clerk been here today  did papa see him ’ ‘he saw him
the minute the chief secretary came out  i announced him ’ said the hall porter with a goodhumored wink
‘here  i’ll take it off ’ ‘seryozha ’ said the tutor  stopping in the doorway leading to the inner rooms ‘take it off yourself ’ but seryozha  though he heard his tutor’s feeble voice  did not pay attention to it
he stood keeping hold of the hall porter’s belt  and gazing into his face
‘well  and did papa do what he wanted for him ’ the hall porter nodded his head affirmatively
the clerk with his face tied up  who had already been seven times to ask some favor of alexey alexandrovitch  interested both seryozha and the hall porter
seryozha had come upon him in the hall  and had heard him plaintively anna karenina 1134 of 1759 beg the hall porter to announce him  saying that he and his children had death staring them in the face
since then seryozha  having met him a second time in the hall  took great interest in him
‘well  was he very glad ’ he asked
‘glad  i should think so  almost dancing as he walked away ’ ‘and has anything been left ’ asked seryozha  after a pause
‘come  sir ’ said the hall porter  then with a shake of his head he whispered  ‘something from the countess ’ seryozha understood at once that what the hall porter was speaking of was a present from countess lidia ivanovna for his birthday
‘what do you say  where ’ ‘korney took it to your papa
a fine plaything it must be too ’ ‘how big  like this ’ ‘rather small  but a fine thing ’ ‘a book ’ ‘no  a thing
run along  run along  vassily lukitch is calling you ’ said the porter  hearing the tutor’s steps approaching  and carefully taking away from his belt the anna karenina 1135 of 1759 little hand in the glove half pulled off  he signed with his head towards the tutor
‘vassily lukitch  in a tiny minute ’ answered seryozha with that gay and loving smile which always won over the conscientious vassily lukitch
seryozha was too happy  everything was too delightful for him to be able to help sharing with his friend the porter the family good fortune of which he had heard during his walk in the public gardens from lidia ivanovna’s niece
this piece of good news seemed to him particularly important from its coming at the same time with the gladness of the bandaged clerk and his own gladness at toys having come for him
it seemed to seryozha that this was a day on which everyone ought to be glad and happy
‘you know papa’s received the alexander nevsky today ’ ‘to be sure i do  people have been already to congratulate him ’ ‘and is he glad ’ ‘glad at the tsar’s gracious favor  i should think so  it’s a proof he’s deserved it ’ said the porter severely and seriously
anna karenina 1136 of 1759 seryozha fell to dreaming  gazing up at the face of the porter  which he had thoroughly studied in every detail  especially the chin that hung down between the gray whiskers  never seen by anyone but seryozha  who saw him only from below
‘well  and has your daughter been to see you lately ’ the porter’s daughter was a ballet dancer
‘when is she to come on week days  they’ve their lessons to learn too
and you’ve your lesson  sir  run along ’ on coming into the room  seryozha  instead of sitting down to his lessons  told his tutor of his supposition that what had been brought him must be a machine
‘what do you think ’ he inquired
but vassily lukitch was thinking of nothing but the necessity of learning the grammar lesson for the teacher  who was coming at two
‘no  do just tell me  vassily lukitch ’ he asked suddenly  when he was seated at their work table with the book in his hands  ‘what is greater than the alexander nevsky  you know papa’s received the alexander nevsky ’ vassily lukitch replied that the vladimir was greater than the alexander nevsky
anna karenina 1137 of 1759 ‘and higher still ’ ‘well  highest of all is the andrey pervozvanny ’ ‘and higher than the andrey ’ ‘i don’t know ’ ‘what  you don’t know ’ and seryozha  leaning on his elbows  sank into deep meditation
his meditations were of the most complex and diverse character
he imagined his father’s having suddenly been presented with both the vladimir and the andrey today  and in consequence being much better tempered at his lesson  and dreamed how  when he was grown up  he would himself receive all the orders  and what they might invent higher than the andrey directly any higher order were invented  he would win it
they would make a higher one still  and he would immediately win that too
the time passed in such meditations  and when the teacher came  the lesson about the adverbs of place and time and manner of action was not ready  and the teacher was not only displeased  but hurt
this touched seryozha
he felt he was not to blame for not having learned the lesson  however much he tried  he was utterly unable to do that
as long as the teacher was explaining to him  he believed him and seemed to comprehend  but as soon as he was left alone  he was positively unable to recollect and anna karenina 1138 of 1759 to understand that the short and familiar word ‘suddenly’ is an adverb of manner of action
still he was sorry that he had disappointed the teacher
he chose a moment when the teacher was looking in silence at the book
‘mihail ivanitch  when is your birthday ’ he asked all  of a sudden
‘you’d much better be thinking about your work
birthdays are of no importance to a rational being
it’s a day like any other on which one has to do one’s work ’ seryozha looked intently at the teacher  at his scanty beard  at his spectacles  which had slipped down below the ridge on his nose  and fell into so deep a reverie that he heard nothing of what the teacher was explaining to him
he knew that the teacher did not think what he said  he felt it from the tone in which it was said
‘but why have they all agreed to speak just in the same manner always the dreariest and most useless stuff  why does he keep me off  why doesn’t he love me ’ he asked himself mournfully  and could not think of an answer anna karenina 1139 of 1759 after the lesson with the grammar teacher came his father’s lesson
while waiting for his father  seryozha sat at the table playing with a penknife  and fell to dreaming
among seryozha’s favorite occupations was searching for his mother during his walks
he did not believe in death generally  and in her death in particular  in spite of what lidia ivanovna had told him and his father had confirmed  and it was just because of that  and after he had been told she was dead  that he had begun looking for her when out for a walk
every woman of full  graceful figure with dark hair was his mother
at the sight of such a woman such a feeling of tenderness was stirred within him that his breath failed him  and tears came into his eyes
and he was on the tiptoe of expectation that she would come up to him  would lift her veil
all her face would be visible  she would smile  she would hug him  he would sniff her fragrance  feel the softness of her arms  and cry with happiness  just as he had one evening lain on her lap while she tickled him  and he laughed and bit her white  ringcovered fingers later  when he accidentally learned from his old nurse that his mother was not dead  and his father anna karenina 1140 of 1759 and lidia ivanovna had explained to him that she was dead to him because she was wicked (which he could not possibly believe  because he loved her)  he went on seeking her and expecting her in the same way
that day in the public gardens there had been a lady in a lilac veil  whom he had watched with a throbbing heart  believing it to be she as she came towards them along the path
the lady had not come up to them  but had disappeared somewhere
that day  more intensely than ever  seryozha felt a rush of love for her  and now  waiting for his father  he forgot everything  and cut all round the edge of the table with his penknife  staring straight before him with sparkling eyes and dreaming of her
‘here is your papa ’ said vassily lukitch  rousing him
seryozha jumped up and went up to his father  and kissing his hand  looked at him intently  trying to discover signs of his joy at receiving the alexander nevsky
‘did you have a nice walk ’ said alexey alexandrovitch  sitting down in his easy chair  pulling the volume of the old testament to him and opening it
although alexey alexandrovitch had more than once told seryozha that every christian ought to know scripture history thoroughly  he often referred to the bible himself during the lesson  and seryozha observed this anna karenina 1141 of 1759 ‘yes  it was very nice indeed  papa ’ said seryozha  sitting sideways on his chair and rocking it  which was forbidden
‘i saw nadinka’ (nadinka was a niece of lidia ivanovna’s who was being brought up in her house)
‘she told me you’d been given a new star
are you glad  papa ’ ‘first of all  don’t rock your chair  please ’ said alexey alexandrovitch
‘and secondly  it’s not the reward that’s precious  but the work itself
and i could have wished you understood that
if you now are going to work  to study in order to win a reward  then the work will seem hard to you  but when you work’ (alexey alexandrovitch  as he spoke  thought of how he had been sustained by a sense of duty through the wearisome labor of the morning  consisting of signing one hundred and eighty papers)  ‘loving your work  you will find your reward in it ’ seryozha’s eyes  that had been shining with gaiety and tenderness  grew dull and dropped before his father’s gaze
this was the same long familiar tone his father always took with him  and seryozha had learned by now to fall in with it
his father always talked to him—so seryozha felt—as though he were addressing some boy of his own imagination  one of those boys that exist in books  utterly anna karenina 1142 of 1759 unlike himself and seryozha always tried with his father to act being the story book boy
‘you understand that  i hope ’ said his father
‘yes  papa ’ answered seryozha  acting the part of the imaginary boy
the lesson consisted of learning by heart several verses out of the gospel and the repetition of the beginning of the old testament
the verses from the gospel seryozha knew fairly well  but at the moment when he was saying them he became so absorbed in watching the sharply protruding  bony knobbiness of his father’s forehead  that he lost the thread  and he transposed the end of one verse and the beginning of another
so it was evident to alexey alexandrovitch that he did not understand what he was saying  and that irritated him
he frowned  and began explaining what seryozha had heard many times before and never could remember  because he understood it too well  just as that ‘suddenly’ is an adverb of manner of action
seryozha looked with scared eyes at his father  and could think of nothing but whether his father would make him repeat what he had said  as he sometimes did
and this thought so alarmed seryozha that he now understood nothing
but his father did not make him repeat it  and passed on to the lesson anna karenina 1143 of 1759 out of the old testament
seryozha recounted the events themselves well enough  but when he had to answer questions as to what certain events prefigured  he knew nothing  though he had already been punished over this lesson the passage at which he was utterly unable to say anything  and began fidgeting and cutting the table and swinging his chair  was where he had to repeat the patriarchs before the flood
he did not know one of them  except enoch  who had been taken up alive to heaven
last time he had remembered their names  but now he had forgotten them utterly  chiefly because enoch was the personage he liked best in the whole of the old testament  and enoch’s translation to heaven was connected in his mind with a whole long train of thought  in which he became absorbed now while he gazed with fascinated eyes at his father’s watch chain and a halfunbuttoned button on his waistcoat
in death  of which they talked to him so often  seryozha disbelieved entirely
he did not believe that those he loved could die  above all that he himself would die that was to him something utterly inconceivable and impossible
but he had been told that all men die  he had asked people  indeed  whom he trusted  and they too  had confirmed it  his old nurse  too  said the same  though anna karenina 1144 of 1759 reluctantly
but enoch had not died  and so it followed that everyone did not die
‘and why cannot anyone else so serve god and be taken alive to heaven ’ thought seryozha
bad people  that is those seryozha did not like  they might die  but the good might all be like enoch
‘well  what are the names of the patriarchs ’ ‘enoch  enos—‘ ‘but you have said that already
this is bad  seryozha  very bad
if you don’t try to learn what is more necessary than anything for a christian ’ said his father  getting up  ‘whatever can interest you  i am displeased with you  and piotr ignatitch’ (this was the most important of his teachers) ‘is displeased with you   
i shall have to punish you ’ his father and his teacher were both displeased with seryozha  and he certainly did learn his lessons very badly
but still it could not be said he was a stupid boy
on the contrary  he was far cleverer than the boys his teacher held up as examples to seryozha
in his father’s opinion  he did not want to learn what he was taught
in reality he could not learn that
he could not  because the claims of his own soul were more binding on him than those claims his father and his teacher made upon him those claims were in opposition  and he was in direct conflict with his anna karenina 1145 of 1759 education he was nine years old  he was a child  but he knew his own soul  it was precious to him  he guarded it as the eyelid guards the eye  and without the key of love he let no one into his soul
his teachers complained that he would not learn  while his soul was brimming over with thirst for knowledge
and he learned from kapitonitch  from his nurse  from nadinka  from vassily lukitch  but not from his teachers
the spring his father and his teachers reckoned upon to turn their mill wheels had long dried up at the source  but its waters did their work in another channel
his father punished seryozha by not letting him go to see nadinka  lidia ivanovna’s niece  but this punishment turned out happily for seryozha
vassily lukitch was in a good humor  and showed him how to make windmills
the whole evening passed over this work and in dreaming how to make a windmill on which he could turn himself—clutching at the sails or tying himself on and whirling round of his mother seryozha did not think all the evening  but when he had gone to bed  he suddenly remembered her  and prayed in his own words that his mother tomorrow for his birthday might leave off hiding herself and come to him
anna karenina 1146 of 1759 ‘vassily lukitch  do you know what i prayed for tonight extra besides the regular things ’ ‘that you might learn your lessons better ’ ‘no ’ ‘toys ’ ‘no
you’ll never guess
a splendid thing  but it’s a secret  when it comes to pass i’ll tell you
can’t you guess ’ ‘no  i can’t guess
you tell me ’ said vassily lukitch with a smile  which was rare with him
‘come  lie down  i’m putting out the candle ’ ‘without the candle i can see better what i see and what i prayed for
there  i was almost telling the secret ’ said seryozha  laughing gaily
when the candle was taken away  seryozha heard and felt his mother
she stood over him  and with loving eyes caressed him
but then came windmills  a knife  everything began to be mixed up  and he fell asleep
anna karenina 1147 of 1759 on arriving in petersburg  vronsky and anna stayed at one of the best hotels  vronsky apart in a lower story  anna above with her child  its nurse  and her maid  in a large suite of four rooms on the day of his arrival vronsky went to his brother’s
there he found his mother  who had come from moscow on business
his mother and sister in law greeted him as usual  they asked him about his stay abroad  and talked of their common acquaintances  but did not let drop a single word in allusion to his connection with anna
his brother came the next morning to see vronsky  and of his own accord asked him about her  and alexey vronsky told him directly that he looked upon his connection with madame karenina as marriage  that he hoped to arrange a divorce  and then to marry her  and until then he considered her as much a wife as any other wife  and he begged him to tell their mother and his wife so
‘if the world disapproves  i don’t care ’ said vronsky  ‘but if my relations want to be on terms of relationship with me  they will have to be on the same terms with my wife ’ anna karenina 1148 of 1759 the elder brother  who had always a respect for his younger brother’s judgment  could not well tell whether he was right or not till the world had decided the question  for his part he had nothing against it  and with alexey he went up to see anna before his brother  as before everyone  vronsky addressed anna with a certain formality  treating her as he might a very intimate friend  but it was understood that his brother knew their real relations  and they talked about anna’s going to vronsky’s estate
in spite of all his social experience vronsky was  in consequence of the new position in which he was placed  laboring under a strange misapprehension
one would have thought he must have understood that society was closed for him and anna  but now some vague ideas had sprung up in his brain that this was only the case in oldfashioned days  and that now with the rapidity of modern progress (he had unconsciously become by now a partisan of every sort of progress) the views of society had changed  and that the question whether they would be received in society was not a foregone conclusion
‘of course ’ he thought  ‘she would not be received at court  but intimate friends can and must look at it in the proper light ’ one may sit for several hours at a stretch with one’s legs crossed anna karenina 1149 of 1759 in the same position  if one knows that there’s nothing to prevent one’s changing one’s position  but if a man knows that he must remain sitting so with crossed legs  then cramps come on  the legs begin to twitch and to strain towards the spot to which one would like to draw them this was what vronsky was experiencing in regard to the world
though at the bottom of his heart he knew that the world was shut on them  he put it to the test whether the world had not changed by now and would not receive them
but he very quickly perceived that though the world was open for him personally  it was closed for anna
just as in the game of cat and mouse  the hands raised for him were dropped to bar the way for anna
one of the first ladies of petersburg society whom vronsky saw was his cousin betsy
‘at last ’ she greeted him joyfully
‘and anna  how glad i am  where are you stopping  i can fancy after your delightful travels you must find our poor petersburg horrid
i can fancy your honeymoon in rome
how about the divorce  is that all over ’ vronsky noticed that betsy’s enthusiasm waned when she learned that no divorce had as yet taken place
anna karenina 1150 of 1759 ‘people will throw stones at me  i know ’ she said  ‘but i shall come and see anna  yes  i shall certainly come
you won’t be here long  i suppose ’ and she did certainly come to see anna the same day  but her tone was not at all the same as in former days
she unmistakably prided herself on her courage  and wished anna to appreciate the fidelity of her friendship
she only stayed ten minutes  talking of society gossip  and on leaving she said  ‘you’ve never told me when the divorce is to be  supposing i’m ready to fling my cap over the mill  other starchy people will give you the cold shoulder until you’re married
and that’s so simple nowadays
ca se fait
so you’re going on friday  sorry we shan’t see each other again ’ from betsy’s tone vronsky might have grasped what he had to expect from the world  but he made another effort in his own family
his mother he did not reckon upon
he knew that his mother  who had been so enthusiastic over anna at their first acquaintance  would have no mercy on her now for having ruined her son’s career
but he had more hope of varya  his brother’s wife
he fancied she would not throw stones  and would go anna karenina 1151 of 1759 simply arid directly to see anna  and would receive her in her own house
the day after his arrival vronsky went to her  and finding her alone  expressed his wishes directly
‘you know  alexey ’ she said after hearing him  ‘how fond i am of you  and how ready i am to do anything for you  but i have not spoken  because i knew i could be of no use to you and to anna arkadyevna ’ she said  articulating the name ‘anna arkadyevna’ with particular care
‘don’t suppose  please  that i judge her
never  perhaps in her place i should have done the same
i don’t and can’t enter into that ’ she said  glancing timidly at his gloomy face
‘but one must call things by their names
you want me to go and see her  to ask her here  and to rehabilitate her in society  but do understand that i cannot do so
i have daughters growing up  and i must live in the world for my husband’s sake
well  i’m ready to come and see anna arkadyevna  she will understand that i can’t ask her here  or i should have to do so in such a way that she would not meet people who look at things differently  that would offend her
i can’t raise her  ’ ‘oh  i don’t regard her as fallen more than hundreds of women you do receive ’ vronsky interrupted her still anna karenina 1152 of 1759 more gloomily  and he got up in silence  understanding that his sister in law’s decision was not to be shaken
‘alexey  don’t be angry with me
please understand that i’m not to blame ’ began varya  looking at him with a timid smile
‘i’m not angry with you ’ he said still as gloomily  ‘but i’m sorry in two ways
i’m sorry  too  that this means breaking up our friendship—if not breaking up  at least weakening it
you will understand that for me  too  it cannot be otherwise ’ and with that he left her
vronsky knew that further efforts were useless  and that he had to spend these few days in petersburg as though in a strange town  avoiding every sort of relation with his own old circle in order not to be exposed to the annoyances and humiliations which were so intolerable to him
one of the most unpleasant features of his position in petersburg was that alexey alexandrovitch and his name seemed to meet him everywhere
he could not begin to talk of anything without the conversation turning on alexey alexandrovitch  he could not go anywhere without risk of meeting him
so at least it seemed to vronsky  just as it seems to a man with a sore finger that anna karenina 1153 of 1759 he is continually  as though on purpose  grazing his sore finger on everything their stay in petersburg was the more painful to vronsky that he perceived all the time a sort of new mood that he could not understand in anna
at one time she would seem in love with him  and then she would become cold  irritable  and impenetrable
she was worrying over something  and keeping something back from him  and did not seem to notice the humiliations which poisoned his existence  and for her  with her delicate intuition  must have been still more unbearable
anna karenina 1154 of 1759 one of anna’s objects in coming back to russia had been to see her son
from the day she left italy the thought of it had never ceased to agitate her
and as she got nearer to petersburg  the delight and importance of this meeting grew ever greater in her imagination
she did not even put to herself the question how to arrange it
it seemed to her natural and simple to see her son when she should be in the same town with him
but on her arrival in petersburg she was suddenly made distinctly aware of her present position in society  and she grasped the fact that to arrange this meeting was no easy matter
she had now been two days in petersburg
the thought of her son never left her for a single instant  but she had not yet seen him
to go straight to the house  where she might meet alexey alexandrovitch  that she felt she had no right to do
she might be refused admittance and insulted
to write and so enter into relations with her husband—that it made her miserable to think of doing  she could only be at peace when she did not think of her husband
to get a glimpse of her son out walking  finding out where and when he went out  was not enough for anna karenina 1155 of 1759 her  she had so looked forward to this meeting  she had so much she must say to him  she so longed to embrace him  to kiss him
seryozha’s old nurse might be a help to her and show her what to do
but the nurse was not now living in alexey alexandrovitch’s house
in this uncertainty  and in efforts to find the nurse  two days had slipped by
hearing of the close intimacy between alexey alexandrovitch and countess lidia ivanovna  anna decided on the third day to write to her a letter  which cost her great pains  and in which she intentionally said that permission to see her son must depend on her husband’s generosity
she knew that if the letter were shown to her husband  he would keep up his character of magnanimity  and would not refuse her request
the commissionaire who took the letter had brought her back the most cruel and unexpected answer  that there was no answer
she had never felt so humiliated as at the moment when  sending for the commissionaire  she heard from him the exact account of how he had waited  and how afterwards he had been told there was no answer
anna felt humiliated  insulted  but she saw that from her point of view countess lidia ivanovna was right
her suffering was the more poignant that she had to bear it in anna karenina 1156 of 1759 solitude
she could not and would not share it with vronsky
she knew that to him  although he was the primary cause of her distress  the question of her seeing her son would seem a matter of very little consequence
she knew that he would never be capable of understanding all the depth of her suffering  that for his cool tone at any allusion to it she would begin to hate him
and she dreaded that more than anything in the world  and so she hid from him everything that related to her son
spending the whole day at home she considered ways of seeing her son  and had reached a decision to write to her husband
she was just composing this letter when she was handed the letter from lidia ivanovna
the countess’s silence had subdued and depressed her  but the letter  all that she read between the lines in it  so exasperated her  this malice was so revolting beside her passionate  legitimate tenderness for her son  that she turned against other people and left off blaming herself
‘this coldness—this pretense of feeling ’ she said to herself
‘they must needs insult me and torture the child  and i am to submit to it  not on any consideration  she is worse than i am
i don’t lie  anyway ’ and she decided on the spot that next day  seryozha’s birthday  she would go straight to her husband’s house  bribe or deceive the anna karenina 1157 of 1759 servants  but at any cost see her son and overturn the hideous deception with which they were encompassing the unhappy child
she went to a toy shop  bought toys and thought over a plan of action
she would go early in the morning at eight o’clock  when alexey alexandrovitch would be certain not to be up
she would have money in her hand to give the hall porter and the footman  so that they should let her in  and not raising her veil  she would say that she had come from seryozha’s godfather to congratulate him  and that she had been charged to leave the toys at his bedside
she had prepared everything but the words she should say to her son
often as she had dreamed of it  she could never think of anything
the next day  at eight o’clock in the morning  anna got out of a hired sledge and rang at the front entrance of her former home
‘run and see what’s wanted
some lady ’ said kapitonitch  who  not yet dressed  in his overcoat and galoshes  had peeped out of the window and seen a lady in a veil standing close up to the door
his assistant  a lad anna did not know  had no sooner opened the door to her than she came in  and pulling a three rouble note out of her muff put it hurriedly into his hand
anna karenina 1158 of 1759 ‘seryozha—sergey alexeitch ’ she said  and was going on
scrutinizing the note  the porter’s assistant stopped her at the second glass door
‘whom do you want ’ he asked
she did not hear his words and made no answer
noticing the embarrassment of the unknown lady  kapitonitch went out to her  opened the second door for her  and asked her what she was pleased to want
‘from prince skorodumov for sergey alexeitch ’ she said
‘his honor’s not up yet ’ said the porter  looking at her attentively
anna had not anticipated that the absolutely unchanged hall of the house where she had lived for nine years would so greatly affect her
memories sweet and painful rose one after another in her heart  and for a moment she forgot what she was here for
‘would you kindly wait ’ said kapitonitch  taking off her fur cloak
as he took off the cloak  kapitonitch glanced at her face  recognized her  and made her a low bow in silence
‘please walk in  your excellency ’ he said to her
she tried to say something  but her voice refused to utter any sound  with a guilty and imploring glance at the anna karenina 1159 of 1759 old man she went with light  swift steps up the stairs
bent double  and his galoshes catching in the steps  kapitonitch ran after her  trying to overtake her
‘the tutor’s there  maybe he’s not dressed
i’ll let him know ’ anna still mounted the familiar staircase  not understanding what the old man was saying
‘this way  to the left  if you please
excuse its not being tidy
his honor’s in the old parlor now ’ the hall porter said  panting
‘excuse me  wait a little  your excellency  i’ll just see ’ he said  and overtaking her  he opened the high door and disappeared behind it
anna stood still waiting
‘he’s only just awake ’ said the hall porter  coming out
and at the very instant the porter said this  anna caught the sound of a childish yawn
from the sound of this yawn alone she knew her son and seemed to see him living before her eyes
‘let me in  go away ’ she said  and went in through the high doorway
on the right of the door stood a bed  and sitting up in the bed was the boy
his little body bent forward with his nightshirt unbuttoned  he was stretching and still yawning the instant his lips came together they curved into a blissfully sleepy smile  and with that smile he slowly and deliciously rolled back again
anna karenina 1160 of 1759 ‘seryozha ’ she whispered  going noiselessly up to him
when she was parted from him  and all this latter time when she had been feeling a fresh rush of love for him  she had pictured him as he was at four years old  when she had loved him most of all
now he was not even the same as when she had left him  he was still further from the fouryear old baby  more grown and thinner
how thin his face was  how short his hair was  what long hands  how he had changed since she left him  but it was he with his head  his lips  his soft neck and broad little shoulders
‘seryozha ’ she repeated just in the child’s ear
he raised himself again on his elbow  turned his tangled head from side to side as though looking for something  and opened his eyes slowly and inquiringly he looked for several seconds at his mother standing motionless before him  then all at once he smiled a blissful smile  and shutting his eyes  rolled not backwards but towards her into her arms ‘seryozha  my darling boy ’ she said  breathing hard and putting her arms round his plump little body ‘mother ’ he said  wriggling about in her arms so as to touch her hands with different parts of him smiling sleepily still with closed eyes  he flung fat little arms round her shoulders  rolled towards her  with the anna karenina 1161 of 1759 delicious sleepy warmth and fragrance that is only found in children  and began rubbing his face against her neck and shoulders ‘i know ’ he said  opening his eyes  ‘it’s my birthday today
i knew you’d come
i’ll get up directly ’ and saying that he dropped asleep
anna looked at him hungrily  she saw how he had grown and changed in her absence
she knew  and did not know  the bare legs so long now  that were thrust out below the quilt  those short cropped curls on his neck in which she had so often kissed him
she touched all this and could say nothing  tears choked her
‘what are you crying for  mother ’ he said  waking completely up
‘mother  what are you crying for ’ he cried in a tearful voice
‘i won’t cry   i’m crying for joy
it’s so long since i’ve seen you
i won’t  i won’t ’ she said  gulping down her tears and turning away
‘come  it’s time for you to dress now ’ she added  after a pause  and  never letting go his hands  she sat down by his bedside on the chair  where his clothes were put ready for him
‘how do you dress without me  how   ’ she tried to begin talking simply and cheerfully  but she could not  and again she turned away
anna karenina 1162 of 1759 ‘i don’t have a cold bath  papa didn’t order it
and you’ve not seen vassily lukitch  he’ll come in soon
why  you’re sitting on my clothes ’ and seryozha went off into a peal of laughter
she looked at him and smiled
‘mother  darling  sweet one ’ he shouted  flinging himself on her again and hugging her it was as though only now  on seeing her smile  he fully grasped what had happened
‘i don’t want that on ’ he said  taking off her hat
and as it were  seeing her afresh without her hat  he fell to kissing her again
‘but what did you think about me  you didn’t think i was dead ’ ‘i never believed it ’ ‘you didn’t believe it  my sweet ’ ‘i knew  i knew ’ he repeated his favorite phrase  and snatching the hand that was stroking his hair  he pressed the open palm to his mouth and kissed it
anna karenina 1163 of 1759 meanwhile vassily lukitch had not at first understood who this lady was  and had learned from their conversation that it was no other person than the mother who had left her husband  and whom he had not seen  as he had entered the house after her departure
he was in doubt whether to go in or not  or whether to communicate with alexey alexandrovitch
reflecting finally that his duty was to get seryozha up at the hour fixed  and that it was therefore not his business to consider who was there  the mother or anyone else  but simply to do his duty  he finished dressing  went to the door and opened it
but the embraces of the mother and child  the sound of their voices  and what they were saying  made him change his mind
he shook his head  and with a sigh he closed the door
‘i’ll wait another ten minutes ’ he said to himself  clearing his throat and wiping away tears among the servants of the household there was intense excitement all this time
all had heard that their mistress had come  and that kapitonitch had let her in  and that anna karenina 1164 of 1759 she was even now in the nursery  and that their master always went in person to the nursery at nine o’clock  and every one fully comprehended that it was impossible for the husband and wife to meet  and that they must prevent it
korney  the valet  going down to the hall porter’s room  asked who had let her in  and how it was he had done so  and ascertaining that kapitonitch had admitted her and shown her up  he gave the old man a talking to
the hall porter was doggedly silent  but when korney told him he ought to be sent away  kapitonitch darted up to him  and waving his hands in korney’s face  began  ‘oh yes  to be sure you’d not have let her in  after ten years’ service  and never a word but of kindness  and there you’d up and say  ‘be off  go along  get away with you ’ oh yes  you’re a shrewd one at politics  i dare say  you don’t need to be taught how to swindle the master  and to filch fur coats ’ ‘soldier ’ said korney contemptuously  and he turned to the nurse who was coming in
‘here  what do you think  marya efimovna  he let her in without a word to anyone ’ korney said addressing her
‘alexey alexandrovitch will be down immediately—and go into the nursery ’ anna karenina 1165 of 1759 ‘a pretty business  a pretty business ’ said the nurse
‘you  korney vassilievitch  you’d best keep him some way or other  the master  while i’ll run and get her away somehow
a pretty business ’ when the nurse went into the nursery  seryozha was telling his mother how he and nadinka had had a fall in sledging downhill  and had turned over three times
she was listening to the sound of his voice  watching his face and the play of expression on it  touching his hand  but she did not follow what he was saying
she must go  she must leave him —this was the only thing she was thinking and feeling
she heard the steps of vassily lukitch coming up to the door and coughing  she heard  too  the steps of the nurse as she came near  but she sat like one turned to stone  incapable of beginning to speak or to get up
‘mistress  darling ’ began the nurse  going up to anna and kissing her hands and shoulders
‘god has brought joy indeed to our boy on his birthday
you aren’t changed one bit ’ ‘oh  nurse dear  i didn’t know you were in the house ’ said anna  rousing herself for a moment
‘i’m not living here  i’m living with my daughter
i came for the birthday  anna arkadyevna  darling ’ anna karenina 1166 of 1759 the nurse suddenly burst into tears  and began kissing her hand again
seryozha  with radiant eyes and smiles  holding his mother by one hand and his nurse by the other  pattered on the rug with his fat little bare feet
the tenderness shown by his beloved nurse to his mother threw him into an ecstasy
‘mother  she often comes to see me  and when she comes   ’ he was beginning  but he stopped  noticing that the nurse was saying something in a whisper to his mother  and that in his mother’s face there was a look of dread and something like shame  which was so strangely unbecoming to her
she went up to him
‘my sweet ’ she said
she could not say good bye  but the expression on her face said it  and he understood
‘darling  darling kootik ’ she used the name by which she had called him when he was little  ‘you won’t forget me  you   ’ but she could not say more
how often afterwards she thought of words she might have said
but now she did not know how to say it  and could say nothing
but seryozha knew all she wanted to say to him
he understood that she was unhappy and anna karenina 1167 of 1759 loved him
he understood even what the nurse had whispered
he had caught the words ‘always at nine o’clock ’ and he knew that this was said of his father  and that his father and mother could not meet
that he understood  but one thing he could not understand—why there should be a look of dread and shame in her face   
she was not in fault  but she was afraid of him and ashamed of something
he would have liked to put a question that would have set at rest this doubt  but he did not dare  he saw that she was miserable  and he felt for her
silently he pressed close to her and whispered  ‘don’t go yet
he won’t come just yet ’ the mother held him away from her to see what he was thinking  what to say to him  and in his frightened face she read not only that he was speaking of his father  but  as it were  asking her what he ought to think about his father
‘seryozha  my darling ’ she said  ‘love him  he’s better and kinder than i am  and i have done him wrong
when you grow up you will judge ’ ‘there’s no one better than you    ’ he cried in despair through his tears  and  clutching her by the shoulders  he began squeezing her with all his force to him  his arms trembling with the strain anna karenina 1168 of 1759 ‘my sweet  my little one ’ said anna  and she cried as weakly and childishly as he
at that moment the door opened
vassily lukitch came in
at the other door there was the sound of steps  and the nurse in a scared whisper said  ‘he’s coming ’ and gave anna her hat
seryozha sank onto the bed and sobbed  hiding his face in his hands
anna removed his hands  once more kissed his wet face  and with rapid steps went to the door
alexey alexandrovitch walked in  meeting her
seeing her  he stopped short and bowed his head
although she had just said he was better and kinder than she  in the rapid glance she flung at him  taking in his whole figure in all its details  feelings of repulsion and hatred for him and jealousy over her son took possession of her
with a swift gesture she put down her veil  and  quickening her pace  almost ran out of the room
she had not time to undo  and so carried back with her  the parcel of toys she had chosen the day before in a toy shop with such love and sorrow
anna karenina 1169 of 1759 as intensely as anna had longed to see her son  and long as she had been thinking of it and preparing herself for it  she had not in the least expected that seeing him would affect her so deeply
on getting back to her lonely rooms in the hotel she could not for a long while understand why she was there ‘yes  it’s all over  and i am again alone ’ she said to herself  and without taking off her hat she sat down in a low chair by the hearth
fixing her eyes on a bronze clock standing on a table between the windows  she tried to think
the french maid brought from abroad came in to suggest she should dress
she gazed at her wonderingly and said  ‘presently ’ a footman offered her coffee
‘later on ’ she said
the italian nurse  after having taken the baby out in her best  came in with her  and brought her to anna
the plump  well fed little baby  on seeing her mother  as she always did  held out her fat little hands  and with a smile on her toothless mouth  began  like a fish with a float  bobbing her fingers up and down the starched folds of her embroidered skirt  making them rustle
it was impossible anna karenina 1170 of 1759 not to smile  not to kiss the baby  impossible not to hold out a finger for her to clutch  crowing and prancing all over  impossible not to offer her a lip which she sucked into her little mouth by way of a kiss
and all this anna did  and took her in her arms and made her dance  and kissed her fresh little cheek and bare little elbows  but at the sight of this child it was plainer than ever to her that the feeling she had for her could not be called love in comparison with what she felt for seryozha everything in this baby was charming  but for some reason all this did not go deep to her heart
on her first child  though the child of an unloved father  had been concentrated all the love that had never found satisfaction
her baby girl had been born in the most painful circumstances and had not had a hundredth part of the care and thought which had been concentrated on her first child besides  in the little girl everything was still in the future  while seryozha was by now almost a personality  and a personality dearly loved
in him there was a conflict of thought and feeling  he understood her  he loved her  he judged her  she thought  recalling his words and his eyes
and she was forever—not physically only but spiritually—divided from him  and it was impossible to set this right
anna karenina 1171 of 1759 she gave the baby back to the nurse  let her go  and opened the locket in which there was seryozha’s portrait when he was almost of the same age as the girl
she got up  and  taking off her hat  took up from a little table an album in which there were photographs of her son at different ages
she wanted to compare them  and began taking them out of the album
she took them all out except one  the latest and best photograph
in it he was in a white smock  sitting astride a chair  with frowning eyes and smiling lips
it was his best  most characteristic expression
with her little supple hands  her white  delicate fingers  that moved with a peculiar intensity today  she pulled at a corner of the photograph  but the photograph had caught somewhere  and she could not get it out
there was no paper knife on the table  and so  pulling out the photograph that was next to her son’s (it was a photograph of vronsky taken at rome in a round hat and with long hair)  she used it to push out her son’s photograph
‘oh  here is he ’ she said  glancing at the portrait of vronsky  and she suddenly recalled that he was the cause of her present misery
she had not once thought of him all the morning
but now  coming all at once upon that manly  noble face  so familiar and so dear to her  she felt a sudden rush of love for him
anna karenina 1172 of 1759 ‘but where is he  how is it he leaves me alone in my misery ’ she thought all at once with a feeling of reproach  forgetting she had herself kept from him everything concerning her son
she sent to ask him to come to her immediately  with a throbbing heart she awaited him  rehearsing to herself the words in which she would tell him all  and the expressions of love with which he would console her
the messenger returned with the answer that he had a visitor with him  but that he would come immediately  and that he asked whether she would let him bring with him prince yashvin  who had just arrived in petersburg
‘he’s not coming alone  and since dinner yesterday he has not seen me ’ she thought  ‘he’s not coming so that i could tell him everything  but coming with yashvin ’ and all at once a strange idea came to her  what if he had ceased to love her  and going over the events of the last few days  it seemed to her that she saw in everything a confirmation of this terrible idea
the fact that he had not dined at home yesterday  and the fact that he had insisted on their taking separate sets of rooms in petersburg  and that even now he was not coming to her alone  as though he were trying to avoid meeting her face to face anna karenina 1173 of 1759 ‘but he ought to tell me so
i must know that it is so
if i knew it  then i know what i should do ’ she said to herself  utterly unable to picture to herself the position she would be in if she were convinced of his not caring for her
she thought he had ceased to love her  she felt close upon despair  and consequently she felt exceptionally alert
she rang for her maid and went to her dressing room
as she dressed  she took more care over her appearance than she had done all those days  as though he might  if he had grown cold to her  fall in love with her again because she had dressed and arranged her hair in the way most becoming to her
she heard the bell ring before she was ready
when she went into the drawing room it was not he  but yashvin  who met her eyes
vronsky was looking through the photographs of her son  which she had forgotten on the table  and he made no haste to look round at her
‘we have met already ’ she said  putting her little hand into the huge hand of yashvin  whose bashfulness was so queerly out of keeping with his immense frame and coarse face
‘we met last year at the races
give them to me ’ she said  with a rapid movement snatching from vronsky the photographs of her son  and glancing significantly at him with flashing eyes
‘were the races good this year  instead anna karenina 1174 of 1759 of them i saw the races in the corso in rome
but you don’t care for life abroad ’ she said with a cordial smile
‘i know you and all your tastes  though i have seen so little of you ’ ‘i’m awfully sorry for that  for my tastes are mostly bad ’ said yashvin  gnawing at his left mustache
having talked a little while  and noticing that vronsky glanced at the clock  yashvin asked her whether she would be staying much longer in petersburg  and unbending his huge figure reached after his cap
‘not long  i think ’ she said hesitatingly  glancing at vronsky
‘so then we shan’t meet again ’ ‘come and dine with me ’ said anna resolutely  angry it seemed with herself for her embarrassment  but flushing as she always did when she defined her position before a fresh person
‘the dinner here is not good  but at least you will see him
there is no one of his old friends in the regiment alexey cares for as he does for you ’ ‘delighted ’ said yashvin with a smile  from which vronsky could see that he liked anna very much
yashvin said good bye and went away  vronsky stayed behind
‘are you going too ’ she said to him
anna karenina 1175 of 1759 ‘i’m late already ’ he answered
‘run along  i’ll catch you up in a moment ’ he called to yashvin
she took him by the hand  and without taking her eyes off him  gazed at him while she ransacked her mind for the words to say that would keep him
‘wait a minute  there’s something i want to say to you ’ and taking his broad hand she pressed it on her neck
‘oh  was it right my asking him to dinner ’ ‘you did quite right ’ he said with a serene smile that showed his even teeth  and he kissed her hand
‘alexey  you have not changed to me ’ she said  pressing his hand in both of hers
‘alexey  i am miserable here
when are we going away ’ ‘soon  soon
you wouldn’t believe how disagreeable our way of living here is to me too ’ he said  and he drew away his hand
‘well  go  go ’ she said in a tone of offense  and she walked quickly away from him
anna karenina 1176 of 1759 when vronsky returned home  anna was not yet home
soon after he had left  some lady  so they told him  had come to see her  and she had gone out with her
that she had gone out without leaving word where she was going  that she had not yet come back  and that all the morning she had been going about somewhere without a word to him—all this  together with the strange look of excitement in her face in the morning  and the recollection of the hostile tone with which she had before yashvin almost snatched her son’s photographs out of his hands  made him serious
he decided he absolutely must speak openly with her
and he waited for her in her drawing room
but anna did not return alone  but brought with her her old unmarried aunt  princess oblonskaya
this was the lady who had come in the morning  and with whom anna had gone out shopping
anna appeared not to notice vronsky’s worried and inquiring expression  and began a lively account of her morning’s shopping
he saw that there was something working within her  in her flashing eyes  when they rested for a moment on him  there was an intense concentration  anna karenina 1177 of 1759 and in her words and movements there was that nervous rapidity and grace which  during the early period of their intimacy  had so fascinated him  but which now so disturbed and alarmed him
the dinner was laid for four
all were gathered together and about to go into the little dining room when tushkevitch made his appearance with a message from princess betsy
princess betsy begged her to excuse her not having come to say good bye  she had been indisposed  but begged anna to come to her between halfpast six and nine o’clock
vronsky glanced at anna at the precise limit of time  so suggestive of steps having been taken that she should meet no one  but anna appeared not to notice it
‘very sorry that i can’t come just between half past six and nine ’ she said with a faint smile
‘the princess will be very sorry ’ ‘and so am i ’ ‘you’re going  no doubt  to hear patti ’ said tushkevitch
‘patti  you suggest the idea to me
i would go if it were possible to get a box ’ ‘i can get one ’ tushkevitch offered his services
anna karenina 1178 of 1759 ‘i should be very  very grateful to you ’ said anna
‘but won’t you dine with us ’ vronsky gave a hardly perceptible shrug
he was at a complete loss to understand what anna was about
what had she brought the old princess oblonskaya home for  what had she made tushkevitch stay to dinner for  and  most amazing of all  why was she sending him for a box  could she possibly think in her position of going to patti’s benefit  where all the circle of her acquaintances would be  he looked at her with serious eyes  but she responded with that defiant  half mirthful  half desperate look  the meaning of which he could not comprehend
at dinner anna was in aggressively high spirits—she almost flirted both with tushkevitch and with yashvin
when they got up from dinner and tushkevitch had gone to get a box at the opera  yashvin went to smoke  and vronsky went down with him to his own rooms after sitting there for some time he ran upstairs
anna was already dressed in a low necked gown of light silk and velvet that she had had made in paris  and with costly white lace on her head  framing her face  and particularly becoming  showing up her dazzling beauty
‘are you really going to the theater ’ he said  trying not to look at her
anna karenina 1179 of 1759 ‘why do you ask with such alarm ’ she said  wounded again at his not looking at her
‘why shouldn’t i go ’ she appeared not to understand the motive of his words
‘oh  of course  there’s no reason whatever ’ he said  frowning
‘that’s just what i say ’ she said  willfully refusing to see the irony of his tone  and quietly turning back her long  perfumed glove
‘anna  for god’s sake  what is the matter with you ’ he said  appealing to her exactly as once her husband had done
‘i don’t understand what you are asking ’ ‘you know that it’s out of the question to go ’ ‘why so  i’m not going alone
princess varvara has gone to dress  she is going with me ’ he shrugged his shoulders with an air of perplexity and despair
‘but do you mean to say you don’t know    ’ he began
‘but i don’t care to know ’ she almost shrieked
‘i don’t care to
do i regret what i have done  no  no  no  if it were all to do again from the beginning  it would be the same
for us  for you and for me  there is only one thing that matters  whether we love each other
other people anna karenina 1180 of 1759 we need not consider
why are we living here apart and not seeing each other  why can’t i go  i love you  and i don’t care for anything ’ she said in russian  glancing at him with a peculiar gleam in her eyes that he could not understand
‘if you have not changed to me  why don’t you look at me ’ he looked at her
he saw all the beauty of her face and full dress  always so becoming to her
but now her beauty and elegance were just what irritated him
‘my feeling cannot change  you know  but i beg you  i entreat you ’ he said again in french  with a note of tender supplication in his voice  but with coldness in his eyes
she did not hear his words  but she saw the coldness of his eyes  and answered with irritation  ‘and i beg you to explain why i should not go ’ ‘because it might cause you   ’ he hesitated
‘i don’t understand
yashvin n’est pas compromettant  and princess varvara is no worse than others
oh  here she is ’ anna karenina 1181 of 1759 vronsky for the first time experienced a feeling of anger against anna  almost a hatred for her willfully refusing to understand her own position
this feeling was aggravated by his being unable to tell her plainly the cause of his anger
if he had told her directly what he was thinking  he would have said  ‘in that dress  with a princess only too well known to everyone  to show yourself at the theater is equivalent not merely to acknowledging your position as a fallen woman  but is flinging down a challenge to society  that is to say  cutting yourself off from it forever ’ he could not say that to her
‘but how can she fail to see it  and what is going on in her ’ he said to himself he felt at the same time that his respect for her was diminished while his sense of her beauty was intensified
he went back scowling to his rooms  and sitting down beside yashvin  who  with his long legs stretched out on a chair  was drinking brandy and seltzer water  he ordered a glass of the same for himself ‘you were talking of lankovsky’s powerful that’s a fine horse  and i would advise you to buy him ’ said anna karenina 1182 of 1759 yashvin  glancing at his comrade’s gloomy face ‘his hindquarters aren’t quite first rate  but the legs and head—one couldn’t wish for anything better ’ ‘i think i will take him ’ answered vronsky
their conversation about horses interested him  but he did not for an instant forget anna  and could not help listening to the sound of steps in the corridor and looking at the clock on the chimney piece
‘anna arkadyevna gave orders to announce that she has gone to the theater ’ yashvin  tipping another glass of brandy into the bubbling water  drank it and got up  buttoning his coat
‘well  let’s go ’ he said  faintly smiling under his mustache  and showing by this smile that he knew the cause of vronsky’s gloominess  and did not attach any significance to it
‘i’m not going ’ vronsky answered gloomily
‘well  i must  i promised to
good bye  then
if you do  come to the stalls  you can take kruzin’s stall ’ added yashvin as he went out
‘no  i’m busy ’ ‘a wife is a care  but it’s worse when she’s not a wife ’ thought yashvin  as he walked out of the hotel
anna karenina 1183 of 1759 vronsky  left alone  got up from his chair and began pacing up and down the room
‘and what’s today  the fourth night   
yegor and his wife are there  and my mother  most likely
of course all petersburg’s there
now she’s gone in  taken off her cloak and come into the light
tushkevitch  yashvin  princess varvara ’ he pictured them to himself    ‘what about me  either that i’m frightened or have given up to tushkevitch the right to protect her  from every point of view—stupid  stupid   
and why is she putting me in such a position ’ he said with a gesture of despair
with that gesture he knocked against the table  on which there was standing the seltzer water and the decanter of brandy  and almost upset it
he tried to catch it  let it slip  and angrily kicked the table over and rang
‘if you care to be in my service ’ he said to the valet who came in  ‘you had better remember your duties
this shouldn’t be here
you ought to have cleared away ’ the valet  conscious of his own innocence  would have defended himself  but glancing at his master  he saw from his face that the only thing to do was to be silent  and hurriedly threading his way in and out  dropped down on the carpet and began gathering up the whole and broken glasses and bottles anna karenina 1184 of 1759 ‘that’s not your duty  send the waiter to clear away  and get my dress coat out ’ vronsky went into the theater at half past eight
the performance was in full swing
the little old box keeper  recognizing vronsky as he helped him off with his fur coat  called him ‘your excellency ’ and suggested he should not take a number but should simply call fyodor
in the brightly lighted corridor there was no one but the box opener and two attendants with fur cloaks on their arms listening at the doors through the closed doors came the sounds of the discreet staccato accompaniment of the orchestra  and a single female voice rendering distinctly a musical phrase
the door opened to let the box opener slip through  and the phrase drawing to the end reached vronsky’s hearing clearly
but the doors were closed again at once  and vronsky did not hear the end of the phrase and the cadence of the accompaniment  though he knew from the thunder of applause that it was over
when he entered the hall  brilliantly lighted with chandeliers and gas jets  the noise was still going on
on the stage the singer  bowing and smiling  with bare shoulders flashing with diamonds  was  with the help of the tenor who had given her his arm  gathering up the bouquets that were flying awkwardly over the footlights
anna karenina 1185 of 1759 then she went up to a gentleman with glossy pomaded hair parted down the center  who was stretching across the footlights holding out something to her  and all the public in the stalls as well as in the boxes was in excitement  craning forward  shouting and clapping the conductor in his high chair assisted in passing the offering  and straightened his white tie
vronsky walked into the middle of the stalls  and  standing still  began looking about him
that day less than ever was his attention turned upon the familiar  habitual surroundings  the stage  the noise  all the familiar  uninteresting  particolored herd of spectators in the packed theater
there were  as always  the same ladies of some sort with officers of some sort in the back of the boxes  the same gaily dressed women—god knows who—and uniforms and black coats  the same dirty crowd in the upper gallery  and among the crowd  in the boxes and in the front rows  were some forty of the real people and to those oases vronsky at once directed his attention  and with them he entered at once into relation
the act was over when he went in  and so he did not go straight to his brother’s box  but going up to the first row of stalls stopped at the footlights with serpuhovskoy  who  standing with one knee raised and his heel on the anna karenina 1186 of 1759 footlights  caught sight of him in the distance and beckoned to him  smiling
vronsky had not yet seen anna
he purposely avoided looking in her direction
but he knew by the direction of people’s eyes where she was
he looked round discreetly  but he was not seeking her  expecting the worst  his eyes sought for alexey alexandrovitch
to his relief alexey alexandrovitch was not in the theater that evening
‘how little of the military man there is left in you ’ serpuhovskoy was saying to him
‘a diplomat  an artist  something of that sort  one would say ’ ‘yes  it was like going back home when i put on a black coat ’ answered vronsky  smiling and slowly taking out his opera glass
‘well  i’ll own i envy you there
when i come back from abroad and put on this ’ he touched his epaulets  ‘i regret my freedom ’ serpuhovskoy had long given up all hope of vronsky’s career  but he liked him as before  and was now particularly cordial to him
‘what a pity you were not in time for the first act ’ vronsky  listening with one ear  moved his opera glass from the stalls and scanned the boxes
near a lady in a turban and a bald old man  who seemed to wave angrily in anna karenina 1187 of 1759 the moving opera glass  vronsky suddenly caught sight of anna’s head  proud  strikingly beautiful  and smiling in the frame of lace
she was in the fifth box  twenty paces from him
she was sitting in front  and slightly turning  was saying something to yashvin
the setting of her head on her handsome  broad shoulders  and the restrained excitement and brilliance of her eyes and her whole face reminded him of her just as he had seen her at the ball in moscow
but he felt utterly different towards her beauty now
in his feeling for her now there was no element of mystery  and so her beauty  though it attracted him even more intensely than before  gave him now a sense of injury
she was not looking in his direction  but vronsky felt that she had seen him already
when vronsky turned the opera glass again in that direction  he noticed that princess varvara was particularly red  and kept laughing unnaturally and looking round at the next box
anna  folding her fan and tapping it on the red velvet  was gazing away and did not see  and obviously did not wish to see  what was taking place in the next box
yashvin’s face wore the expression which was common when he was losing at cards
scowling  he sucked the left end of his mustache further and further into his mouth  and cast sidelong glances at the next box
anna karenina 1188 of 1759 in that box on the left were the kartasovs
vronsky knew them  and knew that anna was acquainted with them
madame kartasova  a thin little woman  was standing up in her box  and  her back turned upon anna  she was putting on a mantle that her husband was holding for her
her face was pale and angry  and she was talking excitedly
kartasov  a fat  bald man  was continually looking round at anna  while he attempted to soothe his wife
when the wife had gone out  the husband lingered a long while  and tried to catch anna’s eye  obviously anxious to bow to her
but anna  with unmistakable intention  avoided noticing him  and talked to yashvin  whose cropped head was bent down to her
kartasov went out without making his salutation  and the box was left empty
vronsky could not understand exactly what had passed between the kartasovs and anna  but he saw that something humiliating for anna had happened
he knew this both from what he had seen  and most of all from the face of anna  who  he could see  was taxing every nerve to carry through the part she had taken up
and in maintaining this attitude of external composure she was completely successful
anyone who did not know her and her circle  who had not heard all the utterances of the anna karenina 1189 of 1759 women expressive of commiseration  indignation  and amazement  that she should show herself in society  and show herself so conspicuously with her lace and her beauty  would have admired the serenity and loveliness of this woman without a suspicion that she was undergoing the sensations of a man in the stocks
knowing that something had happened  but not knowing precisely what  vronsky felt a thrill of agonizing anxiety  and hoping to find out something  he went towards his brother’s box
purposely choosing the way round furthest from anna’s box  he jostled as he came out against the colonel of his old regiment talking to two acquaintances
vronsky heard the name of madame karenina  and noticed how the colonel hastened to address vronsky loudly by name  with a meaning glance at his companions
‘ah  vronsky  when are you coming to the regiment  we can’t let you off without a supper
you’re one of the old set ’ said the colonel of his regiment
‘i can’t stop  awfully sorry  another time ’ said vronsky  and he ran upstairs towards his brother’s box
the old countess  vronsky’s mother  with her steelgray curls  was in his brother’s box
varya with the young princess sorokina met him in the corridor
anna karenina 1190 of 1759 leaving the princess sorokina with her mother  varya held out her hand to her brother in law  and began immediately to speak of what interested him
she was more excited than he had ever seen her
‘i think it’s mean and hateful  and madame kartasova had no right to do it
madame karenina   ’ she began
‘but what is it  i don’t know ’ ‘what  you’ve not heard ’ ‘you know i should be the last person to hear of it ’ ‘there isn’t a more spiteful creature than that madame kartasova ’ ‘but what did she do ’ ‘my husband told me   
she has insulted madame karenina
her husband began talking to her across the box  and madame kartasova made a scene
she said something aloud  he says  something insulting  and went away ’ ‘count  your maman is asking for you ’ said the young princess sorokina  peeping out of the door of the box
‘i’ve been expecting you all the while ’ said his mother  smiling sarcastically
‘you were nowhere to be seen ’ her son saw that she could not suppress a smile of delight
anna karenina 1191 of 1759 ‘good evening  maman
i have come to you ’ he said coldly
‘why aren’t you going to faire la cour a madame karenina ’ she went on  when princess sorokina had moved away
‘elle fait sensation
on oublie la patti pour elle ’ ‘maman  i have asked you not to say anything to me of that ’ he answered  scowling
‘i’m only saying what everyone’s saying ’ vronsky made no reply  and saying a few words to princess sorokina  he went away
at the door he met his brother
‘ah  alexey ’ said his brother
‘how disgusting  idiot of a woman  nothing else   
i wanted to go straight to her
let’s go together ’ vronsky did not hear him
with rapid steps he went downstairs  he felt that he must do something  but he did not know what
anger with her for having put herself and him in such a false position  together with pity for her suffering  filled his heart
he went down  and made straight for anna’s box
at her box stood stremov  talking to her
‘there are no more tenors
le moule en est brise ’ vronsky bowed to her and stopped to greet stremov
anna karenina 1192 of 1759 ‘you came in late  i think  and have missed the best song ’ anna said to vronsky  glancing ironically  he thought  at him
‘i am a poor judge of music ’ he said  looking sternly at her
‘like prince yashvin ’ she said smiling  ‘who considers that patti sings too loud ’ ‘thank you ’ she said  her little hand in its long glove taking the playbill vronsky picked up  and suddenly at that instant her lovely face quivered
she got up and went into the interior of the box
noticing in the next act that her box was empty  vronsky  rousing indignant ‘hushes’ in the silent audience  went out in the middle of a solo and drove home
anna was already at home
when vronsky went up to her  she was in the same dress as she had worn at the theater
she was sitting in the first armchair against the wall  looking straight before her
she looked at him  and at once resumed her former position
‘anna ’ he said
‘you  you are to blame for everything ’ she cried  with tears of despair and hatred in her voice  getting up
‘i begged  i implored you not to go  i knew it would be unpleasant   ’ anna karenina 1193 of 1759 ‘unpleasant ’ she cried—‘hideous  as long as i live i shall never forget it
she said it was a disgrace to sit beside me ’ ‘a silly woman’s chatter ’ he said  ‘but why risk it  why provoke   ’ ‘i hate your calm
you ought not to have brought me to this
if you had loved me  ’ ‘anna  how does the question of my love come in ’ ‘oh  if you loved me  as i love  if you were tortured as i am    ’ she said  looking at him with an expression of terror
he was sorry for her  and angry notwithstanding
he assured her of his love because he saw that this was the only means of soothing her  and he did not reproach her in words  but in his heart he reproached her
and the asseverations of his love  which seemed to him so vulgar that he was ashamed to utter them  she drank in eagerly  and gradually became calmer
the next day  completely reconciled  they left for the country
anna karenina 1194 of 1759 part six anna karenina 1195 of 1759 darya alexandrovna spent the summer with her children at pokrovskoe  at her sister kitty levin’s
the house on her own estate was quite in ruins  and levin and his wife had persuaded her to spend the summer with them
stepan arkadyevitch greatly approved of the arrangement
he said he was very sorry his official duties prevented him from spending the summer in the country with his family  which would have been the greatest happiness for him  and remaining in moscow  he came down to the country from time to time for a day or two
besides the oblonskys  with all their children and their governess  the old princess too came to stay that summer with the levins  as she considered it her duty to watch over her inexperienced daughter in her interesting condition
moreover  varenka  kitty’s friend abroad  kept her promise to come to kitty when she was married  and stayed with her friend
all of these were friends or relations of levin’s wife
and though he liked them all  he rather regretted his own levin world and ways  which was smothered by this influx of the ‘shtcherbatsky element ’ as he called it to himself of his own relations there stayed with him only sergey ivanovitch  but he too was a man of anna karenina 1196 of 1759 the koznishev and not the levin stamp  so that the levin spirit was utterly obliterated
in the levins’ house  so long deserted  there were now so many people that almost all the rooms were occupied  and almost every day it happened that the old princess  sitting down to table  counted them all over  and put the thirteenth grandson or granddaughter at a separate table and kitty  with her careful housekeeping  had no little trouble to get all the chickens  turkeys  and geese  of which so many were needed to satisfy the summer appetites of the visitors and children
the whole family were sitting at dinner
dolly’s children  with their governess and varenka  were making plans for going to look for mushrooms sergey ivanovitch  who was looked up to by all the party for his intellect and learning  with a respect that almost amounted to awe  surprised everyone by joining in the conversation about mushrooms ‘take me with you
i am very fond of picking mushrooms ’ he said  looking at varenka  ‘i think it’s a very nice occupation ’ ‘oh  we shall be delighted ’ answered varenka  coloring a little kitty exchanged meaningful glances with dolly
the proposal of the learned and intellectual sergey anna karenina 1197 of 1759 ivanovitch to go looking for mushrooms with varenka confirmed certain theories of kitty’s with which her mind had been very busy of late she made haste to address some remark to her mother  so that her look should not be noticed
after dinner sergey ivanovitch sat with his cup of coffee at the drawing room window  and while he took part in a conversation he had begun with his brother  he watched the door through which the children would start on the mushroom picking expedition
levin was sitting in the window near his brother
kitty stood beside her husband  evidently awaiting the end of a conversation that had no interest for her  in order to tell him something
‘you have changed in many respects since your marriage  and for the better ’ said sergey ivanovitch  smiling to kitty  and obviously little interested in the conversation  ‘but you have remained true to your passion for defending the most paradoxical theories ’ ‘katya  it’s not good for you to stand ’ her husband said to her  putting a chair for her and looking significantly at her
‘oh  and there’s no time either ’ added sergey ivanovitch  seeing the children running out
anna karenina 1198 of 1759 at the head of them all tanya galloped sideways  in her tightly  drawn stockings  and waving a basket and sergey ivanovitch’s hat  she ran straight up to him
boldly running up to sergey ivanovitch with shining eyes  so like her father’s fine eyes  she handed him his hat and made as though she would put it on for him  softening her freedom by a shy and friendly smile
‘varenka’s waiting ’ she said  carefully putting his hat on  seeing from sergey ivanovitch’s smile that she might do so
varenka was standing at the door  dressed in a yellow print gown  with a white kerchief on her head
‘i’m coming  i’m coming  varvara andreevna ’ said sergey ivanovitch  finishing his cup of coffee  and putting into their separate pockets his handkerchief and cigar case
‘and how sweet my varenka is  eh ’ said kitty to her husband  as soon as sergey ivanovitch rose
she spoke so that sergey ivanovitch could hear  and it was clear that she meant him to do so
‘and how good looking she is—such a refined beauty  varenka ’ kitty shouted
‘shall you be in the mill copse  we’ll come out to you ’ ‘you certainly forget your condition  kitty ’ said the old princess  hurriedly coming out at the door
‘you mustn’t shout like that ’ anna karenina 1199 of 1759 varenka  hearing kitty’s voice and her mother’s reprimand  went with light  rapid steps up to kitty
the rapidity of her movement  her flushed and eager face  everything betrayed that something out of the common was going on in her
kitty knew what this was  and had been watching her intently
she called varenka at that moment merely in order mentally to give her a blessing for the important event which  as kitty fancied  was bound to come to pass that day after dinner in the wood
‘varenka  i should be very happy if a certain something were to happen ’ she whispered as she kissed her
‘and are you coming with us ’ varenka said to levin in confusion  pretending not to have heard what had been said
‘i am coming  but only as far as the threshing floor  and there i shall stop ’ ‘why  what do you want there ’ said kitty
‘i must go to have a look at the new wagons  and to check the invoice ’ said levin  ‘and where will you be ’ ‘on the terrace ’ on the terrace were assembled all the ladies of the party
they always liked sitting there after dinner  and that day they had work to do there too
besides the sewing and knitting of baby clothes  with which all of them were busy  that afternoon jam was being made on the terrace by a method new to agafea mihalovna  without the addition of water
kitty had introduced this new method  which had been in use in her home
agafea mihalovna  to whom the task of jam making had always been intrusted  considering that what had been done in the levin household could not be amiss  had nevertheless put water with the strawberries  maintaining that the jam could not be made without it
she had been caught in the act  and was now making jam before everyone  and it was to be proved to her conclusively that jam could be very well made without water
agafea mihalovna  her face heated and angry  her hair untidy  and her thin arms bare to the elbows  was turning the preserving pan over the charcoal stove  looking darkly at the raspberries and devoutly hoping they would stick and not cook properly the princess  conscious that anna karenina 1201 of 1759 agafea mihalovna’s wrath must be chiefly directed against her  as the person responsible for the raspberry jammaking  tried to appear to be absorbed in other things and not interested in the jam  talked of other matters  but cast stealthy glances in the direction of the stove
‘i always buy my maids’ dresses myself  of some cheap material ’ the princess said  continuing the previous conversation
‘isn’t it time to skim it  my dear ’ she added  addressing agafea mihalovna
‘there’s not the slightest need for you to do it  and it’s hot for you ’ she said  stopping kitty
‘i’ll do it ’ said dolly  and getting up  she carefully passed the spoon over the frothing sugar  and from time to time shook off the clinging jam from the spoon by knocking it on a plate that was covered with yellow red scum and blood colored syrup
‘how they’ll enjoy this at tea time ’ she thought of her children  remembering how she herself as a child had wondered how it was the grownup people did not eat what was best of all—the scum of the jam
‘stiva says it’s much better to give money ’ dolly took up meanwhile the weighty subject under discussion  what presents should be made to servants
‘but  ’ anna karenina 1202 of 1759 ‘money’s out of the question ’ the princess and kitty exclaimed with one voice
‘they appreciate a present  ’ ‘well  last year  for instance  i bought our matrona semyenovna  not a poplin  but something of that sort ’ said the princess
‘i remember she was wearing it on your nameday ’ ‘a charming pattern—so simple and refined —i should have liked it myself  if she hadn’t had it
something like varenka’s
so pretty and inexpensive ’ ‘well  now i think it’s done ’ said dolly  dropping the syrup from the spoon
‘when it sets as it drops  it’s ready
cook it a little longer  agafea mihalovna ’ ‘the flies ’ said agafea mihalovna angrily
‘it’ll be just the same ’ she added
‘ah  how sweet it is  don’t frighten it ’ kitty said suddenly  looking at a sparrow that had settled on the step and was pecking at the center of a raspberry
‘yes  but you keep a little further from the stove ’ said her mother
‘a propos de varenka ’ said kitty  speaking in french  as they had been doing all the while  so that agafea mihalovna should not understand them  ‘you know  anna karenina 1203 of 1759 mamma  i somehow expect things to be settled today
you know what i mean
how splendid it would be ’ ‘but what a famous matchmaker she is ’ said dolly
‘how carefully and cleverly she throws them together   ’ ‘no  tell me  mamma  what do you think ’ ‘why  what is one to think  he’ (he meant sergey ivanovitch) ‘might at any time have been a match for anyone in russia  now  of course  he’s not quite a young man  still i know ever so many girls would be glad to marry him even now   
she’s a very nice girl  but he might  ’ ‘oh  no  mamma  do understand why  for him and for her too  nothing better could be imagined
in the first place  she’s charming ’ said kitty  crooking one of her fingers
‘he thinks her very attractive  that’s certain ’ assented dolly
‘then he occupies such a position in society that he has no need to look for either fortune or position in his wife
all he needs is a good  sweet wife—a restful one ’ ‘well  with her he would certainly be restful ’ dolly assented
‘thirdly  that she should love him
and so it is   that is  it would be so splendid    i look forward to seeing them anna karenina 1204 of 1759 coming out of the forest—and everything settled
i shall see at once by their eyes
i should be so delighted  what do you think  dolly ’ ‘but don’t excite yourself
it’s not at all the thing for you to be excited ’ said her mother
‘oh  i’m not excited  mamma
i fancy he will make her an offer today ’ ‘ah  that’s so strange  how and when a man makes an offer   
there is a sort of barrier  and all at once it’s broken down ’ said dolly  smiling pensively and recalling her past with stepan arkadyevitch
‘mamma  how did papa make you an offer ’ kitty asked suddenly
‘there was nothing out of the way  it was very simple ’ answered the princess  but her face beamed all over at the recollection
‘oh  but how was it  you loved him  anyway  before you were allowed to speak ’ kitty felt a peculiar pleasure in being able now to talk to her mother on equal terms about those questions of such paramount interest in a woman’s life ‘of course i did  he had come to stay with us in the country ’ ‘but how was it settled between you  mamma ’ anna karenina 1205 of 1759 ‘you imagine  i dare say  that you invented something quite new  it’s always just the same  it was settled by the eyes  by smiles  ’ ‘how nicely you said that  mamma  it’s just by the eyes  by smiles that it’s done ’ dolly assented
‘but what words did he say ’ ‘what did kostya say to you ’ ‘he wrote it in chalk
it was wonderful   
how long ago it seems ’ she said and the three women all fell to musing on the same thing
kitty was the first to break the silence
she remembered all that last winter before her marriage  and her passion for vronsky
‘there’s one thing    that old love affair of varenka’s ’ she said  a natural chain of ideas bringing her to this point
‘i should have liked to say something to sergey ivanovitch  to prepare him
they’re all—all men  i mean ’ she added  ‘awfully jealous over our past ’ ‘not all ’ said dolly
‘you judge by your own husband
it makes him miserable even now to remember vronsky
eh  that’s true  isn’t it ’ ‘yes ’ kitty answered  a pensive smile in her eyes
‘but i really don’t know ’ the mother put in in defense of her motherly care of her daughter  ‘what there was in anna karenina 1206 of 1759 your past that could worry him  that vronsky paid you attentions—that happens to every girl ’ ‘oh  yes  but we didn’t mean that ’ kitty said  flushing a little
‘no  let me speak ’ her mother went on  ‘why  you yourself would not let me have a talk to vronsky
don’t you remember ’ ‘oh  mamma ’ said kitty  with an expression of suffering
‘there’s no keeping you young people in check nowadays   
your friendship could not have gone beyond what was suitable
i should myself have called upon him to explain himself but  my darling  it’s not right for you to be agitated
please remember that  and calm yourself ’ ‘i’m perfectly calm  maman ’ ‘how happy it was for kitty that anna came then ’ said dolly  ‘and how unhappy for her
it turned out quite the opposite ’ she said  struck by her own ideas
‘then anna was so happy  and kitty thought herself unhappy
now it is just the opposite
i often think of her ’ ‘a nice person to think about  horrid  repulsive woman—no heart ’ said her mother  who could not forget that kitty had married not vronsky  but levin
anna karenina 1207 of 1759 ‘what do you want to talk of it for ’ kitty said with annoyance
‘i never think about it  and i don’t want to think of it   
and i don’t want to think of it ’ she said  catching the sound of her husband’s well known step on the steps of the terrace
‘what’s that you don’t want to think about ’ inquired levin  coming onto the terrace
but no one answered him  and he did not repeat the question
‘i’m sorry i’ve broken in on your feminine parliament ’ he said  looking round on every one discontentedly  and perceiving that they had been talking of something which they would not talk about before him
for a second he felt that he was sharing the feeling of agafea mihalovna  vexation at their making jam without water  and altogether at the outside shtcherbatsky element
he smiled  however  and went up to kitty
‘well  how are you ’ he asked her  looking at her with the expression with which everyone looked at her now
‘oh  very well ’ said kitty  smiling  ‘and how have things gone with you ’ ‘the wagons held three times as much as the old carts did
well  are we going for the children  i’ve ordered the horses to be put in ’ anna karenina 1208 of 1759 ‘what  you want to take kitty in the wagonette ’ her mother said reproachfully
‘yes  at a walking pace  princess ’ levin never called the princess ‘maman’ as men often do call their mothers in law  and the princess disliked his not doing so
but though he liked and respected the princess  levin could not call her so without a sense of profaning his feeling for his dead mother
‘come with us  maman ’ said kitty
‘i don’t like to see such imprudence ’ ‘well  i’ll walk then  i’m so well ’ kitty got up and went to her husband and took his hand
‘you may be well  but everything in moderation ’ said the princess
‘well  agafea mihalovna  is the jam done ’ said levin  smiling to agafea mihalovna  and trying to cheer her up
‘is it all right in the new way ’ ‘i suppose it’s all right
for our notions it’s boiled too long ’ ‘it’ll be all the better  agafea mihalovna  it won’t mildew  even though our ice has begun to thaw already  so that we’ve no cool cellar to store it ’ said kitty  at once divining her husband’s motive  and addressing the old housekeeper with the same feeling  ‘but your pickle’s so anna karenina 1209 of 1759 good  that mamma says she never tasted any like it ’ she added  smiling  and putting her kerchief straight
agafea mihalovna looked angrily at kitty
‘you needn’t try to console me  mistress
i need only to look at you with him  and i feel happy ’ she said  and something in the rough familiarity of that with him touched kitty ‘come along with us to look for mushrooms  you will show us the nest places ’ agafea mihalovna smiled and shook her head  as though to say  ‘i should like to be angry with you too  but i can’t ’ ‘do it  please  by my receipt ’ said the princess  ‘put some paper over the jam  and moisten it with a little rum  and without even ice  it will never go mildewy ’ kitty was particularly glad of a chance of being alone with her husband  for she had noticed the shade of mortification that had passed over his face—always so quick to reflect every feeling—at the moment when he had come onto the terrace and asked what they were talking of  and had got no answer when they had set off on foot ahead of the others  and had come out of sight of the house onto the beaten dusty road  marked with rusty wheels and sprinkled with grains of corn  she clung faster to his arm and pressed it closer to her
he had quite forgotten the momentary unpleasant impression  and alone with her he felt  now that the thought of her approaching motherhood was never for a moment absent from his mind  a new and delicious bliss  quite pure from all alloy of sense  in the being near to the woman he loved
there was no need of speech  yet he longed to hear the sound of her voice  which like her eyes had changed since she had been with child
in her voice  as in her eyes  there was that softness and gravity which is found in people continually concentrated on some cherished pursuit
anna karenina 1211 of 1759 ‘so you’re not tired  lean more on me ’ said he
‘no  i’m so glad of a chance of being alone with you  and i must own  though i’m happy with them  i do regret our winter evenings alone ’ ‘that was good  but this is even better
both are better ’ he said  squeezing her hand
‘do you know what we were talking about when you came in ’ ‘about jam ’ ‘oh  yes  about jam too  but afterwards  about how men make offers ’ ‘ah ’ said levin  listening more to the sound of her voice than to the words she was saying  and all the while paying attention to the road  which passed now through the forest  and avoiding places where she might make a false step
‘and about sergey ivanovitch and varenka
you’ve noticed   
i’m very anxious for it ’ she went on
‘what do you think about it ’ and she peeped into his face
‘i don’t know what to think ’ levin answered  smiling
‘sergey seems very strange to me in that way i told you  you know  ’ ‘yes  that he was in love with that girl who died   ’ anna karenina 1212 of 1759 ‘that was when i was a child  i know about it from hearsay and tradition
i remember him then
he was wonderfully sweet
but i’ve watched him since with women  he is friendly  some of them he likes  but one feels that to him they’re simply people  not women ’ ‘yes  but now with varenka   i fancy there’s something  ’ ‘perhaps there is   
but one has to know him   
he’s a peculiar  wonderful person
he lives a spiritual life only
he’s too pure  too exalted a nature ’ ‘why  would this lower him  then ’ ‘no  but he’s so used to a spiritual life that he can’t reconcile himself with actual fact  and varenka is after all fact ’ levin had grown used by now to uttering his thought boldly  without taking the trouble of clothing it in exact language he knew that his wife  in such moments of loving tenderness as now  would understand what he meant to say from a hint  and she did understand him
‘yes  but there’s not so much of that actual fact about her as about me
i can see that he would never have cared for me
she is altogether spiritual ’ ‘oh  no  he is so fond of you  and i am always so glad when my people like you   ’ anna karenina 1213 of 1759 ‘yes  he’s very nice to me  but  ’ ‘it’s not as it was with poor nikolay   you really cared for each other ’ levin finished
‘why not speak of him ’ he added
‘i sometimes blame myself for not  it ends in one’s forgetting
ah  how terrible and dear he was   
yes  what were we talking about ’ levin said  after a pause
‘you think he can’t fall in love ’ said kitty  translating into her own language
‘it’s not so much that he can’t fall in love ’ levin said  smiling  ‘but he has not the weakness necessary   
i’ve always envied him  and even now  when i’m so happy  i still envy him ’ ‘you envy him for not being able to fall in love ’ ‘i envy him for being better than i ’ said levin
‘he does not live for himself his whole life is subordinated to his duty
and that’s why he can be calm and contented ’ ‘and you ’ kitty asked  with an ironical and loving smile
she could never have explained the chain of thought that made her smile  but the last link in it was that her husband  in exalting his brother and abasing himself  was not quite sincere kitty knew that this insincerity came from his love for his brother  from his sense of shame at anna karenina 1214 of 1759 being too happy  and above all from his unflagging craving to be better—she loved it in him  and so she smiled
‘and you  what are you dissatisfied with ’ she asked  with the same smile
her disbelief in his self dissatisfaction delighted him  and unconsciously he tried to draw her into giving utterance to the grounds of her disbelief
‘i am happy  but dissatisfied with myself   ’ he said
‘why  how can you be dissatisfied with yourself if you are happy ’ ‘well  how shall i say   
in my heart i really care for nothing whatever but that you should not stumble—see  oh  but really you mustn’t skip about like that ’ he cried  breaking off to scold her for too agile a movement in stepping over a branch that lay in the path
‘but when i think about myself  and compare myself with others  especially with my brother  i feel i’m a poor creature ’ ‘but in what way ’ kitty pursued with the same smile
‘don’t you too work for others  what about your cooperative settlement  and your work on the estate  and your book   ’ ‘oh  but i feel  and particularly just now—it’s your fault ’ he said  pressing her hand—‘that all that doesn’t count
i do it in a way halfheartedly
if i could care for all anna karenina 1215 of 1759 that as i care for you   
instead of that  i do it in these days like a task that is set me ’ ‘well  what would you say about papa ’ asked kitty
‘is he a poor creature then  as he does nothing for the public good ’ ‘he —no  but then one must have the simplicity  the straightforwardness  the goodness of your father  and i haven’t got that
i do nothing  and i fret about it
it’s all your doing
before there was you—and this too ’ he added with a glance towards her waist that she understood— ‘i put all my energies into work  now i can’t  and i’m ashamed  i do it just as though it were a task set me  i’m pretending   ’ ‘well  but would you like to change this minute with sergey ivanovitch ’ said kitty
‘would you like to do this work for the general good  and to love the task set you  as he does  and nothing else ’ ‘of course not ’ said levin
‘but i’m so happy that i don’t understand anything
so you think he’ll make her an offer today ’ he added after a brief silence
‘i think so  and i don’t think so
only  i’m awfully anxious for it
here  wait a minute ’ she stooped down and picked a wild camomile at the edge of the path
anna karenina 1216 of 1759 ‘come  count  he does propose  he doesn’t ’ she said  giving him the flower
‘he does  he doesn’t ’ said levin  tearing off the white petals
‘no  no ’ kitty  snatching at his hand  stopped him
she had been watching his fingers with interest
‘you picked off two ’ ‘oh  but see  this little one shan’t count to make up ’ said levin  tearing off a little half grown petal
‘here’s the wagonette overtaking us ’ ‘aren’t you tired  kitty ’ called the princess
‘not in the least ’ ‘if you are you can get in  as the horses are quiet and walking ’ but it was not worth while to get in  they were quite near the place  and all walked on together
varenka  with her white kerchief on her black hair  surrounded by the children  gaily and good humoredly looking after them  and at the same time visibly excited at the possibility of receiving a declaration from the man she cared for  was very attractive
sergey ivanovitch walked beside her  and never left off admiring her
looking at her  he recalled all the delightful things he had heard from her lips  all the good he knew about her  and became more and more conscious that the feeling he had for her was something special that he had felt long  long ago  and only once  in his early youth
the feeling of happiness in being near her continually grew  and at last reached such a point that  as he put a huge  slender stalked agaric fungus in her basket  he looked straight into her face  and noticing the flush of glad and alarmed excitement that overspread her face  he was confused himself  and smiled to her in silence a smile that said too much ‘if so ’ he said to himself  ‘i ought to think it over and make up my mind  and not give way like a boy to the impulse of a moment ’ anna karenina 1218 of 1759 ‘i’m going to pick by myself apart from all the rest  or else my efforts will make no show ’ he said  and he left the edge of the forest where they were walking on low silky grass between old birch trees standing far apart  and went more into the heart of the wood  where between the white birch trunks there were gray trunks of aspen and dark bushes of hazel walking some forty paces away  sergey ivanovitch  knowing he was out of sight  stood still behind a bushy spindle tree in full flower with its rosy red catkins
it was perfectly still all round him
only overhead in the birches under which he stood  the flies  like a swarm of bees  buzzed unceasingly  and from time to time the children’s voices were floated across to him
all at once he heard  not far from the edge of the wood  the sound of varenka’s contralto voice  calling grisha  and a smile of delight passed over sergey ivanovitch’s face
conscious of this smile  he shook his head disapprovingly at his own condition  and taking out a cigar  he began lighting it
for a long while he could not get a match to light against the trunk of a birch tree
the soft scales of the white bark rubbed off the phosphorus  and the light went out
at last one of the matches burned  and the fragrant cigar smoke  hovering uncertainly in flat  wide coils  stretched away forwards and upwards over a bush under anna karenina 1219 of 1759 the overhanging branches of a birch tree watching the streak of smoke  sergey ivanovitch walked gently on  deliberating on his position
‘why not ’ he thought
‘if it were only a passing fancy or a passion  if it were only this attraction—this mutual attraction (i can call it a mutual attraction)  but if i felt that it was in contradiction with the whole bent of my life—if i felt that in giving way to this attraction i should be false to my vocation and my duty   but it’s not so
the only thing i can say against it is that  when i lost marie  i said to myself that i would remain faithful to her memory
that’s the only thing i can say against my feeling   
that’s a great thing ’ sergey ivanovitch said to himself  feeling at the same time that this consideration had not the slightest importance for him personally  but would only perhaps detract from his romantic character in the eyes of others ‘but apart from that  however much i searched  i should never find anything to say against my feeling
if i were choosing by considerations of suitability alone  i could not have found anything better ’ however many women and girls he thought of whom he knew  he could not think of a girl who united to such a degree all  positively all  the qualities he would wish to see in his wife
she had all the charm and freshness of anna karenina 1220 of 1759 youth  but she was not a child  and if she loved him  she loved him consciously as a woman ought to love  that was one thing
another point  she was not only far from being worldly  but had an unmistakable distaste for worldly society  and at the same time she knew the world  and had all the ways of a woman of the best society  which were absolutely essential to sergey ivanovitch’s conception of the woman who was to share his life
thirdly  she was religious  and not like a child  unconsciously religious and good  as kitty  for example  was  but her life was founded on religious principles
even in trifling matters  sergey ivanovitch found in her all that he wanted in his wife  she was poor and alone in the world  so she would not bring with her a mass of relations and their influence into her husband’s house  as he saw now in kitty’s case
she would owe everything to her husband  which was what he had always desired too for his future family life
and this girl  who united all these qualities  loved him
he was a modest man  but he could not help seeing it
and he loved her
there was one consideration against it—his age
but he came of a long lived family  he had not a single gray hair  no one would have taken him for forty  and he remembered varenka’s saying that it was only in russia that men of fifty thought themselves old  and that in anna karenina 1221 of 1759 france a man of fifty considers himself dans la force de l’age  while a man of forty is un jeune homme but what did the mere reckoning of years matter when he felt as young in heart as he had been twenty years ago  was it not youth to feel as he felt now  when coming from the other side to the edge of the wood he saw in the glowing light of the slanting sunbeams the gracious figure of varenka in her yellow gown with her basket  walking lightly by the trunk of an old birch tree  and when this impression of the sight of varenka blended so harmoniously with the beauty of the view  of the yellow oatfield lying bathed in the slanting sunshine  and beyond it the distant ancient forest flecked with yellow and melting into the blue of the distance  his heart throbbed joyously a softened feeling came over him
he felt that he had made up his mind
varenka  who had just crouched down to pick a mushroom  rose with a supple movement and looked round
flinging away the cigar  sergey ivanovitch advanced with resolute steps towards her
anna karenina 1222 of 1759 ‘varvara andreevna  when i was very young  i set before myself the ideal of the women i loved and should be happy to call my wife
i have lived through a long life  and now for the first time i have met what i sought—in you
i love you  and offer you my hand ’ sergey ivanovitch was saying this to himself while he was ten paces from varvara kneeling down  with her hands over the mushrooms to guard them from grisha  she was calling little masha ‘come here  little ones  there are so many ’ she was saying in her sweet  deep voice
seeing sergey ivanovitch approaching  she did not get up and did not change her position  but everything told him that she felt his presence and was glad of it
‘well  did you find some ’ she asked from under the white kerchief  turning her handsome  gently smiling face to him
‘not one ’ said sergey ivanovitch
‘did you ’ she did not answer  busy with the children who thronged about her
anna karenina 1223 of 1759 ‘that one too  near the twig ’ she pointed out to little masha a little fungus  split in half across its rosy cap by the dry grass from under which it thrust itself
varenka got up while masha picked the fungus  breaking it into two white halves
‘this brings back my childhood ’ she added  moving apart from the children beside sergey ivanovitch
they walked on for some steps in silence
varenka saw that he wanted to speak  she guessed of what  and felt faint with joy and panic
they had walked so far away that no one could hear them now  but still he did not begin to speak
it would have been better for varenka to be silent
after a silence it would have been easier for them to say what they wanted to say than after talking about mushrooms but against her own will  as it were accidentally  varenka said  ‘so you found nothing  in the middle of the wood there are always fewer  though ’ sergey ivanovitch sighed and made no answer
he was annoyed that she had spoken about the mushrooms he wanted to bring her back to the first words she had uttered about her childhood  but after a pause of some length  as though against his own will  he made an observation in response to her last words
anna karenina 1224 of 1759 ‘i have heard that the white edible funguses are found principally at the edge of the wood  though i can’t tell them apart ’ some minutes more passed  they moved still further away from the children  and were quite alone
varenka’s heart throbbed so that she heard it beating  and felt that she was turning red and pale and red again
to be the wife of a man like koznishev  after her position with madame stahl  was to her imagination the height of happiness
besides  she was almost certain that she was in love with him
and this moment it would have to be decided
she felt frightened
she dreaded both his speaking and his not speaking
now or never it must be said—that sergey ivanovitch felt too
everything in the expression  the flushed cheeks and the downcast eyes of varenka betrayed a painful suspense
sergey ivanovitch saw it and felt sorry for her
he felt even that to say nothing now would be a slight to her
rapidly in his own mind he ran over all the arguments in support of his decision
he even said over to himself the words in which he meant to put his offer  but instead of those words  some utterly unexpected reflection that occurred to him made him ask  anna karenina 1225 of 1759 ‘what is the difference between the ‘birch’ mushroom and the ‘white’ mushroom ’ varenka’s lips quivered with emotion as she answered  ‘in the top part there is scarcely any difference  it’s in the stalk ’ and as soon as these words were uttered  both he and she felt that it was over  that what was to have been said would not be said  and their emotion  which had up to then been continually growing more intense  began to subside ‘the birch mushroom’s stalk suggests a dark man’s chin after two days without shaving ’ said sergey ivanovitch  speaking quite calmly now
‘yes  that’s true ’ answered varenka smiling  and unconsciously the direction of their walk changed
they began to turn towards the children
varenka felt both sore and ashamed  at the same time she had a sense of relief
when he had got home again and went over the whole subject  sergey ivanovitch thought his previous decision had been a mistaken one
he could not be false to the memory of marie
‘gently  children  gently ’ levin shouted quite angrily to the children  standing before his wife to protect her anna karenina 1226 of 1759 when the crowd of children flew with shrieks of delight to meet them
behind the children sergey ivanovitch and varenka walked out of the wood
kitty had no need to ask varenka  she saw from the calm and somewhat crestfallen faces of both that her plans had not come off
‘well ’ her husband questioned her as they were going home again
‘it doesn’t bite ’ said kitty  her smile and manner of speaking recalling her father  a likeness levin often noticed with pleasure
‘how doesn’t bite ’ ‘i’ll show you ’ she said  taking her husband’s hand  lifting it to her mouth  and just faintly brushing it with closed lips
‘like a kiss on a priest’s hand ’ ‘which didn’t it bite with ’ he said  laughing
‘both
but it should have been like this  ’ ‘there are some peasants coming  ’ ‘oh  they didn’t see ’ anna karenina 1227 of 1759 during the time of the children’s tea the grown up people sat in the balcony and talked as though nothing had happened  though they all  especially sergey ivanovitch and varenka  were very well aware that there had happened an event which  though negative  was of very great importance
they both had the same feeling  rather like that of a schoolboy after an examination  which has left him in the same class or shut him out of the school forever
everyone present  feeling too that something had happened  talked eagerly about extraneous subjects
levin and kitty were particularly happy and conscious of their love that evening
and their happiness in their love seemed to imply a disagreeable slur on those who would have liked to feel the same and could not—and they felt a prick of conscience
‘mark my words  alexander will not come ’ said the old princess
that evening they were expecting stepan arkadyevitch to come down by train  and the old prince had written that possibly he might come too
anna karenina 1228 of 1759 ‘and i know why ’ the princess went on  ‘he says that young people ought to be left alone for a while at first ’ ‘but papa has left us alone
we’ve never seen him ’ said kitty
‘besides  we’re not young people —we’re old  married people by now ’ ‘only if he doesn’t come  i shall say good bye to you children ’ said the princess  sighing mournfully
‘what nonsense  mamma ’ both the daughters fell upon her at once
‘how do you suppose he is feeling  why  now  ’ and suddenly there was an unexpected quiver in the princess’s voice
her daughters were silent  and looked at one another
‘maman always finds something to be miserable about ’ they said in that glance
they did not know that happy as the princess was in her daughter’s house  and useful as she felt herself to be there  she had been extremely miserable  both on her own account and her husband’s  ever since they had married their last and favorite daughter  and the old home had been left empty
‘what is it  agafea mihalovna ’ kitty asked suddenly of agafea mihalovna  who was standing with a mysterious air  and a face full of meaning
‘about supper ’ anna karenina 1229 of 1759 ‘well  that’s right ’ said dolly  ‘you go and arrange about it  and i’ll go and hear grisha repeat his lesson  or else he will have nothing done all day ’ ‘that’s my lesson  no  dolly  i’m going ’ said levin  jumping up
grisha  who was by now at a high school  had to go over the lessons of the term in the summer holidays
darya alexandrovna  who had been studying latin with her son in moscow before  had made it a rule on coming to the levins’ to go over with him  at least once a day  the most difficult lessons of latin and arithmetic
levin had offered to take her place  but the mother  having once overheard levin’s lesson  and noticing that it was not given exactly as the teacher in moscow had given it  said resolutely  though with much embarrassment and anxiety not to mortify levin  that they must keep strictly to the book as the teacher had done  and that she had better undertake it again herself
levin was amazed both at stepan arkadyevitch  who  by neglecting his duty  threw upon the mother the supervision of studies of which she had no comprehension  and at the teachers for teaching the children so badly
but he promised his sister in law to give the lessons exactly as she wished
and he went on teaching grisha  not in his own way  but by the book  and anna karenina 1230 of 1759 so took little interest in it  and often forgot the hour of the lesson
so it had been today
‘no  i’m going  dolly  you sit still ’ he said
‘we’ll do it all properly  like the book
only when stiva comes  and we go out shooting  then we shall have to miss it ’ and levin went to grisha
varenka was saying the same thing to kitty
even in the happy  well ordered household of the levins varenka had succeeded in making herself useful
‘i’ll see to the supper  you sit still ’ she said  and got up to go to agafea mihalovna
‘yes  yes  most likely they’ve not been able to get chickens
if so  ours  ’ ‘agafea mihalovna and i will see about it ’ and varenka vanished with her
‘what a nice girl ’ said the princess
‘not nice  maman  she’s an exquisite girl  there’s no one else like her ’ ‘so you are expecting stepan arkadyevitch today ’ said sergey ivanovitch  evidently not disposed to pursue the conversation about varenka
‘it would be difficult to find two sons in law more unlike than yours ’ he said with a subtle smile
‘one all movement  only living in society  like a fish in water  the other our kostya  lively  alert  anna karenina 1231 of 1759 quick in everything  but as soon as he is in society  he either sinks into apathy  or struggles helplessly like a fish on land ’ ‘yes  he’s very heedless ’ said the princess  addressing sergey ivanovitch
‘i’ve been meaning  indeed  to ask you to tell him that it’s out of the question for her’ (she indicated kitty) ‘to stay here  that she positively must come to moscow
he talks of getting a doctor down  ’ ‘maman  he’ll do everything  he has agreed to everything ’ kitty said  angry with her mother for appealing to sergey ivanovitch to judge in such a matter
in the middle of their conversation they heard the snorting of horses and the sound of wheels on the gravel
dolly had not time to get up to go and meet her husband  when from the window of the room below  where grisha was having his lesson  levin leaped out and helped grisha out after him
‘it’s stiva ’ levin shouted from under the balcony
‘we’ve finished  dolly  don’t be afraid ’ he added  and started running like a boy to meet the carriage
‘is ea id  ejus  ejus  ejus ’ shouted grisha  skipping along the avenue
anna karenina 1232 of 1759 ‘and some one else too  papa  of course ’ cried levin  stopping at the entrance of the avenue
‘kitty  don’t come down the steep staircase  go round ’ but levin had been mistaken in taking the person sitting in the carriage for the old prince
as he got nearer to the carriage he saw beside stepan arkadyevitch not the prince but a handsome  stout young man in a scotch cap  with long ends of ribbon behind
this was vassenka veslovsky  a distant cousin of the shtcherbatskys  a brilliant young gentleman in petersburg and moscow society
‘a capital fellow  and a keen sportsman ’ as stepan arkadyevitch said  introducing him
not a whit abashed by the disappointment caused by his having come in place of the old prince  veslovsky greeted levin gaily  claiming acquaintance with him in the past  and snatching up grisha into the carriage  lifted him over the pointer that stepan arkadyevitch had brought with him
levin did not get into the carriage  but walked behind
he was rather vexed at the non arrival of the old prince  whom he liked more and more the more he saw of him  and also at the arrival of this vassenka veslovsky  a quite uncongenial and superfluous person
he seemed to him still more uncongenial and superfluous when  on anna karenina 1233 of 1759 approaching the steps where the whole party  children and grown up  were gathered together in much excitement  levin saw vassenka veslovsky  with a particularly warm and gallant air  kissing kitty’s hand
‘your wife arid i are cousins and very old friends ’ said vassenka veslovsky  once more shaking levin’s hand with great warmth
‘well  are there plenty of birds ’ stepan arkadyevitch said to levin  hardly leaving time for everyone to utter their greetings
‘we’ve come with the most savage intentions
why  maman  they’ve not been in moscow since  look  tanya  here’s something for you  get it  please  it’s in the carriage  behind ’ he talked in all directions
‘how pretty you’ve grown  dolly ’ he said to his wife  once more kissing her hand  holding it in one of his  and patting it with the other
levin  who a minute before had been in the happiest frame of mind  now looked darkly at everyone  and everything displeased him
‘who was it he kissed yesterday with those lips ’ he thought  looking at stepan arkadyevitch’s tender demonstrations to his wife
he looked at dolly  and he did not like her either
anna karenina 1234 of 1759 ‘she doesn’t believe in his love
so what is she so pleased about  revolting ’ thought levin
he looked at the princess  who had been so dear to him a minute before  and he did not like the manner in which she welcomed this vassenka  with his ribbons  just as though she were in her own house
even sergey ivanovitch  who had come out too onto the steps  seemed to him unpleasant with the show of cordiality with which he met stepan arkadyevitch  though levin knew that his brother neither liked nor respected oblonsky
and varenka  even she seemed hateful  with her air sainte nitouche making the acquaintance of this gentleman  while all the while she was thinking of nothing but getting married
and more hateful than anyone was kitty for falling in with the tone of gaiety with which this gentleman regarded his visit in the country  as though it were a holiday for himself and everyone else and  above all  unpleasant was that particular smile with which she responded to his smile
noisily talking  they all went into the house  but as soon as they were all seated  levin turned and went out
anna karenina 1235 of 1759 kitty saw something was wrong with her husband
she tried to seize a moment to speak to him alone  but he made haste to get away from her  saying he was wanted at the counting house
it was long since his own work on the estate had seemed to him so important as at that moment
‘it’s all holiday for them ’ he thought  ‘but these are no holiday matters  they won’t wait  and there’s no living without them ’ anna karenina 1236 of 1759 levin came back to the house only when they sent to summon him to supper
on the stairs were standing kitty and agafea mihalovna  consulting about wines for supper
‘but why are you making all this fuss  have what we usually do ’ ‘no  stiva doesn’t drink   kostya  stop  what’s the matter ’ kitty began  hurrying after him  but he strode ruthlessly away to the dining room without waiting for her  and at once joined in the lively general conversation which was being maintained there by vassenka veslovsky and stepan arkadyevitch
‘well  what do you say  are we going shooting tomorrow ’ said stepan arkadyevitch
‘please  do let’s go ’ said veslovsky  moving to another chair  where he sat down sideways  with one fat leg crossed under him
‘i shall be delighted  we will go
and have you had any shooting yet this year ’ said levin to veslovsky  looking intently at his leg  but speaking with that forced amiability that kitty knew so well in him  and that was so out of keeping with him
‘i can’t answer for our finding grouse  anna karenina 1237 of 1759 but there are plenty of snipe
only we ought to start early
you’re not tired  aren’t you tired  stiva ’ ‘me tired  i’ve never been tired yet
suppose we stay up all night
let’s go for a walk ’ ‘yes  really  let’s not go to bed at all  capital ’ veslovsky chimed in
‘oh  we all know you can do without sleep  and keep other people up too ’ dolly said to her husband  with that faint note of irony in her voice which she almost always had now with her husband
‘but to my thinking  it’s time for bed now   
i’m going  i don’t want supper ’ ‘no  do stay a little  dolly ’ said stepan arkadyevitch  going round to her side behind the table where they were having supper
‘i’ve so much still to tell you ’ ‘nothing really  i suppose ’ ‘do you know veslovsky has been at anna’s  and he’s going to them again  you know they’re hardly fifty miles from you  and i too must certainly go over there
veslovsky  come here ’ vassenka crossed over to the ladies  and sat down beside kitty
‘ah  do tell me  please  you have stayed with her  how was she ’ darya alexandrovna appealed to him
anna karenina 1238 of 1759 levin was left at the other end of the table  and though never pausing in his conversation with the princess and varenka  he saw that there was an eager and mysterious conversation going on between stepan arkadyevitch  dolly  kitty  and veslovsky
and that was not all
he saw on his wife’s face an expression of real feeling as she gazed with fixed eyes on the handsome face of vassenka  who was telling them something with great animation
‘it’s exceedingly nice at their place ’ veslovsky was telling them about vronsky and anna
‘i can’t  of course  take it upon myself to judge  but in their house you feel the real feeling of home ’ ‘what do they intend doing ’ ‘i believe they think of going to moscow ’ ‘how jolly it would be for us all to go over to them together’ when are you going there ’ stepan arkadyevitch asked vassenka
‘i’m spending july there ’ ‘will you go ’ stepan arkadyevitch said to his wife
‘i’ve been wanting to a long while  i shall certainly go ’ said dolly
‘i am sorry for her  and i know her
she’s a splendid woman
i will go alone  when you go back  and then i shall be in no one’s way
and it will be better indeed without you ’ anna karenina 1239 of 1759 ‘to be sure ’ said stepan arkadyevitch
‘and you  kitty ’ ‘i  why should i go ’ kitty said  flushing all over  and she glanced round at her husband
‘do you know anna arkadyevna  then ’ veslovsky asked her
‘she’s a very fascinating woman ’ ‘yes ’ she answered veslovsky  crimsoning still more she got up and walked across to her husband
‘are you going shooting  then  tomorrow ’ she said
his jealousy had in these few moments  especially at the flush that had overspread her cheeks while she was talking to veslovsky  gone far indeed
now as he heard her words  he construed them in his own fashion
strange as it was to him afterwards to recall it  it seemed to him at the moment clear that in asking whether he was going shooting  all she cared to know was whether he would give that pleasure to vassenka veslovsky  with whom  as he fancied  she was in love
‘yes  i’m going ’ he answered her in an unnatural voice  disagreeable to himself ‘no  better spend the day here tomorrow  or dolly won’t see anything of her husband  and set off the day after ’ said kitty
anna karenina 1240 of 1759 the motive of kitty’s words was interpreted by levin thus  ‘don’t separate me from him
i don’t care about your going  but do let me enjoy the society of this delightful young man ’ ‘oh  if you wish  we’ll stay here tomorrow ’ levin answered  with peculiar amiability
vassenka meanwhile  utterly unsuspecting the misery his presence had occasioned  got up from the table after kitty  and watching her with smiling and admiring eyes  he followed her
levin saw that look
he turned white  and for a minute he could hardly breathe
‘how dare he look at my wife like that ’ was the feeling that boiled within him
‘tomorrow  then  do  please  let us go ’ said vassenka  sitting down on a chair  and again crossing his leg as his habit was
levin’s jealousy went further still
already he saw himself a deceived husband  looked upon by his wife and her lover as simply necessary to provide them with the conveniences and pleasures of life    but in spite of that he made polite and hospitable inquiries of vassenka about his shooting  his gun  and his boots  and agreed to go shooting next day
anna karenina 1241 of 1759 happily for levin  the old princess cut short his agonies by getting up herself and advising kitty to go to bed
but even at this point levin could not escape another agony
as he said good night to his hostess  vassenka would again have kissed her hand  but kitty  reddening  drew back her hand and said with a naive bluntness  for which the old princess scolded her afterwards  ‘we don’t like that fashion ’ in levin’s eyes she was to blame for having allowed such relations to arise  and still more to blame for showing so awkwardly that she did not like them
‘why  how can one want to go to bed ’ said stepan arkadyevitch  who  after drinking several glasses of wine at supper  was now in his most charming and sentimental humor
‘look  kitty ’ he said  pointing to the moon  which had just risen behind the lime trees"how exquisite  veslovsky  this is the time for a serenade
you know  he has a splendid voice  we practiced songs together along the road
he has brought some lovely songs with him  two new ones
varvara andreevna and he must sing some duets ’ when the party had broken up  stepan arkadyevitch walked a long while about the avenue with veslovsky  their voices could be heard singing one of the new songs
anna karenina 1242 of 1759 levin hearing these voices sat scowling in an easy chair in his wife’s bedroom  and maintained an obstinate silence when she asked him what was wrong
but when at last with a timid glance she hazarded the question  ‘was there perhaps something you disliked about veslovsky ’—it all burst out  and he told her all
he was humiliated himself at what he was saying  and that exasperated him all the more he stood facing her with his eyes glittering menacingly under his scowling brows  and he squeezed his strong arms across his chest  as though he were straining every nerve to hold himself in the expression of his face would have been grim  and even cruel  if it had not at the same time had a look of suffering which touched her
his jaws were twitching  and his voice kept breaking
‘you must understand that i’m not jealous  that’s a nasty word
i can’t be jealous  and believe that   
i can’t say what i feel  but this is awful   
i’m not jealous  but i’m wounded  humiliated that anybody dare think  that anybody dare look at you with eyes like that ’ ‘eyes like what ’ said kitty  trying as conscientiously as possible to recall every word and gesture of that evening and every shade implied in them
at the very bottom of her heart she did think there had been something precisely at the moment when he had anna karenina 1243 of 1759 crossed over after her to the other end of the table  but she dared not own it even to herself  and would have been even more unable to bring herself to say so to him  and so increase his suffering
‘and what can there possibly be attractive about me as i am now   ’ ‘ah ’ he cried  clutching at his head  ‘you shouldn’t say that   
if you had been attractive then  ’ ‘oh  no  kostya  oh  wait a minute  oh  do listen ’ she said  looking at him with an expression of pained commiseration
‘why  what can you be thinking about  when for me there’s no one in the world  no one  no one   
would you like me never to see anyone ’ for the first minute she had been offended at his jealousy  she was angry that the slightest amusement  even the most innocent  should be forbidden her  but now she would readily have sacrificed  not merely such trifles  but everything  for his peace of mind  to save him from the agony he was suffering
‘you must understand the horror and comedy of my position ’ he went on in a desperate whisper  ‘that he’s in my house  that he’s done nothing improper positively except his free and easy airs and the way he sits on his legs
anna karenina 1244 of 1759 he thinks it’s the best possible form  and so i’m obliged to be civil to him ’ ‘but  kostya  you’re exaggerating ’ said kitty  at the bottom of her heart rejoicing at the depth of his love for her  shown now in his jealousy
‘the most awful part of it all is that you’re just as you always are  and especially now when to me you’re something sacred  and we’re so happy  so particularly happy—and all of a sudden a little wretch    he’s not a little wretch  why should i abuse him  i have nothing to do with him but why should my  and your  happiness  ’ ‘do you know  i understand now what it’s all come from ’ kitty was beginning
‘well  what  what ’ ‘i saw how you looked while we were talking at supper ’ ‘well  well ’ levin said in dismay
she told him what they had been talking about
and as she told him  she was breathless with emotion
levin was silent for a space  then he scanned her pale and distressed face  and suddenly he clutched at his head
‘katya  i’ve been worrying you  darling  forgive me  it’s madness  katya  i’m a criminal
and how could you be so distressed at such idiocy ’ anna karenina 1245 of 1759 ‘oh  i was sorry for you ’ ‘for me  for me  how mad i am   
but why make you miserable  it’s awful to think that any outsider can shatter our happiness ’ ‘it’s humiliating too  of course ’ ‘oh  then i’ll keep him here all the summer  and will overwhelm him with civility ’ said levin  kissing her hands
‘you shall see
tomorrow   
oh  yes  we are going tomorrow ’ anna karenina 1246 of 1759 next day  before the ladies were up  the wagonette and a trap for the shooting party were at the door  and laska  aware since early morning that they were going shooting  after much whining and darting to and fro  had sat herself down in the wagonette beside the coachman  and  disapproving of the delay  was excitedly watching the door from which the sportsmen still did not come out
the first to come out was vassenka veslovsky  in new high boots that reached half way up his thick thighs  in a green blouse  with a new russian leather cartridge belt  and in his scotch cap with ribbons  with a brand new english gun without a sling
laska flew up to him  welcomed him  and jumping up  asked him in her own way whether the others were coming soon  but getting no answer from him  she returned to her post of observation and sank into repose again  her head on one side  and one ear pricked up to listen
at last the door opened with a creak  and stepan arkadyevitch’s spot and tan pointer krak flew out  running round and round and turning over in the air
stepan arkadyevitch himself followed with a gun in his hand and a cigar in his mouth anna karenina 1247 of 1759 ‘good dog  good dog  krak ’ he cried encouragingly to the dog  who put his paws up on his chest  catching at his game bag
stepan arkadyevitch was dressed in rough leggings and spats  in torn trousers and a short coat
on his head there was a wreck of a hat of indefinite form  but his gun of a new patent was a perfect gem  and his game bag and cartridge belt  though worn  were of the very best quality
vassenka veslovsky had had no notion before that it was truly chic for a sportsman to be in tatters  but to have his shooting outfit of the best quality
he saw it now as he looked at stepan arkadyevitch  radiant in his rags  graceful  well fed  and joyous  a typical russian nobleman
and he made up his mind that next time he went shooting he would certainly adopt the same get up
‘well  and what about our host ’ he asked
‘a young wife ’ said stepan arkadyevitch  smiling
‘yes  and such a charming one ’ ‘he came down dressed
no doubt he’s run up to her again ’ stepan arkadyevitch guessed right
levin had run up again to his wife to ask her once more if she forgave him for his idiocy yesterday  and  moreover  to beg her for christ’s sake to be more careful
the great thing was for anna karenina 1248 of 1759 her to keep away from the children—they might any minute push against her
then he had once more to hear her declare that she was not angry with him for going away for two days  and to beg her to be sure to send him a note next morning by a servant on horseback  to write him  if it were but two words only  to let him know that all was well with her
kitty was distressed  as she always was  at parting for a couple of days from her husband  but when she saw his eager figure  looking big and strong in his shooting boots and his white blouse  and a sort of sportsman elation and excitement incomprehensible to her  she forgot her own chagrin for the sake of his pleasure  and said good bye to him cheerfully
‘pardon  gentlemen ’ he said  running out onto the steps
‘have you put the lunch in  why is the chestnut on the right  well  it doesn’t matter
laska  down  go and lie down ’ ‘put it with the herd of oxen ’ he said to the herdsman  who was waiting for him at the steps with some question
‘excuse me  here comes another villain ’ levin jumped out of the wagonette  in which he had already taken his seat  to meet the carpenter  who came towards the steps with a rule in his hand
anna karenina 1249 of 1759 ‘you didn’t come to the counting house yesterday  and now you’re detaining me
well  what is it ’ ‘would your honor let me make another turning  it’s only three steps to add
and we make it just fit at the same time
it will be much more convenient ’ ‘you should have listened to me ’ levin answered with annoyance
‘i said  put the lines and then fit in the steps
now there’s no setting it right
do as i told you  and make a new staircase ’ the point was that in the lodge that was being built the carpenter had spoiled the staircase  fitting it together without calculating the space it was to fill  so that the steps were all sloping when it was put in place
now the carpenter wanted  keeping the same staircase  to add three steps
‘it will be much better ’ ‘but where’s your staircase coming out with its three steps ’ ‘why  upon my word  sir ’ the carpenter said with a contemptuous smile
‘it comes out right at the very spot
it starts  so to speak ’ he said  with a persuasive gesture  ‘it comes down  and comes down  and comes out ’ ‘but three steps will add to the length too   where is it to come out ’ anna karenina 1250 of 1759 ‘why  to be sure  it’ll start from the bottom and go up and go up  and come out so ’ the carpenter said obstinately and convincingly
‘it’ll reach the ceiling and the wall ’ ‘upon my word  why  it’ll go up  and up  and come out like this ’ levin took out a ramrod and began sketching him the staircase in the dust ‘there  do you see ’ ‘as your honor likes ’ said the carpenter  with a sudden gleam in his eyes  obviously understanding the thing at last ‘it seems it’ll be best to make a new one ’ ‘well  then  do it as you’re told ’ levin shouted  seating himself in the wagonette ‘down  hold the dogs  philip ’ levin felt now at leaving behind all his family and household cares such an eager sense of joy in life and expectation that he was not disposed to talk
besides that  he had that feeling of concentrated excitement that every sportsman experiences as he approaches the scene of action
if he had anything on his mind at that moment  it was only the doubt whether they would start anything in the kolpensky marsh  whether laska would show to advantage in comparison with krak  and whether he would shoot well that day himself not to disgrace himself anna karenina 1251 of 1759 before a new spectator—not to be outdone by oblonsky—that too was a thought that crossed his brain oblonsky was feeling the same  and he too was not talkative
vassenka veslovsky kept up alone a ceaseless flow of cheerful chatter
as he listened to him now  levin felt ashamed to think how unfair he had been to him the day before
vassenka was really a nice fellow  simple  good hearted  and very good humored
if levin had met him before he was married  he would have made friends with him
levin rather disliked his holiday attitude to life and a sort of free and easy assumption of elegance
it was as though he assumed a high degree of importance in himself that could not be disputed  because he had long nails and a stylish cap  and everything else to correspond  but this could be forgiven for the sake of his good nature and good breeding levin liked him for his good education  for speaking french and english with such an excellent accent  and for being a man of his world
vassenka was extremely delighted with the left horse  a horse of the don steppes
he kept praising him enthusiastically
‘how fine it must be galloping over the steppes on a steppe horse  eh  isn’t it ’ he said
he had imagined riding on a steppe horse as something wild and romantic  and it turned out nothing of the sort
but his anna karenina 1252 of 1759 simplicity  particularly in conjunction with his good looks  his amiable smile  and the grace of his movements  was very attractive
either because his nature was sympathetic to levin  or because levin was trying to atone for his sins of the previous evening by seeing nothing but what was good in him  anyway he liked his society
after they had driven over two miles from home  veslovsky all at once felt for a cigar and his pocketbook  and did not know whether he had lost them or left them on the table
in the pocketbook there were thirty seven pounds  and so the matter could not be left in uncertainty
‘do you know what  levin  i’ll gallop home on that left trace horse
that will be splendid
eh ’ he said  preparing to get out
‘no  why should you ’ answered levin  calculating that vassenka could hardly weigh less than seventeen stone
‘i’ll send the coachman ’ the coachman rode back on the trace horse  and levin himself drove the remaining pair anna karenina 1253 of 1759 ‘well  now what’s our plan of campaign  tell us all about it ’ said stepan arkadyevitch
‘our plan is this
now we’re driving to gvozdyov
in gvozdyov there’s a grouse marsh on this side  and beyond gvozdyov come some magnificent snipe marshes where there are grouse too
it’s hot now  and we’ll get there—it’s fifteen miles or so—towards evening and have some evening shooting  we’ll spend the night there and go on tomorrow to the bigger moors ’ ‘and is there nothing on the way ’ ‘yes  but we’ll reserve ourselves  besides it’s hot
there are two nice little places  but i doubt there being anything to shoot ’ levin would himself have liked to go into these little places  but they were near home  he could shoot them over any time  and they were only little places—there would hardly be room for three to shoot and so  with some insincerity  he said that he doubted there being anything to shoot
when they reached a little marsh levin would have driven by  but stepan arkadyevitch  with the anna karenina 1254 of 1759 experienced eye of a sportsman  at once detected reeds visible from the road
‘shan’t we try that ’ he said  pointing to the little marsh
‘levin  do  please  how delightful ’ vassenka veslovsky began begging  and levin could but consent
before they had time to stop  the dogs had flown one before the other into the marsh
‘krak  laska   ’ the dogs came back
‘there won’t be room for three
i’ll stay here ’ said levin  hoping they would find nothing but peewits  who had been startled by the dogs  and turning over in their flight  were plaintively wailing over the marsh
‘no  come along  levin  let’s go together ’ veslovsky called
‘really  there’s not room
laska  back  laska  you won’t want another dog  will you ’ levin remained with the wagonette  and looked enviously at the sportsmen
they walked right across the marsh
except little birds and peewits  of which vassenka killed one  there was nothing in the marsh
‘come  you see now that it was not that i grudged the marsh ’ said levin  ‘only it’s wasting time ’ anna karenina 1255 of 1759 ‘oh  no  it was jolly all the same
did you see us ’ said vassenka veslovsky  clambering awkwardly into the wagonette with his gun and his peewit in his hands
‘how splendidly i shot this bird  didn’t i  well  shall we soon be getting to the real place ’ the horses started off suddenly  levin knocked his head against the stock of someone’s gun  and there was the report of a shot
the gun did actually go off first  but that was how it seemed to levin
it appeared that vassenka veslovsky had pulled only one trigger  and had left the other hammer still cocked
the charge flew into the ground without doing harm to anyone
stepan arkadyevitch shook his head and laughed reprovingly at veslovsky
but levin had not the heart to reprove him
in the first place  any reproach would have seemed to be called forth by the danger he had incurred and the bump that had come up on levin’s forehead
and besides  veslovsky was at first so naively distressed  and then laughed so good humoredly and infectiously at their general dismay  that one could not but laugh with him
when they reached the second marsh  which was fairly large  and would inevitably take some time to shoot over  levin tried to persuade them to pass it by
but veslovsky anna karenina 1256 of 1759 again overpersuaded him
again  as the marsh was narrow  levin  like a good host  remained with the carriage
krak made straight for some clumps of sedge
vassenka veslovsky was the first to run after the dog
before stepan arkadyevitch had time to come up  a grouse flew out
veslovsky missed it and it flew into an unmown meadow
this grouse was left for veslovsky to follow up
krak found it again and pointed  and veslovsky shot it and went back to the carriage
‘now you go and i’ll stay with the horses ’ he said
levin had begun to feel the pangs of a sportsman’s envy
he handed the reins to veslovsky and walked into the marsh
laska  who had been plaintively whining and fretting against the injustice of her treatment  flew straight ahead to a hopeful place that levin knew well  and that krak had not yet come upon
‘why don’t you stop her ’ shouted stepan arkadyevitch
‘she won’t scare them ’ answered levin  sympathizing with his bitch’s pleasure and hurrying after her
as she came nearer and nearer to the familiar breeding places there was more and more earnestness in laska’s exploration
a little marsh bird did not divert her attention anna karenina 1257 of 1759 for more than an instant
she made one circuit round the clump of reeds  was beginning a second  and suddenly quivered with excitement and became motionless
‘come  come  stiva ’ shouted levin  feeling his heart beginning to beat more violently  and all of a sudden  as though some sort of shutter had been drawn back from his straining ears  all sounds  confused but loud  began to beat on his hearing  losing all sense of distance
he heard the steps of stepan arkadyevitch  mistaking them for the tramp of the horses in the distance  he heard the brittle sound of the twigs on which he had trodden  taking this sound for the flying of a grouse
he heard too  not far behind him  a splashing in the water  which he could not explain to himself picking his steps  he moved up to the dog
‘fetch it ’ not a grouse but a snipe flew up from beside the dog levin had lifted his gun  but at the very instant when he was taking aim  the sound of splashing grew louder  came closer  and was joined with the sound of veslovsky’s voice  shouting something with strange loudness
levin saw he had his gun pointed behind the snipe  but still he fired
anna karenina 1258 of 1759 when he had made sure he had missed  levin looked round and saw the horses and the wagonette not on the road but in the marsh
veslovsky  eager to see the shooting  had driven into the marsh  and got the horses stuck in the mud
‘damn the fellow ’ levin said to himself  as he went back to the carriage that had sunk in the mire ‘what did you drive in for ’ he said to him dryly  and calling the coachman  he began pulling the horses out
levin was vexed both at being hindered from shooting and at his horses getting stuck in the mud  and still more at the fact that neither stepan arkadyevitch nor veslovsky helped him and the coachman to unharness the horses and get them out  since neither of them had the slightest notion of harnessing
without vouchsafing a syllable in reply to vassenka’s protestations that it had been quite dry there  levin worked in silence with the coachman at extricating the horses
but then  as he got warm at the work and saw how assiduously veslovsky was tugging at the wagonette by one of the mud guards  so that he broke it indeed  levin blamed himself for having under the influence of yesterday’s feelings been too cold to veslovsky  and tried to be particularly genial so as to smooth over his chilliness when everything had been put anna karenina 1259 of 1759 right  and the carriage had been brought back to the road  levin had the lunch served
‘bon appetit—bonne conscience  ce poulet va tomber jusqu’au fond de mes bottes ’ vassenka  who had recovered his spirits  quoted the french saying as he finished his second chicken
‘well  now our troubles are over  now everything’s going to go well
only  to atone for my sins  i’m bound to sit on the box
that’s so  eh  no  no  i’ll be your automedon
you shall see how i’ll get you along ’ he answered  not letting go the rein  when levin begged him to let the coachman drive
‘no  i must atone for my sins  and i’m very comfortable on the box ’ and he drove
levin was a little afraid he would exhaust the horses  especially the chestnut  whom he did not know how to hold in  but unconsciously he fell under the influence of his gaiety and listened to the songs he sang all the way on the box  or the descriptions and representations he gave of driving in the english fashion  four in hand  and it was in the very best of spirits that after lunch they drove to the gvozdyov marsh
anna karenina 1260 of 1759 vassenka drove the horses so smartly that they reached the marsh too early  while it was still hot
as they drew near this more important marsh  the chief aim of their expedition  levin could not help considering how he could get rid of vassenka and be free in his movements
stepan arkadyevitch evidently had the same desire  and on his face levin saw the look of anxiety always present in a true sportsman when beginning shooting  together with a certain good humored slyness peculiar to him
‘how shall we go  it’s a splendid marsh  i see  and there are hawks ’ said stepan arkadyevitch  pointing to two great birds hovering over the reeds
‘where there are hawks  there is sure to be game ’ ‘now  gentlemen ’ said levin  pulling up his boots and examining the lock of his gun with rather a gloomy expression  ‘do you see those reeds ’ he pointed to an oasis of blackish green in the huge half mown wet meadow that stretched along the right bank of the river ‘the marsh begins here  straight in front of us  do you see—where it is greener  from here it runs to the right anna karenina 1261 of 1759 where the horses are  there are breeding places there  and grouse  and all round those reeds as far as that alder  and right up to the mill
over there  do you see  where the pools are  that’s the best place
there i once shot seventeen snipe
we’ll separate with the dogs and go in different directions  and then meet over there at the mill ’ ‘well  which shall go to left and which to right ’ asked stepan arkadyevitch
‘it’s wider to the right  you two go that way and i’ll take the left ’ he said with apparent carelessness
‘capital  we’ll make the bigger bag  yes  come along  come along ’ vassenka exclaimed
levin could do nothing but agree  and they divided
as soon as they entered the marsh  the two dogs began hunting about together and made towards the green  slime covered pool
levin knew laska’s method  wary and indefinite  he knew the place too and expected a whole covey of snipe
‘veslovsky  beside me  walk beside me ’ he said in a faint voice to his companion splashing in the water behind him
levin could not help feeling an interest in the direction his gun was pointed  after that casual shot near the kolpensky marsh
‘oh  i won’t get in your way  don’t trouble about me ’ anna karenina 1262 of 1759 but levin could not help troubling  and recalled kitty’s words at parting  ‘mind you don’t shoot one another ’ the dogs came nearer and nearer  passed each other  each pursuing its own scent
the expectation of snipe was so intense that to levin the squelching sound of his own heel  as he drew it up out of the mire  seemed to be the call of a snipe  and he clutched and pressed the lock of his gun
‘bang  bang ’ sounded almost in his ear
vassenka had fired at a flock of ducks which was hovering over the marsh and flying at that moment towards the sportsmen  far out of range
before levin had time to look round  there was the whir of one snipe  another  a third  and some eight more rose one after another
stepan arkadyevitch hit one at the very moment when it was beginning its zigzag movements  and the snipe fell in a heap into the mud
oblonsky aimed deliberately at another  still flying low in the reeds  and together with the report of the shot  that snipe too fell  and it could be seen fluttering out where the sedge had been cut  its unhurt wing showing white beneath
levin was not so lucky  he aimed at his first bird too low  and missed  he aimed at it again  just as it was rising  anna karenina 1263 of 1759 but at that instant another snipe flew up at his very feet  distracting him so that he missed again
while they were loading their guns  another snipe rose  and veslovsky  who had had time to load again  sent two charges of small shot into the water
stepan arkadyevitch picked up his snipe  and with sparkling eyes looked at levin
‘well  now let us separate ’ said stepan arkadyevitch  and limping on his left foot  holding his gun in readiness and whistling to his dog  he walked off in one direction
levin and veslovsky walked in the other
it always happened with levin that when his first shots were a failure he got hot and out of temper  and shot badly the whole day
so it was that day
the snipe showed themselves in numbers they kept flying up from just under the dogs  from under the sportsmen’s legs  and levin might have retrieved his ill luck
but the more he shot  the more he felt disgraced in the eyes of veslovsky  who kept popping away merrily and indiscriminately  killing nothing  and not in the slightest abashed by his ill success
levin  in feverish haste  could not restrain himself  got more and more out of temper  and ended by shooting almost without a hope of hitting laska  indeed  seemed to understand this
she began looking more languidly  and anna karenina 1264 of 1759 gazed back at the sportsmen  as it were  with perplexity or reproach in her eyes
shots followed shots in rapid succession
the smoke of the powder hung about the sportsmen  while in the great roomy net of the game bag there were only three light little snipe
and of these one had been killed by veslovsky alone  and one by both of them together
meanwhile from the other side of the marsh came the sound of stepan arkadyevitch’s shots  not frequent  but  as levin fancied  well directed  for almost after each they heard ‘krak  krak  apporte ’ this excited levin still more
the snipe were floating continually in the air over the reeds
their whirring wings close to the earth  and their harsh cries high in the air  could be heard on all sides  the snipe that had risen first and flown up into the air  settled again before the sportsmen
instead of two hawks there were now dozens of them hovering with shrill cries over the marsh
after walking through the larger half of the marsh  levin and veslovsky reached the place where the peasants’ mowing grass was divided into long strips reaching to the reeds  marked off in one place by the trampled grass  in another by a path mown through it
half of these strips had already been mown
anna karenina 1265 of 1759 though there was not so much hope of finding birds in the uncut part as the cut part  levin had promised stepan arkadyevitch to meet him  and so he walked on with his companion through the cut and uncut patches
‘hi  sportsmen ’ shouted one of a group of peasants  sitting on an unharnessed cart  ‘come and have some lunch with us  have a drop of wine ’ levin looked round
‘come along  it’s all right ’ shouted a good humoredlooking bearded peasant with a red face  showing his white teeth in a grin  and holding up a greenish bottle that flashed in the sunlight
‘qu’est ce qu’ils disent ’ asked veslovsky
‘they invite you to have some vodka
most likely they’ve been dividing the meadow into lots
i should have some ’ said levin  not without some guile  hoping veslovsky would be tempted by the vodka  and would go away to them
‘why do they offer it ’ ‘oh  they’re merry making
really  you should join them
you would be interested ’ ‘allons  c’est curieux ’ ‘you go  you go  you’ll find the way to the mill ’ cried levin  and looking round he perceived with satisfaction anna karenina 1266 of 1759 that veslovsky  bent and stumbling with weariness  holding his gun out at arm’s length  was making his way out of the marsh towards the peasants
‘you come too ’ the peasants shouted to levin
‘never fear  you taste our cake ’ levin felt a strong inclination to drink a little vodka and to eat some bread
he was exhausted  and felt it a great effort to drag his staggering legs out of the mire  and for a minute he hesitated
but laska was setting
and immediately all his weariness vanished  and he walked lightly through the swamp towards the dog
a snipe flew up at his feet  he fired and killed it
laska still pointed — ‘fetch it ’ another bird flew up close to the dog levin fired
but it was an unlucky day for him  he missed it  and when he went to look for the one he had shot  he could not find that either
he wandered all about the reeds  but laska did not believe he had shot it  and when he sent her to find it  she pretended to hunt for it  but did not really
and in the absence of vassenka  on whom levin threw the blame of his failure  things went no better
there were plenty of snipe still  but levin made one miss after another
the slanting rays of the sun were still hot  his clothes  soaked through with perspiration  stuck to his body  his anna karenina 1267 of 1759 left boot full of water weighed heavily on his leg and squeaked at every step  the sweat rain in drops down his powder grimed face  his mouth was full of the bitter taste  his nose of the smell of powder and stagnant water  his ears were ringing with the incessant whir of the snipe  he could not touch the stock of his gun  it was so hot  his heart beat with short  rapid throbs  his hands shook with excitement  and his weary legs stumbled and staggered over the hillocks and in the swamp  but still he walked on and still he shot
at last  after a disgraceful miss  he flung his gun and his hat on the ground
‘no  i must control myself ’ he said to himself picking up his gun and his hat  he called laska  and went out of the swamp
when he got on to dry ground he sat down  pulled off his boot and emptied it  then walked to the marsh  drank some stagnant tasting water  moistened his burning hot gun  and washed his face and hands
feeling refreshed  he went back to the spot where a snipe had settled  firmly resolved to keep cool
he tried to be calm  but it was the same again
his finger pressed the cock before he had taken a good aim at the bird
it got worse and worse
anna karenina 1268 of 1759 he had only five birds in his game bag when he walked out of the marsh towards the alders where he was to rejoin stepan arkadyevitch
before he caught sight of stepan arkadyevitch he saw his dog
krak darted out from behind the twisted root of an alder  black all over with the stinking mire of the marsh  and with the air of a conqueror sniffed at laska
behind krak there came into view in the shade of the alder tree the shapely figure of stepan arkadyevitch
he came to meet him  red and perspiring  with unbuttoned neckband  still limping in the same way
‘well  you have been popping away ’ he said  smiling good humoredly
‘how have you got on ’ queried levin
but there was no need to ask  for he had already seen the full game bag
‘oh  pretty fair ’ he had fourteen birds
‘a splendid marsh  i’ve no doubt veslovsky got in your way
it’s awkward too  shooting with one dog ’ said stepan arkadyevitch  to soften his triumph
anna karenina 1269 of 1759 when levin and stepan arkadyevitch reached the peasant’s hut where levin always used to stay  veslovsky was already there
he was sitting in the middle of the hut  clinging with both hands to the bench from which he was being pulled by a soldier  the brother of the peasant’s wife  who was helping him off with his miry boots
veslovsky was laughing his infectious  good humored laugh
‘i’ve only just come
ils ont ete charmants
just fancy  they gave me drink  fed me  such bread  it was exquisite  delicieux  and the vodka  i never tasted any better
and they would not take a penny for anything
and they kept saying  ‘excuse our homely ways ’’ ‘what should they take anything for  they were entertaining you  to be sure
do you suppose they keep vodka for sale ’ said the soldier  succeeding at last in pulling the soaked boot off the blackened stocking
in spite of the dirtiness of the hut  which was all muddied by their boots and the filthy dogs licking themselves clean  and the smell of marsh mud and powder that filled the room  and the absence of knives and forks  the party drank their tea and ate their supper with a relish anna karenina 1270 of 1759 only known to sportsmen washed and clean  they went into a hay barn swept ready for them  where the coachman had been making up beds for the gentlemen
though it was dusk  not one of them wanted to go to sleep
after wavering among reminiscences and anecdotes of guns  of dogs  and of former shooting parties  the conversation rested on a topic that interested all of them
after vassenka had several times over expressed his appreciation of this delightful sleeping place among the fragrant hay  this delightful broken cart (he supposed it to be broken because the shafts had been taken out)  of the good nature of the peasants that had treated him to vodka  of the dogs who lay at the feet of their respective masters  oblonsky began telling them of a delightful shooting party at malthus’s  where he had stayed the previous summer
malthus was a well known capitalist  who had made his money by speculation in railway shares
stepan arkadyevitch described what grouse moors this malthus had bought in the tver province  and how they were preserved  and of the carriages and dogcarts in which the shooting party had been driven  and the luncheon pavilion that had been rigged up at the marsh
anna karenina 1271 of 1759 ‘i don’t understand you ’ said levin  sitting up in the hay  ‘how is it such people don’t disgust you  i can understand a lunch with lafitte is all very pleasant  but don’t you dislike just that very sumptuousness  all these people  just like our spirit monopolists in old days  get their money in a way that gains them the contempt of everyone
they don’t care for their contempt  and then they use their dishonest gains to buy off the contempt they have deserved ’ ‘perfectly true ’ chimed in vassenka veslovsky
‘perfectly  oblonsky  of course  goes out of bonhomie  but other people say  ‘well  oblonsky stays with them ’  ’ ‘not a bit of it ’ levin could hear that oblonsky was smiling as he spoke
‘i simply don’t consider him more dishonest than any other wealthy merchant or nobleman
they’ve all made their money alike—by their work and their intelligence ’ ‘oh  by what work  do you call it work to get hold of concessions and speculate with them ’ ‘of course it’s work
work in this sense  that if it were not for him and others like him  there would have been no railways ’ ‘but that’s not work  like the work of a peasant or a learned profession ’ anna karenina 1272 of 1759 ‘granted  but it’s work in the sense that his activity produces a result—the railways
but of course you think the railways useless ’ ‘no  that’s another question  i am prepared to admit that they’re useful
but all profit that is out of proportion to the labor expended is dishonest ’ ‘but who is to define what is proportionate ’ ‘making profit by dishonest means  by trickery ’ said levin  conscious that he could not draw a distinct line between honesty and dishonesty
‘such as banking  for instance ’ he went on
‘it’s an evil—the amassing of huge fortunes without labor  just the same thing as with the spirit monopolies  it’s only the form that’s changed
le roi est mort  vive le roi
no sooner were the spirit monopolies abolished than the railways came up  and banking companies  that  too  is profit without work ’ ‘yes  that may all be very true and clever   
lie down  krak ’ stepan arkadyevitch called to his dog  who was scratching and turning over all the hay
he was obviously convinced of the correctness of his position  and so talked serenely and without haste
‘but you have not drawn the line between honest and dishonest work
that i receive a bigger salary than my chief clerk  though he knows more about the work than i do—that’s dishonest  i suppose ’ anna karenina 1273 of 1759 ‘i can’t say ’ ‘well  but i can tell you  your receiving some five thousand  let’s say  for your work on the land  while our host  the peasant here  however hard he works  can never get more than fifty roubles  is just as dishonest as my earning more than my chief clerk  and malthus getting more than a station master
no  quite the contrary  i see that society takes up a sort of antagonistic attitude to these people  which is utterly baseless  and i fancy there’s envy at the bottom of it   ’ ‘no  that’s unfair ’ said veslovsky  ‘how could envy come in  there is something not nice about that sort of business ’ ‘you say ’ levin went on  ‘that it’s unjust for me to receive five thousand  while the peasant has fifty  that’s true
it is unfair  and i feel it  but  ’ ‘it really is
why is it we spend our time riding  drinking  shooting  doing nothing  while they are forever at work ’ said vassenka veslovsky  obviously for the first time in his life reflecting on the question  and consequently considering it with perfect sincerity
‘yes  you feel it  but you don’t give him your property ’ said stepan arkadyevitch  intentionally  as it seemed  provoking levin
anna karenina 1274 of 1759 there had arisen of late something like a secret antagonism between the two brothers in law  as though  since they had married sisters  a kind of rivalry had sprung up between them as to which was ordering his life best  and now this hostility showed itself in the conversation  as it began to take a personal note
‘i don’t give it away  because no one demands that from me  and if i wanted to  i could not give it away ’ answered levin  ‘and have no one to give it to ’ ‘give it to this peasant  he would not refuse it ’ ‘yes  but how am i to give it up  am i to go to him and make a deed of conveyance ’ ‘i don’t know  but if you are convinced that you have no right  ’ ‘i’m not at all convinced
on the contrary  i feel i have no right to give it up  that i have duties both to the land and to my family ’ ‘no  excuse me  but if you consider this inequality is unjust  why is it you don’t act accordingly   ’ ‘well  i do act negatively on that idea  so far as not trying to increase the difference of position existing between him and me ’ ‘no  excuse me  that’s a paradox ’ anna karenina 1275 of 1759 ‘yes  there’s something of a sophistry about that ’ veslovsky agreed
‘ah  our host  so you’re not asleep yet ’ he said to the peasant who came into the barn  opening the creaking door
‘how is it you’re not asleep ’ ‘no  how’s one to sleep  i thought our gentlemen would be asleep  but i heard them chattering
i want to get a hook from here
she won’t bite ’ he added  stepping cautiously with his bare feet
‘and where are you going to sleep ’ ‘we are going out for the night with the beasts ’ ‘ah  what a night ’ said veslovsky  looking out at the edge of the hut and the unharnessed wagonette that could be seen in the faint light of the evening glow in the great frame of the open doors
‘but listen  there are women’s voices singing  and  on my word  not badly too
who’s that singing  my friend ’ ‘that’s the maids from hard by here ’ ‘let’s go  let’s have a walk  we shan’t go to sleep  you know
oblonsky  come along ’ ‘if one could only do both  lie here and go ’ answered oblonsky  stretching ‘it’s capital lying here ’ ‘well  i shall go by myself ’ said veslovsky  getting up eagerly  and putting on his shoes and stockings
‘good  anna karenina 1276 of 1759 bye  gentlemen
if it’s fun  i’ll fetch you you’ve treated me to some good sport  and i won’t forget you ’ ‘he really is a capital fellow  isn’t he ’ said stepan arkadyevitch  when veslovsky had gone out and the peasant had closed the door after him
‘yes  capital ’ answered levin  still thinking of the subject of their conversation just before
it seemed to him that he had clearly expressed his thoughts and feelings to the best of his capacity  and yet both of them  straightforward men and not fools  had said with one voice that he was comforting himself with sophistries this disconcerted him
‘it’s just this  my dear boy
one must do one of two things  either admit that the existing order of society is just  and then stick up for one’s rights in it  or acknowledge that you are enjoying unjust privileges  as i do  and then enjoy them and be satisfied ’ ‘no  if it were unjust  you could not enjoy these advantages and be satisfied—at least i could not
the great thing for me is to feel that i’m not to blame ’ ‘what do you say  why not go after all ’ said stepan arkadyevitch  evidently weary of the strain of thought
‘we shan’t go to sleep  you know
come  let’s go ’ anna karenina 1277 of 1759 levin did not answer
what they had said in the conversation  that he acted justly only in a negative sense  absorbed his thoughts
‘can it be that it’s only possible to be just negatively ’ he was asking himself ‘how strong the smell of the fresh hay is  though ’ said stepan arkadyevitch  getting up
‘there’s not a chance of sleeping
vassenka has been getting up some fun there
do you hear the laughing and his voice  hadn’t we better go  come along ’ ‘no  i’m not coming ’ answered levin
‘surely that’s not a matter of principle too ’ said stepan arkadyevitch  smiling  as he felt about in the dark for his cap
‘it’s not a matter of principle  but why should i go ’ ‘but do you know you are preparing trouble for yourself ’ said stepan arkadyevitch  finding his cap and getting up
‘how so ’ ‘do you suppose i don’t see the line you’ve taken up with your wife  i heard how it’s a question of the greatest consequence  whether or not you’re to be away for a couple of days’ shooting
that’s all very well as an idyllic episode  but for your whole life that won’t answer
a man anna karenina 1278 of 1759 must be independent  he has his masculine interests
a man has to be manly ’ said oblonsky  opening the door
‘in what way  to go running after servant girls ’ said levin
‘why not  if it amuses him  ca ne tire pas a consequence
it won’t do my wife any harm  and it’ll amuse me
the great thing is to respect the sanctity of the home
there should be nothing in the home
but don’t tie your own hands ’ ‘perhaps so ’ said levin dryly  and he turned on his side
‘tomorrow  early  i want to go shooting  and i won’t wake anyone  and shall set off at daybreak ’ ‘messieurs  venes vite ’ they heard the voice of veslovsky coming back
‘charmante  i’ve made such a discovery
charmante  a perfect gretchen  and i’ve already made friends with her really  exceedingly pretty ’ he declared in a tone of approval  as though she had been made pretty entirely on his account  and he was expressing his satisfaction with the entertainment that had been provided for him
levin pretended to be asleep  while oblonsky  putting on his slippers  and lighting a cigar  walked out of the barn  and soon their voices were lost
anna karenina 1279 of 1759 for a long while levin could not get to sleep
he heard the horses munching hay  then he heard the peasant and his elder boy getting ready for the night  and going off for the night watch with the beasts  then he heard the soldier arranging his bed on the other side of the barn  with his nephew  the younger son of their peasant host
he heard the boy in his shrill little voice telling his uncle what he thought about the dogs  who seemed to him huge and terrible creatures  and asking what the dogs were going to hunt next day  and the soldier in a husky  sleepy voice  telling him the sportsmen were going in the morning to the marsh  and would shoot with their guns  and then  to check the boy’s questions  he said  ‘go to sleep  vaska  go to sleep  or you’ll catch it ’ and soon after he began snoring himself  and everything was still he could only hear the snort of the horses  and the guttural cry of a snipe
‘is it really only negative ’ he repeated to himself ‘well  what of it  it’s not my fault ’ and he began thinking about the next day
‘tomorrow i’ll go out early  and i’ll make a point of keeping cool
there are lots of snipe  and there are grouse too
when i come back there’ll be the note from kitty
yes  stiva may be right  i’m not manly with her  i’m tied anna karenina 1280 of 1759 to her apron strings   
well  it can’t be helped  negative again   ’ half asleep  he heard the laughter and mirthful talk of veslovsky and stepan arkadyevitch
for an instant he opened his eyes  the moon was up  and in the open doorway  brightly lighted up by the moonlight  they were standing talking
stepan arkadyevitch was saying something of the freshness of one girl  comparing her to a freshly peeled nut  and veslovsky with his infectious laugh was repeating some words  probably said to him by a peasant  ‘ah  you do your best to get round her ’ levin  half asleep  said  ‘gentlemen  tomorrow before daylight ’ and fell asleep
anna karenina 1281 of 1759 waking up at earliest dawn  levin tried to wake his companions
vassenka  lying on his stomach  with one leg in a stocking thrust out  was sleeping so soundly that he could elicit no response
oblonsky  half asleep  declined to get up so early
even laska  who was asleep  curled up in the hay  got up unwillingly  and lazily stretched out and straightened her hind legs one after the other getting on his boots and stockings  taking his gun  and carefully opening the creaking door of the barn  levin went out into the road
the coachmen were sleeping in their carriages  the horses were dozing
only one was lazily eating oats  dipping its nose into the manger
it was still gray out of doors
‘why are you up so early  my dear ’ the old woman  their hostess  said  coming out of the hut and addressing him affectionately as an old friend
‘going shooting  granny
do i go this way to the marsh ’ ‘straight out at the back  by our threshing floor  my dear  and hemp patches  there’s a little footpath ’ stepping carefully with her sunburnt  bare feet  the old woman anna karenina 1282 of 1759 conducted levin  and moved back the fence for him by the threshing floor
‘straight on and you’ll come to the marsh
our lads drove the cattle there yesterday evening ’ laska ran eagerly forward along the little path
levin followed her with a light  rapid step  continually looking at the sky
he hoped the sun would not be up before he reached the marsh
but the sun did not delay
the moon  which had been bright when he went out  by now shone only like a crescent of quicksilver
the pink flush of dawn  which one could not help seeing before  now had to be sought to be discerned at all
what were before undefined  vague blurs in the distant countryside could now be distinctly seen
they were sheaves of rye
the dew  not visible till the sun was up  wetted levin’s legs and his blouse above his belt in the high growing  fragrant hemp patch  from which the pollen had already fallen out
in the transparent stillness of morning the smallest sounds were audible
a bee flew by levin’s ear with the whizzing sound of a bullet
he looked carefully  and saw a second and a third
they were all flying from the beehives behind the hedge  and they disappeared over the hemp patch in the direction of the marsh
the path led straight to the marsh
the marsh could be recognized by the mist which anna karenina 1283 of 1759 rose from it  thicker in one place and thinner in another  so that the reeds and willow bushes swayed like islands in this mist
at the edge of the marsh and the road  peasant boys and men  who had been herding for the night  were lying  and in the dawn all were asleep under their coats
not far from them were three hobbled horses
one of them clanked a chain
laska walked beside her master  pressing a little forward and looking round
passing the sleeping peasants and reaching the first reeds  levin examined his pistols and let his dog off
one of the horses  a sleek  dark brown three year old  seeing the dog  started away  switched its tail and snorted
the other horses too were frightened  and splashing through the water with their hobbled legs  and drawing their hoofs out of the thick mud with a squelching sound  they bounded out of the marsh
laska stopped  looking ironically at the horses and inquiringly at levin
levin patted laska  and whistled as a sign that she might begin
laska ran joyfully and anxiously through the slush that swayed under her
running into the marsh among the familiar scents of roots  marsh plants  and slime  and the extraneous smell of horse dung  laska detected at once a smell that pervaded the whole marsh  the scent of that strong smelling bird anna karenina 1284 of 1759 that always excited her more than any other
here and there among the moss and marsh plants this scent was very strong  but it was impossible to determine in which direction it grew stronger or fainter
to find the direction  she had to go farther away from the wind
not feeling the motion of her legs  laska bounded with a stiff gallop  so that at each bound she could stop short  to the right  away from the wind that blew from the east before sunrise  and turned facing the wind
sniffing in the air with dilated nostrils  she felt at once that not their tracks only but they themselves were here before her  and not one  but many laska slackened her speed
they were here  but where precisely she could not yet determine
to find the very spot  she began to make a circle  when suddenly her master’s voice drew her off
‘laska  here ’ he asked  pointing her to a different direction
she stopped  asking him if she had better not go on doing as she had begun
but he repeated his command in an angry voice  pointing to a spot covered with water  where there could not be anything
she obeyed him  pretending she was looking  so as to please him  went round it  and went back to her former position  and was at once aware of the scent again
now when he was not hindering her  she knew what to do  and without looking at what was under her feet  and anna karenina 1285 of 1759 to her vexation stumbling over a high stump into the water  but righting herself with her strong  supple legs  she began making the circle which was to make all clear to her
the scent of them reached her  stronger and stronger  and more and more defined  and all at once it became perfectly clear to her that one of them was here  behind this tuft of reeds  five paces in front of her  she stopped  and her whole body was still and rigid
on her short legs she could see nothing in front of her  but by the scent she knew it was sitting not more than five paces off
she stood still  feeling more and more conscious of it  and enjoying it in anticipation
her tail was stretched straight and tense  and only wagging at the extreme end her mouth was slightly open  her ears raised
one ear had been turned wrong side out as she ran up  and she breathed heavily but warily  and still more warily looked round  but more with her eyes than her head  to her master
he was coming along with the face she knew so well  though the eyes were always terrible to her
he stumbled over the stump as he came  and moved  as she thought  extraordinarily slowly
she thought he came slowly  but he was running
noticing laska’s special attitude as she crouched on the ground  as it were  scratching big prints with her hind paws  and with her mouth slightly open  levin knew she anna karenina 1286 of 1759 was pointing at grouse  and with an inward prayer for luck  especially with the first bird  he ran up to her
coming quite close up to her  he could from his height look beyond her  and he saw with his eyes what she was seeing with her nose
in a space between two little thickets  to a couple of yards’ distance  he could see a grouse
turning its head  it was listening
then lightly preening and folding its wings  it disappeared round a corner with a clumsy wag of its tail ‘fetch it  fetch it ’ shouted levin  giving laska a shove from behind ‘but i can’t go ’ thought laska
‘where am i to go  from here i feel them  but if i move forward i shall know nothing of where they are or who they are ’ but then he shoved her with his knee  and in an excited whisper said  ‘fetch it  laska ’ ‘well  if that’s what he wishes  i’ll do it  but i can’t answer for myself now ’ she thought  and darted forward as fast as her legs would carry her between the thick bushes she scented nothing now  she could only see and hear  without understanding anything
ten paces from her former place a grouse rose with a guttural cry and the peculiar round sound of its wings
and immediately after the shot it splashed heavily with its anna karenina 1287 of 1759 white breast on the wet mire
another bird did not linger  but rose behind levin without the dog
when levin turned towards it  it was already some way off
but his shot caught it
flying twenty paces further  the second grouse rose upwards  and whirling round like a ball  dropped heavily on a dry place
‘come  this is going to be some good ’ thought levin  packing the warm and fat grouse into his game bag
‘eh  laska  will it be good ’ when levin  after loading his gun  moved on  the sun had fully risen  though unseen behind the storm clouds
the moon had lost all of its luster  and was like a white cloud in the sky
not a single star could be seen
the sedge  silvery with dew before  now shone like gold
the stagnant pools were all like amber
the blue of the grass had changed to yellow green
the marsh birds twittered and swarmed about the brook and upon the bushes that glittered with dew and cast long shadows
a hawk woke up and settled on a haycock  turning its head from side to side and looking discontentedly at the marsh
crows were flying about the field  and a bare legged boy was driving the horses to an old man  who had got up from under his long coat and was combing his hair
the smoke from the gun was white as milk over the green of the grass
anna karenina 1288 of 1759 one of the boys ran up to levin
‘uncle  there were ducks here yesterday ’ he shouted to him  and he walked a little way off behind him
and levin was doubly pleased  in sight of the boy  who expressed his approval  at killing three snipe  one after another  straight off
anna karenina 1289 of 1759 the sportsman’s saying  that if the first beast or the first bird is not missed  the day will be lucky  turned out correct
at ten o’clock levin  weary  hungry  and happy after a tramp of twenty miles  returned to his night’s lodging with nineteen head of fine game and one duck  which he tied to his belt  as it would not go into the game bag
his companions had long been awake  and had had time to get hungry and have breakfast
‘wait a bit  wait a bit  i know there are nineteen ’ said levin  counting a second time over the grouse and snipe  that looked so much less important now  bent and dry and bloodstained  with heads crooked aside  than they did when they were flying
the number was verified  and stepan arkadyevitch’s envy pleased levin
he was pleased too on returning to find the man sent by kitty with a note was already there
‘i am perfectly well and happy
if you were uneasy about me  you can feel easier than ever
i’ve a new bodyguard  marya vlasyevna ’— this was the midwife  a new and important personage in levin’s domestic life
anna karenina 1290 of 1759 ‘she has come to have a look at me
she found me perfectly well  and we have kept her till you are back
all are happy and well  and please  don’t be in a hurry to come back  but  if the sport is good  stay another day ’ these two pleasures  his lucky shooting and the letter from his wife  were so great that two slightly disagreeable incidents passed lightly over levin
one was that the chestnut trace horse  who had been unmistakably overworked on the previous day  was off his feed and out of sorts
the coachman said he was ‘overdriven yesterday  konstantin dmitrievitch
yes  indeed  driven ten miles with no sense ’ the other unpleasant incident  which for the first minute destroyed his good humor  though later he laughed at it a great deal  was to find that of all the provisions kitty had provided in such abundance that one would have thought there was enough for a week  nothing was left
on his way back  tired and hungry from shooting  levin had so distinct a vision of meat pies that as he approached the hut he seemed to smell and taste them  as laska had smelt the game  and he immediately told philip to give him some
it appeared that there were no pies left  nor even any chicken
anna karenina 1291 of 1759 ‘well  this fellow’s appetite ’ said stepan arkadyevitch  laughing and pointing at vassenka veslovsky
‘i never suffer from loss of appetite  but he’s really marvelous   ’ ‘well  it can’t be helped ’ said levin  looking gloomily at veslovsky
‘well  philip  give me some beef  then ’ ‘the beef’s been eaten  and the bones given to the dogs ’ answered philip
levin was so hurt that he said  in a tone of vexation  ‘you might have left me something ’ and he felt ready to cry
‘then put away the game ’ he said in a shaking voice to philip  trying not to look at vassenka  ‘and cover them with some nettles
and you might at least ask for some milk for me ’ but when he had drunk some milk  he felt ashamed immediately at having shown his annoyance to a stranger  and he began to laugh at his hungry mortification
in the evening they went shooting again  and veslovsky had several successful shots  and in the night they drove home
their homeward journey was as lively as their drive out had been
veslovsky sang songs and related with enjoyment his adventures with the peasants  who had regaled him with vodka  and said to him  ‘excuse our anna karenina 1292 of 1759 homely ways ’ and his night’s adventures with kiss in thering and the servant girl and the peasant  who had asked him was he married  and on learning that he was not  said to him  ‘well  mind you don’t run after other men’s wives—you’d better get one of your own ’ these words had particularly amused veslovsky
‘altogether  i’ve enjoyed our outing awfully
and you  levin ’ ‘i have  very much ’ levin said quite sincerely
it was particularly delightful to him to have got rid of the hostility he had been feeling towards vassenka veslovsky at home  and to feel instead the most friendly disposition to him
anna karenina 1293 of 1759 next day at ten o’clock levin  who had already gone his rounds  knocked at the room where vassenka had been put for the night
‘entrez ’ veslovsky called to him
‘excuse me  i’ve only just finished my ablutions ’ he said  smiling  standing before him in his underclothes only
‘don’t mind me  please ’ levin sat down in the window
‘have you slept well ’ ‘like the dead
what sort of day is it for shooting ’ ‘what will you take  tea or coffee ’ ‘neither
i’ll wait till lunch
i’m really ashamed
i suppose the ladies are down  a walk now would be capital
you show me your horses ’ after walking about the garden  visiting the stable  and even doing some gymnastic exercises together on the parallel bars  levin returned to the house with his guest  and went with him into the drawing room
‘we had splendid shooting  and so many delightful experiences ’ said veslovsky  going up to kitty  who was sitting at the samovar
‘what a pity ladies are cut off from these delights ’ anna karenina 1294 of 1759 ‘well  i suppose he must say something to the lady of the house ’ levin said to himself again he fancied something in the smile  in the all conquering air with which their guest addressed kitty   
the princess  sitting on the other side of the table with marya vlasyevna and stepan arkadyevitch  called levin to her side  and began to talk to him about moving to moscow for kitty’s confinement  and getting ready rooms for them just as levin had disliked all the trivial preparations for his wedding  as derogatory to the grandeur of the event  now he felt still more offensive the preparations for the approaching birth  the date of which they reckoned  it seemed  on their fingers
he tried to turn a deaf ear to these discussions of the best patterns of long clothes for the coming baby  tried to turn away and avoid seeing the mysterious  endless strips of knitting  the triangles of linen  and so on  to which dolly attached special importance
the birth of a son (he was certain it would be a son) which was promised him  but which he still could not believe in—so marvelous it seemed— presented itself to his mind  on one hand  as a happiness so immense  and therefore so incredible  on the other  as an event so mysterious  that this assumption of a definite knowledge of what would be  and consequent preparation anna karenina 1295 of 1759 for it  as for something ordinary that did happen to people  jarred on him as confusing and humiliating
but the princess did not understand his feelings  and put down his reluctance to think and talk about it to carelessness and indifference  and so she gave him no peace
she had commissioned stepan arkadyevitch to look at a fiat  and now she called levin up
‘i know nothing about it  princess
do as you think fit ’ he said
‘you must decide when you will move ’ ‘i really don’t know
i know millions of children are born away from moscow  and doctors   why  ’ ‘but if so  ’ ‘oh  no  as kitty wishes ’ ‘we can’t talk to kitty about it  do you want me to frighten her  why  this spring natalia golitzina died from having an ignorant doctor ’ ‘i will do just what you say ’ he said gloomily
the princess began talking to him  but he did not hear her
though the conversation with the princess had indeed jarred upon him  he was gloomy  not on account of that conversation  but from what he saw at the samovar
anna karenina 1296 of 1759 ‘no  it’s impossible ’ he thought  glancing now and then at vassenka bending over kitty  telling her something with his charming smile  and at her  flushed and disturbed
there was something not nice in vassenka’s attitude  in his eyes  in his smile
levin even saw something not nice in kitty’s attitude and look
and again the light died away in his eyes
again  as before  all of a sudden  without the slightest transition  he felt cast down from a pinnacle of happiness  peace  and dignity  into an abyss of despair  rage  and humiliation
again everything and everyone had become hateful to him
‘you do just as you think best  princess ’ he said again  looking round
‘heavy is the cap of monomach ’ stepan arkadyevitch said playfully  hinting  evidently  not simply at the princess’s conversation  but at the cause of levin’s agitation  which he had noticed
‘how late you are today  dolly ’ everyone got up to greet darya alexandrovna
vassenka only rose for an instant  and with the lack of courtesy to ladies characteristic of the modern young man  he scarcely bowed  and resumed his conversation again  laughing at something
anna karenina 1297 of 1759 ‘i’ve been worried about masha
she did not sleep well  and is dreadfully tiresome today ’ said dolly
the conversation vassenka had started with kitty was running on the same lines as on the previous evening  discussing anna  and whether love is to be put higher than worldly considerations
kitty disliked the conversation  and she was disturbed both by the subject and the tone in which it was conducted  and also by the knowledge of the effect it would have on her husband
but she was too simple and innocent to know how to cut short this conversation  or even to conceal the superficial pleasure afforded her by the young man’s very obvious admiration
she wanted to stop it  but she did not know what to do
whatever she did she knew would be observed by her husband  and the worst interpretation put on it
and  in fact  when she asked dolly what was wrong with masha  and vassenka  waiting till this uninteresting conversation was over  began to gaze indifferently at dolly  the question struck levin as an unnatural and disgusting piece of hypocrisy
‘what do you say  shall we go and look for mushrooms today ’ said dolly ‘by all means  please  and i shall come too ’ said kitty  and she blushed
she wanted from politeness to ask anna karenina 1298 of 1759 vassenka whether he would come  and she did not ask him
‘where are you going  kostya ’ she asked her husband with a guilty face  as he passed by her with a resolute step
this guilty air confirmed all his suspicions
‘the mechanician came when i was away  i haven’t seen him yet ’ he said  not looking at her
he went downstairs  but before he had time to leave his study he heard his wife’s familiar footsteps running with reckless speed to him
‘what do you want ’ he said to her shortly
‘we are busy ’ ‘i beg your pardon ’ she said to the german mechanician  ‘i want a few words with my husband ’ the german would have left the room  but levin said to him  ‘don’t disturb yourself ’ ‘the train is at three ’ queried the german
‘i mustn’t be late ’ levin did not answer him  but walked out himself with his wife ‘well  what have you to say to me ’ he said to her in french
anna karenina 1299 of 1759 he did not look her in the face  and did not care to see that she in her condition was trembling all over  and had a piteous  crushed look
‘i   i want to say that we can’t go on like this  that this is misery   ’ she said
‘the servants are here at the sideboard ’ he said angrily  ‘don’t make a scene ’ ‘well  let’s go in here ’ they were standing in the passage
kitty would have gone into the next room  but there the english governess was giving tanya a lesson
‘well  come into the garden ’ in the garden they came upon a peasant weeding the path
and no longer considering that the peasant could see her tear stained and his agitated face  that they looked like people fleeing from some disaster  they went on with rapid steps  feeling that they must speak out and clear up misunderstandings  must be alone together  and so get rid of the misery they were both feeling
‘we can’t go on like this  it’s misery  i am wretched  you are wretched what for ’ she said  when they had at last reached a solitary garden seat at a turn in the lime tree avenue
anna karenina 1300 of 1759 ‘but tell me one thing  was there in his tone anything unseemly  not nice  humiliatingly horrible ’ he said  standing before her again in the same position with his clenched fists on his chest  as he had stood before her that night
‘yes ’ she said in a shaking voice  ‘but  kostya  surely you see i’m not to blame  all the morning i’ve been trying to take a tone   but such people    why did he come  how happy we were ’ she said  breathless with the sobs that shook her
although nothing had been pursuing them  and there was nothing to run away from  and they could not possibly have found anything very delightful on that garden seat  the gardener saw with astonishment that they passed him on their way home with comforted and radiant faces
anna karenina 1301 of 1759 after escorting his wife upstairs  levin went to dolly’s part of the house
darya alexandrovna  for her part  was in great distress too that day
she was walking about the room  talking angrily to a little girl  who stood in the corner roaring
‘and you shall stand all day in the corner  and have your dinner all alone  and not see one of your dolls  and i won’t make you a new frock ’ she said  not knowing how to punish her
‘oh  she is a disgusting child ’ she turned to levin
‘where does she get such wicked propensities ’ ‘why  what has she done ’ levin said without much interest  for he had wanted to ask her advice  and so was annoyed that he had come at an unlucky moment
‘grisha and she went into the raspberries  and there   i can’t tell you really what she did
it’s a thousand pities miss elliot’s not with us
this one sees to nothing—she’s a machine   
figurez vous que la petite   ’ and darya alexandrovna described masha’s crime
‘that proves nothing  it’s not a question of evil propensities at all  it’s simply mischief ’ levin assured her
anna karenina 1302 of 1759 ‘but you are upset about something  what have you come for ’ asked dolly
‘what’s going on there ’ and in the tone of her question levin heard that it would be easy for him to say what he had meant to say
‘i’ve not been in there  i’ve been alone in the garden with kitty
we’ve had a quarrel for the second time since   stiva came ’ dolly looked at him with her shrewd  comprehending eyes
‘come  tell me  honor bright  has there been   not in kitty  but in that gentleman’s behavior  a tone which might be unpleasant— not unpleasant  but horrible  offensive to a husband ’ ‘you mean  how shall i say   
stay  stay in the corner ’ she said to masha  who  detecting a faint smile in her mother’s face  had been turning round
‘the opinion of the world would be that he is behaving as young men do behave
il fait la cour a une jeune et jolie femme  and a husband who’s a man of the world should only be flattered by it ’ ‘yes  yes ’ said levin gloomily  ‘but you noticed it ’ ‘not only i  but stiva noticed it
just after breakfast he said to me in so many words  je crois que veslovsky fait un petit brin de cour a kitty ’ anna karenina 1303 of 1759 ‘well  that’s all right then  now i’m satisfied
i’ll send him away ’ said levin
‘what do you mean b are you crazy ’ dolly cried in horror  ‘nonsense  kostya  only think ’ she said  laughing
‘you can go now to fanny ’ she said to masha
‘no  if you wish it  i’ll speak to stiva
he’ll take him away
he can say you’re expecting visitors
altogether he doesn’t fit into the house ’ ‘no  no  i’ll do it myself ’ ‘but you’ll quarrel with him ’ ‘not a bit
i shall so enjoy it ’ levin said  his eyes flashing with real enjoyment
‘come  forgive her  dolly  she won’t do it again ’ he said of the little sinner  who had not gone to fanny  but was standing irresolutely before her mother  waiting and looking up from under her brows to catch her mother’s eye
the mother glanced at her
the child broke into sobs  hid her face on her mother’s lap  and dolly laid her thin  tender hand on her head
‘and what is there in common between us and him ’ thought levin  and he went off to look for veslovsky
as he passed through the passage he gave orders for the carriage to be got ready to drive to the station
‘the spring was broken yesterday ’ said the footman
anna karenina 1304 of 1759 ‘well  the covered trap  then  and make haste
where’s the visitor ’ ‘the gentleman’s gone to his room ’ levin came upon veslovsky at the moment when the latter  having unpacked his things from his trunk  and laid out some new songs  was putting on his gaiters to go out riding
whether there was something exceptional in levin’s face  or that vassenka was himself conscious that ce petit brin de cour he was making was out of place in this family  but he was somewhat (as much as a young man in society can be) disconcerted at levin’s entrance ‘you ride in gaiters ’ ‘yes  it’s much cleaner ’ said vassenka  putting his fat leg on a chair  fastening the bottom hook  and smiling with simple hearted good humor
he was undoubtedly a good natured fellow  and levin felt sorry for him and ashamed of himself  as his host  when he saw the shy look on vassenka’s face on the table lay a piece of stick which they had broken together that morning  trying their strength
levin took the fragment in his hands and began smashing it up  breaking bits off the stick  not knowing how to begin
anna karenina 1305 of 1759 ‘i wanted    ’ he paused  but suddenly  remembering kitty and everything that had happened  he said  looking him resolutely in the face  ‘i have ordered the horses to be put to for you ’ ‘how so ’ vassenka began in surprise
‘to drive where ’ ‘for you to drive to the station ’ levin said gloomily
‘are you going away  or has something happened ’ ‘it happens that i expect visitors ’ said levin  his strong fingers more and more rapidly breaking off the ends of the split stick
‘and i’m not expecting visitors  and nothing has happened  but i beg you to go away
you can explain my rudeness as you like ’ vassenka drew himself up ‘i beg you to explain   ’ he said with dignity  understanding at last
‘i can’t explain ’ levin said softly and deliberately  trying to control the trembling of his jaw  ‘and you’d better not ask ’ and as the split ends were all broken off  levin clutched the thick ends in his finger  broke the stick in two  and carefully caught the end as it fell
probably the sight of those nervous fingers  of the muscles he had proved that morning at gymnastics  of the anna karenina 1306 of 1759 glittering eyes  the soft voice  and quivering jaws  convinced vassenka better than any words
he bowed  shrugging his shoulders  and smiling contemptuously
‘can i not see oblonsky ’ the shrug and the smile did not irritate levin
‘what else was there for him to do ’ he thought
‘i’ll send him to you at once ’ ‘what madness is this ’ stepan arkadyevitch said when  after hearing from his friend that he was being turned out of the house  he found levin in the garden  where he was walking about waiting for his guest’s departure
‘mais c’est ridicule  what fly has stung you  mais c’est du dernier ridicule  what did you think  if a young man  ’ but the place where levin had been stung was evidently still sore  for he turned pale again  when stepan arkadyevitch would have enlarged on the reason  and he himself cut him short ‘please don’t go into it  i can’t help it
i feel ashamed of how i’m treating you and him
but it won’t be  i imagine  a great grief to him to go  and his presence was distasteful to me and to my wife ’ ‘but it’s insulting to him  et puis c’est ridicule ’ anna karenina 1307 of 1759 ‘and to me it’s both insulting and distressing  and i’m not at fault in any way  and there’s no need for me to suffer ’ ‘well  this i didn’t expect of you  on peut etre jaloux  mais a ce point  c’est du dernier ridicule ’ levin turned quickly  and walked away from him into the depths of the avenue  and he went on walking up and down alone
soon he heard the rumble of the trap  and saw from behind the trees how vassenka  sitting in the hay (unluckily there was no seat in the trap) in his scotch cap  was driven along the avenue  jolting up and down over the ruts
‘what’s this ’ levin thought  when a footman ran out of the house and stopped the trap
it was the mechanician  whom levin had totally forgotten
the mechanician  bowing low  said something to veslovsky  then clambered into the trap  and they drove off together
stepan arkadyevitch and the princess were much upset by levin’s action
and he himself felt not only in the highest degree ridicule  but also utterly guilty and disgraced but remembering what sufferings he and his wife had been through  when he asked himself how he should act another time  he answered that he should do just the same again anna karenina 1308 of 1759 in spite of all this  towards the end of that day  everyone except the princess  who could not pardon levin’s action  became extraordinarily lively and good humored  like children after a punishment or grown up people after a dreary  ceremonious reception  so that by the evening vassenka’s dismissal was spoken of  in the absence of the princess  as though it were some remote event
and dolly  who had inherited her father’s gift of humorous storytelling  made varenka helpless with laughter as she related for the third and fourth time  always with fresh humorous additions  how she had only just put on her new shoes for the benefit of the visitor  and on going into the drawing room  heard suddenly the rumble of the trap
and who should be in the trap but vassenka himself  with his scotch cap  and his songs and his gaiters  and all  sitting in the hay ‘if only you’d ordered out the carriage  but no  and then i hear  ‘stop ’ oh  i thought they’ve relented
i look out  and behold a fat german being sat down by him and driving away   
and my new shoes all for nothing   ’ anna karenina 1309 of 1759 darya alexandrovna carried out her intention and went to see anna
she was sorry to annoy her sister and to do anything levin disliked
she quite understood how right the levins were in not wishing to have anything to do with vronsky
but she felt she must go and see anna  and show her that her feelings could not be changed  in spite of the change in her position
that she might be independent of the levins in this expedition  darya alexandrovna sent to the village to hire horses for the drive  but levin learning of it went to her to protest
‘what makes you suppose that i dislike your going  but  even if i did dislike it  i should still more dislike your not taking my horses ’ he said
‘you never told me that you were going for certain
hiring horses in the village is disagreeable to me  and  what’s of more importance  they’ll undertake the job and never get you there
i have horses
and if you don’t want to wound me  you’ll take mine ’ darya alexandrovna had to consent  and on the day fixed levin had ready for his sister in law a set of four horses and relays  getting them together from the farm  anna karenina 1310 of 1759 and saddle horses—not at all a smart looking set  but capable of taking darya alexandrovna the whole distance in a single day
at that moment  when horses were wanted for the princess  who was going  and for the midwife  it was a difficult matter for levin to make up the number  but the duties of hospitality would not let him allow darya alexandrovna to hire horses when staying in his house
moreover  he was well aware that the twenty roubles that would be asked for the journey were a serious matter for her  darya alexandrovna’s pecuniary affairs  which were in a very unsatisfactory state  were taken to heart by the levins as if they were their own
darya alexandrovna  by levin’s advice  started before daybreak
the road was good  the carriage comfortable  the horses trotted along merrily  and on the box  besides the coachman  sat the counting house clerk  whom levin was sending instead of a groom for greater security
darya alexandrovna dozed and waked up only on reaching the inn where the horses were to be changed
after drinking tea at the same well to do peasant’s with whom levin had stayed on the way to sviazhsky’s  and chatting with the women about their children  and with the old man about count vronsky  whom the latter praised very highly  darya alexandrovna  at ten o’clock  anna karenina 1311 of 1759 went on again
at home  looking after her children  she had no time to think
so now  after this journey of four hours  all the thoughts she had suppressed before rushed swarming into her brain  and she thought over all her life as she never had before  and from the most different points of view
her thoughts seemed strange even to herself
at first she thought about the children  about whom she was uneasy  although the princess and kitty (she reckoned more upon her) had promised to look after them
‘if only masha does not begin her naughty tricks  if grisha isn’t kicked by a horse  and lily’s stomach isn’t upset again ’ she thought
but these questions of the present were succeeded by questions of the immediate future
she began thinking how she had to get a new flat in moscow for the coming winter  to renew the drawing room furniture  and to make her elder girl a cloak
then questions of the more remote future occurred to her  how she was to place her children in the world
‘the girls are all right ’ she thought  ‘but the boys ’ ‘it’s very well that i’m teaching grisha  but of course that’s only because i am free myself now  i’m not with child
stiva  of course  there’s no counting on
and with the help of good natured friends i can bring them up  but if there’s another baby coming    ’ and the thought struck anna karenina 1312 of 1759 her how untruly it was said that the curse laid on woman was that in sorrow she should bring forth children
‘the birth itself  that’s nothing  but the months of carrying the child—that’s what’s so intolerable ’ she thought  picturing to herself her last pregnancy  and the death of the last baby
and she recalled the conversation she had just had with the young woman at the inn
on being asked whether she had any children  the handsome young woman had answered cheerfully  ‘i had a girl baby  but god set me free  i buried her last lent ’ ‘well  did you grieve very much for her ’ asked darya alexandrovna
‘why grieve  the old man has grandchildren enough as it is
it was only a trouble
no working  nor nothing
only a tie ’ this answer had struck darya alexandrovna as revolting in spite of the good natured and pleasing face of the young woman  but now she could not help recalling these words
in those cynical words there was indeed a grain of truth
‘yes  altogether ’ thought darya alexandrovna  looking back over her whole existence during those fifteen years of her married life  ‘pregnancy  sickness  mental incapacity  anna karenina 1313 of 1759 indifference to everything  and most of all—hideousness
kitty  young and pretty as she is  even kitty has lost her looks  and i when i’m with child become hideous  i know it
the birth  the agony  the hideous agonies  that last moment   then the nursing  the sleepless nights  the fearful pains   ’ darya alexandrovna shuddered at the mere recollection of the pain from sore breasts which she had suffered with almost every child
‘then the children’s illnesses  that everlasting apprehension  then bringing them up  evil propensities’ (she thought of little masha’s crime among the raspberries)  ‘education  latin—it’s all so incomprehensible and difficult
and on the top of it all  the death of these children ’ and there rose again before her imagination the cruel memory  that always tore her mother’s heart  of the death of her last little baby  who had died of croup  his funeral  the callous indifference of all at the little pink coffin  and her own torn heart  and her lonely anguish at the sight of the pale little brow with its projecting temples  and the open  wondering little mouth seen in the coffin at the moment when it was being covered with the little pink lid with a cross braided on it
‘and all this  what’s it for  what is to come of it all  that i’m wasting my life  never having a moment’s peace  anna karenina 1314 of 1759 either with child  or nursing a child  forever irritable  peevish  wretched myself and worrying others  repulsive to my husband  while the children are growing up unhappy  badly educated  and penniless even now  if it weren’t for spending the summer at the levins’  i don’t know how we should be managing to live
of course kostya and kitty have so much tact that we don’t feel it  but it can’t go on
they’ll have children  they won’t be able to keep us  it’s a drag on them as it is
how is papa  who has hardly anything left for himself  to help us  so that i can’t even bring the children up by myself  and may find it hard with the help of other people  at the cost of humiliation why  even if we suppose the greatest good luck  that the children don’t die  and i bring them up somehow
at the very best they’ll simply be decent people
that’s all i can hope for
and to gain simply that—what agonies  what toil   
one’s whole life ruined ’ again she recalled what the young peasant woman had said  and again she was revolted at the thought  but she could not help admitting that there was a grain of brutal truth in the words
‘is it far now  mihail ’ darya alexandrovna asked the counting house clerk  to turn her mind from thoughts that were frightening her
anna karenina 1315 of 1759 ‘from this village  they say  it’s five miles ’ the carriage drove along the village street and onto a bridge
on the bridge was a crowd of peasant women with coils of ties for the sheaves on their shoulders  gaily and noisily chattering
they stood still on the bridge  staring inquisitively at the carriage
all the faces turned to darya alexandrovna looked to her healthy and happy  making her envious of their enjoyment of life
‘they’re all living  they’re all enjoying life ’ darya alexandrovna still mused when she had passed the peasant women and was driving uphill again at a trot  seated comfortably on the soft springs of the old carriage  ‘while i  let out  as it were from prison  from the world of worries that fret me to death  am only looking about me now for an instant
they all live  those peasant women and my sister natalia and varenka and anna  whom i am going to see—all  but not i
‘and they attack anna
what for  am i any better  i have  anyway  a husband i love—not as i should like to love him  still i do love him  while anna never loved hers
how is she to blame  she wants to live
god has put that in our hearts
very likely i should have done the same
even to this day i don’t feel sure i did right in listening to her at that terrible time when she came to me in moscow
i ought then to have cast off my husband and have begun anna karenina 1316 of 1759 my life fresh
i might have loved and have been loved in reality
and is it any better as it is  i don’t respect him
he’s necessary to me ’ she thought about her husband  ‘and i put up with him
is that any better  at that time i could still have been admired  i had beauty left me still ’ darya alexandrovna pursued her thoughts  and she would have liked to look at herself in the looking glass
she had a traveling looking glass in her handbag  and she wanted to take it out  but looking at the backs of the coachman and the swaying counting house clerk  she felt that she would be ashamed if either of them were to look round  and she did not take out the glass
but without looking in the glass  she thought that even now it was not too late  and she thought of sergey ivanovitch  who was always particularly attentive to her  of stiva’s good hearted friend  turovtsin  who had helped her nurse her children through the scarlatina  and was in love with her
and there was someone else  a quite young man  who—her husband had told her it as a joke— thought her more beautiful than either of her sisters
and the most passionate and impossible romances rose before darya alexandrovna’s imagination
‘anna did quite right  and certainly i shall never reproach her for it
she is happy  she makes another person happy  and she’s not anna karenina 1317 of 1759 broken down as i am  but most likely just as she always was  bright  clever  open to every impression ’ thought darya alexandrovna —and a sly smile curved her lips  for  as she pondered on anna’s love affair  darya alexandrovna constructed on parallel lines an almost identical love affair for herself  with an imaginary composite figure  the ideal man who was in love with her
she  like anna  confessed the whole affair to her husband
and the amazement and perplexity of stepan arkadyevitch at this avowal made her smile
in such daydreams she reached the turning of the highroad that led to vozdvizhenskoe anna karenina 1318 of 1759 the coachman pulled up his four horses and looked round to the right  to a field of rye  where some peasants were sitting on a cart
the counting house clerk was just going to jump down  but on second thoughts he shouted peremptorily to the peasants instead  and beckoned to them to come up
the wind  that seemed to blow as they drove  dropped when the carriage stood still  gadflies settled on the steaming horses that angrily shook them off
the metallic clank of a whetstone against a scythe  that came to them from the cart  ceased
one of the peasants got up and came towards the carriage
‘well  you are slow ’ the counting house clerk shouted angrily to the peasant who was stepping slowly with his bare feet over the ruts of the rough dry road
‘come along  do ’ a curly headed old man with a bit of bast tied round his hair  and his bent back dark with perspiration  came towards the carriage  quickening his steps  and took hold of the mud guard with his sunburnt hand
‘vozdvizhenskoe  the manor house  the count’s ’ he repeated  ‘go on to the end of this track
then turn to the anna karenina 1319 of 1759 left
straight along the avenue and you’ll come right upon it
but whom do you want  the count himself ’ ‘well  are they at home  my good man ’ darya alexandrovna said vaguely  not knowing how to ask about anna  even of this peasant ‘at home for sure ’ said the peasant  shifting from one bare foot to the other  and leaving a distinct print of five toes and a heel in the dust
‘sure to be at home ’ he repeated  evidently eager to talk
‘only yesterday visitors arrived
there’s a sight of visitors come
what do you want ’ he turned round and called to a lad  who was shouting something to him from the cart
‘oh  they all rode by here not long since  to look at a reaping machine
they’ll be home by now
and who will you be belonging to   ’ ‘we’ve come a long way ’ said the coachman  climbing onto the box
‘so it’s not far ’ ‘i tell you  it’s just here
as soon as you get out   ’ he said  keeping hold all the while of the carriage
a healthy looking  broad shouldered young fellow came up too
‘what  is it laborers they want for the harvest ’ he asked
‘i don’t know  my boy ’ anna karenina 1320 of 1759 ‘so you keep to the left  and you’ll come right on it ’ said the peasant  unmistakably loth to let the travelers go  and eager to converse
the coachman started the horses  but they were only just turning off when the peasant shouted  ‘stop  hi  friend  stop ’ called the two voices
the coachman stopped
‘they’re coming  they’re yonder ’ shouted the peasant
‘see what a turn out ’ he said  pointing to four persons on horseback  and two in a char a banc  coming along the road
they were vronsky with a jockey  veslovsky and anna on horseback  and princess varvara and sviazhsky in the char a banc
they had gone out to look at the working of a new reaping machine
when the carriage stopped  the party on horseback were coming at a walking pace
anna was in front beside veslovsky
anna  quietly walking her horse  a sturdy english cob with cropped mane and short tail  her beautiful head with her black hair straying loose under her high hat  her full shoulders  her slender waist in her black riding habit  and all the ease and grace of her deportment  impressed dolly
anna karenina 1321 of 1759 for the first minute it seemed to her unsuitable for anna to be on horseback
the conception of riding on horseback for a lady was  in darya alexandrovna’s mind  associated with ideas of youthful flirtation and frivolity  which  in her opinion  was unbecoming in anna’s position
but when she had scrutinized her  seeing her closer  she was at once reconciled to her riding
in spite of her elegance  everything was so simple  quiet  and dignified in the attitude  the dress and the movements of anna  that nothing could have been more natural
beside anna  on a hot looking gray cavalry horse  was vassenka veslovsky in his scotch cap with floating ribbons  his stout legs stretched out in front  obviously pleased with his own appearance darya alexandrovna could not suppress a good humored smile as she recognized him
behind rode vronsky on a dark bay mare  obviously heated from galloping
he was holding her in  pulling at the reins
after him rode a little man in the dress of a jockey
sviazhsky and princess varvara in a new char a banc with a big  raven black trotting horse  overtook the party on horseback
anna’s face suddenly beamed with a joyful smile at the instant when  in the little figure huddled in a corner of the anna karenina 1322 of 1759 old carriage  she recognized dolly
she uttered a cry  started in the saddle  and set her horse into a gallop
on reaching the carriage she jumped off without assistance  and holding up her riding habit  she ran up to greet dolly
‘i thought it was you and dared not think it
how delightful  you can’t fancy how glad i am ’ she said  at one moment pressing her face against dolly and kissing her  and at the next holding her off and examining her with a smile
‘here’s a delightful surprise  alexey ’ she said  looking round at vronsky  who had dismounted  and was walking towards them
vronsky  taking off his tall gray hat  went up to dolly
‘you wouldn’t believe how glad we are to see you ’ he said  giving peculiar significance to the words  and showing his strong white teeth in a smile
vassenka veslovsky  without getting off his horse  took off his cap and greeted the visitor by gleefully waving the ribbons over his head
‘that’s princess varvara ’ anna said in reply to a glance of inquiry from dolly as the char a banc drove up
‘ah ’ said darya alexandrovna  and unconsciously her face betrayed her dissatisfaction
anna karenina 1323 of 1759 princess varvara was her husband’s aunt  and she had long known her  and did not respect her
she knew that princess varvara had passed her whole life toadying on her rich relations  but that she should now be sponging on vronsky  a man who was nothing to her  mortified dolly on account of her kinship with her husband
anna noticed dolly’s expression  and was disconcerted by it
she blushed  dropped her riding habit  and stumbled over it
darya alexandrovna went up to the char a banc and coldly greeted princess varvara
sviazhsky too she knew
he inquired how his queer friend with the young wife was  and running his eyes over the ill matched horses and the carriage with its patched mud guards  proposed to the ladies that they should get into the char a banc
‘and i’ll get into this vehicle ’ he said
‘the horse is quiet  and the princess drives capitally ’ ‘no  stay as you were ’ said anna  coming up  ‘and we’ll go in the carriage ’ and taking dolly’s arm  she drew her away
darya alexandrovna’s eyes were fairly dazzled by the elegant carriage of a pattern she had never seen before  the splendid horses  and the elegant and gorgeous people surrounding her
but what struck her most of all was the change that had taken place in anna  whom she knew so anna karenina 1324 of 1759 well and loved
any other woman  a less close observer  not knowing anna before  or not having thought as darya alexandrovna had been thinking on the road  would not have noticed anything special in anna
but now dolly was struck by that temporary beauty  which is only found in women during the moments of love  and which she saw now in anna’s face
everything in her face  the clearly marked dimples in her cheeks and chin  the line of her lips  the smile which  as it were  fluttered about her face  the brilliance of her eyes  the grace and rapidity of her move meets  the fulness of the notes of her voice  even the manner in which  with a sort of angry friendliness  she answered veslovsky when he asked permission to get on her cob  so as to teach it to gallop with the right leg foremost—it was all peculiarly fascinating  and it seemed as if she were herself aware of it  and rejoicing in it
when both the women were seated in the carriage  a sudden embarrassment came over both of them
anna was disconcerted by the intent look of inquiry dolly fixed upon her
dolly was embarrassed because after sviazhsky’s phrase about ‘this vehicle ’ she could not help feeling ashamed of the dirty old carriage in which anna was sitting with her
the coachman philip and the counting house clerk were experiencing the same sensation
the anna karenina 1325 of 1759 counting house clerk  to conceal his confusion  busied himself settling the ladies  but philip the coachman became sullen  and was bracing himself not to be overawed in future by this external superiority he smiled ironically  looking at the raven horse  and was already deciding in his own mind that this smart trotter in the char a banc was only good for promenage  and wouldn’t do thirty miles straight off in the heat
the peasants had all got up from the cart and were inquisitively and mirthfully staring at the meeting of the friends  making their comments on it
‘they’re pleased  too  haven’t seen each other for a long while ’ said the curly headed old man with the bast round his hair
‘i say  uncle gerasim  if we could take that raven horse now  to cart the corn  that ‘ud be quick work ’ ‘look ee  is that a woman in breeches ’ said one of them  pointing to vassenka veslovsky sitting in a side saddle
‘nay  a man  see how smartly he’s going it ’ ‘eh  lads  seems we’re not going to sleep  then ’ ‘what chance of sleep today ’ said the old man  with a sidelong look at the sun ‘midday’s past  look ee  get your hooks  and come along ’ anna looked at dolly’s thin  care worn face  with its wrinkles filled with dust from the road  and she was on the point of saying what she was thinking  that is  that dolly had got thinner
but  conscious that she herself had grown handsomer  and that dolly’s eyes were telling her so  she sighed and began to speak about herself
‘you are looking at me ’ she said  ‘and wondering how i can be happy in my position  well  it’s shameful to confess  but i  
i’m inexcusably happy
something magical has happened to me  like a dream  when you’re frightened  panic stricken  and all of a sudden you wake up and all the horrors are no more
i have waked up
i have lived through the misery  the dread  and now for a long while past  especially since we’ve been here  i’ve been so happy    ’ she said  with a timid smile of inquiry looking at dolly
‘how glad i am ’ said dolly smiling  involuntarily speaking more coldly than she wanted to
‘i’m very glad for you
why haven’t you written to me ’ ‘why   
because i hadn’t the courage   
you forget my position  ’ anna karenina 1327 of 1759 ‘to me  hadn’t the courage  if you knew how i   i look at  ’ darya alexandrovna wanted to express her thoughts of the morning  but for some reason it seemed to her now out of place to do so
‘but of that we’ll talk later
what’s this  what are all these buildings ’ she asked  wanting to change the conversation and pointing to the red and green roofs that came into view behind the green hedges of acacia and lilac
‘quite a little town ’ but anna did not answer
‘no  no  how do you look at my position  what do you think of it ’ she asked
‘i consider   ’ darya alexandrovna was beginning  but at that instant vassenka veslovsky  having brought the cob to gallop with the right leg foremost  galloped past them  bumping heavily up and down in his short jacket on the chamois leather of the side saddle
‘he’s doing it  anna arkadyevna ’ he shouted
anna did not even glance at him  but again it seemed to darya alexandrovna out of place to enter upon such a long conversation in the carriage  and so she cut short her thought
anna karenina 1328 of 1759 ‘i don’t think anything ’ she said  ‘but i always loved you  and if one loves anyone  one loves the whole person  just as they are and not as one would like them to be   ’ anna  taking her eyes off her friend’s face and dropping her eyelids (this was a new habit dolly had not seen in her before)  pondered  trying to penetrate the full significance of the words
and obviously interpreting them as she would have wished  she glanced at dolly
‘if you had any sins ’ she said  ‘they would all be forgiven you for your coming to see me and these words ’ and dolly saw that tears stood in her eyes
she pressed anna’s hand in silence
‘well  what are these buildings  how many there are of them ’ after a moment’s silence she repeated her question
‘these are the servants’ houses  barns  and stables ’ answered anna
‘and there the park begins
it had all gone to ruin  but alexey had everything renewed
he is very fond of this place  and  what i never expected  he has become intensely interested in looking after it
but his is such a rich nature  whatever he takes up  he does splendidly
so far from being bored by it  he works with passionate interest
he—with his temperament as i know it—he has become careful and businesslike  a first rate manager  he positively reckons every penny in his anna karenina 1329 of 1759 management of the land
but only in that
when it’s a question of tens of thousands  he doesn’t think of money ’ she spoke with that gleefully sly smile with which women often talk of the secret characteristics only known to them—of those they love
‘do you see that big building  that’s the new hospital
i believe it will cost over a hundred thousand  that’s his hobby just now
and do you know how it all came about  the peasants asked him for some meadowland  i think it was  at a cheaper rate  and he refused  and i accused him of being miserly
of course it was not really because of that  but everything together  he began this hospital to prove  do you see  that he was not miserly about money
c’est une petitesse  if you like  but i love him all the more for it
and now you’ll see the house in a moment
it was his grandfather’s house  and he has had nothing changed outside ’ ‘how beautiful ’ said dolly  looking with involuntary admiration at the handsome house with columns  standing out among the different colored greens of the old trees in the garden
‘isn’t it fine  and from the house  from the top  the view is wonderful ’ they drove into a courtyard strewn with gravel and bright with flowers  in which two laborers were at work anna karenina 1330 of 1759 putting an edging of stones round the light mould of a flower bed  and drew up in a covered entry
‘ah  they’re here already ’ said anna  looking at the saddle horses  which were just being led away from the steps
‘it is a nice horse  isn’t it  it’s my cob  my favorite
lead him here and bring me some sugar
where is the count ’ she inquired of two smart footmen who darted out
‘ah  there he is ’ she said  seeing vronsky coming to meet her with veslovsky
‘where are you going to put the princess ’ said vronsky in french  addressing anna  and without waiting for a reply  he once more greeted darya alexandrovna  and this time he kissed her hand
‘i think the big balcony room ’ ‘oh  no  that’s too far off  better in the corner room  we shall see each other more
come  let’s go up ’ said anna  as she gave her favorite horse the sugar the footman had brought her
‘et vous oubliez votre devoir ’ she said to veslovsky  who came out too on the steps
‘pardon  j’en ai tout plein les poches ’ he answered  smiling  putting his fingers in his waistcoat pocket
anna karenina 1331 of 1759 ‘mais vous venez trop tard ’ she said  rubbing her handkerchief on her hand  which the horse had made wet in taking the sugar
anna turned to dolly
‘you can stay some time  for one day only  that’s impossible ’ ‘i promised to be back  and the children   ’ said dolly  feeling embarrassed both because she had to get her bag out of the carriage  and because she knew her face must be covered with dust
‘no  dolly  darling   
well  we’ll see
come along  come along ’ and anna led dolly to her room
that room was not the smart guest chamber vronsky had suggested  but the one of which anna had said that dolly would excuse it
and this room  for which excuse was needed  was more full of luxury than any in which dolly had ever stayed  a luxury that reminded her of the best hotels abroad
‘well  darling  how happy i am ’ anna said  sitting down in her riding habit for a moment beside dolly
‘tell me about all of you
stiva i had only a glimpse of  and he cannot tell one about the children
how is my favorite  tanya  quite a big girl  i expect ’ ‘yes  she’s very tall ’ darya alexandrovna answered shortly  surprised herself that she should respond so coolly anna karenina 1332 of 1759 about her children
‘we are having a delightful stay at the levins’ ’ she added
‘oh  if i had known ’ said anna  ‘that you do not despise me   
you might have all come to us
stiva’s an old friend and a great friend of alexey’s  you know ’ she added  and suddenly she blushed
‘yes  but we are all   ’ dolly answered in confusion
‘but in my delight i’m talking nonsense
the one thing  darling  is that i am so glad to have you ’ said anna  kissing her again
‘you haven’t told me yet how and what you think about me  and i keep wanting to know
but i’m glad you will see me as i am
the chief thing i shouldn’t like would be for people to imagine i want to prove anything
i don’t want to prove anything  i merely want to live  to do no one harm but myself
i have the right to do that  haven’t i  but it is a big subject  and we’ll talk over everything properly later
now i’ll go and dress and send a maid to you ’ anna karenina 1333 of 1759 left alone  darya alexandrovna  with a good housewife’s eye  scanned her room
all she had seen in entering the house and walking through it  and all she saw now in her room  gave her an impression of wealth and sumptuousness and of that modern european luxury of which she had only read in english novels  but had never seen in russia and in the country
everything was new from the new french hangings on the walls to the carpet which covered the whole floor
the bed had a spring mattress  and a special sort of bolster and silk pillowcases on the little pillows
the marble washstand  the dressing table  the little sofa  the tables  the bronze clock on the chimney piece  the window curtains  and the portieres were all new and expensive
the smart maid  who came in to offer her services  with her hair done up high  and a gown more fashionable than dolly’s  was as new and expensive as the whole room
darya alexandrovna liked her neatness  her deferential and obliging manners  but she felt ill at ease with her
she felt ashamed of her seeing the patched dressing jacket that had unluckily been packed by mistake anna karenina 1334 of 1759 for her
she was ashamed of the very patches and darned places of which she had been so proud at home
at home it had been so clear that for six dressing jackets there would be needed twenty four yards of nainsook at sixteen pence the yard  which was a matter of thirty shillings besides the cutting out and making  and these thirty shillings had been saved
but before the maid she felt  if not exactly ashamed  at least uncomfortable
darya alexandrovna had a great sense of relief when annushka  whom she had known for years  walked in
the smart maid was sent for to go to her mistress  and annushka remained with darya alexandrovna
annushka was obviously much pleased at that lady’s arrival  and began to chatter away without a pause
dolly observed that she was longing to express her opinion in regard to her mistress’s position  especially as to the love and devotion of the count to anna arkadyevna  but dolly carefully interrupted her whenever she began to speak about this
‘i grew up with anna arkadyevna  my lady’s dearer to me than anything
well  it’s not for us to judge
and  to be sure  there seems so much love  ’ ‘kindly pour out the water for me to wash now  please ’ darya alexandrovna cut her short anna karenina 1335 of 1759 ‘certainly
we’ve two women kept specially for washing small things  but most of the linen’s done by machinery
the count goes into everything himself ah  what a husband   ’ dolly was glad when anna came in  and by her entrance put a stop to annushka’s gossip
anna had put on a very simple batiste gown
dolly scrutinized that simple gown attentively
she knew what it meant  and the price at which such simplicity was obtained
‘an old friend ’ said anna of annushka
anna was not embarrassed now
she was perfectly composed and at ease
dolly saw that she had now completely recovered from the impression her arrival had made on her  and had assumed that superficial  careless tone which  as it were  closed the door on that compartment in which her deeper feelings and ideas were kept
‘well  anna  and how is your little girl ’ asked dolly
‘annie ’ (this was what she called her little daughter anna ) ‘very well
she has got on wonderfully
would you like to see her  come  i’ll show her to you
we had a terrible bother ’ she began telling her  ‘over nurses
we had an italian wet nurse
a good creature  but so stupid  anna karenina 1336 of 1759 we wanted to get rid of her  but the baby is so used to her that we’ve gone on keeping her still ’ ‘but how have you managed    ’ dolly was beginning a question as to what name the little girl would have  but noticing a sudden frown on anna’s face  she changed the drift of her question
‘how did you manage  have you weaned her yet ’ but anna had understood
‘you didn’t mean to ask that  you meant to ask about her surname
yes  that worries alexey
she has no name—that is  she’s a karenina ’ said anna  dropping her eyelids till nothing could be seen but the eyelashes meeting
‘but we’ll talk about all that later ’ her face suddenly brightening
‘come  i’ll show you her
elle est tres gentille
she crawls now ’ in the nursery the luxury which had impressed dolly in the whole house struck her still more
there were little go carts ordered from england  and appliances for learning to walk  and a sofa after the fashion of a billiard table  purposely constructed for crawling  and swings and baths  all of special pattern  and modern
they were all english  solid  and of good make  and obviously very expensive
the room was large  and very light and lofty
anna karenina 1337 of 1759 when they went in  the baby  with nothing on but her little smock was sitting in a little elbow chair at the table  having her dinner of broth which she was spilling all over her little chest
the baby was being fed  and the russian nursery maid was evidently sharing her meal
neither the wet nurse nor the head nurse were there  they were in the next room  from which came the sound of their conversation in the queer french which was their only means of communication
hearing anna’s voice  a smart  tall  english nurse with a disagreeable face and a dissolute expression walked in at the door  hurriedly shaking her fair curls  and immediately began to defend herself though anna had not found fault with her
at every word anna said  the english nurse said hurriedly several times  ‘yes  my lady ’ the rosy baby with her black eyebrows and hair  her sturdy red little body with tight goose flesh skin  delighted darya alexandrovna in spite of the cross expression with which she stared at the stranger
she positively envied the baby’s healthy appearance
she was delighted  too  at the baby’s crawling
not one of her own children had crawled like that
when the baby was put on the carpet and its little dress tucked up behind  it was wonderfully charming
looking round like some little wild animal at the grown  anna karenina 1338 of 1759 up big people with her bright black eyes  she smiled  unmistakably pleased at their admiring her  and holding her legs sideways  she pressed vigorously on her arms  and rapidly drew her whole back up after  and then made another step forward with her little arms but the whole atmosphere of the nursery  and especially the english nurse  darya alexandrovna did not like at all
it was only on the supposition that no good nurse would have entered so irregular a household as anna’s that darya alexandrovna could explain to herself how anna with her insight into people could take such an unprepossessing  disreputable looking woman as nurse to her child
besides  from a few words that were dropped  darya alexandrovna saw at once that anna  the two nurses  and the child had no common existence  and that the mother’s visit was something exceptional
anna wanted to get the baby her plaything  and could not find it
most amazing of all was the fact that on being asked how many teeth the baby had  anna answered wrong  and knew nothing about the two last teeth
‘i sometimes feel sorry i’m so superfluous here ’ said anna  going out of the nursery and holding up her skirt so anna karenina 1339 of 1759 as to escape the plaything standing in the doorway
‘it was very different with my first child ’ ‘i expected it to be the other way ’ said darya alexandrovna shyly
‘oh  no  by the way  do you know i saw seryozha ’ said anna  screwing up her eyes  as though looking at something far away
‘but we’ll talk about that later
you wouldn’t believe it  i’m like a hungry beggar woman when a full dinner is set before her  and she does not know what to begin on first
the dinner is you  and the talks i have before me with you  which i could never have with anyone else  and i don’t know which subject to begin upon first
mais je ne vous ferai grace de rien
i must have everything out with you ’ ‘oh  i ought to give you a sketch of the company you will meet with us ’ she went on ‘i’ll begin with the ladies
princess varvara—you know her  and i know your opinion and stiva’s about her
stiva says the whole aim of her existence is to prove her superiority over auntie katerina pavlovna  that’s all true  but she’s a good natured woman  and i am so grateful to her
in petersburg there was a moment when a chaperon was absolutely essential for me
then she turned up
but really she is goodnatured
she did a great deal to alleviate my position
i see anna karenina 1340 of 1759 you don’t understand all the difficulty of my position   there in petersburg ’ she added
‘here i’m perfectly at ease and happy
well  of that later on  though
then sviazhsky—he’s the marshal of the district  and he’s a very good sort of a man  but he wants to get something out of alexey
you understand  with his property  now that we are settled in the country  alexey can exercise great influence
then there’s tushkevitch—you have seen him  you know—betsy’s admirer
now he’s been thrown over and he’s come to see us
as alexey says  he’s one of those people who are very pleasant if one accepts them for what they try to appear to be  et puis il est comme il faut  as princess varvara says
then veslovsky   you know him
a very nice boy ’ she said  and a sly smile curved her lips
‘what’s this wild story about him and the levins  veslovsky told alexey about it  and we don’t believe it
il est tres gentil et naif ’ she said again with the same smile
‘men need occupation  and alexey needs a circle  so i value all these people
we have to have the house lively and gay  so that alexey may not long for any novelty
then you’ll see the steward—a german  a very good fellow  and he understands his work
alexey has a very high opinion of him
then the doctor  a young man  not quite a nihilist perhaps  but you know  eats with his anna karenina 1341 of 1759 knife   but a very good doctor
then the architect   
une petite cour ’ ‘here’s dolly for you  princess  you were so anxious to see her ’ said anna  coming out with darya alexandrovna onto the stone terrace where princess varvara was sitting in the shade at an embroidery frame  working at a cover for count alexey kirillovitch’s easy chair
‘she says she doesn’t want anything before dinner  but please order some lunch for her  and i’ll go and look for alexey and bring them all in ’ princess varvara gave dolly a cordial and rather patronizing reception  and began at once explaining to her that she was living with anna because she had always cared more for her than her sister katerina pavlovna  the aunt that had brought anna up  and that now  when every onehad abandoned anna  she thought it her duty to help her in this most difficult period of transition
‘her husband will give her a divorce  and then i shall go back to my solitude  but now i can be of use  and i am doing my duty  however difficult it may be for me—not like some other people
and how sweet it is of you  how right of you to have come  they live like the best of married couples  it’s for god to judge them  not for us
anna karenina 1343 of 1759 and didn’t biryuzovsky and madame avenieva   and sam nikandrov  and vassiliev and madame mamonova  and liza neptunova  
did no one say anything about them  and it has ended by their being received by everyone
and then  c’est un interieur si joli  si comme il faut
touta fait a l’anglaise
on se reunit le matin au breakfast  et puis on se separe
everyone does as he pleases till dinnertime
dinner at seven o’clock
stiva did very rightly to send you
he needs their support
you know that through his mother and brother he can do anything
and then they do so much good
he didn’t tell you about his hospital  ce sera admirable—everything from paris ’ their conversation was interrupted by anna  who had found the men of the party in the billiard room  and returned with them to the terrace
there was still a long time before the dinner hour  it was exquisite weather  and so several different methods of spending the next two hours were proposed
there were very many methods of passing the time at vozdvizhenskoe  and these were all unlike those in use at pokrovskoe
‘une partie de lawn tennis ’ veslovsky proposed  with his handsome smile
‘we’ll be partners again  anna arkadyevna ’ anna karenina 1344 of 1759 ‘no  it’s too hot  better stroll about the garden and have a row in the boat  show darya alexandrovna the river banks ’ vronsky proposed
‘i agree to anything ’ said sviazhsky
‘i imagine that what dolly would like best would be a stroll— wouldn’t you  and then the boat  perhaps ’ said anna
so it was decided
veslovsky and tushkevitch went off to the bathing place  promising to get the boat ready and to wait there for them
they walked along the path in two couples  anna with sviazhsky  and dolly with vronsky
dolly was a little embarrassed and anxious in the new surroundings in which she found herself
abstractly  theoretically  she did not merely justify  she positively approved of anna’s conduct
as is indeed not unfrequent with women of unimpeachable virtue  weary of the monotony of respectable existence  at a distance she not only excused illicit love  she positively envied it
besides  she loved anna with all her heart
but seeing anna in actual life among these strangers  with this fashionable tone that was so new to darya alexandrovna  she felt ill at ease
what she disliked particularly was seeing princess varvara ready anna karenina 1345 of 1759 to overlook everything for the sake of the comforts she enjoyed
as a general principle  abstractly  dolly approved of anna’s action  but to see the man for whose sake her action had been taken was disagreeable to her
moreover  she had never liked vronsky
she thought him very proud  and saw nothing in him of which he could be proud except his wealth
but against her own will  here in his own house  he overawed her more than ever  and she could not be at ease with him
she felt with him the same feeling she had had with the maid about her dressing jacket
just as with the maid she had felt not exactly ashamed  but embarrassed at her darns  so she felt with him not exactly ashamed  but embarrassed at herself
dolly was ill at ease  and tried to find a subject of conversation
even though she supposed that  through his pride  praise of his house and garden would be sure to be disagreeable to him  she did all the same tell him how much she liked his house
‘yes  it’s a very fine building  and in the good oldfashioned style ’ he said
‘i like so much the court in front of the steps
was that always so ’ anna karenina 1346 of 1759 ‘oh  no ’ he said  and his face beamed with pleasure
‘if you could only have seen that court last spring ’ and he began  at first rather diffidently  but more and more carried away by the subject as he went on  to draw her attention to the various details of the decoration of his house and garden
it was evident that  having devoted a great deal of trouble to improve and beautify his home  vronsky felt a need to show off the improvements to a new person  and was genuinely delighted at darya alexandrovna’s praise
‘if you would care to look at the hospital  and are not tired  indeed  it’s not far
shall we go ’ he said  glancing into her face to convince himself that she was not bored ‘are you coming  anna ’ he turned to her
‘we will come  won’t we ’ she said  addressing sviazhsky
‘mais il ne faut pas laisser le pauvre veslovsky et tushkevitch se morfondre la dans le bateau
we must send and tell them ’ ‘yes  this is a monument he is setting up here ’ said anna  turning to dolly with that sly smile of comprehension with which she had previously talked about the hospital
anna karenina 1347 of 1759 ‘oh  it’s a work of real importance ’ said sviazhsky
but to show he was not trying to ingratiate himself with vronsky  he promptly added some slightly critical remarks ‘i wonder  though  count ’ he said  ‘that while you do so much for the health of the peasants  you take so little interest in the schools ’ ‘c’est devenu tellement commun les ecoles ’ said vronsky
‘you understand it’s not on that account  but it just happens so  my interest has been diverted elsewhere
this way then to the hospital ’ he said to darya alexandrovna  pointing to a turning out of the avenue
the ladies put up their parasols and turned into the side path
after going down several turnings  and going through a little gate  darya alexandrovna saw standing on rising ground before her a large pretentious looking red building  almost finished
the iron roof  which was not yet painted  shone with dazzling brightness in the sunshine
beside the finished building another had been begun  surrounded by scaffolding
workmen in aprons  standing on scaffolds  were laying bricks  pouring mortar out of vats  and smoothing it with trowels
‘how quickly work gets done with you ’ said sviazhsky
‘when i was here last time the roof was not on ’ anna karenina 1348 of 1759 ‘by the autumn it will all be ready
iside almost everything is done ’ said anna
‘and what’s this new building ’ ‘that’s the house for the doctor and the dispensary ’ answered vronsky  seeing the architect in a short jacket coming towards him  and excusing himself to the ladies  he went to meet him going round a hole where the workmen were slaking lime  he stood still with the architect and began talking rather warmly
‘the front is still too low ’ he said to anna  who had asked what was the matter
‘i said the foundation ought to be raised ’ said anna
‘yes  of course it would have been much better  anna arkadyevna ’ said the architect  ‘but now it’s too late ’ ‘yes  i take a great interest in it ’ anna answered sviazhsky  who was expressing his surprise at her knowledge of architecture
‘this new building ought to have been in harmony with the hospital
it was an afterthought  and was begun without a plan ’ vronsky  having finished his talk with the architect  joined the ladies  and led them inside the hospital
although they were still at work on the cornices outside and were painting on the ground floor  upstairs anna karenina 1349 of 1759 almost all the rooms were finished going up the broad cast iron staircase to the landing  they walked into the first large room
the walls were stuccoed to look like marble  the huge plate glass windows were already in  only the parquet floor was not yet finished  and the carpenters  who were planing a block of it  left their work  taking off the bands that fastened their hair  to greet the gentry
‘this is the reception room ’ said vronsky
‘here there will be a desk  tables  and benches  and nothing more ’ ‘this way  let us go in here
don’t go near the window ’ said anna  trying the paint to see if it were dry
‘alexey  the paint’s dry already ’ she added
from the reception room they went into the corridor
here vronsky showed them the mechanism for ventilation on a novel system
then he showed them marble baths  and beds with extraordinary springs
then he showed them the wards one after another  the storeroom  the linen room  then the heating stove of a new pattern  then the trolleys  which would make no noise as they carried everything needed along the corridors  and many other things
sviazhsky  as a connoisseur in the latest mechanical improvements  appreciated everything fully
dolly simply wondered at all she had not seen before  and  anxious to anna karenina 1350 of 1759 understand it all  made minute inquiries about everything  which gave vronsky great satisfaction
‘yes  i imagine that this will be the solitary example of a properly fitted hospital in russia ’ said sviazhsky
‘and won’t you have a lying in ward ’ asked dolly
‘that’s so much needed in the country
i have often  ’ in spite of his usual courtesy  vronsky interrupted her
‘this is not a lying in home  but a hospital for the sick  and is intended for all diseases  except infectious complaints ’ he said
‘ah  look at this ’ and he rolled up to darya alexandrovna an invalid chair that had just been ordered for the convalescents
‘look ’ he sat down in the chair and began moving it
‘the patient can’t walk—still too weak  perhaps  or something wrong with his legs  but he must have air  and he moves  rolls himself along   ’ darya alexandrovna was interested by everything she liked everything very much  but most of all she liked vronsky himself with his natural  simple hearted eagerness ‘yes  he’s a very nice  good man ’ she thought several times  not hearing what he said  but looking at him and penetrating into his expression  while she mentally put herself in anna’s place
she liked him so much just now with his eager interest that she saw how anna could be in love with him
anna karenina 1351 of 1759 ‘no  i think the princess is tired  and horses don’t interest her ’ vronsky said to anna  who wanted to go on to the stables  where sviazhsky wished to see the new stallion
‘you go on  while i escort the princess home  and we’ll have a little talk ’ he said  ‘if you would like that ’ he added  turning to her
‘i know nothing about horses  and i shall be delighted ’ answered darya alexandrovna  rather astonished
she saw by vronsky’s face that he wanted something from her
she was not mistaken
as soon as they had passed through the little gate back into the garden  he looked in the direction anna had taken  and having made sure that she could neither hear nor see them  he began  ‘you guess that i have something i want to say to you ’ he said  looking at her with laughing eyes
‘i am not wrong in believing you to be a friend of anna’s ’ he took off his hat  and taking out his handkerchief  wiped his head  which was growing bald
darya alexandrovna made no answer  and merely stared at him with dismay
when she was left alone with anna karenina 1352 of 1759 him  she suddenly felt afraid  his laughing eyes and stern expression scared her
the most diverse suppositions as to what he was about to speak of to her flashed into her brain
‘he is going to beg me to come to stay with them with the children  and i shall have to refuse  or to create a set will receive anna in moscow   
or isn’t it vassenka veslovsky and his relations with anna  or perhaps about kitty  that he feels he was to blame ’ all her conjectures were unpleasant  but she did not guess what he really wanted to talk about to her
‘you have so much influence with anna  she is so fond of you ’ he said  ‘do help me ’ darya alexandrovna looked with timid inquiry into his energetic face  which under the lime trees was continually being lighted up in patches by the sunshine  and then passing into complete shadow again
she waited for him to say more  but he walked in silence beside her  scratching with his cane in the gravel
‘you have come to see us  you  the only woman of anna’s former friends—i don’t count princess varvara— but i know that you have done this not because you regard our position as normal  but because  understanding all the difficulty of the position  you still love her and want anna karenina 1353 of 1759 to be a help to her
have i understood you rightly ’ he asked  looking round at her
‘oh  yes ’ answered darya alexandrovna  putting down her sunshade  ‘but  ’ ‘no ’ he broke in  and unconsciously  oblivious of the awkward position into which he was putting his companion  he stopped abruptly  so that she had to stop short too
‘no one feels more deeply and intensely than i do all the difficulty of anna’s position  and that you may well understand  if you do me the honor of supposing i have any heart
i am to blame for that position  and that is why i feel it ’ ‘i understand ’ said darya alexandrovna  involuntarily admiring the sincerity and firmness with which he said this
‘but just because you feel yourself responsible  you exaggerate it  i am afraid ’ she said
‘her position in the world is difficult  i can well understand ’ ‘in the world it is hell ’ he brought out quickly  frowning darkly
‘you can’t imagine moral sufferings greater than what she went through in petersburg in that fortnight   and i beg you to believe it ’ ‘yes  but here  so long as neither anna   nor you miss society  ’ anna karenina 1354 of 1759 ‘society ’ he said contemptuously  ‘how could i miss society ’ ‘so far—and it may be so always—you are happy and at peace
i see in anna that she is happy  perfectly happy  she has had time to tell me so much already ’ said darya alexandrovna  smiling  and involuntarily  as she said this  at the same moment a doubt entered her mind whether anna really were happy
but vronsky  it appeared  had no doubts on that score
‘yes  yes ’ he said  ‘i know that she has revived after all her sufferings  she is happy
she is happy in the present
but i   
i am afraid of what is before us   i beg your pardon  you would like to walk on ’ ‘no  i don’t mind ’ ‘well  then  let us sit here ’ darya alexandrovna sat down on a garden seat in a corner of the avenue
he stood up facing her
‘i see that she is happy ’ he repeated  and the doubt whether she were happy sank more deeply into darya alexandrovna’s mind
‘but can it last  whether we have acted rightly or wrongly is another question  but the die is cast ’ he said  passing from russian to french  ‘and we are bound together for life
we are united by all the ties of love that we hold most sacred
we have a child  we may anna karenina 1355 of 1759 have other children
but the law and all the conditions of our position are such that thousands of complications arise which she does not see and does not want to see
and that one can well understand
but i can’t help seeing them
my daughter is by law not my daughter  but karenin’s
i cannot bear this falsity ’ he said  with a vigorous gesture of refusal  and he looked with gloomy inquiry towards darya alexandrovna
she made no answer  but simply gazed at him
he went on  ‘one day a son may be born  my son  and he will be legally a karenin  he will not be the heir of my name nor of my property  and however happy we may be in our home life and however many children we may have  there will be no real tie between us
they will be karenins
you can understand the bitterness and horror of this position  i have tried to speak of this to anna
it irritates her
she does not understand  and to her i cannot speak plainly of all this
now look at another side
i am happy  happy in her love  but i must have occupation
i have found occupation  and am proud of what i am doing and consider it nobler than the pursuits of my former companions at court and in the army
and most certainly i would not change the work i am doing for theirs
i am anna karenina 1356 of 1759 working here  settled in my own place  and i am happy and contented  and we need nothing more to make us happy
i love my work here
ce n’est pas un pis aller  on the contrary  ’ darya alexandrovna noticed that at this point in his explanation he grew confused  and she did not quite understand this digression  but she felt that having once begun to speak of matters near his heart  of which he could not speak to anna  he was now making a clean breast of everything  and that the question of his pursuits in the country fell into the same category of matters near his heart  as the question of his relations with anna
‘well  i will go on ’ he said  collecting himself ‘the great thing is that as i work i want to have a conviction that what i am doing will not die with me  that i shall have heirs to come after me —and this i have not
conceive the position of a man who knows that his children  the children of the woman he loves  will not be his  but will belong to someone who hates them and cares nothing about them  it is awful ’ he paused  evidently much moved
‘yes  indeed  i see that
but what can anna do ’ queried darya alexandrovna
anna karenina 1357 of 1759 ‘yes  that brings me to the object of my conversation ’ he said  calming himself with an effort ‘anna can  it depends on her   
even to petition the tsar for legitimization  a divorce is essential
and that depends on anna
her husband agreed to a divorce—at that time your husband had arranged it completely
and now  i know  he would not refuse it
it is only a matter of writing to him
he said plainly at that time that if she expressed the desire  he would not refuse
of course ’ he said gloomily  ‘it is one of those pharisaical cruelties of which only such heartless men are capable
he knows what agony any recollection of him must give her  and knowing her  he must have a letter from her
i can understand that it is agony to her
but the matter is of such importance  that one must passer par dessus toutes ces finesses de sentiment
il y va du bonheur et de l’existence d’anne et de ses enfants
i won’t speak of myself  though it’s hard for me  very hard ’ he said  with an expression as though he were threatening someone for its being hard for him
‘and so it is  princess  that i am shamelessly clutching at you as an anchor of salvation
help me to persuade her to write to him and ask for a divorce ’ ‘yes  of course ’ darya alexandrovna said dreamily  as she vividly recalled her last interview with alexey anna karenina 1358 of 1759 alexandrovitch
‘yes  of course ’ she repeated with decision  thinking of anna
‘use your influence with her  make her write
i don’t like—i’m almost unable to speak about this to her ’ ‘very well  i will talk to her
but how is it she does not think of it herself ’ said darya alexandrovna  and for some reason she suddenly at that point recalled anna’s strange new habit of half closing her eyes
and she remembered that anna drooped her eyelids just when the deeper questions of life were touched upon
‘just as though she half shut her eyes to her own life  so as not to see everything ’ thought dolly
‘yes  indeed  for my own sake and for hers i will talk to her ’ dolly said in reply to his look of gratitude
they got up and walked to the house
when anna found dolly at home before her  she looked intently in her eyes  as though questioning her about the talk she had had with vronsky  but she made no inquiry in words
‘i believe it’s dinner time ’ she said
‘we’ve not seen each other at all yet
i am reckoning on the evening
now i want to go and dress
i expect you do too  we all got splashed at the buildings ’ dolly went to her room and she felt amused
to change her dress was impossible  for she had already put on her best dress
but in order to signify in some way her preparation for dinner  she asked the maid to brush her dress  changed her cuffs and tie  and put some lace on her head
‘this is all i can do ’ she said with a smile to anna  who came in to her in a third dress  again of extreme simplicity
‘yes  we are too formal here ’ she said  as it were apologizing for her magnificence
‘alexey is delighted at your visit  as he rarely is at anything
he has completely lost his heart to you ’ she added
‘you’re not tired ’ anna karenina 1360 of 1759 there was no time for talking about anything before dinner
going into the drawing room they found princess varvara already there  and the gentlemen of the party in black frock coats
the architect wore a swallow tail coat
vronsky presented the doctor and the steward to his guest
the architect he had already introduced to her at the hospital
a stout butler  resplendent with a smoothly shaven round chin and a starched white cravat  announced that dinner was ready  and the ladies got up
vronsky asked sviazhsky to take in anna arkadyevna  and himself offered his arm to dolly veslovsky was before tushkevitch in offering his arm to princess varvara  so that tushkevitch with the steward and the doctor walked in alone
the dinner  the dining room  the service  the waiting at table  the wine  and the food  were not simply in keeping with the general tone of modern luxury throughout all the house  but seemed even more sumptuous and modern
darya alexandrovna watched this luxury which was novel to her  and as a good housekeeper used to managing a household—although she never dreamed of adapting anything she saw to her own household  as it was all in a style of luxury far above her own manner of living—she could not help scrutinizing anna karenina 1361 of 1759 every detail  and wondering how and by whom it was all done
vassenka veslovsky  her husband  and even sviazhsky  and many other people she knew  would never have considered this question  and would have readily believed what every well bred host tries to make his guests feel  that is  that all that is well ordered in his house has cost him  the host  no trouble whatever  but comes of itself
darya alexandrovna was well aware that even porridge for the children’s breakfast does not come of itself  and that therefore  where so complicated and magnificent a style of luxury was maintained  someone must give earnest attention to its organization
and from the glance with which alexey kirillovitch scanned the table  from the way he nodded to the butler  and offered darya alexandrovna her choice between cold soup and hot soup  she saw that it was all organized and maintained by the care of the master of the house himself it was evident that it all rested no more upon anna than upon veslovsky
she  sviazhsky  the princess  and veslovsky  were equally guests  with light hearts enjoying what had been arranged for them
anna was the hostess only in conducting the conversation
the conversation was a difficult one for the lady of the house at a small table with persons present  like anna karenina 1362 of 1759 the steward and the architect  belonging to a completely different world  struggling not to be overawed by an elegance to which they were unaccustomed  and unable to sustain a large share in the general conversation
but this difficult conversation anna directed with her usual tact and naturalness  and indeed she did so with actual enjoyment  as darya alexandrovna observed
the conversation began about the row tushkevitch and veslovsky had taken alone together in the boat  and tushkevitch began describing the last boat races in petersburg at the yacht club
but anna  seizing the first pause  at once turned to the architect to draw him out of his silence
‘nikolay ivanitch was struck ’ she said  meaning sviazhsky  ‘at the progress the new building had made since he was here last  but i am there every day  and every day i wonder at the rate at which it grows ’ ‘it’s first rate working with his excellency ’ said the architect with a smile (he was respectful and composed  though with a sense of his own dignity)
‘it’s a very different matter to have to do with the district authorities
where one would have to write out sheaves of papers  here i call upon the count  and in three words we settle the business ’ anna karenina 1363 of 1759 ‘the american way of doing business ’ said sviazhsky  with a smile
‘yes  there they build in a rational fashion  ’ the conversation passed to the misuse of political power in the united states  but anna quickly brought it round to another topic  so as to draw the steward into talk
‘have you ever seen a reaping machine ’ she said  addressing darya alexandrovna
‘we had just ridden over to look at one when we met
it’s the first time i ever saw one ’ ‘how do they work ’ asked dolly
‘exactly like little scissors
a plank and a lot of little scissors
like this ’ anna took a knife and fork in her beautiful white hands covered with rings  and began showing how the machine worked
it was clear that she saw nothing would be understood from her explanation  but aware that her talk was pleasant and her hands beautiful she went on explaining
‘more like little penknives ’ veslovsky said playfully  never taking his eyes off her
anna gave a just perceptible smile  but made no answer
‘isn’t it true  karl fedoritch  that it’s just like little scissors ’ she said to the steward
anna karenina 1364 of 1759 ‘oh  ja ’ answered the german
‘es it ein ganz einfaches ding ’ and he began to explain the construction of the machine
‘it’s a pity it doesn’t bind too
i saw one at the vienna exhibition  which binds with a wire ’ said sviazhsky
‘they would be more profitable in use ’ ‘es kommt drauf an   
der preis vom draht muss ausgerechnet werden ’ and the german  roused from his taciturnity  turned to vronsky
‘das laesst sich ausrechnen  erlaucht ’ the german was just feeling in the pocket where were his pencil and the notebook he always wrote in  but recollecting that he was at a dinner  and observing vronsky’s chilly glance  he checked himself ‘zu compliziert  macht zu viel klopot ’ he concluded
‘wuenscht man dochots  so hat man auch klopots ’ said vassenka veslovsky  mimicking the german
‘j’adore l’allemand ’ he addressed anna again with the same smile
‘cessez ’ she said with playful severity
‘we expected to find you in the fields  vassily semyonitch ’ she said to the doctor  a sickly looking man  ‘have you been there ’ ‘i went there  but i had taken flight ’ the doctor answered with gloomy jocoseness
‘then you’ve taken a good constitutional ’ anna karenina 1365 of 1759 ‘splendid ’ ‘well  and how was the old woman  i hope it’s not typhus ’ ‘typhus it is not  but it’s taking a bad turn ’ ‘what a pity ’ said anna  and having thus paid the dues of civility to her domestic circle  she turned to her own friends
‘it would be a hard task  though  to construct a machine from your description  anna arkadyevna ’ sviazhsky said jestingly
‘oh  no  why so ’ said anna with a smile that betrayed that she knew there was something charming in her disquisitions upon the machine that had been noticed by sviazhsky
this new trait of girlish coquettishness made an unpleasant impression on dolly
‘but anna arkadyevna’s knowledge of architecture is marvelous ’ said tushkevitch
‘to be sure  i heard anna arkadyevna talking yesterday about plinths and damp courses ’ said veslovsky
‘have i got it right ’ ‘there’s nothing marvelous about it  when one sees and hears so much of it ’ said anna
‘but  i dare say  you don’t even know what houses are made of ’ anna karenina 1366 of 1759 darya alexandrovna saw that anna disliked the tone of raillery that existed between her and veslovsky  but fell in with it against her will
vronsky acted in this matter quite differently from levin
he obviously attached no significance to veslovsky’s chattering  on the contrary  he encouraged his jests
‘come now  tell us  veslovsky  how are the stones held together ’ ‘by cement  of course ’ ‘bravo  and what is cement ’ ‘oh  some sort of paste    no  putty ’ said veslovsky  raising a general laugh
the company at dinner  with the exception of the doctor  the architect  and the steward  who remained plunged in gloomy silence  kept up a conversation that never paused  glancing off one subject  fastening on another  and at times stinging one or the other to the quick
once darya alexandrovna felt wounded to the quick  and got so hot that she positively flushed and wondered afterwards whether she had said anything extreme or unpleasant
sviazhsky began talking of levin  describing his strange view that machinery is simply pernicious in its effects on russian agriculture
anna karenina 1367 of 1759 ‘i have not the pleasure of knowing this m
levin ’ vronsky said  smiling  ‘but most likely he has never seen the machines he condemns  or if he has seen and tried any  it must have been after a queer fashion  some russian imitation  not a machine from abroad
what sort of views can anyone have on such a subject ’ ‘turkish views  in general ’ veslovsky said  turning to anna with a smile
‘i can’t defend his opinions ’ darya alexandrovna said  firing up  ‘but i can say that he’s a highly cultivated man  and if he were here he would know very well how to answer you  though i am not capable of doing so ’ ‘i like him extremely  and we are great friends ’ sviazhsky said  smiling good naturedly
‘mais pardon  il est un petit peu toque  he maintains  for instance  that district councils and arbitration boards are all of no use  and he is unwilling to take part in anything ’ ‘it’s our russian apathy ’ said vronsky  pouring water from an iced decanter into a delicate glass on a high stem  ‘we’ve no sense of the duties our privileges impose upon us  and so we refuse to recognize these duties ’ ‘i know no man more strict in the performance of his duties ’ said darya alexandrovna  irritated by vronsky’s tone of superiority
anna karenina 1368 of 1759 ‘for my part ’ pursued vronsky  who was evidently for some reason or other keenly affected by this conversation  ‘such as i am  i am  on the contrary  extremely grateful for the honor they have done me  thanks to nikolay ivanitch’ (he indicated sviazhsky)  ‘in electing me a justice of the peace
i consider that for me the duty of being present at the session  of judging some peasants’ quarrel about a horse  is as important as anything i can do
and i shall regard it as an honor if they elect me for the district council
it’s only in that way i can pay for the advantages i enjoy as a landowner
unluckily they don’t understand the weight that the big landowners ought to have in the state ’ it was strange to darya alexandrovna to hear how serenely confident he was of being right at his own table
she thought how levin  who believed the opposite  was just as positive in his opinions at his own table
but she loved levin  and so she was on his side
‘so we can reckon upon you  count  for the coming elections ’ said sviazhsky
‘but you must come a little beforehand  so as to be on the spot by the eighth
if you would do me the honor to stop with me ’ ‘i rather agree with your beau frere ’ said anna  ‘though not quite on the same ground as he ’ she added with a smile
‘i’m afraid that we have too many of these anna karenina 1369 of 1759 public duties in these latter days
just as in old days there were so many government functionaries that one had to call in a functionary for every single thing  so now everyone’s doing some sort of public duty
alexey has been here now six months  and he’s a member  i do believe  of five or six different public bodies
du train que cela va  the whole time will be wasted on it
and i’m afraid that with such a multiplicity of these bodies  they’ll end in being a mere form
how many are you a member of  nikolay ivanitch ’ she turned to sviazhsky—‘over twenty  i fancy ’ anna spoke lightly  but irritation could be discerned in her tone
darya alexandrovna  watching anna and vronsky attentively  detected it instantly
she noticed  too  that as she spoke vronsky’s face had immediately taken a serious and obstinate expression
noticing this  and that princess varvara at once made haste to change the conversation by talking of petersburg acquaintances  and remembering what vronsky had without apparent connection said in the garden of his work in the country  dolly surmised that this question of public activity was connected with some deep private disagreement between anna and vronsky
anna karenina 1370 of 1759 the dinner  the wine  the decoration of the table were all very good  but it was all like what darya alexandrovna had seen at formal dinners and balls which of late years had become quite unfamiliar to her  it all had the same impersonal and constrained character  and so on an ordinary day and in a little circle of friends it made a disagreeable impression on her
after dinner they sat on the terrace  then they proceeded to play lawn tennis
the players  divided into two parties  stood on opposite sides of a tightly drawn net with gilt poles on the carefully leveled and rolled croquetground
darya alexandrovna made an attempt to play  but it was a long time before she could understand the game  and by the time she did understand it  she was so tired that she sat down with princess varvara and simply looked on at the players
her partner  tushkevitch  gave up playing too  but the others kept the game up for a long time
sviazhsky and vronsky both played very well and seriously
they kept a sharp lookout on the balls served to them  and without haste or getting in each other’s way  they ran adroitly up to them  waited for the rebound  and neatly and accurately returned them over the net
veslovsky played worse than the others
he was too eager  but he kept the players lively with his high spirits
his anna karenina 1371 of 1759 laughter and outcries never paused
like the other men of the party  with the ladies’ permission  he took off his coat  and his solid  comely figure in his white shirt sleeves  with his red perspiring face and his impulsive movements  made a picture that imprinted itself vividly on the memory
when darya alexandrovna lay in bed that night  as soon as she closed her eyes  she saw vassenka veslovsky flying about the croquet ground
during the game darya alexandrovna was not enjoying herself
she did not like the light tone of raillery that was kept up all the time between vassenka veslovsky and anna  and the unnaturalness altogether of grown up people  all alone without children  playing at a child’s game
but to avoid breaking up the party and to get through the time somehow  after a rest she joined the game again  and pretended to be enjoying it
all that day it seemed to her as though she were acting in a theater with actors cleverer than she  and that her bad acting was spoiling the whole performance
she had come with the intention of staying two days  if all went well
but in the evening  during the game  she made up her mind that she would go home next day
the maternal cares and worries  which she had so hated on the way  now  after a day spent anna karenina 1372 of 1759 without them  struck her in quite another light  and tempted her back to them
when  after evening tea and a row by night in the boat  darya alexandrovna went alone to her room  took off her dress  and began arranging her thin hair for the night  she had a great sense of relief
it was positively disagreeable to her to think that anna was coming to see her immediately
she longed to be alone with her own thoughts
anna karenina 1373 of 1759 dolly was wanting to go to bed when anna came in to see her  attired for the night
in the course of the day anna had several times begun to speak of matters near her heart  and every time after a few words she had stopped  ‘afterwards  by ourselves  we’ll talk about everything
i’ve got so much i want to tell you ’ she said
now they were by themselves  and anna did not know what to talk about she sat in the window looking at dolly  and going over in her own mind all the stores of intimate talk which had seemed so inexhaustible beforehand  and she found nothing
at that moment it seemed to her that everything had been said already
‘well  what of kitty ’ she said with a heavy sigh  looking penitently at dolly
‘tell me the truth  dolly  isn’t she angry with me ’ ‘angry  oh  no ’ said darya alexandrovna  smiling
‘but she hates me  despises me ’ ‘oh  no  but you know that sort of thing isn’t forgiven ’ ‘yes  yes ’ said anna  turning away and looking out of the open window
‘but i was not to blame
and who is to anna karenina 1374 of 1759 blame  what’s the meaning of being to blame  could it have been otherwise  what do you think  could it possibly have happened that you didn’t become the wife of stiva ’ ‘really  i don’t know
but this is what i want you to tell me  ’ ‘yes  yes  but we’ve not finished about kitty
is she happy  he’s a very nice man  they say ’ ‘he’s much more than very nice
i don’t know a better man ’ ‘ah  how glad i am  i’m so glad  much more than very nice ’ she repeated
dolly smiled
‘but tell me about yourself
we’ve a great deal to talk about
and i’ve had a talk with   ’ dolly did not know what to call him
she felt it awkward to call him either the count or alexey kirillovitch
‘with alexey ’ said anna  ‘i know what you talked about
but i wanted to ask you directly what you think of me  of my life ’ ‘how am i to say like that straight off  i really don’t know ’ ‘no  tell me all the same   
you see my life
but you mustn’t forget that you’re seeing us in the summer  when anna karenina 1375 of 1759 you have come to us and we are not alone   
but we came here early in the spring  lived quite alone  and shall be alone again  and i desire nothing better
but imagine me living alone without him  alone  and that will be   i see by everything that it will often be repeated  that he will be half the time away from home ’ she said  getting up and sitting down close by dolly
‘of course ’ she interrupted dolly  who would have answered  ‘of course i won’t try to keep him by force
i don’t keep him indeed
the races are just coming  his horses are running  he will go
i’m very glad
but think of me  fancy my position   
but what’s the use of talking about it ’ she smiled
‘well  what did he talk about with you ’ ‘he spoke of what i want to speak about of myself  and it’s easy for me to be his advocate  of whether there is not a possibility    whether you could not   ’ (darya alexandrovna hesitated) ‘correct  improve your position   
you know how i look at it   
but all the same  if possible  you should get married   ’ ‘divorce  you mean ’ said anna
‘do you know  the only woman who came to see me in petersburg was betsy tverskaya  you know her  of course  au fond  c’est la femme la plus depravee qui existe
she had an intrigue anna karenina 1376 of 1759 with tushkevitch  deceiving her husband in the basest way
and she told me that she did not care to know me so long as my position was irregular
don’t imagine i would compare   i know you  darling
but i could not help remembering   
well  so what did he say to you ’ she repeated
‘he said that he was unhappy on your account and his own
perhaps you will say that it’s egoism  but what a legitimate and noble egoism
he wants first of all to legitimize his daughter  and to be your husband  to have a legal right to you ’ ‘what wife  what slave can be so utterly a slave as i  in my position ’ she put in gloomily
‘the chief thing he desires   he desires that you should not suffer ’ ‘that’s impossible
well ’ ‘well  and the most legitimate desire—he wishes that your children should have a name ’ ‘what children ’ anna said  not looking at dolly  and half closing her eyes
‘annie and those to come  ’ ‘he need not trouble on that score  i shall have no more children ’ ‘how can you tell that you won’t ’ anna karenina 1377 of 1759 ‘i shall not  because i don’t wish it ’ and  in spite of all her emotion  anna smiled  as she caught the naive expression of curiosity  wonder  and horror on dolly’s face
‘the doctor told me after my illness  ’ ‘impossible ’ said dolly  opening her eyes wide
for her this was one of those discoveries the consequences and deductions from which are so immense that all that one feels for the first instant is that it is impossible to take it all in  and that one will have to reflect a great  great deal upon it
this discovery  suddenly throwing light on all those families of one or two children  which had hitherto been so incomprehensible to her  aroused so many ideas  reflections  and contradictory emotions  that she had nothing to say  and simply gazed with wide open eyes of wonder at anna
this was the very thing she had been dreaming of  but now learning that it was possible  she was horrified
she felt that it was too simple a solution of too complicated a problem
‘n’est ce pas immoral ’ was all she said  after a brief pause
‘why so  think  i have a choice between two alternatives  either to be with child  that is an invalid  or to anna karenina 1378 of 1759 be the friend and companion of my husband—practically my husband ’ anna said in a tone intentionally superficial and frivolous
‘yes  yes ’ said darya alexandrovna  hearing the very arguments she had used to herself  and not finding the same force in them as before
‘for you  for other people ’ said anna  as though divining her thoughts  ‘there may be reason to hesitate  but for me   
you must consider  i am not his wife  he loves me as long as he loves me
and how am i to keep his love  not like this ’ she moved her white hands in a curve before her waist with extraordinary rapidity  as happens during moments of excitement  ideas and memories rushed into darya alexandrovna’s head
‘i ’ she thought  ‘did not keep my attraction for stiva  he left me for others  and the first woman for whom he betrayed me did not keep him by being always pretty and lively
he deserted her and took another
and can anna attract and keep count vronsky in that way  if that is what he looks for  he will find dresses and manners still more attractive and charming
and however white and beautiful her bare arms are  however beautiful her full figure and her eager face under her black anna karenina 1379 of 1759 curls  he will find something better still  just as my disgusting  pitiful  and charming husband does ’ dolly made no answer  she merely sighed anna noticed this sigh  indicating dissent  and she went on
in her armory she had other arguments so strong that no answer could be made to them
‘do you say that it’s not right  but you must consider ’ she went on  ‘you forget my position
how can i desire children  i’m not speaking of the suffering  i’m not afraid of that
think only  what are my children to be  ill fated children  who will have to bear a stranger’s name
for the very fact of their birth they will be forced to be ashamed of their mother  their father  their birth ’ ‘but that is just why a divorce is necessary ’ but anna did not hear her
she longed to give utterance to all the arguments with which she had so many times convinced herself
‘what is reason given me for  if i am not to use it to avoid bringing unhappy beings into the world ’ she looked at dolly  but without waiting for a reply she went on  ‘i should always feel i had wronged these unhappy children ’ she said
‘if they are not  at any rate they are not anna karenina 1380 of 1759 unhappy  while if they are unhappy  i alone should be to blame for it ’ these were the very arguments darya alexandrovna had used in her own reflections  but she heard them without understanding them
‘how can one wrong creatures that don’t exist ’ she thought
and all at once the idea struck her  could it possibly  under any circumstances  have been better for her favorite grisha if he had never existed  and this seemed to her so wild  so strange  that she shook her head to drive away this tangle of whirling  mad ideas ‘no  i don’t know  it’s not right ’ was all she said  with an expression of disgust on her face
‘yes  but you mustn’t forget that you and i   
and besides that ’ added anna  in spite of the wealth of her arguments and the poverty of dolly’s objections  seeming still to admit that it was not right  ‘don’t forget the chief point  that i am not now in the same position as you
for you the question is  do you desire not to have any more children  while for me it is  do i desire to have them  and that’s a great difference
you must see that i can’t desire it in my position ’ darya alexandrovna made no reply
she suddenly felt that she had got far away from anna  that there lay anna karenina 1381 of 1759 between them a barrier of questions on which they could never agree  and about which it was better not to speak
anna karenina 1382 of 1759 ‘then there is all the more reason for you to legalize your position  if possible ’ said dolly
‘yes  if possible ’ said anna  speaking all at once in an utterly different tone  subdued and mournful
‘surely you don’t mean a divorce is impossible  i was told your husband had consented to it ’ ‘dolly  i don’t want to talk about that ’ ‘oh  we won’t then ’ darya alexandrovna hastened to say  noticing the expression of suffering on anna’s face
‘all i see is that you take too gloomy a view of things ’ ‘i  not at all  i’m always bright and happy
you see  je fais des passions
veslovsky  ’ ‘yes  to tell the truth  i don’t like veslovsky’s tone ’ said darya alexandrovna  anxious to change the subject
‘oh  that’s nonsense  it amuses alexey  and that’s all  but he’s a boy  and quite under my control
you know  i turn him as i please
it’s just as it might be with your grisha   
dolly ’— she suddenly changed the subject— ‘you say i take too gloomy a view of things
you can’t understand
it’s too awful  i try not to take any view of it at all ’ anna karenina 1383 of 1759 ‘but i think you ought to
you ought to do all you can ’ ‘but what can i do  nothing
you tell me to marry alexey  and say i don’t think about it
i don’t think about it ’ she repeated  and a flush rose into her face
she got up  straightening her chest  and sighed heavily
with her light step she began pacing up and down the room  stopping now and then
‘i don’t think of it  not a day  not an hour passes that i don’t think of it  and blame myself for thinking of it   because thinking of that may drive me mad
drive me mad ’ she repeated
‘when i think of it  i can’t sleep without morphine
but never mind
let us talk quietly
they tell me  divorce
in the first place  he won’t give me a divorce
he’s under the influence of countess lidia ivanovna now ’ darya alexandrovna  sitting erect on a chair  turned her head  following anna with a face of sympathetic suffering
‘you ought to make the attempt ’ she said softly
‘suppose i make the attempt
what does it mean ’ she said  evidently giving utterance to a thought  a thousand times thought over and learned by heart
‘it means that i  hating him  but still recognizing that i have wronged him—and i consider him magnanimous—that i humiliate anna karenina 1384 of 1759 myself to write to him   
well  suppose i make the effort  i do it
either i receive a humiliating refusal or consent   
well  i have received his consent  say   ’ anna was at that moment at the furthest end of the room  and she stopped there  doing something to the curtain at the window
‘i receive his consent  but my   my son  they won’t give him up to me
he will grow up despising me  with his father  whom i’ve abandoned
do you see  i love  
equally  i think  but both more than myself—two creatures  seryozha and alexey ’ she came out into the middle of the room and stood facing dolly  with her arms pressed tightly across her chest i her white dressing gown her figure seemed more than usually grand and broad
she bent her head  and with shining  wet eyes looked from under her brows at dolly  a thin little pitiful figure in her patched dressing jacket and nightcap  shaking all over with emotion
‘it is only those two creatures that i love  and one excludes the other
i can’t have them together  and that’s the only thing i want
and since i can’t have that  i don’t care about the rest
i don’t care about anything  anything
and it will end one way or another  and so i can’t  i don’t like to talk of it
so don’t blame me  don’t judge me for anything
you can’t with your pure heart understand all anna karenina 1385 of 1759 that i’m suffering ’ she went up  sat down beside dolly  and with a guilty look  peeped into her face and took her hand
‘what are you thinking  what are you thinking about me  don’t despise me
i don’t deserve contempt
i’m simply unhappy
if anyone is unhappy  i am ’ she articulated  and turning away  she burst into tears
left alone  darya alexandrovna said her prayers and went to bed
she had felt for anna with all her heart while she was speaking to her  but now she could not force herself to think of her
the memories of home and of her children rose up in her imagination with a peculiar charm quite new to her  with a sort of new brilliance
that world of her own seemed to her now so sweet and precious that she would not on any account spend an extra day outside it  and she made up her mind that she would certainly go back next day
anna meantime went back to her boudoir  took a wine glass and dropped into it several drops of a medicine  of which the principal ingredient was morphine
after drinking it off and sitting still a little while  she went into her bedroom in a soothed and more cheerful frame of mind
anna karenina 1386 of 1759 when she went into the bedroom  vronsky looked intently at her
he was looking for traces of the conversation which he knew that  staying so long in dolly’s room  she must have had with her
but in her expression of restrained excitement  and of a sort of reserve  he could find nothing but the beauty that always bewitched him afresh though he was used to it  the consciousness of it  and the desire that it should affect him
he did not want to ask her what they had been talking of  but he hoped that she would tell him something of her own accord
but she only said  ‘i am so glad you like dolly
you do  don’t you ’ ‘oh  i’ve known her a long while  you know
she’s very good hearted  i suppose  mais excessivement terre aterre
still  i’m very glad to see her ’ he took anna’s hand and looked inquiringly into her eyes
misinterpreting the look  she smiled to him
next morning  in spite of the protests of her hosts  darya alexandrovna prepared for her homeward journey
levin’s coachman  in his by no means new coat and shabby hat  with his ill matched horses and his coach with the patched mud guards  drove with gloomy determination into the covered gravel approach
anna karenina 1387 of 1759 darya alexandrovna disliked taking leave of princess varvara and the gentlemen of the party
after a day spent together  both she and her hosts were distinctly aware that they did not get on together  and that it was better for them not to meet
only anna was sad
she knew that now  from dolly’s departure  no one again would stir up within her soul the feelings that had been roused by their conversation
it hurt her to stir up these feelings  but yet she knew that that was the best part of her soul  and that that part of her soul would quickly be smothered in the life she was leading
as she drove out into the open country  darya alexandrovna had a delightful sense of relief  and she felt tempted to ask the two men how they had liked being at vronsky’s  when suddenly the coachman  philip  expressed himself unasked  ‘rolling in wealth they may be  but three pots of oats was all they gave us everything cleared up till there wasn’t a grain left by cockcrow
what are three pots  a mere mouthful  and oats now down to forty five kopecks
at our place  no fear  all comers may have as much as they can eat ’ ‘the master’s a screw ’ put in the counting house clerk
‘well  did you like their horses ’ asked dolly
anna karenina 1388 of 1759 ‘the horses —there’s no two opinions about them
and the food was good
but it seemed to me sort of dreary there  darya alexandrovna
i don’t know what you thought ’ he said  turning his handsome  good natured face to her
‘i thought so too
well  shall we get home by evening ’ ‘eh  we must ’ on reaching home and finding everyone entirely satisfactory and particularly charming  darya alexandrovna began with great liveliness telling them how she had arrived  how warmly they had received her  of the luxury and good taste in which the vronskys lived  and of their recreations  and she would not allow a word to be said against them
‘one has to know anna and vronsky—i have got to know him better now—to see how nice they are  and how touching ’ she said  speaking now with perfect sincerity  and forgetting the vague feeling of dissatisfaction and awkwardness she had experienced there
anna karenina 1389 of 1759 vronsky and anna spent the whole summer and part of the winter in the country  living in just the same condition  and still taking no steps to obtain a divorce
it was an understood thing between them that they should not go away anywhere  but both felt  the longer they lived alone  especially in the autumn  without guests in the house  that they could not stand this existence  and that they would have to alter it
their life was apparently such that nothing better could be desired
they had the fullest abundance of everything  they had a child  and both had occupation
anna devoted just as much care to her appearance when they had no visitors  and she did a great deal of reading  both of novels and of what serious literature was in fashion
she ordered all the books that were praised in the foreign papers and reviews she received  and read them with that concentrated attention which is only given to what is read in seclusion
moreover  every subject that was of interest to vronsky  she studied in books and special journals  so that he often went straight to her with questions relating to agriculture or architecture  sometimes even with anna karenina 1390 of 1759 questions relating to horse breeding or sport
he was amazed at her knowledge  her memory  and at first was disposed to doubt it  to ask for confirmation of her facts  and she would find what he asked for in some book  and show it to him
the building of the hospital  too  interested her
she did not merely assist  but planned and suggested a great deal herself
but her chief thought was still of herself— how far she was dear to vronsky  how far she could make up to him for all he had given up
vronsky appreciated this desire not only to please  but to serve him  which had become the sole aim of her existence  but at the same time he wearied of the loving snares in which she tried to hold him fast
as time went on  and he saw himself more and more often held fast in these snares  he had an ever growing desire  not so much to escape from them  as to try whether they hindered his freedom had it not been for this growing desire to be free  not to have scenes every time he wanted to go to the town to a meeting or a race  vronsky would have been perfectly satisfied with his life
the role he had taken up  the role of a wealthy landowner  one of that class which ought to be the very heart of the russian aristocracy  was entirely to his taste  and now  after spending six months in that character  he anna karenina 1391 of 1759 derived even greater satisfaction from it
and his management of his estate  which occupied and absorbed him more and more  was most successful
in spite of the immense sums cost him by the hospital  by machinery  by cows ordered from switzerland  and many other things  he was convinced that he was not wasting  but increasing his substance in all matters affecting income  the sales of timber  wheat  and wool  the letting of lands  vronsky was hard as a rock  and knew well how to keep up prices
in all operations on a large scale on this and his other estates  he kept to the simplest methods involving no risk  and in trifling details he was careful and exacting to an extreme degree
in spite of all the cunning and ingenuity of the german steward  who would try to tempt him into purchases by making his original estimate always far larger than really required  and then representing to vronsky that he might get the thing cheaper  and so make a profit  vronsky did not give in
he listened to his steward  crossexamined him  and only agreed to his suggestions when the implement to be ordered or constructed was the very newest  not yet known in russia  and likely to excite wonder
apart from such exceptions  he resolved upon an increased outlay only where there was a surplus  and in making such an outlay he went into the minutest details  anna karenina 1392 of 1759 and insisted on getting the very best for his money  so that by the method on which he managed his affairs  it was clear that he was not wasting  but increasing his substance
in october there were the provincial elections in the kashinsky province  where were the estates of vronsky  sviazhsky  koznishev  oblonsky  and a small part of levin’s land
these elections were attracting public attention from several circumstances connected with them  and also from the people taking part in them there had been a great deal of talk about them  and great preparations were being made for them
persons who never attended the elections were coming from moscow  from petersburg  and from abroad to attend these
vronsky had long before promised sviazhsky to go to them
before the elections sviazhsky  who often visited vozdvizhenskoe  drove over to fetch vronsky on the day before there had been almost a quarrel between vronsky and anna over this proposed expedition
it was the very dullest autumn weather  which is so dreary in the country  and so  preparing himself for a struggle  vronsky  with a hard and cold expression  informed anna of his departure as he had never spoken to her before but  to his surprise  anna accepted the information with great composure  and merely asked anna karenina 1393 of 1759 when he would be back
he looked intently at her  at a loss to explain this composure
she smiled at his look
he knew that way she had of withdrawing into herself  and knew that it only happened when she had determined upon something without letting him know her plans
he was afraid of this  but he was so anxious to avoid a scene that he kept up appearances  and half sincerely believed in what he longed to believe in—her reasonableness
‘i hope you won’t be dull ’ ‘i hope not ’ said anna
‘i got a box of books yesterday from gautier’s
no  i shan’t be dull ’ ‘she’s trying to take that tone  and so much the better ’ he thought  ‘or else it would be the same thing over and over again ’ and he set off for the elections without appealing to her for a candid explanation
it was the first time since the beginning of their intimacy that he had parted from her without a full explanation
from one point of view this troubled him  but on the other side he felt that it was better so
‘at first there will be  as this time  something undefined kept back  and then she will get used to it
i any case i can give up anything for her  but not my masculine independence ’ he thought
