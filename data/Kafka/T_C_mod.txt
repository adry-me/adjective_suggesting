it was late in the evening when k
arrived  the village was j
deep in snow
the castle hill was hidden  veiled in mist and darkness  nor was there even a glimmer of light to show that a castle was there
on the wooden bridge leading from the main road to the village k
stood for a long time gazing into the illusory emptiness above him
then he went on to find quarters for the night
the inn was still awake  and although the landlord could not provide a room and was upset by such a late and unexpected arrival  he was willing to let k
sleep on a bag of straw in the parlour
k
accepted the offer
some peasants were still sitting over their beer  but he did not want to talk  and after himself fetching the bag of straw from the attic  lay down beside the stove it was a warm corner  the peasants were quiet  and letting his weary eyes stray over them he soon fell asleep but very shortly he was awakened
a young man dressed like a townsman  with the face of an actor  his eyes narrow and his eyebrows strongly marked  was standing beside him along with the landlord
the peasants were still in the room  and a few had turned their chairs round so as to see and hear better
the young man apologized very courteously for having awakened k   introducing himself as the son of the castellan  and then said   this village belongs to the castle  and whoever lives here or passes the night here does so in a manner of speaking in the castle itself nobody may do that without the count s permission
but you have no such permit  or at least you have produced none   k
had half raised himself and now  smoothing down his hair and looking up at the two men  he said   what village is this i have wandered into  is there a castle here    most certainly   replied the young man slowly  while here and there a head was shaken over k  s remark   the castle of my lord the count west west    and must one have a permit to sleep here   asked k   as if he wished to assure himself that what he had heard was not a dream  one must have a permit   was the reply  and there was an ironical contempt for k
in the young man s gesture as he stretched out his arm and appealed to the others   or must one not have a permit    well  then  i ll have to go and get one   said k yawning and pushing his blanket away as if to rise up
 and from whom  pray   asked the young man
 from the count   said k    that s the only thing to be done    a permit from the count in the middle of the night   cried the young man  stepping back a pace
 is that impossible   inquired k
coolly
 then why did you waken me   at this the young man flew into a passion
 none of your guttersnipe manners   he cried   i insist on respect for the count s authority i i woke you up to inform you that you must quit the count s territory at once    enough of this fooling   said k
in a markedly quiet voice  laying himself down again and pulling up the blanket  you re going a little too far  my good fellow  and i ll have something to say tomorrow about your conduct
the landlord here and those other gentlemen will bear me out if necessary
let me tell you that i am the land surveyor whom the count is expecting
my assistants are coming on tomorrow in a carriage with the apparatus
i did not want to miss the chance of a walk through the snow  but unfortunately lost my way several times and so arrived very late
that it was too late to present myself at the castle i knew very well before you saw fit to inform me
that is why i have made shift with this bed for the night  where  to put it mildly  you have had the discourtesy to disturb me
that is all i have to say
good night  gentlemen   and k
turned over on his side towards the stove
 land surveyor   he heard the hesitating question behind his back  and then there was a general silence
but the young man soon recovered his assurance  and lowering his voice  sufficiently to appear considerate of k  s sleep while yet speaking loud enough to be clearly heard  said to the landlord   i ll ring up and inquire   so there was a telephone in this village inn  they had everything up to the mark
the particular instance surprised k   but on the whole he had really expected it
it appeared that the telephone was placed almost over his head and in his drowsy condition he had overlooked it
if the young man must needs telephone he could not  even with the best intentions  avoid disturbing k   the only question was whether k
would let him do so  he decided to allow it
in that case  however  there was no sense in pretending to sleep  and so he turned on his back again
he could see the peasants putting their heads together  the arrival of a land surveyor was no small event
the door into the kitchen had been opened  and blocking the whole doorway stood the imposing figure of the landlady  to whom the landlord was advancing on tiptoe in order to tell her what was happening
and now the conversation began on the telephone
the castellan was asleep  but an under castellan  one of the under castellans  a certain herr fritz  was available
the young man  announcing himself as schwarzer  reported that he had found k   a disreputable looking man in the thirties  sleeping calmly on a bag of straw with a minute rucksack for pillow and a knotty stick within reach he had naturally suspected the fellow  and as the landlord had obviously neglected his duty he  schwarzer  had felt bound to investigate the matter
he had roused the man  questioned him  and duly warned him off the count s territory  all of which k
had taken with an ill grace  perhaps with some justification  as it eventually turned out  for he claimed to be a land surveyor engaged by the count
of course  to say the least of it  that was a statement which required official confirmation  and so schwarzer begged herr fritz to inquire in the central bureau if a land surveyor were really expected  and to telephone the answer at once
then there was silence while fritz was making inquiries up there and the young man was waiting for the answer
k
did not change his position  did not even once turn round  seemed quite indifferent and stared into space
schwarzer s report  in its combination of malice and prudence  gave him an idea of the measure of diplomacy in which even underlings in the castle like schwarzer were versed
nor were they remiss in industry  the central office had a night service
and apparently answered questions quickly  too  for fritz was already ringing
his reply seemed brief enough  for schwarzer hung up the receiver immediately  crying angrily   just what i said  not a trace of a land surveyor
a common  lying tramp  and probably worse   for a moment k
thought that all of them  schwarzer  the peasants  the landlord and the landlady  were going to fall upon him in a body  and to escape at least the first shock of their assault he crawled right underneath the blanket
but the telephone rang again  and with a special insistence  it seemed to k
slowly he put out his head
although it was improbable that this message also concerned k   they all stopped short and schwarzer took up the receiver once more
he listened to a fairly long statement  and then said in a low voice   a mistake  is it  i m sorry to hear that
the head of the department himself said so  very queer  very queer how am i to explain it all to the land surveyor   k
pricked up his ears
so the castle had recognized him as the land surveyor
that was unpropitious for him  on the one hand  for it meant that the castle was well informed about him  had estimated all the probable chances  and was taking up the challenge with a smile
on the other hand  however  it was quite propitious  for if his interpretation were right they had underestimated his strength  and he would have more freedom of action than he had dared to hope
and if they expected to cow him by their lofty superiority in recognizing him as land surveyor  they were mistaken  it made his skin prickle a little  that was all
he waved off schwarzer who was timidly approaching him  and refused an urgent invitation to transfer himself into the landlord s own room  he only accepted a warm drink from the landlord and from the landlady a basin to wash in  a piece of soap  and a towel he did not even have to ask that the room should be cleared  for all the men flocked out with averted faces lest he should recognize them again next day
the lamp was blown out  and he was left in peace at last
he slept deeply until morning  scarcely disturbed by rats scuttling past once or twice
after breakfast  which  according to his host  was to be paid for by the castle  together with all the other expenses of his board and lodging  he prepared to go out immediately into the village
but since the landlord  to whom he had been very curt because of his behaviour the preceding night  kept circling around him in dumb entreaty  he took pity on the man and asked him to sit down for a while
 i haven t met the count yet   said k    but he pays well for good work  doesn t he  when a man like me travels so far from home he wants to go back with something in his pockets    there s no need for the gentleman to worry about that kind of thing  nobody complains of being badly paid    well   said k    i m not one of your timid people  and can give a piece of my mind even to a count  but of course it s much better to have everything settled up without any trouble   the landlord sat opposite k
on the rim of the window ledge  not daring to take a more comfortable seat  and kept on gazing at k
with an anxious look in his large brown eyes
he had thrust his company on k
at erst  but now it seemed that he was eager to escape
was he afraid of being cross questioned about the count  was he afraid of some indiscretion on the part of the  gentleman  whom he took k
to be  k
must divert his attention
he looked at the clock  and said   my assistants should be arriving soon
will you be able to put them up here    certainly  sir   he said   but won t they be staying with you up at the castle   was the landlord so willing  then  to give up prospective customers  and k
in particular  whom he so unconditionally transferred to the castle   that s not at all certain yet   said k
 i must first find out what work i am expected to do
if i have to work down here  for instance  it would be more sensible to lodge down here
i m afraid  too  that the life at the castle wouldn t suit me
i like to be my own master    you don t know the castle   said the landlord quietly
 of course   replied k    one shouldn t judge prematurely
all that i know at present about the castle is that the people there know how to choose a good land surveyor
perhaps it has other attractions as well   and he stood up in order to rid the landlord of his presence  since the man was biting his lip uneasily
his confidence was not to be lightly won
as k
was going out he noticed a dark portrait in a dim frame on the wall
he had already observed it from his couch by the stove  but from that distance he had not been able to distinguish any details and had thought that it was only a plain back to the frame
but it was a picture after all  as now appeared  the bust portrait of a man about fifty
his head was sunk so low upon his breast that his eyes were scarcely visible  and the weight of the high  heavy forehead and the strong hooked nose seemed to have borne the head down
because of this pose the man s full beard was pressed in at the chin and spread out farther down
his left hand was buried in his luxuriant hair  but seemed incapable of supporting the head
 who is that   asked k    the count   he was standing before the portrait and did not look round at the landlord
 no   said the latter   the castellan    a handsome castellan  indeed   said k    a pity that he had such an ill bred son    no  no   said the landlord  drawing k
a little towards him and whispering in his ear   schwarzer exaggerated yesterday  his father is only an under castellan  and one of the lowest  too   at that moment the landlord struck k
as a very child
 the villain   said k
with a laugh  but the landlord instead of laughing said   even his father is powerful    get along with you   said k    you think everyone powerful
me too  perhaps    no   he replied  timidly yet seriously   i don t think you powerful    you re a keen observer   said k    for between you and me i m not really powerful
and consequently i suppose i have no less respect for the powerful than you have  only i m not so honest as you and am not always willing to acknowledge it   and k
gave the landlord a tap on the cheek to hearten him and awaken his friendliness
it made him smile a little
he was actually young  with that soft and almost beardless face of his  how had he come to have that massive  elderly wife  who could be seen through a small window bustling about the kitchen with her elbows sticking out  k
did not want to force his confidence any further  however  nor to scare away the smile he had at last evoked
so he only signed to him to open the door  and went out into the brilliant winter morning   now  he could see the castle above him clearly defined in the glittering air  its outline made still more definite by the moulding of snow covering it in a thin layer
there seemed to be much less snow up there on the hill than down in the village  where k
found progress as laborious as on the main road the previous day
here the heavy snowdrifts reached right up to the cottage windows and began again on the low roofs  but up on the hill everything soared light and free into the air  or at least so it appeared from down below
on the whole this distant prospect of the castle satisfied k  s expectations
it was neither an old stronghold nor a new mansion  but a rambling pile consisting of innumerable small buildings closely packed together and of one or two storeys  if k
had not known that it was a castle he might have taken it for a little town
there was only one tower as far as he could see  whether it belonged to a dwelling house or a church he could not determine
swarms of crows were circling round it with his eyes fixed on the castle k
went on farther  thinking of nothing else at all
but on approaching it he was disappointed in the castle  it was after all only a wretched looking town  a huddle of village houses  whose sole merit  if any  lay in being built of stone  but the plaster had long since flaked off and the stone seemed to be crumbling away k
had a fleeting recollection of his native town
it was hardly inferior to this so called castle  and if it were merely a question of enjoying the view it was a pity to have come so far
k
would have done better to visit his native town again  which he had not seen for such a long time
and in his mind he compared the church tower at home with the tower above him
the church tower  firm in line  soaring unfalteringly to its tapering point  topped with red tiles and broad in the roof  an earthly building what else can men build   but with a loftier goal than the humble dwellinghouses  and a clearer meaning than the muddle of everyday life
the tower above him here the only one visible the tower of a house  as was now apparent  perhaps of the main building  was uniformly round  part of it graciously mantled with ivy  pierced by small windows that glittered in the sun  a somewhat maniacal glitter  and topped by what looked like an attic  with battlements that were irregular  broken  fumbling  as if designed by the trembling or careless hand of a child  clearly outlined against the blue
it was as if a melancholy mad tenant who ought to have been kept locked in the topmost chamber of his house had burst through the roof and lifted himself up to the gaze of the world again k
came to a stop  as if in standing still he had more power of judgement
but he was disturbed
behind the village church where he had stopped it was really only a chapel widened with barn like additions so as to accommodate the parishioners   was the school
a long  low building  combining remarkably a look of great age with a provincial appearance  it lay behind a fenced in garden which was now a field of snow
the children were just coming out with their teacher
they thronged round him  all gazing up at him and chattering without a break so rapidly that k
could not follow what they said
the teacher  a small young man with narrow shoulders and a very upright carriage which yet did not make him ridiculous  had already fixed k
with his eyes from the distance  naturally enough  for apart from the school children there was not another human being in sight
being the stranger  k
made the first advance  especially as the other was an authoritative looking little man  and said   good morning  sir   as if by one accord the children fell silent  perhaps the master liked to have a sudden stillness as a preparation for his words
 you are looking at the castle   he asked more gently than k
had expected  but with the inflexion that denoted disapproval of k  s occupation
 yes   said k
 i am a stranger here  i came to the village only last night    you don t like the castle   returned the teacher quickly
 what   countered k   a little taken aback  and repeated the question in a modified form
 do i like the castle  why do you assume that i don t like it    strangers never do   said the teacher
to avoid saying the wrong thing k
changed the subject and asked   i suppose you know the count    no   said the teacher turning away
but k
would not be put off and asked again   what  you don t know the count    why should i   replied the teacher in a low tone  and added aloud in french   please remember that there are innocent children present   k
took this as a justification for asking   might i come to pay you a visit one day  sir  i am to be staying here for some time and already feel a little lonely
i don t fit in with the peasants nor  i imagine  with the castle    there is no difference between the peasantry and the castle   said the teacher
 maybe   said k     that doesn t alter my position
can i pay you a visit one day    i live in swan street at the butcher s   that was assuredly more of a statement than an invitation  but k
said   right  i ll come   the teacher nodded and moved on with his batch of children  who began to scream again immediately
they soon vanished in a steeply descending by street
but k
was disconcerted  irritated by the conversation
for the first time since his arrival he felt really tired
the long journey he had made seemed at first to have imposed no strain upon him   how quietly he had sauntered through the days  step by step i   but now the consequences of his exertion were making themselves felt  and at the wrong time  too he felt irresistibly drawn to seek out new acquaintances  but each new acquaintance only seemed to increase his weariness
if he forced himself in his present condition to go on at least as far as the castle entrance  he would have done more than enough so he resumed his walk  but the way proved long
for the street he was in  the main street of the village  did not lead up to the castle hill  it only made towards it and then  as if deliberately  turned aside  and though it did not lead away from the castle it got no nearer to it either
at every turn k
expected the road to double back to the castle  and only because of this expectation did he go on  he was flatly unwilling  tired as he was  to leave the street  and he was also amazed at the length of the village  which seemed to have no end  again and again the same little houses  and frost bound window panes and snow and the entire absence of human beings but at last he tore himself away from the obsession of the street and escaped into a small side lane  where the snow was still deeper and the exertion of lifting one s feet clear was fatiguing  he broke into a sweat  suddenly came to a stop  and could not go on well  he was not on a desert island  there were cottages to right and left of him
he made a snowball and threw it at a window
the door opened immediately the first door that had opened during the whole length of the village and there appeared an old peasant in a brown fur jacket  with his head cocked to one side  a frail and kindly figure
 may i come into your house for a little   asked k     i m very tired   he did not hear the old man s reply  but thankfully observed that a plank was pushed out towards him to rescue him from the snow  and in a few steps he was in the kitchen
a large kitchen  dimly lit
anyone coming in from outside could make out nothing at first
k
stumbled over a washing  tub  a woman s hand steadied him
the crying of children came loudly from one corner
from another steam was welling out and turning the dim light into darkness
k
stood as if in the clouds
 he must be drunk   said somebody
 who are you   cried a hectoring voice  and then obviously to the old man   why did you let him in  are we to let in everybody that wanders about in the street    i am the count s land surveyor  said k   trying to justify himself before this still invisible personage  oh  it s the land surveyor   said a woman s voice  and then came a complete silence
 you know me  then   asked k
 of course   said the same voice curtly
the fact that he was known did not seem to be a recommendation
at last the steam thinned a little  and k
was able gradually to make things out
it seemed to be a general washing day
near the door clothes were being washed
but the steam was coming from another corner  where in a wooden tub larger than any k
had ever seen  as wide as two beds  two men were bathing in steaming water
but still more astonishing  although one could not say what was so astonishing about it  was the scene in the right hand corner
from a large opening  the only one in the back wall  a pale snowy light came in  apparently from the courtyard  and gave a gleam as of silk to the dress of a woman who was almost reclining in a high arm chair
she was suckling an infant at her breast
several children were playing around her  peasant children  as was obvious  but she seemed to be of another class  although of course illness and weariness give even peasants a look of refinement
 sit down    said one of the men  who had a full beard and breathed heavily through his mouth which always hung open  pointing it was a funny sight with his wet hand over the edge of the tub towards a settle  and showering drops of warm water all over k  s face as he did so
on the settle the old man who had admitted k
was already sitting  sunk in vacancy
k
was thankful to find a seat at last
nobody paid any further attention to him
the woman at the washing tub  young  plump  and fair  sang in a low voice as she worked  the men stamped and rolled about in the bath  the children tried to get closer to them but were constantly driven back by mighty splashes of water which fell on k   too  and the woman in the arm chair lay as if lifeless staring at the roof without even a glance towards the child at her bosom
she made a beautiful  sad  fixed picture  and k
looked at her for what must have been a long time  then he must have fallen asleep  for when a loud voice roused him he found that his head was lying on the old man s shoulder
the men had finished with the tub in which the children were now wallowing in charge of the fair haired woman and were standing fully dressed before k
it appeared that the hectoring one with the full beard was the less important of the two
the other  a still  slow thinking man who kept his head bent  was not taller than his companion and had a much smaller beard  but he was broader in the shoulders and had a broad face as well  and he it was who said   you can t stay here  sir
excuse the discourtesy    i don t want to stay   said k   i only wanted to rest a little
i have rested  and now i shall go    you re probably surprised at our lack of hospitality   said the man   but hospitality is not our custom here  we have no use for visitors   somewhat refreshed by his sleep  his perceptions somewhat quickened  k
was pleased by the man s frankness
he felt less constrained  poked with his stick here and there  approached the woman in the arm chair  and noted that he was physically the biggest man in the room
 to be sure   said k    what use would you have for visitors  but still you need one now and then  me  for example  the lane surveyor    i don t know about that   replied the man slowly
 if you ve been asked to come you re probably needed  that s an exceptional case  but we small people stick to our tradition  and you can t blame us for that    no  no   said k    i am only grateful to you and everybody here   and taking them all by surprise he made an adroit turn and stood before the reclining woman
out of weary blue eyes she looked at him  a transparent silk kerchief hung down to the middle of her forehead  die infant was asleep on her bosom
 who are you   asked k   and disdainfully   whether contemptuous of k
or her own answer was not clear   she replied   a girl from the castle   it had only taken a second or so  but already the two men were at either side of k
and were pushing him towards the door  as if there were no other means of persuasion  silently  but putting out all their strength
something in this procedure delighted the old man  and he clapped his hands
the woman at the bath tub laughed too  and the children suddenly shouted like mad
k
was soon out in the street  and from the threshold the two men surveyed him
snow was again falling  yet the sky seemed a little brighter
the bearded man cried impatiently   where do you want to go  this is the way to the castle  and that to the village   k
made no reply to him  but turned to the other  who in spite of his shyness seemed to him the more amiable of the two  and said   who are you  whom have i to thank for sheltering me    i am the tanner lasemann   was the answer   but you owe thanks to nobody    all right   said k    perhaps we ll meet again    i don t suppose so   said the man
at that moment the other cried  with a wave of his hand   good morning  arthur  good morning  jeremiah   k
turned round  so there were really people to be seen in the village streets
from the direction of the castle came two young men of medium height  both very slim  in tight fitting clothes  and like each other in their features
although their skin was a dusky brown the blackness of their little pointed beards was actually striking by contrast
considering the state of the road  they were walking at a great pace  their slim legs keeping time
 where are you off to   shouted the bearded man
one had to shout to them  they were going so fast and they would not stop
 on business   they shouted back  laughing
 where    at the inn   t  i m going there too   yelled k
suddenly  louder than all the rest  he felt a strong desire to accompany them  not that he expected much from their acquaintance  but they were obviously good and jolly companions
they heard him  but only nodded  and were already out of sight
k
was still standing in the snow  and was little inclined to extricate his feet only for the sake of plunging them in again  the tanner and his comrade  satisfied with having finally got rid of him  edged slowly into the house through the door which was now barely ajar  casting backward glances at k   and he was left alone in the falling snow  a fine setting for a fit of despair   it occurred to him   if i were only standing here by accident instead of design   just then in the hut on his left hand a tiny window was opened  which had seemed quite blue when shut  perhaps from the reflexion of the snow  and was so tiny that when opened it did not permit the whole face of the person behind it to be seen  but only the eyes  old brown eyes
 there he is   k
heard a woman s trembling voice say
 it s the land surveyor   answered a man s voice
then the man came to the window and asked  not unamiably  but still as if he were anxious to have no cornplications in front of his house   are you waiting for somebody    for a sledge  to pick me up   said k
 no sledges will pass here   said the man   there s no traffic here    but it s the road leading to the castle   objected k
 all the same  all the same   said the man with a certain finality   there s no traffic here   then they were both silent
but the man was obviously thinking of something  for he kept the window open
 it s a bad road   said k   to help him out
the only answer he got  however  was   oh yes   but after a little the man volunteered   if you like  i ll take you in my sledge    please do   said k
delighted   what is your charge    nothing   said the man
k
was very surprised
 well  you re the land surveyor   explained the man   and you belong to the castle
where do you want to be taken    to the castle   returned k
quickly
 i won t take you there   said the man without hesitation
 but i belong to the castle   said k   repeating the other s very words
 maybe   said the man shortly
 oh  well  take me to the inn   said k
 all right   said the man    i ll be out with the sledge in a moment  his whole behaviour had the appearance of springing not from any special desire to be friendly but rather from a kind of selfish  worried  and almost pedantic insistence on shifting k
away from the front of the house
the gate of the courtyard opened  and a small light sledge  quite flat  without a seat of any kind  appeared  drawn by a feeble little horse  and behind it limped the man  a weakly stooped figure with a gaunt red snuffling face that looked peculiarly small beneath a tightly swathed woollen scarf
he was obviously ailing  and yet only to transport k
he had dragged himself out k ventured to mention it  but the man waved him aside
all that k
elicited was that he was a coachman called gerstacker  and that he had taken this uncomfortable sledge because it was standing ready  and to get out one of the others would have wasted too much time
 sit down   he said  pointing to the sledge
 i ll sit beside you   said k
 i m going to walk   said gerstacker
 but why   asked k
 i m going to walk   repeated gerstacker  and was seized with a fit of coughing which shook him so severely that he had to brace his legs in the snow and hold on to the rim of the sledge
k
said no more  but sat down on the sledge  the man s cough slowly abated  and they drove off
the castle above them  which k
had hoped to reach that very day  was already beginning to grow dark  and retreated again into the distance
but as if to give him a parting sign till their next encounter a bell began to ring merrily up there  a bell which for at least a second made his heart palpitate for its tone was menacing  too  as if it threatened him with the fulfilment of his vague desire
this great bell soon died away  however  and its place was taken by a feeble monotonous little tinkle which might have come from the castle  but might have been somewhere in the village
it certainly harmonized better with the slow going journey  with the wretched looking yet inexorable driver  i say   cried k
suddenly they were already near the church  the inn was not far oft  and k
felt he could risk something   i m surprised that you have the nerve to drive me round on your own responsibility  are you allowed to do that   gerstacker paid no attention  but went on walking quietly beside the little horse
 hi   cried k   scraping some snow from the sledge and flinging a snowball which hit gerstacker full in the ear
that made him stop and turn round  but when k
saw him at such close quarters  the sledge had slid forward a little this stooping and somehow ill used figure with the thin red tired face and cheeks that were different one being flat and the other fallen instanding listening with his mouth open  displaying only a few isolated teeth  he found that what he had just said out of malice had to be repeated out of pity  that is  whether gerstacker was likely to be penalized for driving him about
 what do you mean   asked gerstacker uncomprehendingly  but without waiting for an answer he spoke to the horse and they moved on again
when by a turn in the road k
recognized that they were near the inn  he was greatly surprised to see that darkness had already set in
had he been gone for such a long time  surely not for more than an hour or two  by his reckoning
and it had been morning when he left
and he had not felt any need of food
and just a short time ago it had been uniform daylight  and now the darkness of night was upon them
 short days  short days   he said to himself  slipped off the sledge  and went towards the inn at the top of the little flight of steps leading into the house stood the landlord  a welcome figure  holding up a lighted lantern
remembering his conductor for a fleeting moment k
stood still  there was a cough in the darkness behind him  that was he
well  he would see him again soon
not until he was level with the landlord  who greeted him humbly  did he notice two men  one on either side of the doorway
he took the lantern from his host s hand and turned the light upon them  it was the men he had already met  who were called arthur and jeremiah
they now saluted him
that reminded him of his soldiering days  happy days for him  and he laughed
 who are you   he asked  looking from one to die other
 your assistants   they answered
 it s your assistants   corroborated the landlord in a low voice
 what   said k    are you my old assistants whom i told to follow me and whom i am expecting   they answered in the affirmative
 that s good   observed k
after a short pause
 i m glad you ve come    well   he said  after another pause   you ve come very late  you re very slack    it was a long way to come   said one of them
 a long way   repeated k    but i met you just now coming from the castle    yes   said they without further explanation
 where is the apparatus   asked k
 we haven t any   said they
 the apparatus i gave you   said k
 we haven t any   they reiterated
 oh  you are fine fellows    said k    do you know anything about surveying    no   said they
 but if you are my old assistants you must know something about it    said k
they made no reply
 well  come in   said k   pushing them before him into the house
they sat down then all three together over their beer at a small table  saying little  k
in the middle with an assistant on each side
as on the other evening  there was only one other table occupied by a few peasants
 you re a difficult problem   said k   comparing them  as he had already done several times
 how am i to know one of you from the other  the only difference between you is your names  otherwise you re as like as      he stopped  and then went on involuntarily   you re as like as two snakes   they smiled
 people usually manage to distinguish us quite well   they said in self justification
 i am sure they do   said k    i was a witness of that myself  but i can only see with my own eyes  and with them i can t distinguish you
so i shall treat you as if you were one man and call you both arthur  that s one of your names  yours  isn t it   he asked one of them
 no   said the man   i m jeremiah    it doesn t matter   said k
 i ll call you both arthur
if i tell arthur to go anywhere you must both go
if i give arthur something to do you must both do it  that has the great disadvantage for me of preventing me from employing you on separate jobs  but the advantage that you will both be equally responsible for anything i tell you to do
how you divide the work between you doesn t matter to me  only you re not to excuse yourselves by blaming each other  for me you re only one man   they considered this  and said   we shouldn t like that at all    i don t suppose so   said k    of course you won t like it  but that s how it has to be   for some little time one of the peasants had been sneaking round the table and k
had noticed him  now the fellow took courage and went up to one of the assistants to whisper something
 excuse me   said k   bringing his band down on the table and rising to his feet   these are my assistants and we re discussing private business
nobody is entitled to disturb us    sorry  sir  sorry   muttered the peasant anxiously  retreating backwards towards his friends
 and this is my most important charge to you   said k   sitting down again
 you re not to speak to anyone without my permission
i am a stranger here  and if you are my old assistants you are strangers too
we three strangers must stand by each other therefore  give me your hands on that   all too eagerly they stretched out their hands to k  never mind the trimming   said he   but remember that my command holds good
i shall go to bed now and i recommend you to do the same
to day we have missed a day s work  and to morrow we must begin very early
you must get hold of a sleigh for taking me to the castle and have it ready outside the house at six o clock    very well   said one
but the other interrupted him
 you say  very well   and yet you know it can t be done    silence   said k
 you re trying already to dissociate yourselves from each other   but then the first man broke in   he s right  it can t be done  no stranger can get into the castle without a permit   where does one apply for a permit    i don t know  perhaps to the castellan    then we ll apply by telephone  go and telephone to the castellan at once  both of you   they rushed to the instrument  asked for the connexion   how eager they were about it  in externals they were absurdly docile   and inquired if k
could come with them next morning into the castle
the  no  of the answer was audible even to k
at his table
but the answer went on and was still more explicit  it ran as follows   neither to morrow nor at any other time    i shall telephone myself   said k   and got up
while k
and his assistants hitherto had passed nearly unremarked except for the incident with the one peasant  his last statement aroused general attention
they all got up when k
did  and although the landlord tried to drive them away  crowded round him in a close semicircle at the telephone
the general opinion among them was that k
would get no answer at all
k
had to beg them to be quiet  saying he did not want to hear their opinion
the receiver gave out a buzz of a kind that k
had never before heard on a telephone
it was like the hum of countless children s voices   but yet not a hum  the echo rather of voices singing at an infinite distance   blended by sheer impossibility into one high but resonant sound which vibrated on the ear as if it were trying to penetrate beyond mere hearing
k
listened without attempting to telephone  leaning his left arm on the telephone shelf
he did not know how long he had stood there  but he stood until the landlord pulled at his coat saying that a messenger had come to speak with him
 go away   yelled k
in an access of rage  perhaps into the mouthpiece  for someone immediately answered from the other end
the following conversation ensued   oswald speaking  who s there   cried a severe arrogant voice with a small defect in its speech  as seemed to k   which its owner tried to cover by an exaggerated severity
k
hesitated to announce himself  for he was at the mercy of the telephone  the other could shout him down or hang up the receiver  and that might mean the blocking of a not unimportant way of access k  s hesitation made the man impatient
 who s there   he repeated  adding   i should be obliged if there was less telephoning from down there  only a minute ago somebody rang up   k
ignored this remark  and announced with sudden decision   the land surveyor s assistant speaking   what land surveyor  what assistant   k
recollected yesterday s telephone conversation  and said briefly   ask fritz   this succeeded  to his own astonishment but even more than at his success he was astonished at the organization of the castle service
the answer came   oh  yes
that everlasting land surveyor
quite so
what about it  what assistant    joseph   said k
he was a little put out by the murmuring of the peasants behind his back  obviously they disapproved of his ruse
he had no time to bother about them  however  for the conversation absorbed all his attention
 joseph   came the question
 but the assistants arc called      there was a short pause  evidently to inquire the names from somebody else   arthur and jeremiah    these are the new assistants   said k
 no  they are the old ones    they are the new ones  i am the old assistant  i came to day after the land surveyor    no   was shouted back
 then who am i   asked k
as blandly as before
and after a pause the same voice with the same defect answered him  yet with a deeper and more authoritative tone   you are the old assistant   k
was listening to the new note  and almost missed the question   what is it you want   he felt like laying down the receiver
he had ceased to expect anything from this conversation
but being pressed  he replied quickly   when can my master come to the castle    never   was the answer
 very well   said k   and hung the receiver up
behind him the peasants had crowded quite close
his assistants  with many side glances in his direction  were trying to keep them back
but they seemed not to take the matter very seriously  and in any case the peasants  satisfied with the result of the conversation  were beginning to give ground
a man came cleaving his way with rapid steps through the group  bowed before k   and handed him a letter
k
took it  but looked at the man  who for the moment seemed to him the more important
there was a great resemblance between this new comer and the assistants  he was slim like them and clad in the same tightfitting garments  had the same suppleness and agility  and yet he was quite different
how much k
would have preferred him as an assistant
he reminded k
a little of the girl with the infant whom he had seen at the tanner s
he was clothed nearly all in white  not in silk  of course  he was in winter clothes like all the others  but the material he was wearing had the softness and dignity of silk
his face was clear and frank  his eyes larger than ordinary
his smile was unusually joyous  he drew his hand over his face as if to conceal the smile  but in vain
 who are you   asked k
 my name is barnabas   said he   i am a messenger   his lips were strong and yet gentle as he spoke
 do you approve of this kind of thing   asked k   pointing to the peasants for whom he was still an object of curiosity  and who stood gaping at him with their open mouths  coarse lips  and literally tortured faces   their heads looked as if they had been beaten flat on top and their features as if the pain of the beating had twisted them to the present shape   and yet they were not exactly gaping at him  for their eyes often flitted away and studied some indifferent object in the room before fixing on him again  and then k
pointed also to his assistants who stood linked together  cheek against cheek  and smiling  but whether submissively or mockingly could not be determined
all these he pointed out as if presenting a train of followers forced upon him by circumstances  and as if he expected barnabas   that indicated intimacy  it occurred to k   always to discriminate between him and them
but barnabas   quite innocently  it was clear   ignored the question  letting it pass as a well bred servant ignores some remark of his master only apparently addressed to him  and merely surveyed the room in obedience to the question  greeting by a pressure of the hand various acquaintances among the peasants and exchanging a few words with the assistants  all with a free independence which set him apart from the others
rebuffed but not mortified  k
returned to the letter in his hand and opened it
its contents were as follows   my dear sir  as you know  you have been engaged for the count s service
your immediate superior is the superintendent of the village  who will give you all particulars about your work and the terms of your employment  and to whom you are responsible i myself  however  will try not to lose sight of you
barnabas  the bearer of this letter  will report himself to you from rime to time to learn your wishes and communicate them to me you will find me always ready to oblige you  in so far as that is possible
i desire my workers to be contented   the signature was illegible  but stamped beside it was  chief of department x    wait a little   said k
to barnabas  who bowed before him  then he commanded the landlord to show him to his room  for he wanted to be alone with the letter for a while
at the same time he reflected that barnabas  although so attractive  was still only a messenger  and ordered a mug of beer for him
he looked to see how barnabas would take it  but barnabas was obviously quite pleased and began to drink the beer at once
then k
went off with the landlord
the house was so small that nothing was available for k
but a little attic room  and even that had caused some difficulty  for two maids who had hitherto slept in it had had to be quartered elsewhere
nothing indeed had been done but to clear the maids out  the room was otherwise quite unprepared  no sheets on the single bed  only some pillows and a horse blanket still in the same rumpled state as in the morning
a few sacred pictures and photographs of soldiers were on the walls  the room had not even been aired  obviously they hoped that the new guest would not stay long  and were doing nothing to encourage him
k
felt no resentment  however  wrapped himself in the blanket  sat down at the table  and began to read the letter again by the light of a candle it was not a consistent letter  in part it dealt with him as with a free man whose independence was recognized  the mode of address  for example  and the reference to his wishes
but there were other places in which he was directly or indirectly treated as a minor employee  hardly visible to the heads of departments  the writer would try to make an effort  not to lose sight  of him  his superior was only the village superintendent to whom he was actually responsible  probably his sole colleague would be the village policeman
these were inconsistencies  no doubt about it
they were so obvious that they had to be faced
it hardly occurred to k
that they might be due to indecision  that seemed a mad idea in connexion with such an organization
he was much more inclined to read into them a frankly offered choice  which left it to him to make what he liked out of the letter  whether he preferred to become a village worker with a distinctive but merely apparent connexion with the castle  or an ostensible village worker whose real occupation was determined through the medium of barnabas
k
did not hesitate in his choice  and would not have hesitated even had he lacked the experience which had befallen him since his arrival
only as a worker in the village  removed as far as possible from the sphere of the castle  could he hope to achieve anything in the castle itself  the village folk  who were now so suspicious of him  would begin to talk to him once he was their fellow citizen  if not exactly their friend  and if he were to become indistinguishable from gerstacker or lasemann   and that must happen as soon as possible  everything depended on that   then all kinds of paths would be thrown open to him  which would remain not only for ever closed to him but quite invisible were he to depend merely on the favour of the gentlemen in the castle
there was of course a danger  and that was sufficiently emphasized in the letter  even elaborated with a certain satisfaction  as if it were unavoidable
that was sinking to the workman s level   service  superior work  terms of employment  responsible workers   the letter fairly reeked of it  and even though more personal messages were included they were written from the standpoint of an employer if k
were willing to become a workman he could do so  but he would have to do it in grim earnest  without any other prospect
k
knew that he had no real compulsory discipline to fear  he was not afraid of that  and in this case least of all  but the pressure of a discouraging environment  of a growing resignation to disappointment  the pressure of the imperceptible influences of every moment  these things he did fear  but that was a danger he would have to guard against
nor did the letter pass over the fact that if it should come to a struggle k
had had the hardihood to make the first advances  it was very subtly indicated and only to be sensed by an uneasy conscience   an uneasy conscience  not a bad one   it lay in the three words   as you know   referring to his engagement in the count s service
k
had reported his arrival  and only after that  as the letter pointed out  had he known that he was engaged
k
took down a picture from the wall and stuck the letter on the nail  this was the room he was to live in and the letter should hang there
then he went down to the inn parlour
barnabas was sitting at a table with the assistants
 oh  there you are   said k
without any reason  only because he was glad to see barnabas  who jumped to his feet at once
hardly had k
shown his face when the peasants got up and gathered round him   it had become a habit of theirs to follow him around
 what are you always following me about for   cried k
they were not offended  and slowly drifted back to their seats again
one of them in passing said casually in apology  with an enigmatic smile which was reflected on several of the others  faces   there s always something new to listen to   and he licked his lips as if news were meat and drink to him
k
said nothing conciliatory  it was good for them to have a little respect for him  but hardly had he reached barnabas when he felt a peasant breathing down the back of his neck
he had only come  he said  for the salt cellar  but k
stamped his foot with rage and the peasant scuttled away without the salt cellar
it was really easy to get at k   all one had to do was to egg on the peasants against him  their persistent interference seemed much more objectionable to him than the reserve of the others  nor were they free from reserve either  for if he had sat down at their table they would not have stayed
only the presence of barnabas restrained him from making a scene
but he turned round to scowl at them  and found that they  too  were all looking at him
when he saw them sitting like that  however  each man in his own place  not speaking to one another and without any apparent mutual understanding  united only by the fact that they were all gazing at him  he concluded that it was not out of malice that they pursued him  perhaps they really wanted something from him and were only incapable of expressing it  if not that  it might be pure childishness  which seemed to be in fashion at the inn  was not the landlord himself childish  standing there stock still gazing at k with a glass of beer in his hand which he should have been carrying to a customer  and oblivious of his wife  who was leaning out of the kitchen hatch calling to him  with a quieter mind k
turned to barnabas  he would have liked to dismiss his assistants  but could not think of an excuse
besides  they were brooding peacefully over their beer
 the letter   began k    i have read it
do you know the contents    no   said barnabas  whose look seemed to imply more than his words
perhaps k
was as mistaken in barnabas s goodness as in the malice of the peasants  but his presence remained a cornfort
 you are mentioned in the letter  too  you are supposed to carry messages now and then from me to the chief  that s why i thought you might know the contents    i was only told   said barnabas   to give you the letter  to wait until you had read it and then to bring back a verbal or written answer if you thought it needful    very well   said k    there s no need to write anything  convey to the chief   by the way  what s his name  i couldn t read his signature    klamm   said barnabas
 well  convey to herr klamm my thanks for his recognition and for his great kindness  which 1 appreciate  being as i am one who has not yet proved his worth here
i shall follow his instructions faithfully
i have no particular requests to make for to day   barnabas  who had listened with close attention  asked to be allowed to recapitulate the message
k
assented  barnabas repeated it word for word
then he rose to take his leave
k
had been studying his face the whole time  and now he gave it a last survey
barnabas was about the same height as k   but his eyes seemed to look down on k   yet that was almost in a kind of humility  it was impossible to think that this man could put anyone to shame
of course he was only a messenger  and did not know the contents of the letters he carried  but the expression in his eyes  his smile  his bearing  seemed also to convey a message   however little he might know about it
and k
shook him by the hand  which seemed obviously to surprise him  for he had been going to content himself with a bow as soon as he had gone   before opening the door he had leaned his shoulder against it for a moment and embraced the room generally in a final glance   k
said to the assistants   i ll bring down the plans from my room  and then we ll discuss what work is to be done first   they wanted to accompany him
 stay here   said k
still they tried to accompany him
k
had to repeat his command more authoritatively
barnabas was no longer in the hall
but he had only just gone out
yet in front of the house   fresh snow was falling   k
could not see him either
he called out   barnabas   no answer
could he still be in the house  nothing else seemed possible
none the less k
yelled the name with the full force of his lungs
it thundered through the night
and from the distance came a faint response  so far away was barnabas already
k
called him back  and at the same time went to meet him  the spot where they encountered each other was no longer visible from the inn
 barnabas   said k   and could not keep his voice from trembling   i have something else to say to you
and that reminds me that it s a bad arrangement to leave me dependent on your chance comings for sending a message to the castle
if i hadn t happened to catch you just now   how you fly along  i thought you were still in the house   who knows how long i might have had to wait for your next appearance    you can ask the chief   said barnabas   to send me at definite times appointed by yourself    even that would not suffice   said k    i might have nothing to say for a year at a time  but something of urgent importance might occur to me a quarter of an hour after you had gone    well   said barnabas   shall i report to the chief that between him and you some other means of communication should be established instead of me    no  no   said k    not at all  i only mention the matter in passing  for this time i have been lucky enough to catch you    shall we go back to the inn   said barnabas   so that you can give me the new message there   he had already taken a step in the direction of the inn
 barnabas   said k    it isn t necessary  i ll go a part of the way with you    why don t you want to go to the inn   asked barnabas
 the people there annoy me   said k    you saw for yourself how persistent the peasants are    we could go into your room   said barnabas
 it s the maids  room   said k    dirty and stuffy   it s to avoid staying there that i want to accompany you for a little  only   he added  in order finally to overcome barnabas s reluctance   you must let me take your arm  for you are surer of foot than i am   and k
took his arm
it was quite dark  k
could not see barnabas s face  his figure was only vaguely discernible  he had had to grope for his arm a minute or two
barnabas yielded and they moved away from the inn
k
realized  indeed  that his utmost efforts could not enable him to keep pace with barnabas  that he was a drag on him  and that even in ordinary circumstances this trivial accident might be enough to ruin everything  not to speak of side streets like the one in which he had got stuck that morning  out of which he could never struggle unless barnabas were to carry him but he banished all such anxieties  and was comforted by barnabas s silence  for if they went on in silence then barnabas  too  must feel that their excursion together was the sole reason for their association
they went on  but k
did not know whither  he could discern nothing  not even whether they had already passed the church or not
the effort which it cost him merely to keep going made him lose control of his thoughts
instead of remaining fixed on their goal they strayed
memories of his home kept recurring and filled his mind
there  too  a church stood in the marketplace  partly surrounded by an old graveyard which was again surrounded by a high wall
very few boys had managed to climb that wall  and for some time k   too  had failed
it was not curiosity which had urged them on
the graveyard had been no mystery to them
they had often entered it through a small wicket gate  it was only the smooth high wall that they had wanted to conquer
but one morning   the empty  quiet marketplace had been flooded with sunshine  when had k
ever seen it like that either before or since    he had succeeded in climbing it with astonishing ease  at a place where he had already slipped down many a time he had clambered with a small flag between his teeth right to the top at the first attempt
stones were still rattling down under his feet  but he was at the top
he stuck the flag in  it flew in the wind  he looked down and round about him  over his shoulder  too  at the crosses mouldering in the ground  nobody was greater than he at that place and that moment
by chance the teacher had come past and with a stern face had made k
descend
in jumping down he had hurt his knee and had found some difficulty in getting home  but still he had been on the top of the wall
the sense of that triumph had seemed to him then a victory for life  which was not altogether foolish  for now so many years later on the arm of barnabas in the snowy night the memory of it came to succour him
he took a firmer hold  barnabas was almost dragging him along  the silence was unbroken
of the road they were following all that k
knew was that to judge from its surface they had not yet turned aside into a by street
he vowed to himself that  however difficult the way and however doubtful even the prospect of his being able to get back  he would not cease from going on he would surely have strength enough to let himself be dragged and the road must come to an end some time
by day the castle had looked within easy reach  and  of course  the messenger would take the shortest cut
at that moment barnabas stopped
where were they  was this the end  would barnabas try to leave him  he wouldn t succeed
k
clutched his arm so firmly that it almost made his hand ache
or had the incredible happened  and were they already in the castle or at its gates  but they had not done any climbing so far as k
could tell
or had barnabas taken him up by an imperceptibly mounting road   where are we   said k
in a low voice  more to himself than to barnabas  at home   said barnabas in the same tone
 at home    be careful now  sir  or you ll slip
we go down here    down    only a step or two   added barnabas  and was already knocking at a door
a girl opened it  and they were on the threshold of a large room almost in darkness  for there was no light save for a tiny oil lamp hanging over a table in the background
 who is with you  barnabas   asked the girl
 the land surveyor   said he
 the land surveyor   repeated the girl in a louder voice  turning towards the table
two old people there rose to their feet  a man and a woman  as well as another girl
they greeted k
barnabas introduced the whole family  his parents and his sisters olga and amalia
k
scarcely glanced at them and let them take his wet coat off to dry at the stove
so it was only barnabas who was at home  not he himself but why had they come here  k
drew barnabas aside and asked   why have you come here  or do you live in the castle precincts    the castle precincts   repeated barnabas  as if he did not understand
 barnabas   said k    you left the inn to go to the castle    no   said barnabas   i left it to come home  i don t go to the castle till the early morning  i never sleep there    oh   said k    so you weren t going to the castle  but only here    the man s smile seemed less brilliant  and his person more insignificant    why didn t you say so    you didn t ask me  sir   said barnabas   you only said you had a message to give me  but you wouldn t give it in the inn parlour  or in your room  so i thought you could speak to me quietly here in my parents  house
the others will all leave us if you wish   and  if you prefer  you could spend the night here
haven t i done the right thing   k
could not reply
it had been simply a misunderstanding  a common  vulgar misunderstanding  and k
had been completely taken in by it
he had been bewitched by barnabas s closefitting  silken gleaming jacket  which  now that it was unbuttoned  displayed a coarse  dirty grey shirt patched all over  and beneath that the huge muscular chest of a labourer
his surroundings not only corroborated all this but even emphasized it  the old gouty father who progressed more by the help of his groping hands than by the slow movements of his stiff legs  and the mother with her hands folded on her bosom  who was equally incapable of any but the smallest steps by reason of her stoutness
both of them  father and mother  had been advancing from their corner towards k
ever since he had come in  and were still a long way off
the yellow haired sisters  very like each other and very like barnabas  but with harder features than their brother  great strapping wenches  hovered round their parents and waited for some word of greeting from k
but he could not utter it
he had been persuaded that in this village everybody meant something to him  and indeed he was not mistaken  it was only for these people here that he could feel not the slightest interest
if he had been fit to struggle back to the inn alone he would have left at once
the possibility of accompanying barnabas to the castle early in the morning did not attract him
he had hoped to penetrate into the castle unremarked in the night on the arm of barnabas  but on the arm of the barnabas he had imagined  a man who was more to him than anyone else  the barnabas he had conceived to be far above his apparent rank and in the intimate confidence of the castle
with the son of such a family  however  a son who integrally belonged to it  and who was already sitting at table with the others  a man who was not even allowed to sleep in the castle  he could not possibly go to the castle in the broad light of day  it would be a ridiculous and hopeless undertaking
k
sat down on a window seat where he determined to pass the night without accepting any other favour
the other people in the village  who turned him away or were afraid of him  seemed much less dangerous  for all that they did was to throw him back on his own resources  helping him to concentrate his powers  but such ostensible helpers as these who on the strength of a petty masquerade brought him into their homes instead of into the castle  deflected him  whether intentionally or not  from his goal and only helped to destroy him
an invitation to join the family at table he ignored completely  stubbornly sitting with bent head on his bench
then olga  the gentler of the sisters  got up  not without a trace of maidenly embarrassment  came over to k
and asked him to join the family meal of bread and bacon  saying that she was going to fetch some beer  where from   asked k
 from the inn   she said
that was welcome news to k
he begged her instead of fetching beer to accompany him back to the inn  where he had important work waiting to be done but the fact now emerged that she was not going so far as his inn  she was going to one much nearer  called the herrenhof
none the less k
begged to be allowed to accompany her  thinking that there perhaps he might find a lodging for the night  however wretched it might be he would prefer it to the best bed these peqple could offer him olga did not reply at once  but glanced towards the table
her brother stood up  nodded obligingly and said   if the gentleman wishes   this assent was almost enough to make k
withdraw his request  nothing could be of much value if barnabas assented to it
but since they were already wondering whether k
would be admitted into that inn and doubting its possibility  he insisted emphatically upon going  without taking the trouble to give a colourable excuse for his eagerness  this family would have to accept him as he was  he had no feeling of shame where they were concerned
yet he was somewhat disturbed by amalia s direct and serious gaze  which was unflinching and perhaps a little stupid
on their short walk to the inn   k
had taken olga s arm and was leaning his whole weight on her as earlier on barnabas  he could not get along otherwise   he learned that it was an inn exclusively reserved for gentlemen from the castle  who took their meals there and sometimes slept there whenever they had business in the village
olga spoke to k
in a low and confidential tone  to walk with her was pleasant  almost as pleasant as walking with her brother
k
struggled against the feeling of comfort she gave him  but it persisted
from outside the new inn looked very like the inn where k
was staying
all the houses in the village resembled one another more or less  but still a few small differences were immediately apparent here  the front steps had a balustrade  and a fine lantern was fixed over the doorway
something fluttered over their heads as they entered  it was a flag with the count s colours
in the hall they were at once met by the landlord  who was obviously on a tour of inspection  he glanced at k
in passing with small eyes that were cither screwed up critically  or half asleep  and said   the land surveyor mustn t go anywhere but into the bar    certainly   said olga  who took k  s part at once   he s only escorting me   but k
ungratefully let go her arm and drew the landlord aside
olga meanwhile waited patiently at the end of the hall
 i should like to spend the night here   said k
 i m afraid that s impossible   said the landlord
 you don t seem to be aware that this house is reserved exclusively for gentlemen from the castle    well  that may be the rule   said k    but it s surely possible to let me sleep in a corner somewhere    i should be only too glad to oblige you   said the landlord   but besides the strictness with which the rule is enforced   and you speak about it as only a stranger could   it s quite out of the question for another reason  the castle gentlemen are so sensitive that i m convinced they couldn t bear the sight of a stranger  at least unless they were prepared for it  and if i were to let you sleep here  and by some chance or other   and chances are always on the side of the gentlemen   you were discovered  not only would it mean my ruin but yours too
that sounds ridiculous  but it s true   this tall and closely buttoned man who stood with his legs crossed  one hand braced against the wall and the other on his hip  bending down a little towards k
and speaking confidentially to him  seemed to have hardly anything in common with the village  even although his dark clothes looked like a peasant s finery
 i believe you absolutely   said k    and i didn t mean to belittle the rule  although i expressed myself badly
only there s something i d like to point out  i have some influence in the castle  and shall have still more  and that secures you against any danger arising out of my stay here overnight  and is a guarantee that i am able fully to recompense any small favour you may do me    oh  i know   said the landlord  and repeated again   i know all that   now was the time for k
to state his wishes more clearly  but this reply of the landlord s disconcerted him  and so he merely asked   are there many of the castle gentlemen staying in the house to night    as far as that goes  to night is favourable   returned the landlord  as if in encouragement   there s only one gentleman   still k
felt incapable of urging the matter  but being in hopes that he was as good as accepted  he contented himself by asking the name of the gentleman  klamm   said the landlord casually  turning meanwhile to his wife who came rustling towards them in a remarkably shabby  old fashioned gown overloaded with pleats and frills  but of a fine city cut
she came to summon the landlord  for the chief wanted something or other
before the landlord complied  however  he turned once more to k   as if it lay with k
to make the decision about staying all night
but k
could not utter a word  overwhelmed as he was by the discovery that it was his patron who was in the house
without being able to explain it completely to himself he did not feel the same freedom of action in relation to klamm as he did to the rest of the castle  and the idea of being caught in the inn by klamm  although it did not terrify him as it did the landlord  gave him a twinge of uneasiness  much as if he were thoughtlessly to hurt the feelings of someone to whom he was bound by gratitude  at the same time  however  it vexed him to recognize already in these qualms the obvious effects of that degradation to an inferior status which he had feared  and to realize that although they were so obvious he was not even in a position to counteract them so he stood there biting his lips and said nothing
once more the landlord looked back at him before disappearing through a doorway  and k
returned the look without moving from the spot  until olga came up and drew him away
 what did you want with the landlord   she asked
 i wanted a bed for the night   said k
 but you re staying with us   said olga in surprise
 of course   said k   leaving her to make what she liked of it   in the bar  which was a large room with a vacant space in the middle  there were several peasants sitting by the wall on the tops of some casks  but they looked different from those in k  s inn
they were more neatly and uniformly dressed in coarse yellowish grey cloth  with loose jackets and tightly fitting trousers
they were smallish men with at first sight a strong mutual resemblance  having flat bony faces  but rounded cheeks
they were all quiet  and sat with hardly a movement  except that they followed the newcomers with their eyes  but they did even that slowly and indifferently
yet because of their numbers and their quietness they had a certain effect on k
he took olga s arm again as if to explain his presence there
a man rose up from one corner  an acquaintance of olga s  and made towards her  but k
wheeled her round by the arm in another direction
his action was perceptible to nobody but olga  and she tolerated it with a smiling side glance
the beer was drawn off by a young girl called frieda
an unobtrusive little girl with fair hair  sad eyes  and hollow cheeks  with a striking look of conscious superiority
as soon as her eye met k s it seemed to him that her look decided something concerning himself  something which he had not known to exist  but which her look assured him did exist he kept on studying her from the side  even while she was speaking to olga
olga and frieda were apparently not intimate  they exchanged only a few cold words
k
wanted to hear more  and so interposed with a question on his own account   do you know herr klamm   olga laughed out loud
 what are you laughing at   asked k
irritably
 i m not laughing   she protested  but went on laughing
 olga is a childish creature   said k
bending far over the counter in order to attract frieda s gaze again
but she kept her eyes lowered and laughed shyly
 would you like to see herr klamm   k
begged for a sight of him
she pointed to a door just on her left
 there s a little peephole there  you can look through    what about the others   asked k
she curled her underlip and pulled k 
to the door with a hand that was unusually soft
the little hole had obviously been bored for spying through  and commanded almost the whole of the neighbouring room
at a desk in the middle of the room in a comfortable arm chair sat herr klamm  his face brilliantly lit up by an incandescent lamp which hung low before him
a middle sized  plump  and ponderous man
his face was still smooth  but his cheeks were already somewhat flabby with age
his black moustache had long points  his eyes were hidden behind glittering pince nez that sat awry
if he had been planted squarely before his desk k
would only have seen his profile  but since he was turned directly towards k
his whole face was visible
his left elbow lay on the desk  his right hand  in which was a virginia cigar  rested on his knee
a beer glass was standing on the desk  but there was a rim round the desk which prevented k
from seeing whether any papers were lying on it  he had the idea  however  that there were none
to make it certain he asked frieda to look through the hole and tell him if there were any
but since she had been in that room a short time ago  she was able to inform him without further ado that the desk was empty
k
asked frieda if his time was up  but she told him to go on looking as long as he liked
k
was now alone with frieda
olga  as a hasty glance assured him  had found her way to her acquaintance  and was sitting high on a cask swinging her legs
 frieda   said k
in a whisper   do you know herr klamm well    oh  yes   she said   very well   she leaned over to k
and he became aware that she was coquettishly fingering the lowcut cream coloured blouse which sat oddly on her poor thin body
then she said   didn t you notice how olga laughed    yes  the rude creature   said k
 well   she said extenuatingly   there was a reason for laughing
you asked if i knew klamm  and you see i    here she involuntarily lifted her chin a little  and again her triumphant glance  which had no connexion whatever with what she was saying  swept over k
   i am his mistress    klamm s mistress   said k
she nodded
 then   said k
smiling  to prevent the atmosphere from being too charged with seriousness   you are for me a highly respectable person    not only for you   said frieda amiably  but without returning his smile
k
had a weapon for bringing down her pride  and he tried it   have you ever been in the castle   but it missed the mark  for she answered   no  but isn t it enough for me to be here in the bar   her vanity was obviously boundless  and she was trying  it seemed  to get k
in particular to minister to it
 of course   said k    here in the bar you re taking the landlord s place    that s so   she assented   and i began as a barmaid at the inn by the bridge    with those delicate hands   said k
halfquestioningly  without knowing himself whether he was only flattering her or was compelled by something in her her hands were certainly small and delicate  but they could quite as well have been called weak and characterless
 nobody bothered about them then   she said   and even now      k
looked at her inquiringly
she shook her head and would say no more
 you have your secrets  naturally   said k    and you re not likely to give them away to somebody you ve known for only half an hour  and who hasn t had the chance yet to tell you anything about himself   this remark proved to be ill chosen  for it seemed to arouse frieda as from a trance that was favourable to him out of ihe leather bag hanging at her girdle she took a small piece of wood  stopped up the peephole with it  and said to k
with an obvious attempt to conceal the change in her attitude   oh  i know all about you  you re the land surveyor   and then adding   but now i must go back to my work   she returned to her place behind the bar counter  while a man here and there came up to get his empty glass refilled
k
wanted to speak to her again  so he took an empty glass from a stand and went up to her  saying   one thing more  fraulein frieda  it s an extraordinary feat and a sign of great strength of mind to have worked your way up from byre maid to this position in the bar  but can it be the end of all ambition for a person like you  an absurd idea
your eyes   don t laugh at me  fraulein frieda   speak to me far more of conquests still to come than of conquests past
but the opposition one meets in the world is great  and becomes greater the higher one aims  and it s no disgrace to accept the help of a man who s fighting his way up too  even though he s a small and uninfluential man perhaps we could have a quiet talk together sometime  without so many onlookers    i don t know what you re after   she said  and in her tone this time there seemed to be  against her will  an echo rather of countless disappointments than of past triumphs
 do you want to take me away from klamm perhaps  o heavens   and she clapped her hands
 you ve seen through me   said k   as if wearied by so much mistrust   that s exactly my real secret intention
you ought to leave klamm and become my sweetheart
and now i can go
olga   he cried   we re going home   obediently olga slid down from her cask but did not succeed immediately in breaking through her ring of friends
then frieda said in a low voice with a hectoring look at k    when can i talk to you    can i spend the night here   asked k
 yes   said frieda
 can i stay now    go out first with olga  so that i can clear out all the others
then you can come back in a little    right   said k   and he waited impatiently for olga
but the peasants would not let her go  they made up a dance in which she was the central figure  they circled round her yelling all together and every now and then one of them left the ring  seized olga firmly round the waist and whirled her round and round  the pace grew faster and faster  the yells more hungry  more raucous  until they were insensibly blended into one continuous howl
olga  who had begun laughingly by trying to break out of the ring  was now merely reeling with flying hair from one man to the other
 that s the kind of people i m saddled with   said frieda  biting her thin lips in scorn
 who are they   asked k
 klamm s servants   said frieda   he keeps on bringing those people with him  and they upset me
i can hardly tell what i ve been saying to you  but please forgive me if i ve offended you  it s these people who are to blame  they re the most contemptible and objectionable creatures i know  and i have to fill their glasses up with beer for them
how often i ve implored klamm to leave them behind him  for though i have to put up with the other gentlemen s servants  he could surely have some consideration for me  but it s all no use  an hour before his arrival they always come bursting in like cattle into their stalls
but now they ve really got to get into the stalls  where they belong
if you weren t here i d fling open this door and klamm would be forced to drive them out himself    can t he hear them  then   asked k  no   said frieda   he s asleep    asleep   cried k
 but when i peeped in he was awake and sitting at the desk    he always sits like that   said frieda   he was sleeping when you saw him
would i have let you look in if he hadn t been asleep  that s how he sleeps  the gentlemen do sleep a great deal  it s hard to understand
anyhow  if he didn t sleep so much  he wouldn t be able to put up with his servants
but now i ll have to turn them out myself   she took a whip from a corner and sprang among the dancers with a single bound  a little uncertainly  as a young lamb might spring
at first they faced her as if she were merely a new partner  and actually for a moment frieda seemed inclined to let the whip fall  but she soon raised it again  crying   in the name of klamm into the stall with you  into the stall  all of you   when they saw that she was in earnest they began to press towards the back wall in a kind of panic incomprehensible to k    and under the impact of the first few a door shot open  letting in a current of night air through which they all vanished with frieda behind them openly driving them across the courtyard into the stalls
in the sudden silence which ensued k
heard steps in the vestibule
with some idea of securing his position he dodged behind the bar counter  which afforded the only possible cover in the room
he had an admitted right to be in the bar  but since he meant to spend the night there he had to avoid being seen
so when the door was actually opened he slid under the counter
to be discovered there of course would have its dangers too  yet he could explain plausibly enough that he had only taken refuge from the wild licence of the peasants
it was the landlord who came in
 frieda     he called  and walked up and down the room several times
fortunately frieda soon came back  she did not mention k   she only complained about the peasants  and in the course of looking round for k
went behind the counter  so that he was able to touch her foot
from that moment he felt safe
since frieda made no reference to k   however  the landlord was cornpelled to do it
 and where is the land surveyor   he asked
he was probably courteous by nature  refined by constant and relatively free intercourse with men who were much his superior  but there was remarkable consideration in his tone to frieda  which was all the more striking because in his conversation he did not cease to be an employer addressing a servant  and a saucy servant at that
 the land surveyor   i forgot all about him   said frieda  setting her small foot on k  s chest
 he must have gone out long ago    but i haven t seen him   said the landlord   and i was in the hall nearly the whole time    well  he isn t in here   said frieda coolly
 perhaps he s hidden somewhere   went on the landlord
 from the impression i had of him he s capable of a good deal    he would hardly have the cheek to do that   said frieda  pressing her foot down on k
there was a certain mirth and freedom about her which k
had not previously remarked  and quite unexpectedly it took the upper hand  for suddenly laughing she bent down to k
with the words   perhaps he s hidden underneath here   kissed him lightly and sprang up again saying with a troubled air   no  he s not there   then the landlord  too  surprised k
when he said   it bothers me not to know for certain that he s gone
not only because of herr klamm  but because of the rule of the house
and the rule applies to you  fraulein frieda  just as much as to me
well  if you answer for the bar  i ll go through the rest of the rooms good night  sleep well   he could hardly have left the room before frieda had turned out the electric light and was under the counter beside k
 my darling  my darling     she whispered  but she did not touch him
as if swooning with love she lay on her back and stretched out her arms  time must have seemed endless to her in the prospect of her happiness  and she sighed rather than sang some little song or other then as k still lay absorbed in thought  she started up and began to tug at him like a child   come on  it s too close down here   and they embraced each other  her little body burned in k  s hands  in a state of unconsciousness which k
tried again and again but in vain to master as they rolled a little way  landing with a thud on klamm s door  where they lay among the small puddles of beer and other refuse gathered on the floor
there  hours went past  hours in which they breathed as one  in which their hearts beat as one  hours in which k
was haunted by the feeling that he was losing himself or wandering into strange country  farther than ever man had wandered 45 before  a country so strange that not even the air had anything in common with his native air  where one might die of strangeness  and yet whose enchantment was such that one could only go on and lose oneself further so it came to him not as a shock but as a faint glimmer of comfort when from klamm s room a deep  authoritative impersonal voice called for frieda
 frieda   whispered k
in frieda s ear  passing on the summons
with a mechanical instinct of obedience frieda made as if to spring to her feet  then she remembered where she was  stretched herself  laughing quietly  and said   i m not going  i m never going to him again   k wanted to object  to urge her to go to klamm  and began to fasten up her disordered blouse  but he could not bring himself to speak  he was too happy to have frieda in his arms  too troubled also in his happiness  for it seemed to him that in letting frieda go he would lose all he had and as if his support had strengthened her frieda clenched her fist and beat upon the door  crying   i m with the land surveyor   that silenced klamm at any rate  but k
started up  and on his knees beside frieda gazed round him in the uncertain light of dawn
what had happened  where were his hopes  what could he expect from frieda now that she had betrayed everything  instead of feeling his way with the prudence befitting the greatness of his enemy and of his ambition  he had spent a whole night wallowing in puddles of beer  the smell of which was nearly overpowering
 what have you done   he said as if to himself  we are both ruined    no   said frieda   it s only me that s ruined  but then i ve won you
don t worry
but just look how these two are laughing    who   asked k   and turned round
there on the bar counter sat his two assistants  a little heavy eyed for lack of sleep  but cheerful
it was a cheerfulness arising from a sense of duty well done
 what are you doing here   cried k
as if they were to blame for everything
 we had to search for you   explained the assistants   since you didn t come back to the inn  we looked for you at barnabas s and finally found you here
we have been sitting here all night
ours is no easy job    it s in the day time i need you   said k    not in the night  clear out    but it s day time now   said they without moving
it was really day  the doors into the courtyard were opened  the peasants came streaming in and with them olga  whom k
had completely forgotten
although her hair and clothes were in disorder olga was as alert as on the previous evening  and her eyes flew to k
before she was well over the threshold
 why did you not come home with me   she asked  almost weeping
 all for a creature like that   she said then  and repeated the remark several times
frieda  who had vanished for a moment  came back with a small bundle of clothing  and olga moved sadly to one side
 now we can be off   said frieda  it was obvious she meant that they should go back to the inn by the bridge
k
walked with frieda  and behind them the assistants  that was the little procession
the peasants displayed a great contempt for frieda  which was understandable  for she had lorded it over them hitherto  one of them even took a stick and held it as if to prevent her from going out until she had jumped over it  but a look from her sufficed to quell him
when they were out in the snow k
breathed a little more freely
it was such a relief to be in the open air that the journey seemed less laborious  if he had been alone he would have got on still better
when he reached the inn he went straight to his room and lay down on the bed
frieda prepared a couch for herself on the floor beside him
the assistants had pushed their way in too  and on being driven out came back through the window
k
was too weary to drive them out again
the landlady came up specially to welcome frieda  who hailed her as  mother   their meeting was inexplicably affectionate  with kisses and long embracings
there was little peace and quietness to be had in the room  for the maids too came clumping in with their heavy boots  bringing or seeking various articles  and whenever they wanted anything from the miscellaneous assortment on the bed they simply pulled it out from under k
they greeted frieda as one of themselves in spite of all this coming and going k
stayed in bed the whole day through  and the whole night
frieda performed little offices for him
when he got up at last on the following morning he was much refreshed  and it was the fourth day since his arrival in the village   he would have liked an intimate talk with frieda  but the assistants hindered this simply by their importunate presence  and frieda  too  laughed and joked with them from time to time
otherwise they were not at all exacting  they had simply settled down in a corner on two old skirts spread out on the floor
they made it a point of honour  as they repeatedly assured frieda  not to disturb the land surveyor and to take up as little room as possible  and in pursuit of this intention  although with a good deal of whispering and giggling  they kept on trying to squeeze themselves into a smaller compass  crouching together in the corner so that in the dim light they looked like one large bundle from his experience of them by daylight  however  k
was all too conscious that they were acute observers and never took their eyes off him  whether they were fooling like children and using their hands as spyglasses  or merely glancing at him while apparently completely absorbed in grooming their beards  on which they spent much thought and which they were for ever comparing in length and thickness  calling on frieda to decide between them
from his bed k
often watched the antics of all three with the completest indifference
when he felt himself well enough to leave his bed  they all ran to serve him he was not yet strong enough to ward off their services  and noted that that brought him into a state of dependence on them which might have evil consequences  but he could not help it
nor was it really unpleasant to drink at the table the good coffee which frieda had brought  to warm himself at the stove which frieda had lit  and to have the assistants racing ten times up and down the stairs in their awkwardness and zeal to fetch him soap and water  comb and lookingglass  and eventually even a small glass of rum because he had hinted in a low voice at his desire for one among all this giving of orders and being waited on  k said  more out of good humour than any hope of being obeyed   go away now  you two  i need nothing more for the present  and i want to speak to fraulein frieda by herself   and when he saw no direct opposition on their faces he added  by way of excusing them   we three shall go to the village superintendent afterwards  so wait downstairs in the bar for me   strangely enough they obeyed him  only turning to say before going   we could wait here   but k
answered   i know  but i don t want you to wait here   it annoyed him  however  and yet in a sense pleased him when frieda  who had settled on his knee as soon as the assistants were gone  said   what s your objection to the assistants  darling  we don t need to have any mysteries before them
they are true friends    oh  true friends   said k    they keep spying on me the whole time  it s nonsensical but abominable    i believe i know what you mean   she said  and she clung to his neck and tried to say something else but could not go on speaking  and since their chair was close to it they reeled over and fell on the bed
there they lay  but not in the forgetfulness of the previous night
she was seeking and he was seeking  they raged and contorted their faces and bored their heads into each other s bosoms in the urgency of seeking something  and their embraces and their tossing limbs did not avail to make them forget  but only reminded them of what they sought  like dogs desperately tearing up the ground they tore at each other s bodies  and often  helplessly baffled  in a final effort to attain happiness they nuzzled and tongued each other s face sheer weariness stilled them at last and brought them gratitude to each other
then the maids came in
 look how they re lying there   said one  and sympathetically cast a coverlet over them
when somewhat later k
freed himself from the coverlet and looked round  the two assistants   and he was not surprised at that were again in their corner  and with a finger jerked towards k nudged each other to a formal salute  but besides them the landlady was sitting near the bed knitting away at a stocking  an infinitesimal piece of work hardly suited to her enormous bulk which almost darkened the room
 i ve been here a long time   she said  lifting up her broad and much furrowed face which was  however  still rounded and might once have been beautiful
the words sounded like a reproach  an ill timed reproach  for k
had not desired her to come
so he merely acknowledged them by a nod  and sat up
frieda also got up  but left k
to lean over the landlady s chair
 if you want to speak to me   said k
in bewilderment   couldn t you put it off until after i come back from visiting the superintendent  i have important business with him    this is important  believe me  sir   said the landlady   your other business is probably only a question of work  but this concerns a living person  frieda  my dear maid    oh  if that s it   said k    then of course you re right  but i don t see why we can t be left to settle our own affairs    because i love her and care for her   said the landlady  drawing frieda s head towards her  for frieda as she stood only reached up to the landlady s shoulder
 since frieda puts such confidence in you   cried k    i must do the same  and since not long ago frieda called my assistants true friends we are all friends together
so i can tell you that what i would like best would be for frieda and myself to get married  the sooner the better
i know  oh  i know that i ll never be able to make up to frieda for all she has lost for my sake  her position in the herrenhof and her friendship with klamm   frieda lifted up her face  her eyes were full of tears and had not a trace of triumph
 why  why am i chosen out from other people    what   asked k
and the landlady simultaneously
 she s upset  poor child   said the landlady   upset by the conjunction of too much happiness and unhappiness   and as if in confirmation of those words frieda now flung herself upon k   kissing him wildly as if there were nobody else in the room  and then weeping  but still clinging to him  fell on her knees before him
while he caressed frieda s hair with both hands k
asked the landlady   you seem to have no objection    you are a man of honour   said the landlady  who also had tears in her eyes
she looked a little worn and breathed with difficulty  but she found strength enough to say   there s only the question now of what guarantees you are to give frieda  for great as is my respect for you  you re a stranger here  there s nobody here who can speak for you  your family circumstances aren t known here  so some guarantee is necessary you must see that  my dear sir  and indeed you touched on it yourself when you mentioned how much frieda must lose through her association with you    of course  guarantees  most certainly   said k    but they ll be best given before the notary  and at the same time other officials of the count s will perhaps be concerned
besides  before i m married there s something i must do
i must have a talk with klamm    that s impossible   said frieda  raising herself a little and pressing close to k    what an idea    but it must be done   said k    if it s impossible for me to manage it  you must    i can t  k   i can t   said frieda
 klamm will never talk to you
how can you even think of such a thing    and won t he talk to you   asked k
 not to me either   said frieda   neither to you nor to me  it s simply impossible   she turned to the landlady with outstretched arms   you see what he s asking for    you re a strange person   said the landlady  and she was an awe inspiring figure now that she sat more upright  her legs spread out and her enormous knees projecting under her thin skirt   you ask for the impossible    why is it impossible   said k  that s what i m going to tell you   said the landlady in a tone which sounded as if her explanation were less a final concession to friendship than the first item in a score of penalties she was enumerating   that s what i shall be glad to let you know although i don t belong to the castle  and am only a woman  only a landlady here in an inn of the lowest kind   it s not of the very lowest but not far from it   and on that account you may not perhaps set much store by my explanation  still i ve kept my eyes open all my life and met many kinds of people and taken the whole burden of the inn on my own shoulders  for martin is no landlord although he s a good man  and responsibility is a thing he ll never understand
it s only his carelessness  for instance  that you ve got to thank   for i was tired to death on that evening   for being here in the village at all  for sitting here on this bed in peace and comfort    what   said k   waking from a kind of absent minded distraction  pricked more by curiosity than by anger
 it s only his carelessness you ve got to thank for it   cried the landlady again  pointing with her forefinger at k
frieda tried to silence her
 i can t help it   said the landlady with a swift turn of her whole body
 the land surveyor asked me a question and i must answer it
there s no other way of making him understand what we take for granted  that herr klamm will never speak to him   will never speak  did i say  can never speak to him
just listen to me  sir
herr klamm is a gentleman from the castle  and that in itself  without considering klamm s position there at all  means that he is of very high rank
but what are you  for whose marriage we are humbly considering here ways and means of getting permission  you are not from the castle  you are not from the village  you aren t anything
or rather  unfortunately  you are something  a stranger  a man who isn t wanted and is in everybody s way  a man who s always causing trouble  a man who takes up the maids  room  a man whose intentions are obscure  a man who has ruined our dear little frieda and whom we must unfortunately accept as her husband
i don t hold all that up against you
you are what you are  and i have seen enough in my lifetime to be able to face facts
but now consider what it is you ask
a man like klamm is to talk with you
it vexed me to hear that frieda let you look through the peephole  when she did that she was already corrupted by you
but just tell me  how did you have the face to look at klamm  you needn t answer  i know you think you were quite equal to the occasion
you re not even capable of seeing klamm as he really is  that s not merely an exaggeration  for i myself am not capable of it cither
klamm is to talk to you  and yet klamm doesn t talk even to people from the village  never yet has he spoken a word himself to anyone in the village it was frieda s great distinction  a distinction i ll be proud of to my dying day  that he used at least to call out her name  and that she could speak to him whenever she liked and was permitted the freedom of the peephole  but even to her he never talked
and the fact that he called her name didn t mean of necessity what one might think  he simply mentioned the name frieda   who can tell what he was thinking of    and that frieda naturally came to him at once was her affair   and that she was admitted without let or hindrance was an act  of grace on klamm s part  but that he deliberately summoned her is more than one can maintain
of course that s all over now for good
klamm may perhaps call  frieda  as before  that s possible  but she ll never again be admitted to his presence  a girl who has thrown herself away upon you
and there s one thing  one thing my poor head can t understand  that a girl who had the honour of being known as klamm s mistress   a wild exaggeration in my opinion   should have allowed you even to lay a finger on her    most certainly  that s remarkable   said k   drawing frieda to his bosom   she submitted at once although with bent head  but in my opinion that only proves the possibility of your being mistaken in some respects
you re quite right  for instance  in saying that i m a mere nothing compared with klamm  and even though i insist on speaking to klamm in spite of that  and am not dissuaded even by your arguments  that does not mean at all that i m able to face klamm without a door between us  or that i mayn t run from the room at the very sight of him
but such a conjecture  even though well founded  is no valid reason in my eyes for refraining from the attempt
if i only succeed in holding my ground there s no need for him to speak to me at all  it will be sufficient for me to see what effect my words have on him  and if they have no effect or if he simply ignores them  i shall at any rate have the satisfaction of having spoken my mind freely to a great man
but you  with your wide knowledge of men and affairs  and frieda  who was only yesterday klamm s mistress   i see no reason for questioning that tide   could certainly procure me an interview with klamm quite easily  if it could be done in no other way i could surely see him in the herrenhof  perhaps he s still there    it s impossible   said the landlady   and i can see that you re incapable of understanding why
but just tell me what you want to speak to klamm about    about frieda  of course   said k
 about frieda   repeated the landlady  uncomprehendingly  and turned to frieda
 do you hear that  frieda  it s about you that he  he  wants to speak to klamm  to klamm    oh   said k    you re a clever and admirable woman  and yet every trifle upsets you
well  there it is  i want to speak to him about frieda  that s not monstrous  it s only natural
and you re quite wrong  too  in supposing that from the moment of my appearance frieda has ceased to be of any importance to klamm
you underestimate him if you suppose that
i m well aware that it s impertinence in me to lay down the law to you in this matter  but i must do it
i can t be the cause of any alteration in klamm s relation to frieda
either there was no essential relationship between them   and that s what it amounts to if people deny that he was her honoured lover   in which case there is still no relationship between them  or else there was a relationship  and then how could i  a cipher in klamm s eyes  as you rightly point out  how could i make any difference to it  one flies to such suppositions in the first moment of alarm  but the smallest reflection must correct one s bias
anyhow  let us hear what frieda herself thinks about it  with a far away look in her eyes and her cheek on k  s breast  frieda said   it s certain  as mother says  that klamm will have nothing more to do with me
but i agree that it s not because of you  darling  nothing of that kind could upset him
i think on the other hand that it was entirely his work that we found each other under  the bar counter  we should bless that hour and not curse it    if that is so   said k
slowly  for frieda s words were sweet  and he shut his eyes a moment or two to let their sweetness penetrate him   if that is so  there is less ground than ever to flinch from an interview with klamm    upon my word   said the landlady  with her nose in the air   you put me in mind of my own husband  you re just as childish and obstinate as he is
you ve been only a few days in the village and already you think you know everything better than people who have spent their lives here  better than an old woman like me  and better than frieda who has seen and heard so much in the herrenhof
i don t deny that it s possible once in a while to achieve something in the teeth of every rule and tradition
i ve never experienced anything of that kind myself  but i believe there are precedents for it
that may well be  but it certainly doesn t happen in the way you re trying to do it  simply by saying  no  no   and sticking to your own opinions and flouting the most well meant advice
do you think it s you i m anxious about  did i bother about you in the least so long as you were by yourself  even though it would have been a good thing and saved a lot of trouble  the only thing i ever said to my husband about you was   keep your distance where he s concerned   and i should have done that myself to this very day if frieda hadn t got mixed up with your affairs
it s her you have to thank   whether you like it or not   for my interest in you  even for my noticing your existence at all
and you can t simply shake me off  for i m the only person who looks after little frieda  and you re strictly answerable to me
maybe frieda is right  and all that has happened is klamm s will  but i have nothing to do with klamm here and now
i shall never speak to him  he s quite beyond my reach
but you re sitting here  keeping my frieda  and being kept yourself   i don t see why i shouldn t tell you   by me
yes  by me  young man  for let me see you find a lodging anywhere in this village if i throw you out  even it were only a dog kennel    thank you   said k    that s frank and i believe you absolutely
so my position is as uncertain as that  is it  and frieda s position  too    no   interrupted the landlady furiously
 frieda s position in this respect has nothing at all to do with yours
frieda belongs to my house  and nobody is entitled to call her position here uncertain    all right  all right   said k    i ll grant you that  too  especially since frieda for some reason i m not able to fathom seems to be too afraid of you to interrupt stick to me then for the present
my position is quite uncertain  you don t deny that  indeed you rather go out of your way to emphasize it
like everything else you say  that has a fair proportion of truth in it  but it isn t absolutely true
for instance  i know where i could get a very good bed if i wanted it    where  where   cried frieda and the landlady simultaneously and so eagerly that they might have had the same motive for asking
 at barnabas s   said k
 that scum   cried the landlady
 that rascally scum i at barnabas s  do you hear    and she turned towards the corner  but the assistants had long quitted it and were now standing arm in arm behind her
and so now  as if she needed support  sne seized one of them by the hand   do you hear where the man goes hobnobbing  with the family of barnabas
oh  certainly he d get a bed there  i only wished he d stay d there overnight instead of in the herrenhof
but where were you two      madam   said k   before the assistants had time to answer   these are my assistants
but you re treating them as if they were your assistants and my keepers
in every other respect i m willing at least to argue the point with you courteously  but not where my assistants are concerned  that s too obvious a matter
i request you therefore not to speak to my assistants  and if my request proves ineffective i shall forbid my assistants to answer you    so i m not allowed to speak to you   said the landlady  and they laughed all three  the landlady scornfully  but with less anger than k
had expected  and the assistants in their usual manner  which meant both much and little and disclaimed all responsibility
 don t get angry   said frieda   you must try to understand why we re upset
i can put it in this way  it s all owing to barnabas that we belong to each other now
when i saw you for the first time in the bar   when you came in arm in arm with olga   well  i knew something about you  but i was quite indifferent to you
i was indifferent not only to you but to nearly everything  yes  nearly everything
for at that time i was discontented about lots of things  and often annoyed  but it was a queer discontent and a queer annoyance
for instance  if one of the customers in the bar insulted me   and they were always after me   you saw what kind of creatures they were  but there were many worse than that  klamm s servants weren t the worst   well  if one of them insulted me  what did that matter to me  i regarded it as if it had happened years before  or as if it had happened to someone else  or as if i had only heard tell of it  or as if i had already forgotten about it
but i can t describe it  i can hardly imagine it now  so different has everything become since losing klamm   and frieda broke off short  letting her head drop sadly  folding her hands on her bosom
 you see   cried the landlady  and she spoke not as if in her own person but as if she had merely lent frieda her voice  she moved nearer  too  and sat close beside frieda   you see  sir  the results of your actions  and your assistants too  whom i am not allowed to speak to  can profit by looking on at them
you ve snatched frieda from the happiest state she had ever known  and you managed to do that largely because in her childish susceptibility she could not bear to see you arm in arm with olga  and so apparently delivered hand and foot to the barnabas family
she rescued you from that and sacrificed herself in doing
and now that it s done  and frieda has given up all she had for the pleasure of sitting on your knee  you come out with this fine trump card that once you had the chance of getting a bed from barnabas
that s by way of showing me that you re independent of me
i assure you  if you had slept in that house you would be so independent of me that in the twinkling of an eye you would be put out of this one    i don t know what sins the family of barnabas have cornmitted   said k   carefully raising frieda   who drooped as if lifeless   setting her slowly down on the bed and standing up himself   you may be right about them  but i know that i was right in asking you to leave frieda and me to settle our own affairs you talked then about your care and affection  yet i haven t seen much of that  but a great deal of hatred and scorn and forbidding me your house
if it was your intention to separate frieda from me or me from frieda it was quite a good move  but all the same i think it won t succeed  and if it does succeed   it s my turn now to issue vague threats you ll repent it
as for the lodging you favour me with   you can only mean this abominable hole   it s not at all certain that you do it of your own free will  it s much more likely that the authorities insist upon it i shall now inform them that i have been told to go   and if i am allotted other quarters you ll probably feel relieved  but not so much as i will myself
and now i m going to discuss this and other business with the superintendent  please be so good as to look after frieda at least  whom you have reduced to a bad enough state with your so called motherly counsel   then he turned to the assistants
 come along   he said  taking klamm s letter from its nail and making for the door
the landlady looked at him in silence  and only when his hand was on the latch did she say   there s something else to take away with you  for whatever you say and however you insult an old woman like me  you re after all frieda s future husband
that s my sole reason for telling you now that your ignorance of the local situation is so appalling that it makes my head go round to listen to you and compare your ideas and opinions with the real state of things
it s a kind of ignorance which can t be enlightened at one attempt  and perhaps never can be  but there s a lot you could learn if you would only believe me a little and keep your own ignorance constantly in mind
for instance  you would at once be less unjust to me  and you would begin to have an inkling of the shock it was to me   a shock from which i m still suffering   when i realized that my dear little frieda had  so to speak  deserted the eagle for the snake in the grass  only the real situation is much worse even than that  and i have to keep on trying to forget it so as to be able to speak civilly to you at all
oh  now you re angry again  no  don t go away yet  listen to this one appeal  wherever you may be  never forget that you re the most ignorant person in the village  and be cautious  here in this house where frieda s presence saves you from harm you can drivel on to your heart s content  for instance  here you can explain to us how you mean to get an interview with klamm  but i entreat you  i entreat you  don t do it in earnest   she stood up  tottering a little with agitation  went over to k   took his hand and looked at him imploringly
 madam   said k    i don t understand why you should stoop to entreat me about a thing like this
if as you say  it s impossible for me to speak to klamm  i won t manage it in any case whether i m entreated or not
but if it proves to be possible  why shouldn t i do it  especially as that would remove your main objection and so make your other premises questionable
of course  i m ignorant  that s an unshaken truth and a sad truth for me  but it gives me all the advantage of ignorance  which is greater daring  and so i m prepared to put up with my ignorance  evil consequences and all  for some time to come  so long as my strength holds out
but these consequences really affect nobody but myself  and that s why i simply can t understand your pleading
i m certain you would always look after frieda  and if i were to vanish from frieda s side you couldn t regard that as anything but good luck
so what are you afraid of  surely you re not afraid   an ignorant man thinks everything possible    here k
flung the door open    surely you re not afraid for klamm   the landlady gazed after him in silence as he ran down the staircase with the assistants following him
to his own surprise k
had little difficulty in obtaining an interview with the superintendent
he sought to explain this to himself by the fact that  going by his experience hitherto  official intercourse with the authorities for him was always very easy this was caused on the one hand by the fact that the word had obviously gone out once and for all to treat his case with the external marks of indulgence  and on the other  by the admirable autonomy of the service  which one divined to be peculiarly effective precisely where it was not visibly present
at the mere thought of those facts  k
was often in danger of considering his situation hopeful  nevertheless  after such fits of easy confidence  he would hasten to tell himself that just there lay his danger direct intercourse with the authorities was not particularly difficult then  for well organized as they might be  all they did was to guard the distant and invisible interests of distant and invisible masters  while k
fought for something vitally near to him  for himself  and moreover  at least at the very beginning  on his own initiative  for he was the attacker  and besides he fought not only for himself  but clearly for other powers as well which he did not know  but in which  without infringing the regulations of the authorities  he was permitted to believe but now by the fact that they had at once amply met his wishes in all unimportant matters   and hitherto only unimportant matters had come up   they had robbed him of the possibility of light and easy victories  and with that of the satisfaction which must accompany them and the well grounded confidence for further and greater struggles which must result from them
instead  they let k
go anywhere he liked   of course only within the village   and thus pampered and enervated him  ruled out all possibility of conflict  and transported him to an unofficial totally unrecognized  troubled  and alien existence
in this life it might easily happen  if he were not always on his guard  until one day or other  in spite of the amiability of the authorities the scrupulous fulfilment of all his exaggeratedly light duties  might   deceived by the apparent favour shown him   conduc himself so imprudently that he might get a fall  and the authorities  still ever mild and friendly  and as it were against their wil but in the name of some public regulation unknown to hit might have to come and clear him out of the way and what was it  this other life to which he was consigned  never yet had k
seen vocation and life so interlaced as here  so interlaced sometimes one might think that they had exchanged places
what importance  for example  had the power  merely formal up till now  which klamm exercised over k  s services  cor pared with the very real power which klamm possessed in k  s bedroom  so it came about that while a light and frivolous bearing  a certain deliberate carelessness was sufficient when one came in direct contact with the authorities  one needed in everything else the greatest caution  and had to look round on every side before one made a single step
k
soon found his opinion of the authorities of the place confirmed when he went to see the superintendent
the superintendent  a kindly  stout  clean shaven man  was laid up  he was suffering from a severe attack of gout  and received k
in bed
 so here is our land surveyor   he said  and tried to sit up  failed in the attempt  and flung himself back again on die cushions  pointing apologetically to his leg in the faint light of the room  where the tiny windows were still further darkened by curtains  a noiseless  almost shadowing woman pushed forward a chair for k
and placed it beside the bed
 take a seat  land surveyor  take a seat   said the superintendent   and let me know your wishes   k
read out klamm s letter and adjoined a few remarks to it
again he had this sense of extraordinary ease in intercourse with the authorities
they seemed literally to bear every burden  one could lay everything on their shoulders and remain free and untouched oneself
as if he  too  felt this in his way  the superintendent made a movement of discomfort on the bed
at length he said   you know about the whole business as  indeed  you have remarked
the reason why i ve done nothing is  firstly  that i ve been unwell  and secondly  that you ve been so long in coming  i thought finally that you had given up the business
but now that you ve been so kind as to look me up  really i must tell you the plain unvarnished truth of the matter
you ve been taken on as land surveyor  as you say  but  unfortunately  we have no need of a land surveyor
there wouldn t be the least use for one here
the frontiers of our little state are marked out and all officially recorded
so what should we do with a land surveyor   though he had not given the matter a moment s thought before  k
was convinced now at the bottom of his heart that he had expected some such response as this
exactly for that reason he was able to reply immediately   this is a great surprise for me
it throws all my calculations out
i can only hope that there s some misunderstanding    no  unfortunately   said the superintendent   it s as i ve said    but how is that possible   cried k
 surely i haven t made this endless journey just to be sent back again    that s another question   replied the superintendent   which isn t for me to decide  but how this misunderstanding became possible  i can certainly explain that
in such a large governmental office as the count s  it may occasionally happen that one department ordains this  another that  neither knows of the other  and though the supreme control is absolutely efficient  it comes by its nature too late  and so every now and then a trifling miscalculation arises
of course that applies only to the pettiest little affairs  as for example your case
in great matters i ve never known of any error yet  but even little affairs are often painful enough
now as for your case  i ll be open with you about its history  and make no official mystery of it   i m not enough of the official for that  i m a farmer and always will remain one
a long time ago   i had only been superintendent for a few months   there came an order  i can t remember from what department  in which in the usual categorical way of the gentlemen up there  it was made known that a land surveyor was to be called in  and the municipality were instructed to hold themselves ready for the plans and measurements necessary for his work this order obviously couldn t have concerned you  for it was many years ago  and i shouldn t have remembered it if i weren t ill just now and with ample time in bed to think of the most absurd things       mizzi   he said  suddenly interrupting his narrative  to the woman who was still flitting about the room in incomprehensible activity   please have a look in the cabinet  perhaps you ll find the order    you see  it belongs to my first months here   he explained to k    at that time i still filed everything away   the woman opened the cabinet at once
k
and the superintendent looked on
the cabinet was crammed full of papers
when it was opened two large packages of papers rolled out  tied in round bundles  as one usually binds firewood  the woman sprang back in alarm
 it must be down below  at the bottom   said the superintendent  directing operations from the bed
gathering the papers in both arms the woman obediently threw them all out of the cabinet so as to read those at the bottom the papers now covered half the floor
 a great deal of work is got through here   said the superintendent nodding his head   and that s only a small fraction of it
i ve put away the most important pile in the shed  but the great mass of it has simply gone astray
who could keep it all together  but there s piles and piles more in the shed    will you be able to find the order   he said  turning again to his wife   you must look for a document with the word land surveyor underlined in blue pencil    it s too dark   said the woman   i ll fetch a candle   and she stamped through the papers to the door  my wife is a great help to me   said the superintendent   in these difficult official affairs  and yet we can never quite keep up with them
true  i have another assistant for the writing that has to be done  the teacher  but all the same it s impossible to get things shipshape  there s always a lot of business that has to be left lying  it has been put away in that chest there   and he pointed to another cabinet
 and just now  when i m laid up  it has got the upper hand   he said  and lay back with a weary yet proud air
 couldn t i   asked k   seeing that the woman had now returned with the candle and was kneeling before the chest looking for the paper   couldn t i help your wife to look for it   the superintendent smilingly shook his head   as i said before  i don t want to make any parade of official secrecy before you  but to let you look through these papers yourself   no  i can t go so far as that   now stillness fell in the room  only the rustling of the papers was to be heard
it looked  indeed  for a few minutes  as if the superintendent were dozing
a faint rapping on the door made k
turn round
it was of course the assistants
all the same they showed already some of the effects of their training  they did not rush at once into the room  but whispered at first through the door which was slightly ajar   it s cold out here    who s that   asked the superintendent  starting up
 it s only my assistants   replied k
 i don t know where to ask them to wait for me  it s too cold outside and here they would be in the way    they won t disturb me   said the superintendent indulgently
 ask them to come in
besides i know them
old acquaintances    but they re in my way   k
replied bluntly  letting his gaze wander from the assistants to the superintendent and back again  and finding on the faces of all three the same smile
 but seeing you re here as it is   he went on experimentally   stay and help the superintendent s lady there to look for a document with the word land surveyor underlined in blue pencil   the superintendent raised no objection
what had not been permitted to k
was allowed to the assistants
they threw themselves at once on the papers  but they did not so much seek for anything as rummage about in the heap  and while one was spelling out a document the other would immediately snatch it out of his hand the woman meanwhile knelt before the empty chest  she seemed to have completely given up looking  in any case the candle was standing quite far away from her
 the assistants   said the superintendent with a self complacent smile  which seemed to indicate that he had the lead  though nobody was in a position even to assume this   they re in your way then  yet they re your own assistants    no   replied k
coolly   they only ran into me here    ran into you   said he   you mean  of course  were assigned to you    all right then  were assigned to me   said k    but they might as well have fallen from the sky  for all the thought that was spent in choosing them    nothing here is done without taking thought   said the superintendent  actually forgetting the pain in his foot and sitting up
 nothing   said k    and what about my being summoned here then    even your being summoned was carefully considered   said the superintendent   it was only certain auxiliary circumstances that entered and confused the matter i ll prove it to you from the official papers    the papers will not be found   said k
 not be found   said the superintendent
 mizzi  please hurry up a bit  still i can tell you the story even without the papers
we replied with thanks to the order that i ve mentioned already  saying that we didn t need a land surveyor
but this reply doesn t appear to have reached the original department   i ll call it a   but by mistake went to another department  b
so department a remained without an answer  but unfortunately our full reply didn t reach b either
whether it was that the order itself was not enclosed by us  or whether it got lost on the way   it was certainly not lost in my department  that i can vouch for   in any case all that arrived at department b was the covering letter  in which was merely noted that the enclosed order  unfortunately an impracticable one  was concerned with the engagement of a land surveyor
meanwhile department a was waiting for our answer  they had  of course  made a memorandum of the case  but as excusably enough often happens and is bound to happen even under the most efficient handling  our correspondent trusted to the fact that we would answer him  after which he would either summon the land surveyor  or else if need be write us further about the matter
as a result he never thought of referring to his memorandum and the whole thing fell into oblivion
but in department b the covering letter came into the hands of a correspondent  famed for his conscientiousness  sordini by name  an italian
it is incomprehensible even to me  though i am one of the initiated  why a man of his capacities is left in an almost subordinate position
this sordini naturally sent the unaccompanied covering letter for completion
now months  if not years  had passed by this time since that first communication from department a  which is understandable enough  for when   which is the rule   a document goes the proper rout it reaches the department at the outside in a day and is settled that day  but when it once in a while loses its way then in an organization so efficient as ours its proper destination must be sought for literally with desperation  otherwise it mightn t be found  and then  well then the search may last really for a long time
accordingly  when we got sordini s note we had only a vague memory of the affair  there were only two of us to do the work at that time  mizzi and myself  the teacher hadn t yet been assigned to us  we only kept copies in the most important instances  so we could only reply in the most vague terms that we knew nothing of this engagement of a land surveyor and that as far as we knew there was no need for one    but   here the superintendent interrupted himself as if  carried on by his tale  he had gone too far  or as if at least it were possible that he had gone too far   doesn t the story bore you    no   said k    it amuses me   thereupon the superintendent said   i m not telling it to amuse you    it only amuses me   said k    because it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling which in certain circumstances may decide the life of a human being    you haven t been given any insight into that yet   replied the superintendent gravely   and i can go on with my story naturally sordini was not satisfied with our reply
i admire the man  although he is a plague to me
he literally distrusts everyone
even if  for instance  he has come to know somebody  through countless circumstances  as the most reliable man in the world  he distrusts him as soon as fresh circumstances arise  as if he didn t want to know him  or rather as if he wanted to know that he was a scoundrel i consider that right and proper  an official must behave like that
unfortunately with my nature i can t follow out this principle  you see yourself how frank i am with you  a stranger  about those things  i can t act in any other way
but sordini  on the contrary  was seized by suspicion when he read our reply
now a large correspondence began to grow
sordini inquired how i had suddenly recalled that a land surveyor shouldn t be summoned
i replied  drawing on mizzi s splendid memory  that the first suggestion had come from the chancellery itself  but that it had come from a different department we had of course forgotten long before this 
sordini countered   why had i only mentioned this official order now   i replied   because i had just remembered it   sordini   that was very extraordinary   myself   it was not in the least extraordinary in such a long drawn out business   sordini   yes  it was extraordinary  for the order that i remembered didn t exist   myself   of course it didn t exist  for the whole document had gone missing   sordini   but there must be a memorandum extant relating to this first communication  and there wasn t one extant   that drew me up  for that an error should happen in sordini s department i neither dared to maintain nor to believe
perhaps  my dear land surveyor  you ll make the reproach against sordini in your mind  that in consideration of my assertion he should have been moved at least to make inquiries in the other departments about the affair
but that is just what would have been wrong  i don t want any blame to attach to this man  no  not even in your thoughts
it s a working principle of the head bureau that the very possibility of error must be ruled out of account
this ground principle is justified by the consummate organization of the whole authority  and it is necessary if the maximum speed in transacting business is to be attained
so it wasn t within sordini s power to make inquiries in other departments  besides they simply wouldn t have answered  because they would have guessed at once that it was a case of hunting out a possible error    allow me  superintendent  to interrupt you with a question   said k
 did you not mention once before a control authority  from your description the whole economy is one that would rouse one s apprehension if onecould imagine the control failing    you re very strict   said the superintendent   but multiply your strictness a thousand times and it would still be nothing compared with the strictness which the authority imposes on itself
only a total stranger could ask a question like yours
is there a control authority  there are only control authorities
frankly it isn t their function to hunt out errors in the vulgar sense  for errors don t happen  and even when once in a while an error does happen  as in your case  who can say finally that it s an error    this is news indeed   cried k
 it s very old news to me   said the superintendent
 not unlike yourself i m convinced that an error has occurred  and as a result sordini is quite ill with despair  and the first control officials  whom we have to thank for discovering the source of error  recognize that there is an error
but who can guarantee that the second control officials will decide in the same way and the third lot and all the others    that may be   said k
 i would much rather not mix in these speculations yet  besides this is the first mention i ve heard of these control officials and naturally i can t understand them yet
but i fancy that two things must be distinguished here  firstly  what is transacted in the offices and can be construed again officially this way or that  and secondly  my own actual person  me myself  situated outside of the offices and threatened by their encroachments  which are so meaningless that i can t even yet believe in the seriousness of the danger
the first evidently is covered by what you  superintendent  tell me in such extraordinary and disconcerting detail
all the same i would like to hear a word now about myself    i m coming to that too   said the superintendent   but you couldn t understand it without my giving a few more preliminary details
my mentioning the control officials just now was premature
so i must turn back to the discrepancies with sordini
as i said  my defence gradually weakened
but whenever sordini has in his hands even the slightest hold against anyone  he has as good as won  for then his vigilance  energy  and alertness are actually increased and it s a terrible moment for the victim  and a glorious one for the victim s enemies
it s only because in other circumstances i have experienced this last feeling that i m able to speak of him as i do all the same i have never managed yet to come within sight of him
he can t get down here  he s so overwhelmed with work
from the descriptions i ve heard of his room every wail is covered with columns of documents tied together  piled on top of one another
those are only the documents that sordini is working on at the time  and as bundles of papers are continually being taken away and brought in  and all in great haste  those columns are always falling on the floor  and it s just those perpetual crashes  following fast on one another  that have come to distinguish sordini s workroom
yes  sordini is a worker and he gives the same scrupulous care to the smallest case as to the greatest    superintendent   said k    you always call my case one of the smallest  and yet it has given hosts of officials a great deal of trouble  and if  perhaps  it was unimportant at the start  yet through the diligence of officials of sordini s type it has grown into a great affair
very much against my will  unfortunately  for my ambition doesn t run to seeing columns of documents  all about me  rising and crashing together  but to working quietly at my drawing board as a humble land surveyor    no   said the superintendent   it s not at all a great affair  in
that respect you ve no ground for complaint   it s one of the
least important among the least important
the importance of a case is not determined by the amount of work it involves  you re far from understanding the authorities if you believe that
but even if it s a question of the amount of work  your case would remain one of the slightest
ordinary cases  those without any so called errors i mean  provide far more work and far more profitable work as well
besides you know absolutely nothing yet of the actual work which was caused by your case
i ll tell you about that now
well  presently sordini left me out of count  but the clerks arrived  and every day a formal inquiry involving the most prominent members of the community was held in the herrenhof
the majority stuck by me  only a few held back   the question of a land surveyor appeals to peasants   they scented secret plots and injustices and what not  found a leader  no less  and sordini was forced by their assertions to the conviction that if i had brought the question forward in the town council  every voice wouldn t have been against the summoning of a land surveyor
so a commonplace   namely  a land surveyor wasn t needed   was turned after all into doubtful matter at least
a man called brunswick distinguish himself especially  you don t know him  of course probably he s not a bad man  only stupid and fanciful  he s a son in law of lasemann s    of the master tanner   asked k   and he described the fullbearded man whom he had seen at lasemann s
 yes  that s the man   said the superintendent
 i know his wife  too   said k
a little at random
 that s possible   replied the superintendent briefly
 she s beautiful   said k    but rather pale and sickly
she comes  of course  from the castle   it was half a question
the superintendent looked at the clock  poured some medicine into a spoon  and gulped at it hastily
 you only know the official side of the castle   asked k
bluntly
 that s so   replied the superintendent  with an ironical and yet grateful smile   and it s the most important
and as for brunswick  if we could exclude him from the council we would almost all be glad  and lasemann not least
but at that time brunswick gained some influence  he s not an orator of course  but a shouter
but even that can do a lot
and so it came about that i was forced to lay the matter before the town council
however  it was brunswick s only immediate triumph  for of course the town council refused by a large majority to hear anything about a land surveyor
that  too  was a long time ago  but the whole time since the matter has never been allowed to rest  partly owing to sordini s conscientiousness  who by the most painful sifting of data sought to fathom the motives of the majority no less than the opposition  partly owing to brunswick s stupidity and ambition  who had several personal acquaintances among the authorities whom he set working with fresh inventions of his fancy
sordini  at any rate  didn t let himself be deceived by brunswick   how could brunswick deceive sordini    but simply to prevent himself from being deceived a new sifting of data was necessary  and long before it was ended brunswick had already thought out something new he s very  very versatile  no doubt of it  that goes with his stupidity
and now i come to a peculiar characteristic of our administrative apparatus
along with its precision it s extremely sensitive as well
when an affair has been weighed for a very long time  it may happen  even before the matter has been fully considered  that suddenly in a flash the decision comes in some unforeseen place  that  moreover  can t be found any longer later on  a decision that settles the matter  if in most cases justly  yet all the same arbitrarily
it s as if the administrative apparatus were unable any longer to bear the tension the yearlong irritation caused by the same affair   probably trivial in itself and had hit upon the decision by itself  without the assistance of the officials
of course a miracle didn t happen and certainly it was some clerk who hit upon the solution or the unwritten decision  but in any case it couldn t be discovered by us  at least by us here  or even by the head bureau  which clerk had decided in this case and on what grounds
the control officials only discovered that much later  but we will never learn it
besides by this time it would scarcely interest anybody
now  as i said  it s just these decisions that are generally excellent
the only annoying thing about them   it s usually the case with such things   is that one learns too late about them and so in the meantime keeps on still passionately canvassing things that were decided long ago
i don t know whether in your case a decision of this kind happened   some people say yes  others no   but if it had happened then the summons would have been sent to you and you would have made the long journey to this place  much time would have passed  and in the meanwhile sordini would have been working away here all the time on the same case until he was exhausted
brunswick would have been intriguing  and i would have been plagued by both of them
i only indicate this possibility  but i know the following for a fact  a control official discovered meanwhile that a query had gone out from the department a to the town council many years before regarding a land surveyor  without having received a reply up till then
a new inquiry was sent to me  and now the whole business was really cleared up
department a was satisfied with my answer that a  land surveyor was not needed  and sordini was forced to recognize that he had not been equal to this case and  innocently it is true  had got through so much nerveracking work for nothing
if new work hadn t come rushing in as ever from every side  and if your case hadn t been a very unimportant case   one might almost say the least important among the unimportant we might all of us have breathed freely again  i fancy even sordini himself brunswick was the only one that grumbled  but that was only ridiculous
and now imagine to yourself  land surveyor  my dismay when after the fortunate end of the whole business   and since then  too  a great deal of time had passed by suddenly you appear and it begins to look as if the whole thing must begin all over again
you ll understand of course that i m firmly resolved  so far as i m concerned  not to let that happen in any case    certainly   said k    but i understand better still that a terrible abuse of my case  and probably of the law  is being carried on
as for me  i shall know how to protect myself against it    how will you do it   asked the superintendent
 i m not at liberty to reveal that   said k
 i don t want to press myself upon you   said the superintendent   only i would like you to reflect that in me you have   i won t say a friend  for we re complete strangers of course   but to some extent a business friend
the only thing i will not agree to is that you should be taken on as land surveyor  but in other matters you can draw on me with confidence  frankly to the extent of my power  which isn t great    you always talk of the one thing   said k    that i shan t be taken on as land surveyor  but i m land surveyor already  here is klamm s letter    klamm s letter   said the superintendent
 that s valuable and worthy of respect on account of klamm s signature which seems to be genuine  but all the same   yet i won t dare to advance it on my own unsupported word mizzi   he called  and then   but what are you doing   mizzi and the assistants  left so long unnoticed  had clearly not found the paper they were looking for  and had then tried to shut everything up again in the cabinet  but on account of the confusion and superabundance of papers had not succeeded
then the assistants had hit upon the idea which they were carrying out now
they had laid the cabinet on its back on the floor  crammed all the documents in  then along with mizzi had knelt on the cabinet door and were trying now in this way to get it shut
 so the paper hasn t been found   said the superintendent
 a pity  but you know the story already
really we don t need the paper now  besides it will certainly be found sometime yet
probably it s at the teacher s place  there s a great pile of papers there too
but come over here now with the candle  mizzi  and read this letter for me   mizzi went over and now looked still more grey and insignificant as she sat on the edge of the bed and leaned against the strong  vigorous man  who put his arm round her
in the candlelight only her pinched face was cast into relief  its simple and austere lines softened by nothing but age
hardly had she glanced at the letter when she clasped her hands lightly and said   from klamm   then they read the letter together  whispered for a moment  and at last  just as the assistants gave a  hurrah   for they had finally got the cabinet door shut which earned them a look of silent gratitude from mizzi   then superintendent said   mizzi is quite of my opinion and now i am at liberty to press it
this letter is in no sense an official letter  but only a private letter
that can be clearly seen in the very mode of address   my dear sir   moreover  there isn t a single word in it showing that you ve been taken on as land surveyor
on the contrary it s all about state service in general  and even that is not absolutely guaranteed  as you know  that is  the task of proving that you are taken on is laid on you
finally  you are officially and expressly referred to me  the superintendent  as your immediate superior  for more detailed information  which  indeed  has in great part been given already
to anyone who knows how to read official communications  and consequently knows still better how to read unofficial letters  all this is only too clear
that you  a stranger  don t know it doesn t surprise me
in general the letter means nothing more than that klamm intends to take a personal interest in you if you should be taken into the state service    superintendent   said k    you interpret the letter so well that nothing remains of it but a signature on a blank sheet of paper
don t you see that in doing this you depreciate klamm s name  which you pretend to respect    you misunderstand me   said the superintendent   i don t change the meaning of the letter  my reading of it doesn t disparage it  on the contrary
a private letter from klamm has naturally far more significance than an official letter  but it hasn t precisely the kind of significance that you attach to it    do you know schwarzer   asked k
 no   replied the superintendent
 perhaps you know him  mizzi  you don t know him either  no  we don t know him    that s strange   said k    he s a son of one of the undercastellans    my dear land surveyor   replied the superintendent   how on earth should i know all the sons of all the under castellans    right   said k    then you ll just have to take my word that he is one
i had a sharp encounter with this schwarzer on the very day of my arrival
afterwards he made a telephone inquiry of an under castellan called fritz and received the information that i was engaged as land surveyor
how do you explain that  superintendent    very simply   replied the superintendent
 you haven t once up till now come into real contact with our authorities
all those contacts of yours have been illusory  but owing to your ignorance of the circumstances you take them to be real and as for the telephone
as you see  in my place  though i ve certainly enough to do with the authorities  there s no telephone
in inns and suchlike places it may be of real use  as much use say as a penny in the slot musical instrument  but it s nothing more than that
have you ever telephoned here  yes  well  then perhaps you ll understand what i say
in the castle the telephone works beautifully of course  i ve been told it s going there all the time  that naturally speeds up the work a great deal
we can hear this continual telephoning in our telephones down here as a humming and singing  you must have heard it too
now this humming and singing transmitted by our telephones is the only real and reliable thing you ll hear  everything else is deceptive
there s no fixed connexion with the castle  no central exchange transmits our calls further
when anybody calls up the castle from here the instruments in all the subordinate departments ring  or rather they would all ring if practically all the departments  1 know it for a certainty   didn t leave their receivers off
now and then  however  a fatigued official may feel the need of a little distraction  especially in the evenings and at night and may hang the receiver on
then we get an answer  but an answer of course that s merely a practical joke
and that s very understandable too
for who would take the responsibility of interrupting  in the middle of the night  the extremely important work up there that goes on furiously the whole time  with a message about his own little private troubles  i can t comprehend how even a stranger can imagine that when he calls up sordini  for example  it s really sordini that answers
far more probably it s a little copying clerk from an entirely different department
on the other hand  it may certainly happen once in a blue moon that when one calls up the little copying clerk sordini will answer himself then finally the best thing is to fly from the telephone before the first sound comes through    i didn t know it was like that  certainly   said k
 i couldn t know of all these peculiarities  but i didn t put much confidence in those telephone conversations and i was always aware that tfo only things of real importance were those that happened in the castle itself    no   said the superintendent  holding firmly on to the words   these telephone replies certainly have a meaning  why shouldn t they  how could a message given by an official from the castld be unimportant  as i remarked before apropos klamm s letter
all these utterances have no official significance
when you attach official significance to them you go astray
on the other hand  their private significance in a friendly or hostile sense is very great  generally greater than an official communication could ever be    good   said k
 granted that all this is so  i should have lots of good friends in the castle
looked at rightly the sudden inspiration of that department all these years ago   saying that a land surveyor should be asked to come was an act of friendship towards myself
but then in the sequel one act was followed by another  until at last  on an evil day  i was enticed here and then threatened with being thrown out again   there s a certain amount of truth in your view of the case   said the superintendent   you re right in thinking that the pronouncements of the castle are not to be taken literally
but caution is always necessary  not only here  and always the more necessary the more important the pronouncement in question happens to be
but when you went on to talk about being enticed  i ceased to fathom you
if you had followed my explanation more carefully  then you must have seen that the question of your being summoned here is far too difficult to be settled here and now in the course of a short conversation    so the only remaining conclusion   said k    is that everything is very uncertain and insoluble  including my being thrown out    who would take the risk of throwing you out  land surveyor   asked the superintendent
 the very uncertainty about your summons guarantees you the most courteous treatment  only you re too sensitive by all appearances
nobody keeps you here  but that surely doesn t amount to throwing you out    oh  superintendent   said k    now again you re taking far too simple a view of the case
i ll enumerate for your benefit a few of the things that keep me here  the sacrifice i made in leaving my home  the long and difficult journey  the wellgrounded hopes i built on my engagement here  my complete lack of means  the impossibility after this of finding some other suitable job at home  and last but not least my fiancee  who lives here    oh  frieda   said the superintendent without showing any surprise
 i know
but frieda would follow you anywhere
as for the rest of what you ve said  some consideration will be necessary and i ll communicate with the castle about it
if a decision should be come to  or if it should be necessary first to interrogate you again  i ll send for you
is that agreeable to you    no  absolutely   said k    i don t want any act of favour from the castle  but my rights    mizzi   the superintendent said to his wife  who still sat pressed against him  and lost in a day dream was playing with klamm s letter  which she had folded into the shape of a little boat   k
snatched it from her in alarm
 mizzi  my foot is beginning to throb again  we must renew the compress   k
got up
 then i ll take my leave   he said
 hm   said mizzi  who was already preparing a poultice   the last one was drawing too strongly   k
turned away
at his last words the assistants with their usual misplaced zeal to be useful had thrown open both wings of the door
to protect the sickroom from the strong draught of cold air which was rushing in  k
had to be content with making the superintendent a hasty bow
then  pushing the assistants in front of him  he rushed out of the room and quickly closed the door
before the inn the landlord was waiting for him
without being questioned he would not have ventured to address him  accordingly k
asked what he wanted
 have you found new lodgings yet   asked the landlord  looking at the ground
 you were told to ask by your wife   replied k    you re very much under her influence    no   said the landlord   i didn t ask because of my wife
but she s very bothered and unhappy on your account  can t work  lies in bed and sighs and complains all the time    shall i go and see her   asked k
 i wish you would   said the landlord
 i ve been to the superintendent s already to fetch you i listened at the door but you were talking
i didn t want to disturb you  besides i was anxious about my wife and ran back again
but she wouldn t see me  so there was nothing for it but to wait for you    then let s go at once   said k    i ll soon reassure her    if you could only manage it   said the landlord
they went through the bright kitchen where three or four maids  engaged all in different corners at the work they were happening to be doing  visibly stiffened on seeing k
from the kitchen the sighing of the landlady could already be heard
she lay in a windowless annex separated from the kitchen by thin lath boarding
there was room in it only for a huge family bed and a chest
the bed was so placed that from it one could see over the whole kitchen and superintend the work
from the kitchen  on the other hand  hardly anything could be seen in the annex
there it was quite dark
only the faint gleam of the upper bed coverlet could be distinguished
not until one s eyes become used to the darkness did one detach particular objects
 you ve come at last   said the landlady feebly
she was lying stretched out on her back  she breathed with visible difficulty  she had thrown back the feather quilt in bed she looked much younger than in her clothes  but a nightcap of delicate lacework which she wore  although it was too small and nodded on her head  made her sunk face look pitiable
 why should i have come   asked k
mildly
 you didn t send for me    you shouldn t have kept me waiting so long   said the landlady with the capriciousness of an invalid
 sit down   she went on  pointing to the bed   and you others go away   meantime the maids as well as the assistants had crowded in
 i ll go too  gardana   said the landlord
this was the first time that k
had heard her name
 of course   she replied slowly  and as if she were occupied with other thoughts she added absently   why should you remain any more than the others   but when they had all retreated to the kitchen even the assistants this time went at once  besides  a maid was behind them   gardana was alert enough to grasp that everything she said could be heard in there  for the annex lacked a door  and so she commanded everyone to leave the kitchen as well
it was immediately done
 land surveyor   said gardana   there s a wrap hanging over there beside the chest  will you please reach me it  i ll lay it over me
i can t bear the feather quilt  my breathing is so bad   and as k
handed her the wrap  she went on   look  this is a beautiful wrap  isn t it   to k
it seemed to be an ordinary woollen wrap
he felt it with his fingers again merely out of politeness  but did not reply
 yes  it s a beautiful wrap   said gardana covering herself up
now she lay back comfortably  all her pain seemed to have gone  she actually had enough strength to think of the state of her hair which had been disordered by her lying position  she raised herself up for a moment and rearranged her coiffure a little round the nightcap
her hair was abundant
k
became impatient  and began   you asked me  madam  whether i had found other lodgings yet    i asked you   said the landlady   no  you re mistaken    your husband asked me a few minutes ago    that may well be   said the landlady   i m at variance with him
when i didn t want you here  he kept you here  now that i m glad to have you here  he wants to drive you away
he s always like that    have you changed your opinion of me so greatly  then   asked k
 in a couple of hours    i haven t changed my opinion   said the landlady more freely again   give me your hand
there  and now promise to be quite frank with me and i ll be the same with you    right   said k    but who s to begin first    i shall   said the landlady
she did not give so much the impression of one who wanted to meet k
half way  as of one who was eager to have the first word
she drew a photograph from under the pillow and held it out to k
 look at that portrait   she said eagerly
to see it better k
stepped into the kitchen  but even there it was not easy to distinguish anything on the photograph  for it was faded with age  cracked in several places  crumpled  and dirty
 it isn t in very good condition   said k
 unluckily no   said the landlady   when one carries a thing about with one for years it s bound to be the case
but if you look at it carefully  you ll be able to make everything out  you ll see
but i can help you
tell me what you see  i like to hear anyone talk about the portrait
well  then    a young man   said k
 right   said the landlady   and what s he doing    it seems to me he s lying on a board stretching himself and yawning   the landlady laughed  quite wrong   she said  but here s the board and here he is lying on it   persisted k
on his side
 but look more carefully   said the landlady in annoyance   is he really lying down    no   said k
now   he s floating  and now i can see it  it s not a board at all  but probably a rope  and the young man is taking a high leap    you see   replied the landlady triumphantly   he s leaping  that s how the i official messengers practise
i knew quite well that you would make it out
can you make out his face  too    i can only make out his face very dimly   said k    he s obviously making a great leap
his mouth is open  his eyes tightly shut and his hair flutter    well done   said the landlady appreciatively   nobody who ever saw him could have made out more than that but he was a beautiful young man
i only saw him once for a second and i ll never forget him    who was he then   asked k
 he was the messenger that klamm sent to call me to him the first rime   k could not hear properly  his attention was distracted by the rattling of glass
he immediately discovered the cause of the disturbance
the assistants were standing outside in the yard hopping from one foot to the other in the snow  behaving as if they were glad to see him again
in their joy they pointed each other out to him and kept tapping all the time on the kitchen window
at a threatening gesture from k
they stopped at once  tried to pull one another away  but the one would slip immediately from the grasp of the other and soon they were both back at the window again
k
hurried into the annex where the assistants could not see him from outside and he would not have to see them
but the soft and as it were beseeching tapping on the window pane followed him there too for a long time
 the assistants again   he said apologetically to the landlady and pointed outside
but she paid no attention to him
she had taken the portrait from him  looked at it  smoothed it out  and pushed it again under her pillow
her movements had become slower  but not with weariness  but with the burden of memory
she had wanted to tell k
the story of her life and had forgotten about him in thinking of the story itself
she was playing with the fringe of her wrap
a little time went by before she looked up  passed her hand over her eyes  and said   this wrap was given me by klamm
and the nightcap  too
the portrait  the wrap  and the nightcap  these are the only three things of his i have as keepsakes
i m not young like frieda  i m not so ambitious as she is  nor so sensitive either  she s very sensitive to put it bluntly  i know how to accommodate myself to life  but one thing i must admit  i couldn t have held out so long here without these three keepsakes
perhaps these three things seem very trifling to you  but let me tell you  frieda  who has had relations with klamm for a long time  doesn t possess a single keepsake from him
i have asked her  she s too fanciful  and too difficult to please besides  i  on the other hand  though i was only three times with klamm  after that he never asked me to come again  i don t know why i managed to bring three presents back with me all the same  having a premonition that my time would be short
of course one must make a point of it
klamm gives nothing of himself  but if one sees something one likes lying about there  one can get it out of him   k felt uncomfortable listening to these tales  much as they interested him
 how long ago was all that  then   he asked with a sigh
 over twenty years ago   replied the landlady   considerably over twenty years    so one remains faithful to klamm as long as that   said k
 but are you aware  madam  that these stories give me grave alarm when i think of my future married life   the landlady seemed to consider this intrusion of his own affairs unseasonable and gave him an angry sidelook
 don t be angry  madam   said k
 i ve nothing at all to say against klamm
all the same  by force of circumstances i have come in a sense in contact with klamm that can t be gainsaid even by his greatest admirer
well  then
as a result of that i am forced whenever klamm is mentioned to think of myself as well  that can t be altered
besides  madam   here k
took hold of her reluctant hand   reflect how badly our last talk turned out and that this time we want to part in peace    you re right   said the landlady  bowing her head   but spare me
i m not more touchy than other people
on the contrary  everyone has his sensitive spots  and i only have this one    unfortunately it happens to be mine too   said k    but promise to control myself
now tell me  madam  how i am put up with my married life in face of this terrible fidelity granted that frieda  too  resembles you in that    terrible fidelity    repeated the landlady with a growl
 is it a question of fidelity  i m faithful to my husband but klamm once chose me as his mistress  can i ever lose this honour  and you ask how you are to put up with frieda  land surveyor  who are you after all that you dare ask such things    j fadam   said k
warningly
 i know   said the landlady  controlling herself   but my husband never put such questions
i don t know which to call the unhappier   myself then or frieda now
frieda who saucily left klamm  or myself whom he stopped asking to come
yet it is probably frieda  though she hasn t even yet guessed the full extent of her unhappiness  it seems still  my thoughts were more exclusively occupied by my unhappiness then  all the same  for i had always to be asking myself one question  and in reality haven t ceased to ask it to this day  why did this happen  three times klamm sent for me  but he never sent a fourth time  no  never a fourth time
what else could i have thought of during those days  what else could i have talked about with my husband  whom i married shortly afterwards  during the day we had no time  we had taken over this inn in a wretched condition and had to struggle to make it respectable  but at night   for years all our nightly talks turned on klamm and the reason for his changing his mind
and if my husband fell asleep during those talks i woke him and we went on again    now   said k    if you ll permit me  i m going to ask a very rude question   the landlady remained silent
 then i mustn t ask it   said k
 well  that serves my purpose as well    yes   replied the landlady   that serves your purpose as well  and just that serves it best
you misconstrue everything  even a person s silence
you can t do anything else
i allow you to ask your question    if i misconstrue everything  perhaps i misconstrue my question as well  perhaps it s not so rude after all
i only want to know how you came to meet your husband and how this inn came into your hands   the landlady wrinkled her forehead  but said indifferently   that s a very simple story
my father was the blacksmith  and hans  my husband  who was a groom at a big farmer s place  came often to see him
that was just after my last meeting with klamm
i was very unhappy and really had no right to be so  for everything had gone as it should  and that i wasn t allowed any longer to see klamm was klamm s own decision
it was as it should be then  only the grounds for it were obscure
i was entitled to inquire into them  but i had no right to be unhappy
still i was  all the same  couldn t work  and sat in our front garden all day
there hans saw me  often sat down beside me
i didn t complain to him  but he knew how things were  and as he was a good young man  he wept with me
the wife of the landlord at that time had died and he had consequently to give up business  besides he was already an old man
well once as he passed our garden and saw us sitting there  he stopped  and without more ado offered us the inn to rent  didn t ask for any money in advance  for he trusted us  and set the rent at a very low figure
i didn t want to be a burden on my father  nothing else mattered to me  and so thinking of the inn and of my new work that might perhaps help me to forget a little  i gave hans my hand
that s the whole story   there was silence for a little  then k
said   the behaviour of the landlord was generous  but rash  or had he particular grounds for trusting you both    he knew hans well   said the landlady
 he was hans s uncle    well then   said k    hans s family must have been very anxious to be connected with you    it may be so   said the landlady   i don t know
i ve never bothered about it    but it must have been so all the same   said k    seeing that the family was ready to make such a sacrifice and to give the inn into your hands absolutely without security    it wasn t imprudent  as was proved later   said the landlady
 i threw myself into the work  i was strong  i was the blacksmith s daughter  i didn t need maid or servant
i was everywhere  in the taproom  in the kitchen  in the stables  in the yard
  i cooked so well that i even enticed some of the herrenhof s customers away
you ve never been in the inn yet at lunchtime  you don t know our day customers
at that time there were more of them  many of them have stopped coming since
and the consequence was that we were able not merely to pay the t regularly  but after a few years we bought the whole place
today it s practically free of debt
the further consequence  i admit  was that i ruined my health  got heart disease  and am now an old woman
probably you think that i m much older than hans  but the fact is that he s only two or three years younger than me and will never grow any older either  for at his work   smoking his pipe  listening to the customers  knocking out his pipe again  and fetching an occasional pot of beer at that sort of work one doesn t grow old    what you ve done has been splendid   said k  i don t doubt that for a moment  but we were speaking of the time before your marriage  and it must have been an extraordinary thing at that stage for hans s family to press on the marriage   at a money sacrifice  or at least at such a great risk as the handing over of the inn must have been  and without trusting in anything but your powers of work  which besides nobody knew of then  and hans s powers of work  which everybody must have known beforehand were nil    oh  well   said the landlady wearily
 i know what you re getting at and how wide you are of the mark
klamm had absolutely nothing to do with the matter
why should he have concerned himself about me  or better  how could he in any case have concerned himself about me  he knew nothing about me by that time the fact that he had ceased to summon me was a sign that he had forgotten me
when he stops summoning people  he forgets them completely
i didn t want to talk of this before frieda
and it s not mere forgetting  it s something more than that
for anybody one has forgotten can come back to one s memory again  of course
with klamm that s impossible
anybody that he stops summoning he has forgotten completely  not only as far as the past is concerned  but literally for the future as well
if i try very hard i can of course think myself into your ideas  valid  perhaps  in the very different land you come from
but it s next thing to madness to imagine that klamm could have given me hans as a husband simply that i might have no great difficulty in going to him if he should summon me sometime again
where is the man who could hinder me from running to klamm if klamm lifted his little finger  madness  absolute madness  one begins to feel confused oneself when one plays with such mad ideas    no   said k    i ve no intention of getting confused
my thoughts hadn t gone so far as you imagined  though  to tell the truth  they were on that road
for the moment the only thing that surprises me is that hans s relations expected so much from his marriage and that these expectations were actually fulfilled  at the sacrifice of your sound heart and your health  it is true
the idea that these facts were connected with klamm occurred to me  i admit  but not with the bluntness  or not till now with the bluntness that you give it   apparently with no object but to have a dig at me  because that gives you pleasure
well  make the most of your pleasure  my idea  however  was this  first of all klamm was obviously the occasion of your marriage
if it hadn t been for klamm you wouldn t have been unhappy and wouldn t have been sitting doing nothing in the garden  if it hadn t been for klamm hans wouldn t have seen you sitting there  if it hadn t been that you were unhappy a shy man like hans would never have ventured to speak  if it hadn t been for klamm hans would never have found you in tears  if it hadn t been for klamm the good old uncle would never have seen you sitting there together peacefully  if it hadn t been for klamm you wouldn t have been indifferent to what life still offered you  and therefore would never have married hans
now in all this there s enough of klamm already  it seems to me but that s not all
if you hadn t been trying to forget  you certainly wouldn t have overtaxed your strength so much and done so splendidly with the inn
so klamm was there too
but apart from that klamm is also the root cause of your illness  for before your marriage your heart was already worn out with your hopeless passion for him
the only question that remains now is  what made hans s relatives so eager for the marriage  you yourself said just now that to be klamm s mistress is a distinction that can t be lost  so it may have been that that attracted them
but besides that  i imagine  they had the hope that the lucky star that led you to klamm   assuming that it was a lucky star  but you maintain that it was   was your star and so would reinstant to you and not leave you quite so quickly and suddenly as klamm did    do you mean all this in earnest   asked the landlady
 yes  in earnest   replied k
immediately   only i consider hans s relations were neither entirely right nor entirely wrong  n their hopes  and i think  too  i can see the mistake that they made
in appearance  of course  everything seems to have succeeded hans is well provided for  he has a handsome wife  is looked up to  and the inn is free of debt
yet in reality everything has not succeeded  he would certainly have been much happier with a simple girl who gave him her first love  and if he sometimes stands in the inn there as if lost  as you complain  and because he really feels as if he were lost   without being unhappy over it  i grant you  i know that much about him already   it s just as true that a handsome  intelligent young man like him would be happier with another wife  and by happier i mean more independent  industrious  manly
and you yourself certainly can t be happy  seeing you say you wouldn t be able to go on without these three keepsakes  and your heart is bad  too
then were hans s relatives mistaken in their hopes  i don t think so
the blessing was over you  but they didn t know how to bring it down    then what did they miss doing   asked the landlady
she was lying outstretched on her back now gazing up at the ceiling  to ask klamm   said k
 so we re back at your case again   said the landlady
 or at yours   said k
 our affairs run parallel    what do you want from klamm   asked the landlady
she had sat up  had shaken out the pillows so as to lean her back against them  and looked k
full in the eyes
 i ve told you frankly about my experiences  from which you should have been able to learn something
tell me now as frankly what you want to ask klamm
i ve had great trouble in persuading frieda to go up to her room and stay there  i was afraid you wouldn t talk freely enough in her presence    i have nothing to hide   said k
 but first of all i want to draw your attention to something
klamm forgets immediately  you say
now in the first place that seems very improbable to me  and secondly it is undemonstrable  obviously nothing more than legend  thought out moreover by the flappcrish minds of those who have been in klamm s favour i m surprised that you believe in such a banal invention    it s no legend   said the landlady   it s much rather the result of general experience    i see  a thing then to be refuted by further experience   said k
 besides there s another distinction still between your case and frieda s
in frieda s case it didn t happen that klamm never summoned her again  on the contrary he summoned her but she didn t obey
it s even possible that he s still waiting for her   the landlady remained silent  and only looked k
up and down with a considering stare
at last she said   i ll try to listen quietly to what you have to say
speak frankly and don t spare my feelings
i ve only one request
don t use klamm s name
call him  him  or something  but don t mention him by name    willingly   replied k    but what i want from him is difficult to express
firstly  i want to see him at close quarters
then i want to hear his voice
then i want to get from him what his attitude is to our marriage
what i shall ask from him after that depends on the outcome of our interview
lots of things may come up in the course of talking  but still the most important thing for me is to be confronted with him
you see i haven t yet spoken with a real official
that seems to be more difficult to manage than i had thought but now i m put under the obligation of speaking to him as a private person  and that  in my opinion  is much easier to bring about
as an official i can only speak to him in his bureau in the castle  which may be inaccessible  or   and that s questionable  too   in the herrenhof
but as a private person i can speak to him anywhere  in a house  in the street  wherever i happen to meet him
if i should find the official in front of me  then i would be glad to accost him as well  but that s not my primary object    right   said the landlady pressing her face into the pillows as if she were uttering something shameful   if by using my influence i can manage to get your request for an interview passed on to klamm  promise me to do nothing on your own account until the reply comes back    i can t promise that   said k    glad as i would be to fulfil ur wishes or your whims the matter is urgent  you see  specify after the unfortunate outcome of my talk with the superintendent    that excuse falls to the ground   said the landlady   the superintendent is a person of no importance
haven t you found that out  he couldn t remain another day in his post if it weren t for his wife  who runs everything    mizzi   asked k
the landlady nodded
 she was present   said k
 did she express her opinion   asked the landlady
 no   replied k    but i didn t get the impression that she could    there   said the landlady   you see how distorted your view of everything here is
in any case the superintendent s arrangements for you are of no importance  and i ll talk to his wife when i have time
and if i promise now in addition that klamm s answer will come in a week at latest  you can t surely have any further grounds for not obliging me    all that is not enough to influence me   said k
 my decision is made  and i would try to carry it out even if an unfavourable answer were to come
and seeing that this is my fixed intention  i can t very well ask for an interview beforehand
a thing that would remain a daring attempt  but still an attempt in good faith so long as i didn t ask for an interview  would turn into an open transgression of the law after receiving an unfavourable answer
that frankly would be far worse    worse   said the landlady
 it s a transgression of the law in any case
and now you can do what you like
reach me over my skirt   without paying any regard to k  s presence she pulled on her skirt and hurried into the kitchen
for a long time already k
had been hearing noises in the dining room
there was a tap ping on the kitchen hatch
the assistants had unfastened it and were shouting that they were hungry
then other faces appeared at it
one could even hear a subdued song being chanted by several voices
undeniably k  s conversation with the landlady had greatly delayed the cooking of the midday meal  it was not ready yet and the customers had assembled
nevertheless nobody had dared to set foot in the kitchen after the landlady s order
but now when the observers at the hatch reported that the landlady was coming  the maids immediately ran back to the kitchen  and as k
entered the dining room a surprisingly large cornpany  more than twenty  men and women   all attired in provincial but not rustic clothes streamed back from the hatch to the tables to make sure of their seats
only at one little table in the corner was a married couple seated already with a few children
the man  a kindly  blue eyed person with disordered grey hair and beard  stood bent over the children and with a knife beat time to their singing  which he perpetually strove to soften
perhaps he was trying to make them forget their hunger by singing
the landlady threw a few indifferent words of apology to her customers  nobody complained of her conduct
she looked round for the landlord  who had fled from the difficulty of the situation  however  long ago
when she went slowly into the kitchen  she did not take any more notice of k   who hurried to frieda in her room
at upstairs k
ran into the teacher
the room was improved by almost beyond recognition  so well had frieda set to work
it was well aired  the stove amply stoked  the floor scrubbed  the bed put in order  the maids  filthy pile of things and even their photographs cleared away
the table  which had literally struck one in the eye before with its crust of accumulated dust  was covered with a white embroidered cloth
one was in a position to receive visitors now
k  s small change of underclothes hanging before the fire   frieda must have washed them early in the morning   did not spoil the impression much
frieda and the teacher were sitting at the table  they rose at k  s entrance
frieda greeted k
with a kiss  the teacher bowed slightly
distracted and still agitated by his talk with the landlady  k
began to apologize for not having been able yet to visit the teacher
it was as if he were assuming that the teacher had called on him finally because he was impatient at k  s absence
on the other hand the teacher in his precise way only seemed now gradually remember that sometime or other there had been some matter between k
and himself of a visit  you must be  land surveyor   he said slowly   the stranger i had a few words with he other day in the church square    i am   replied k
shortly
the behaviour which he had submitted to when he felt homeless he did not intend to put up with now here in his room
he turned to frieda and consulted with her about an important visit which he had to pay at once and for which he would need his best clothes
without further inquiry frieda called over the assistants  who were already busy examining the new tablecloth  and commanded them to brush k  s suit and shoes   which he had begun to take off   down in the yard
she herself took a shirt from the line and ran down to the kitchen to iron it
now k
was left alone with the teacher  who was seated silently again at the table
k
kept him waiting for a little longer  drew off his shirt and began to wash himself at the tap only then  with his back to the teacher  did he ask him the reason for his visit
 i have come at the instance of the parish superintendent   he said
k
made ready to listen
but as the noise of the water made it difficult to catch what k
said  the teacher had to come nearer and lean against the wall beside him
k
excused his washing and his hurry by the urgency of his coming appointment
the teacher swept aside his excuses  and said   you were discourteous to the parish superintendent  an old and experienced man who should be treated with respect    whether i was discourteous or not i can t say   said k
while he dried himself   but that i had other things to think of than polite behaviour is true enough  for my existence is at stake  which is threatened by a scandalous official bureaucracy whose particular failings i needn t mention to you  seeing that you re an acting member of it yourself has the parish superintendent complained about me    where s the man that he would need to complain of   asked the teacher
 and even if there was anyone  do you think he would ever do it  i ve only made out at his dictation a short protocol on your interview  and that has shown me clearly enough how kind the superintendent was and what your answers were like   while k
was looking for his comb  which frieda must have cleared away somewhere  he said   what  a protocol  drawn up afterwards in my absence by someone who wasn t at the interview at all  that s not bad
and why on earth a protocol  was it an official interview  then    no   replied the teacher   a semi official one  the protocol too was only semi official
it was merely drawn up because with us everything must be done in strict order
in any case it s finished now  and it doesn t better your credit   k   who had at last found the comb  which had been tucked into the bed  said more calmly   well  then  it s finished
have you come to tell me that    no   said the teacher   but i m not a machine and i had to give you my opinion
my instructions are only another proof of the superintendent s kindness
i want to emphasize that his kindness in this instance is incomprehensible to me  and that i only carry out his instructions because it s my duty and out of respect to the superintendent   washed and combed  k
now sat down at the table to wait for his shirt and clothes
he was not very curious to know the message that the teacher had brought  he was influenced besides by the landlady s low opinion of the superintendent
 it must be after twelve already  surely   he said  thinking of the distance he had to walk
then he remembered himself  and said   you want to give me some message from the superintendent    well  yes   said the teacher  shrugging his shoulders as if he were discarding all responsibility  the superintendent is afraid that  if the decision in your case takes too long  you might do something rash on your own account
for my own part i don t know why he should fear that   my own opinion is that you should just be allowed to do what you like
we aren t your guardian angels and we re not obliged to run after you in all your doings
well and good
the superintendent  however  is of a different opinion
he can t of course hasten the decision itself  which is a matter for the authorities
but in his own sphere of jurisdiction he wants to provide a temporary and truly generous settlement
it simply lies with you to accept it
he offers you provisionally the post of school janitor   at first k
thought very little of the offer made him  but the fact that an offer had been made seemed to him not without significance
it seemed to point to the fact that in the superintendent s opinion he was in a hurry to look after himself  to carry out projects against the town council itself was preparing certain counter measures and how seriously they were taking the matter   the teacher  who had already been waiting for a while  and who before that  moreover  had made out the protocol  must of course have been told to run here by the superintendent
when the teacher saw that he had made k
reflect at last  he went on   i put my objections
i pointed out that up till now a janitor hadn t been found necessary
the churchwarden s wife cleared up the place from time to time  and fraulein gisa  the second teacher  overlooked the matter
i had trouble enough with the children  i didn t want to be bothered by a janitor as well
the superintendent pointed out that all the same the school was very dirty
i replied  keeping to the truth  that it wasn t so very bad
and  i went on  would it be any better if we took on this man as janitor  most certainly not
apart from the fact that he didn t know the work  there were only two big classrooms in the school  and no additional room so the janitor and his family would have to live  sleep  perhaps even cook in one of the classrooms  which could hardly make for greater cleanliness but the superintendent laid stress on the fact that this post would keep you out of difficulties  and that consequently you would do your utmost to fill it creditably
he suggested further  that along with you we would obtain the services of your wife and your assistants  so that the school should be kept in first rate order  and not only it  but the school garden as well
i easily proved that this would not hold water
at last the superintendent couldn t bring forward a single argument in your favour
he laughed and merely said that you were a land surveyor after all and so should be able to lay out the vegetable beds beautifully
well  against a joke there s no argument  and so i came to you with the proposal    you ve taken your trouble for nothing  teacher   said k
 i have no intention of accepting the post    splendid   said the teacher
 splendid that you decline quite unconditionally   and he took his hat  bowed  and went
immediately afterwards frieda came rushing up the stairs an excited face  the shirt still unironed in her hand  she did not reply to k  s inquiries
to distract her he told her about the teacher and the offer
she had hardly heard it when she flung the shirt on the bed and ran out again
she soon came back  but with the teacher  who looked annoyed and entered without any greeting
frieda begged him to have a little patience   obviously she had done that already several times on the way up   then drew k
through a side door of which he had never suspected the existence  on to the neighbouring loft  and then at last  out of breath with excitement  told what had happened to her
enraged that frieda had humbled herself by making an avowal to k   and   what was still worse   had yielded to him merely to secure him an interview with klamm  and after all had gained nothing but  so she alleged  cold and moreover insincere professions  the landlady was resolved to keep k
no longer in her house
if he had connections with the castle  then he should take advantage of them at once  for he must leave the house that very day  that very minute  and she would only take him back again at the express order and command of the authorities  but she hoped it would not come to that  for she too had connexions with the castle and would know how to make use of them
besides  he was only in the inn because of the landlord s negligence  and moreover he was not in a state of destitution  for this very morning he had boasted of a roof which was always free to him for the night
frieda of course was to remain
if frieda wanted to go with k
she  the landlady  would be very sorry
down in the kitchen she had sunk into a chair by the fire and cried at the mere thought of it
the poor  sick woman
but how could she behave otherwise  now that  in her imagination at any rate  it was a matter involving the honour of klamm s keepsakes  that was how matters stood with the landlady
frieda of course would follow him  k   wherever he wanted to go
yet the position of both of them was very bad in any case  just for that reason she had greeted the teacher s offer with such joy
even if it was not a suitable post for k   yet it was   that was expressly insisted on   only a temporary post
one would gain a little time and would easily find other chances  even if the final decision should turn out to be unfavourable
 if it comes to the worst   cried frieda at last  falling on k  s neck   we ll go away  what is there in the village to keep us  but for the time being  darling  we ll accept the offer  won t we  i ve fetched the teacher back again  you ve only to say to him  done   that s all  and we ll move over to the school    it s a great nuisance   said k without quite meaning it  for ue was not much concerned about his lodgings  and in his underclothes he was shivering up here in the loft  which without wall or window on two sides was swept by a cold draught   you ve arranged the room so comfortably and now we must leave it
i would take up the post very  very unwillingly
the few snubs i ve already had from the teacher have been painful enough  and now he s to become my superior  no less
if we could only stay here a little while longer  perhaps my position might change for the better this very afternoon
if you would only remain here at least  we could wait on for a little and give the teacher a non committal answer
as for me  if it came to the worst  i could really always find a lodging for the night with gar    frieda stopped him by putting her hand over his mouth
 no  not that   she said beseechingly   please never mention that again
in everything else i ll obey you
if you like i ll stay on here by myself  sad as it will be for me
if you like  we ll refuse the offer  wrong as that would seem to me
for look here  if you find another possibility  even this afternoon  why  it s obvious that we would throw up the post in the school at once
nobody would object
and as for your humiliation in front of the teacher  let me see to it that there will be none
i ll speak to him myself  you ll only have to be there and needn t say anything  and later  too  it will be just the same  you ll never be made to speak to him if you don t want to  i   i alone   will be his subordinate in reality  and i won t be even that  for i know his weak points
so you see nothing will be lost if we take on the post  and a great deal if we refuse it
above all  if you don t wring something out of the castle this very day  you ll never manage to find  even for yourself  anywhere at all in the village to spend the night in  anywhere  that is  of which i needn t be ashamed as your future wife
and if you don t manage to find a roof for the night  do you really expect me to sleep here in my warm room  while i know that you are wandering about out there in the dark and cold   k   who had been trying to warm himself all this time by clapping his chest with his arms like a carter  said   then there s nothing left but to accept  come along    when they returned to the room he went straight over to the fire he paid no attention to the teacher
the latter  sitting at the table  drew out his watch and said   it s getting late    i know  but we re completely agreed at last   said frieda   we accept the post    good   said the teacher   but the post is offered to the land surveyor
he must say the word himself   frieda came to k  s help  really   she said   he accepts the post
don t you  k    so k
could confine his declaration to a simple  yes   which was not even directed to the teacher but to frieda
 then   said the teacher   the only thing that remains for me is to acquaint you with your duties  so that in that respect we can understand each other once and for all
you have  land surveyor  to clean and heat both classrooms daily  to make any small repairs in the house  further  to look after the class and gymnastic apparatus personally  to keep the garden path free of snow  run messages for me and the lady teacher  and look after all the work in the garden in the warmer seasons of the year in return for that you have the right to live in whichever one of the classrooms you like but  when both rooms are not being used at the same time for teaching  and you are in the room that is needed  you must of course move to the other room you mustn t do any cooking in the school
in return you and your dependants will be given your meals here in the inn at the cost of the town council
that you must behave in a manner consonant with the dignity of the school  and in particular that the children during school hours must never be allowed to witness any unedifying matrimonial scenes  i mention only in passing  for as an educated man you must of course know that
in connection with that i want to say further that we must insist on your relations with fraulein frieda being legitimized at the earliest possible moment
about all this and a few other trifling matters  an agreement will be made out  which as soon as you move over to the school must be signed by you   to k
all this seemed of no importance  as if it did not concern him or at any rate did not bind him
but the self importance of the teacher irritated him  and he said carelessly   i know  they re the usual duties   to clear away the impression created by this remark frieda inquired about the salary
 whether there will be any salary   said the teacher   will only be considered after a month s trial service    but that is hard on us   said frieda
 we ll have to marry on practically nothing  and have nothing to set up house on
couldn t you make a representation to the town council  sir  to give us a small salary at the start  couldn t you advise that    no   replied the teacher  who continued to direct his words to k
 representations to the town council will only be made if i give the word  and i shan t give it
the post has only been given to you as a personal favour  and one can t stretch a favour too far  if one has any consciousness of one s obvious responsibilities   now k intervened at last  almost against his will
 as for the favour  teacher   he said   it seems to me that you re mistaken the favour is perhaps rather on my side    no   replied the teacher  smiling now that he had compelled k
to speak at last
 i m completely grounded on that point
our need for a janitor is just about as urgent as our need for a land surveyor
janitor  land surveyor  in both cases it s a burden on our shoulders
i ll still have a lot of trouble thinking out how i m to justify the post to the town council
the best thing and the most honest thing would be to throw the proposal on the table and not justify anything    that s just what i meant   replied k    you must take me on against your will
although it causes you grave perturbation  you must take me on
but when one is compelled to take someone else on  and this someone else allows himself to be taken on  then he is the one who grants the favour    strange   said the teacher  what is it that compels us to take you on  the only thing that compels us is the superintendent s kind heart  his too kind heart
i see  land surveyor  that you ll have to rid yourself of a great many illusions  before you can become a serviceable janitor
and remarks such as these hardly produce the right atmosphere for the granting of an eventual salary
i notice  too  with regret that your attitude will give me a great deal of trouble yet  all this time   i ve seen it with my own eyes and yet can scarcely believe it   you ve been talking to me in your shirt and drawers    quite so   exclaimed k
with laugh  and he clapped his hands
 these terrible assistants  where have they been all this time   frieda hurried to the door
the teacher  who noticed that k
was no longer to be drawn into conversation  asked her when she would move into the school
 today   said frieda
 then tomorrow i ll come to inspect matters   said the teacher  waved a goodbye  and made to go out through the door  which frieda had opened for herself  but ran into the maids  who already were arriving with their things to take possession of the room again
and he  who made way for nobody  had to slip between them
frieda followed him
 you re surely in a hurry   said k   who this time was very pleased with the maids   had you to push your way in while we re still here   they did not answer  only twisted their bundles in embarrassment  from which k
saw the wellknown filthy rags projecting
 so you ve never washed your things yet   said k
it was not said maliciously  but actually with a certain indulgence
they noticed it  opened their hard mouths in concert  showed their beautiful animal like teeth and laughed noiselessly   come along   said k    put your things down  it s your room after all   as they still hesitated  however   the room must have seemed to them all too well transformed   k
took one of them by the arm to lead her forward
but he let her go at once  so astonished was the gaze of both  which  after a brief glance between them  was now turned unflinchingly on k
 but now you ve stared at me long enough   he said  repelling a vague  unpleasant sensation  and he took up his clothes and boots  which frieda  timidly followed by the assistants  had just brought  and drew them on
the patience which frieda had with the assistants  always incomprehensible to him  now struck him again
after a long search she had found them below peacefully eating their lunch  the untouched clothes which they should have been brushing in the yard crumpled in their laps
then she had had to brush everything herself  and yet she  who knew how to keep the common people in their places  had not even scolded them  and instead spoke in their presence of their grave negligence as if it were a trifling peccadillo  and even slapped one of them lightly  almost caressingly  on the cheek
k
would have to talk to her about this
but now it is time to be gone
 the assistants will stay here to help you with the removing   he said
they were not in the least pleased with this arrangement
happy and full  they would have gladly skipped the exercise
only when frieda said   certainly  you stay here   did they yield
 do you know where i m going 2 asked k
 yes   replied frieda
 and you don t want to hold me back any longer   asked k
 you ll find obstacles enough   she replied   what does anything i say matter in comparison   she kissed k
good bye  and as he had had nothing at lunch time  she gave him a little packet of bread and sausage which she had brought for him from downstairs  reminded him that he must not return here again but to the school  and accompanied him  with her hand on his shoulder  to the door
at first k
was glad to have escaped from the crush of the maids and the assistants in the warm room
it was freezing a little  the snow was firmer  the going easier
but already darkness was actually beginning to fall  and he hastened his steps
the castle  whose contours were already beginning to dissolve  lay silent as ever
never yet had k
seen there the slightest sign of life   perhaps it was quite impossible to recognize anything at that distance  and yet the eye demanded it and could not endure that stillness
when k
looked at the castle  often it seemed to him as if he were observing someone who sat quietly there in front of him   gazing  not lost in thought and so oblivious of everything  but free and untroubled  as if he were alone with nobody to observe him  and yet must notice that he was observed  and all the same remained with his calm not even slightly disturbed
and really   one did not know whether it was cause or effect   the gaze of the observer could not remain concentrated there  but slid away
this impression today was strengthened still further by the early dusk
the longer he looked  the less he could make out and the deeper everything was lost in the twilight
just as k
reached the herrenhof  which was still unlighted  a window was opened in the first storey  and a stout  smooth shaven young man in a fur coat leaned out and then remained at the window
he did not seem to make the slightest response to k  s greeting
neither in the hall nor in the taproom did k
meet anybody
the smell of stale beer was still worse than last time
such a state of things was never allowed even in the inn by the bridge
k
went straight over to the door through which he had observed klamm  and lifted the latch cautiously  but the door was barred
then he felt for the place where the peephole was  but the pin apparently was fitted so well that he could not find the place  so he struck a match
he was startled by a cry
in the corner between the door and the till  near the fire  a young girl was crouching and staring at him in the flare of the match  with partially opened sleep drunken eyes
she was evidently frieda s successor
she soon collected herself and switched on the electric light
her expression was cross  then she recognized k
 ah  the land surveyor   she said smiling  held out her hand  and introduced herself
 my name is pepi   she was small  redcheeked  plump
her opulent reddish golden hair was twisted into a strong plait  yet some of it escaped and curled round her temples
she was wearing a dress of grey shimmering material  falling in straight lines  which did not suit her in the least
at the foot it was drawn together by a childishly clumsy silken band with tassels falling from it  which impeded her movements she inquired after frieda and asked whether she would come back soon
it was a question which verged on insolence
 as soon as frieda went away   she said next   i was called here urgendy because they couldn t find anybody suitable at the moment
i ve been a chambermaid till now  but this isn t a change for the better
there s lots of evening and night work in this job  it s very tiring  i don t think i ll be able to stand it
i m not surprised that frieda threw it up    frieda was very happy here   said k   to make her aware definitely of the difference between frieda and herself  which she did not seem to appreciate
 don t you believe her   said pepi
 frieda can keep a straight face better than other people can
she doesn t admit what she doesn t want to admit  and so nobody noticed that she has anything to admit
i ve been in service here with her several years already
we ve slept together all that time in same bed  yet i m not intimate with her  and by now i m rite out of her thoughts  that s certain
perhaps her only 2 nd     °  lan hacty of the bridge inn  and that tells a story     frieda is my fiancee   said k   searching at the same time for the peephole in the door
 i know   said pepi   that s just the reason why i ve told you
otherwise it wouldn t have any interest for you    i understand   said k
 you mean that i should be proud to have won such a reticent girl    that s so   said she  laughing triumphantly  as if she had established a secret understanding with k
regarding frieda
but it was not her actual words that troubled k
and deflected him for a little from his search  but rather her appearance and her presence in this place
certainly she was much younger than frieda  almost a child still  and her clothes were ludicrous
she had obviously dressed in accordance with the exaggerated notions which she had of the importance of a barmaid s position
and these notions were right enough in their way in her  for this position of which she was still incapable had come to her unearned and unexpectedly  and only for the time being
not even the leather reticule which frieda always wore on her belt had been entrusted to her
and her ostensible dissatisfaction with the position was nothing but showing off
and yet  in spite of her childish mind  she too  apparently  had connections with the castle
if she was not lying  she had been a chambermaid
without being aware of what she possessed she slept through the days here  and though if he took this tiny  plump slightly round backed creature in his arms he could not extort from her what she possessed  yet that could bring him in contact with it and inspirit him for his difficult task then could her case now be much the same as frieda s  oh  no  it was different
one had only to think of frieda s look to know that
k
would never have touched pepi
all the same he had to lower his eyes tor a little now  so greedily was he staring at her
 it s against orders for the light to be on   said pepi  switching it off again
 i only turned it on because you gave me such a fright
what do you want here really  did frieda forget anything    yes   said k   pointing to the door   a table cover  a white embroidered table cover  here in the next room    yes  her table cover   said pepi
 i remember it  a pretty piece of work
i helped with it myself  but it can hardly be in that room    frieda thinks it is
who lives in it  then   asked
k
 nobody   said pepi   it s the gentlemen s room
the gentlemen eat and drink there
that is  it s reserved for that  but most of them remain upstairs in their rooms    if i knew   said k    that nobody was in there just now  i would like very much to go in and have a look for the table cover but one can t be certain
klamm  for instance  is often in the habit of sitting there    klamm is certainly not there now   said pepi
 he s making ready to leave this minute  the sledge is waiting for him in the yard   without a word of explanation k
left the taproom at once
when he reached the hall he returned  instead of to the door  to the interior of the house  and in a few steps reached the courtyard
how still and lovely it was here it was a four square yard  bordered on three sides by the house buildings  and towards the street   a side street which k
did not know   by a high white wall with a huge  heavy gate  open now
here where the court was  the house seemed stiller than at the front
at any rate the whole first storey jutted out and had a more impressive appearance  for it was encircled by a wooden gallery closed in except for one tiny slit for looking through
at the opposite side from k
and on the ground floor  but in the corner where the opposite wing of the house joined the main building  there was an entrance to the house  open  and without a door
before it was standing a dark  closed sledge to which a pair of horses was yoked
except for the coachman  whom at that distance and in the falling twilight k
guessed at rather than recognized  nobody was to be seen
looking about him cautiously  his hands in his pockets  k
slowly coasted round two sides of the yard until he reached the sledge
the coachman   one of the peasants who had been the other night in the taproom   smart in his fur coat  watched k
approaching non committally  much as one follows the movements of a cat
even when k
was standing beside him and had to move  and the horses were becoming a little restive at seeing a man coming out of the dusk  he remained completely detached
that exactly suited k  s purpose
leaning against the wall of the house he took out his lunch  thought gratefully of crieda and her solicitous provision for him  and meanwhile peered into the house
a very angular and broken stair led downwards and was crossed down below by a low but apparently deep passage
everything was clean and whitewashed  sharply and distinctly defined
the wait lasted longer than k
had expected
long ago he had finished his meal  he was getting chilled  the twilight had changed into complete darkness  and still klamm had not arrived
 it might be a long time yet   said a rough voice suddenly  so near to him that k
started
it was the coachman  who  as if waking up  stretched himself and yawned loudly  what might be a long time yet   asked k   not ungrateful at being disturbed  for the perpetual silence and tension had already become a burden  before you go away   said the coachman
k
did not understand him  but did not ask further
he thought that would be the best means of making the insolent fellow speak
not to answer here in this darkness was almost a challenge
and actually the coachman asked  after a pause   would you like some brandy    yes   said k
without thinking tempted only too keenly by the offer  for he was freezing
 then open the door of the sledge   said the coachman   in the side pocket there are some flasks  take one and have a drink and then hand it up to me
with this fur coat it s difficult for me to get down   k
was annoyed at being ordered about  but seeing that he had struck up with the coachman he obeyed  even at the possible risk of being surprised by klamm in the sledge
he opened the wide door and could without more ado have drawn a flask out of the side pocket which was fastened to the inside of the door
but now that it was open he felt an impulse which he could not withstand to go inside the sledge
all he wanted was to sit there for a minute
he slipped inside
the warmth within the sledge was extraordinary  and it remained although the door  which k
did not dare to close  was wide open
one could not tell whether it was a seat one was sitting on  so completely was one surrounded by blankets  cushions  and furs
one could turn and stretch on every side  and always one sank into softness and warmth his arms spread out  his head supported on pillows which always seemed to be there  k gazed out of the sledge into the dark house
why was klamm such a long time in coming  as if stupefied by the warmth after his long wait in the snow  k
began to wish that klamm would come soon
the thought that he would much rather not be seen by klamm in his present position touched him only vaguely as a faint disturbance of his comfort
he was supported in this obliviousness by the behaviour of the coachman  who certainly knew that he was in the sledge  and yet let him stay there without once demanding the brandy
that was very considerate  but still k
wanted to oblige him
slowly  without altering his position  he reached out his hand to the side pocket
but not the one in the open door  but the one behind him in the closed door
after all  it didn t matter  there were flasks in that one too
he pulled one out  unscrewed the stopper  and smelt
involuntarily he smiled  the perfume was so sweet  so caressing  like praise and good words from someone whom one likes very much  yet one does not know clearly what they are for and has no desire to know  and is simply happy in the knowledge that it is one s friend who is saying them
 can this be brandy   k
asked himself doubtfully and took a taste out of curiosity yes  strangely enough it was brandy  and burned and warmed him
how wonderfully it was transformed in drinking out of something which seemed hardly more than a sweet perfume into a drink fit for a coachman
  can it be   k
asked himself as if self reproachfully  and took another sip then   as k
was just in the middle of a long swig   everything became bright  the electric lights blazed inside on the stairs  in the passages  in the entrance hall  outside above the door
steps could be heard coming down the stairs  the flask fell from k  s hand  the brandy was spilt over a rug  k
sprang out of the sledge  he had just time to slam the door to  which made a loud noise  when a gentleman came slowly out of the house
the only consolation that remained was that it was not klamm  or was not that rather a pity  it was the gentleman whom k
had already seen at the window on the first floor
a young man  very good looking  pink and white  but very serious
k   too  looked
thinking gravely  but his gravity was on his own account
really it would have done better to have sent his assistants here  they oughtn t have behaved more foolishly than he had done
the gentleman still regarded him in silence  as if he had not enough breath in his overcharged bosom for what had to be said
 this is unheard of   he said at last  pushing his hat a little back on his forehead
what next  the gentleman knew nothing apparently of k  s stay in the sledge  and yet found something that was unheard of  perhaps that k
had pushed his way in as far as the courtyard   how do you come to be here   the gentleman asked next  more softly now  breathing freely again  resigning himself to the inevitable what questions to ask  and what could one answer  was k
to admit simply and flatly to this man that his attempt  begun with so many hopes  had failed  instead of replying  k
turned to the sledge  opened the door  and retrieved his cap  which he had forgotten there
he noticed with discomfort that the brandy was dripping from the footboard
then he turned again to the gentleman  to show him that he had been in the sledge gave him no more compunction now  besides that wasn t the worst of it
when he was questioned  but only then  he would divulge the fact that the coachman himself had at least asked him to open the door of the sledge but the real calamity was that the gentleman had surprised him  that there had not been enough time left to hide from him so as afterwards to wait in peace for klamm  or rather that he had not had enough presence of mind to remain in the sledge  close the door and wait there among the rugs for klamm  or at least to stay there as long as this man was about
true  he couldn t know of course whether it might not be klamm himself who was coming  in which case it would naturally have been much better to accost him outside the sledge yes  there had been many things here for thought  but now there was none  for this was the end
 come with me   said the gentleman  not really as a command  for the command lay not in the words  but in a slight  studiedly indifferent gesture of the hand which accompanied them
 i m waiting here for somebody   said k   no longer in the hope of any success  but simply on principle
 come   said the gentleman once more quite imperturbably  as if he wanted to show that he had never doubted that k
was waiting for somebody
 but then i would miss the person i m waiting for   said k
with an emphatic nod of his head
in spite of everything that had happened he had the feeling that what he had achieved thus far was something gained  which it was true he only held now in seeming  but which he must not relinquish all the same merely on account of a polite command
 you ll miss him in any case  whether you go or stay   said the gentleman  expressing himself bluntly  but showing an unexpected consideration for k  s line of thought  then i would rather wait for him and miss him   said k
defiantly
he would certainly not be driven away from here by the mere talk of this young man
thereupon with his head thrown back and a supercilious look on his face the gentleman closed his eyes for a few minutes  as if he wanted to turn from k s senseless stupidity to his own sound reason again  ran the tip of his tongue round his slightly parted lips  and said at last to the coachman   unyoke the horses   obedient to the gendeman  but with a furious sideglance at k   the coachman had now to get down in spite of his fur coat  and began very hesitatingly   as if he did not so much expect a counter order from the gentleman as a sensible remark from k
  to back the horses and the sledge closer to the side wing  in which apparently  behind a big door  was the shed where the vehicles were kept
k
saw himself deserted  the sledge was disappearing in one direction  in the other  by the way he had come himself  the gentleman was receding  both it was true very slowly  as if they wanted to show k that it was still in his power to call them back
perhaps he had this power  but it would have availed him nothing
to call the sledge back would be to drive himself away so he remained standing as one who held the field  but it was a victory which gave him no joy
alternately he looked at the backs of the gentleman and the coachman
the gentleman had already reached the door through which k
had first come into the courtyard
yet once more he looked back  k
fancied he saw him shaking his head over such obstinacy  then with a short  decisive  final movement he turned away and stepped into the hall  where he immediately vanished
the coachman remained for a while still in the courtyard  he had a great deal of work with the sledge  he had to open the heavy door of the shed  back the sledge into its place  unyoke the horses  lead them to their stalls
all this he did gravely  with concentration  evidently without any hope of starting soon again  and this silent absorption which did not spare a single side glance for k
seemed to the latter a far heavier reproach than the behaviour of the gentleman
and when now  after finishing his work in the shed  the coachman went across the courtyard in his slow  rolling walk  closed the huge gate and then returned  all very slowly  while he literally looked at nothing but his own footprints in the snow and finally shut himself into the shed and now as all the electric lights went out too   for whom should they remain on    and only up above the slit in the wooden gallery still remained bright  holding one s wandering gaze for a little  it seemed to k
as if at last those people had broken off all relations with him  and as if now in reality he were freer than he had ever been  and at liberty to wait here in this place usually forbidden to him as long as he desired  and had won a freedom such as hardly anybody else had ever succeeded in winning  and as if nobody could dare to touch him or drive him away  or even speak to him
but   this conviction was at least equally strong   as if at the same time there was nothing more senseless  nothing more hopeless  than this freedom  this waiting  this inviolability
and he tore himself free and went back into the house   this time not along the wall but straight through the snow and met the landlord in the hall  who greeted him in silence and pointed towards the door of the taproom k
followed the hint  for he was shivering  and wanted to see human faces
but he was greatly disappointed when he saw there  sitting at a little table   which must have been specially set out  for usually the customers put up with upturned barrels   the young gentleman and standing before him   an unwelcome sight for k
  the landlady from the bridge inn
pepi  proud  her head thrown back and a fixed smile on her face  conscious of her incontestable dignity  her plait nodding with every movement  hurried to and fro  fetching beer and then pen and ink  for the gentleman had already spread out papers in front of him  was comparing dates which he looked up now in this paper  then again in a paper at the other end of the table  and was preparing to write from her full height the landlady silently overlooked the gentleman and the papers  her lips pursed a little as if musing
it was as if she had already said everything necessary and it had been well received
 the land surveyor  at last   said the gentleman at k  s entrance  looking up briefly  then burying himself again in his papers the landlady  too  only gave k
an indifferent and not in the least surprised glance
but pepi actually seemed to notice k
for the first time when he went up to the bar and ordered a brandy
k
leaned there  his hands pressed to his eyes  oblivious of everything
then he took a sip of the brandy and pushed it back  saying it was undrinkable
 all the gentlemen drink it   replied pepi curdy  poured out the remainder  washed the glass and set it on the rack
 the gentlemen have better stuff as well   said k
 it s possible   replied pepi   but i haven t   and with that she was finished with k
and once more at the gentleman s service  who  however  was in need of nothing  and behind whom she only kept walking to and fro in circles  making respectful attempts to catch a glimpse of the papers over his shoulder
but that was only her senseless curiosity and self importance  which the landlady  too  reprehended with knitted brows
then suddenly the landlady s attention was distracted  she stared  listening intently  into vacancy
k
turned round  he could not hear anything in particular  nor did the others seem to hear anything
but the landlady ran on tiptoe and taking large steps to the door which led to the courtyard  peered through the keyhole  turned then to the others with wide  staring eyes and flushed cheeks  signed to them with her finger to near  and now they peered through the keyhole by turns
the landlady had  of course  the lion s share  but pepi  too  was sidered
the gentleman was on the whole the most indifferent of the three
pepi and the gentleman came away soon  but   landlady kept on peering anxiously  bent double  almost kneeling
one had almost the feeling that she was only imploring the keyhole now to let her through  for there had certainly been nothing more to see for a long time
when at last she got passed her hand over her face  arranged her hair  took a deep breath  and now at last seemed to be trying with reluctance to accustom her eyes again to the room and the people in it  k
said  not so much to get his suspicions confirmed  as to forestall the announcement  so open to attack did he feel now   has klamm gone already then   the landlady walked past him in silence  but the gentleman answered from his table   yes  of course
as soon as you gave up your sentry go  klamm was able to leave
but it s strange how sensitive he is
did you notice  landlady  how uneasily klamm looked round him   the landlady did not appear to have noticed it  but the gentleman went on   well  fortunately there was nothing more to be seen  the coachman had effaced even the footprints in the snow    the landlady didn t notice anything   said k   but he said it without conviction  merely provoked by the gentleman s assertion  which was uttered in such a final and unanswerable tone
 perhaps i wasn t at the keyhole just then   said the landlady presently  to back up the gentleman  but then she felt compelled to give klamm his due as well  and added   all the same  i can t believe in this terrible sensitiveness of klamm
we are anxious about him and try to guard him  and so go on to infer that he s terribly sensitive
that s as it should be and it s certainly klamm s will
but how it is in reality we don t know
certainly  klamm will never speak to anybody that he doesn t want to speak to  no matter how much trouble this anybody may take  and no matter how insufferably forward he may be
but that fact alone  that klamm will never speak to him  never allow him to come into his presence  is enough in itself
why after all should it follow that he isn t able to endure seeing this anybody  at any rate  it can t be proved  seeing that it will never come that    the gentleman nodded eagerly
 that is essentially  of course   he said   if i expressed myself a little to the test
then my opinion too  differently  it was to make myself comprehensible to the land surveyor
all the same it s a fact that when klamm stepped out of the doorway he looked round him several times    perhaps he was looking for me   said k
 possibly   said the gentleman
 i hadn t thought of that   they all laughed  pepi  who hardly understood anything that was being said  loudest of all
 seeing we re all so happy here now   the gentleman went on   i want to beg you very seriously  land surveyor  to enable me to complete my papers by answering a few questions    there s a great deal of writing there   said k
glancing at the papers from where he was standing
 yes  a wretched bore   said the gentleman laughing again   but perhaps you don t know yet who i am i m momus  klamm s village secretary   at these words seriousness descended on the room
although the landlady and pepi knew quite well who the gentleman was  yet they seemed staggered by the utterance of his name and rank
and even the gentleman himself  as if he had said more than his judgement sanctioned  and as if he were resolved to escape at least from any after effects of the solemn import implicit in his own words  buried himself in his papers and began to write  so that nothing was heard in the room but the scratching of his pen  what is that  village secretary   asked k
after a pause
the landlady answered for momus  who now that he had introduced himself did not regard it seemly to give such explanations himself   herr momus is klamm s secretary in the same sense as any of klamm s secretaries  but his official province  and if i m not mistaken  his official standing    still writing momus shook his head decidedly and the landlady amended her phrase    well  then  his official province  but not his official standing  is confined to the village herr momus dispatches any clerical work of klamm s which may become necessary in the village and as klamm s deputy receives any petitions to klamm which may be sent by the village   as  still quite unimpressed by these facts  k
looked at the landlady with vacant eyes  she added in a halfembarrassed tone   that s how it s arranged
all the gentlemen in the castle have their village secretaries   momus  who had been listening far more attentively than k   supplied the landlady with a supplementary fact   most of the village seretaries work only for one gentleman  but i work for s for klamm and for vallabene    yes   went on the landlady remembering now on her side too  and turning to k    herr momus works for two gentlemen  for klamm and for vallabene  and so is twice a village secretary    actually twice   said k   nodding to momus   who now  leaning slightly forward  looked him full in the face   as one nods to a child whom one has just heard being praised
if there was a certain contempt in the gesture  then it was either unobserved or else actually expected
precisely to  k   it seemed  who was not considered worthy even to be seen in passing by klamm  these people had described in detail the services of a man out of klamm s circle with the unconcealed intention of evoking k  s recognition and admiration
and yet k
had no proper appreciation of it
he  who with all his powers strove to get a glimpse of klamm  valued very little  for example  the post of a momus who was permitted to live in klamm s eye
for it was not klamm s environment in itself that seemed to him worth striving for  but rather that he  k   he only and no one else  should attain to klamm  and should attain to him not to rest with him  but to go on beyond him  farther yet  into the castle
and he looked at his watch and said   but now i must be going home   immediately the position changed in momus s favour
  yes  of course   the latter replied   the school work calls
but you must favour me with just a moment of your time
only a few short questions    i don t feel in the mood for it   said k
and turned towards the door
momus brought down a document on the table and stood up   in the name of klamm i command you to answer my questions    in the name of klamm   repeated k    does he trouble himself about my affairs  then    as to that   replied momus   i have no information and you certainly have still less we can safely leave that to him
all the same i cornmand you by virtue of my function granted by klamm to stay here and to answer    land surveyor   broke in the landlady   i refuse to advise you any further  my advice till now  the most well meaning that you could have got  has been cast back at me in the most unheard of manner
and i have come here to momus   i have nothing to hide   simply to give the office adequate idea of your behaviour and your intentions and to protect myself for all time from having you quartered on me again
that s how we stand towards each other and that s how we ll always stand  and if i speak my mind accordingly now  i don t do it  i can tell you  to help you  but to ease a little the hard job which herr momus is bound to have in dealing with a man like you
all the same  just because of my absolute frankness and i couldn t deal otherwise than frankly with you even if i were to try   you can extract some advantage for yourself out of what i say  if you only take the trouble
in the present case i want to draw your attention to this  that the only road that can lead you to klamm is through this protocol here of herr momus
but i don t want to exaggerate  perhaps that road won t get you as far as klamm  perhaps it will stop long before it reaches him
the judgement of herr momus will decide that
but in any case that s the only road that will take you in the direction of klamm
and do you intend to reject that road  for nothing but pride    oh  madam   said k    that s neither the only road to klamm  nor is it any better than the others
but you  mr secretary  decide this question  whether what i may say here can get as far as klamm or not    of course it can   said momus  lowering his eyes proudly and gazing at nothing   otherwise why should i be secretary here    now you see  madam   said k    i don t need a road to klamm  but only to mr secretary    i wanted to throw open this road for you   said the landlady   didn t i offer this morning to send your request to klamm  that might have been done through herr momus but you refused  and yet from now on no other way will remain for you but this one
but frankly  after your attempt on klamm s privacy  with much less prospect of success
all the same this last  any  vanishing  yes  actually invisible hope  is your only one    how is it  madam   said k    that originally you tried so hard to keep me from seeing klamm  and yet now take my wish to see him quite seriously  and seem to consider me lost largely on account of the miscarrying of my plan  if at advise me sincerely from your heart against you not trying to see at how can you possibly drive me on the road to klamm now  apparently just as sincerely  even though it s admitted that the road may not reach as far as him    am i driving you on   asked the landlady
 do you call it   driving you on when i tell you that your attempt is hopeless 
would it really be the limit of audacity if you tried in that way push the responsibility on to me
perhaps it s herr momus s presence that encourages you to do it
no  land surveyor  i m not trying to drive you on to anything
i can admit only one mistake  that i overestimated you a little when i first saw you
your immediate victory over frieda frightened me  i didn t know what you might still be capable of
i wanted to prevent further damage  and thought that the only means of achieving that was to shake your resolution by prayers and threats
since then i have learned to look on the whole thing more calmly
you can do what you like
your actions may no doubt leave deep footprints in the snow out there in the courtyard  but they ll do nothing more    the contradiction doesn t seem to me to be quite cleared up   said k    but i m content with having drawn attention to it
but now i beg you  mr secretary  to tell me whether the landlady s opinion is correct  that is  that the protocol which you want to take down from my answers can have the result of gaining me admission to klamm if that s the case  i m ready to answer all your questions at once
in that direction i m ready  indeed  for anything    no   replied momus   that doesn t follow at all
it s simply a matter of keeping an adequate record of this afternoon s happenings for klamm s village register
the record is already complete  there are only two or three omissions which you must fill in for the sake of order
there s no other object in view and no other object can be achieved   k
gazed at the landlady in silence
 why are you looking at me   asked she   did i say anything else  he s always like that  mr secretary  he s always like that falsifies the information one gives him  and then maintains that he received false information
i ve told him from the first and i tell him again to day that he hasn t the faintest prospect of being received by klamm
well  if there s no prospect in any case he won t alter that fact by means of this protocol
could anything be clearer  i said further that this protocol is the only real official connection that he can have with klamm
that too is surely clear and incontestable enough
but if in spite of that he won t believe me  and keeps on hoping   i don t know why or with what idea   that he ll be able to reach klamm  then so long as he remains in that frame of mind  the only thing that can help him is this one real official connection he has with klamm  in other words  this protocol
that s all i have said  and whoever main  tains the contrary twists my words maliciously    if that is so  madam   said k    then i beg your pardon  and i ve misunderstood you
for i thought   erroneously  as it turns out now   that i could take out of your former words that there was still some very tiny hope for me    certainly   replied the landlady   that s my meaning exactly
you re twisting my words again  only this time in the opposite way
in my opinion there is such a hope for you  and founded actually on this protocol and nothing else
but it s not of such a nature that you can simply fall on herr momus with the question   will i be allowed to see klamm if i answer your questions   when a child asks questions like that people laugh  when a grown man does it it is an insult to all authority
herr momus graciously concealed this under the politeness of his reply
but the hope that i mean consists simply in this  that through the protocol you have a sort of connection  a sort of connexion perhaps with klamm
isn t that enough  if anyone inquired for any service which might earn you the privilege of such a hope  could you bring forward the slightest one  for the last time  that s the best that can be said about this hope of yours  and certainly herr momus in his official capacity could never give even the slightest hint of it
for him it s a matter  as he says  merely of keeping a record of this afternoon s happenings  for the sake of order
more than that he won t say  even if you ask him this minute his opinion of what i ve said    will klamm  then  mr secretary   asked k    read the protocol    no   replied momus   why should he  klamm can t read every protocol  in fact he reads none  keep away from me with your protocols   he usually says    land surveyor   groaned the landlady   you exhaust me with such questions
do you think it s necessary  or even simply desirable  that klamm should read his protocol and become acquainted word for word with the curiousities of your life  shouldn t you rather pray humbly that a c protocol should be concealed from klamm   a prayer  however  that would be just as unreasonable as the other  for who would hide anything from klamm even though he has given many signs of his sympathetic nature  and is it even necessary for that you call your hope  haven t you admitted yourself that you would be content if you only got the chance of speaking to klamm  even if he never looked at you and never listened to you  and won t you achieve that at least through the protocol  perhaps much more    much more   asked k
 in what way    if you wouldn t always talk about things like a child  as if they were for eating
who on earth can give any answer to such questions  the protocol will be put in klamm s village register  you have heard that already  more than that can t be said with certainty
but do you know yet the full importance of the protocol  and of herr momus  and of the village register  do you know what it means to be examined by herr momus  perhaps   to all appearances at least   he doesn t know it himself he sits quietly there and does his duty  for the sake of order  as he says
but consider that klamm appointed him  that he acts in klamm s name  that what he does  even if it never reaches klamm  has yet klamm s assent in advance
and how can anything have klamm s assent that isn t filled by his spirit  far be it from me to offer herr momus crude flattery besides he would absolutely forbid it himself   but i m speaking of him not as an independent person  but as he is when he has klamm s assent  as at present  then he s an instrument in the hand of klamm  and woe to anybody who doesn t obey him   the landlady s threats did not daunt k  of the hopes with which she tried to catch him he was weary
klamm was far away
once the landlady had compared klamm to an eagle  and that had seemed absurd in k  s eyes  but it did not seem absurd now
he thought of klamm s remoteness  of his impregnable dwelling  of his silence  broken perhaps only by cries such as k
had never yet heard  of his downward pressing gaze  which could never be proved or disproved  of his wheelings which could never be disturbed by anything that k
did down below  which far above he followed at the behest of incomprehensibly laws and which only for instants were visible   all these things klamm and the eagle had in common
but assuredly these had nothing to do with the protocol  over which just now mornus was crumbling a roll dusted with salt  which he was eating with beer to help it out  in the process all the papers becoming covered with salt and caraway seeds
 good night   said k
 i ve no objection to any kind of examination   and now he went at last to the door
 he s going after all   said momus almost anxiously to the landlady
 he won t dare   said she
k
heard nothing more  he was already in the hall
it was cold and a strong wind was blowing
from a door on the opposite side came the landlord  he seemed to have been keeping the hall under observation from behind a peephole
he had to hold the tail of his coat round his knees  the wind tore so strongly at him in the hall
 you re going already  land surveyor   he asked
 you re surprised at that   asked k
 i am   said the landlord   haven t you been examined then    no   replied k
 i didn t let myself be examined    why not   asked the landlord
 i don t know   said k    why i should let myself be examined  why i should give in to a joke or an official whim
perhaps some other time i might have taken it on my side too as a joke or as a whim  but not to day     why certainly  certainly   said the landlord  but he agreed only out of politeness  not from conviction
 i must let the servants into the taproom now   he said presently   it s long past their time
only i didn t want to disturb the examination    did you consider it as important as all that   asked k
 well  yes   replied the landlord
 i shouldn t have refused   said k
 no   replied the landlord   you shouldn t have done that   seeing that k
was silent  he added  whether to comfort k
or to get away sooner   well  well  the sky won t rain sulphur for all that    no   replied k    the weather signs don t look like it   and they parted laughing
     k stepped out into the windswept street and peered into  
the darkness
wild  wild weather
as if there were some connection between the two he reflected again how the landlady had striven to make him accede to the protocol  and how he had stood out
the landlady s attempt had of course not been a straightforward one  surreptitiously she had tried to put him against the protocol at the same time
in reality he could not tell whether he had stood out or given in
an intriguing nature  acting blindly  it seemed  like the wind  according to strange and remote behests which one could never guess at
he had only taken a few steps along the main street when he saw two swaying lights in the distance
these signs of life gladdened him and he hastened towards them  while they  too  made in his direction
he could not tell why he was so disappointed when he recognized the assistants
still  they were coming to meet him  evidently sent by frieda  and the lanterns which delivered him from the darkness roaring round him were his own  nevertheless he was disappointed  he had expected something else  not those old acquaintances who were such a burden to him
but the assistants were not alone
out of the darkness between them barnabas stepped out
 barnabas   cried k
and he held out his hand   have you come to see me   the surprise at meeting him again drowned at first all the annoyance which he had once felt at barnabas
 to see you   replied barnabas unalterably friendly as before   with a letter from klamm    a letter from klamm   cried k
throwing back his head
 lights here   he called to the assistants  who now pressed close to him on both sides holding up their lanterns
k
had to fold the large sheet in small compass to protect it from the wind while reading it
then he read   to the land surveyor at the bridge inn
the surveying work which you have carried out thus far has ken appreciated by me
the work of the assistants  too  deserves praise
you know how to keep them at their jobs
do not slacken in your efforts  carry your work on to a fortunate contusion
any interruption would displease me
for the rest be easy in your mind
the question of salary will presently be decided
i shall not forget you   k
only looked up from the letter when the assistants  who read far more slowly than he  gave three loud cheers at the good news and waved their lanterns
 be quiet   he said  and to barnabas   there s been a misunderstanding   barnabas did not seem to comprehend
 there s been a misunderstanding   k
repeated  and the weariness he had felt in the afternoon came over him again  the road to the schoolhouse seemed very long  and behind barnabas he could sec his whole family  and the assistants were still jostling him so closely that he had to drive them away with his elbows
how could frieda have sent them to meet him when he had commanded that they should stay with her  he could quite well have found his own way home  and better alone  indeed  than in this company
and to make matters worse one of them had wound a scarf round his neck whose free ends flapped in the wind and had several times been flung against k  s face
it is true  the other assistant had always disengaged the wrap at once with his long  pointed  perpetually mobile fingers  but that had not made things any better
both of them seemed to have considered it an actual pleasure to walk here and back  and the wind and the wildness of the night threw them into raptures
 get out   shouted k    seeing that you ve come to meet me  why haven t you brought my stick  what have i now to drive you home with   they crouched behind barnabas  but they were not too frightened to set their lanterns on their protector s shoulders  right and left
however  he shook them off at once
 barnabas   said k   and he felt a weight on his heart when he saw that barnabas obviously did not understand him  that though his tunic shone beautifully when fortune was there  when things became serious no help for to be found in him  but only dumb opposition  opposition against which one could not fight  for barnabas himself was helpless  he could only smile  but that was of just as little help as the stars up there against this tempest down below  look what klamm has written   said k   holding the letter before his face
 he has been wrongly informed
i haven t done any surveying at all  and you see yourself how much the assistants are worth
and obviously  too  i can t interrupt work which i ve never begun
i can t even ° itc the gentleman s displeasure  so how can i have earned his preciation  as for being easy in my mind  i can never be hat   i ll see to it   said barnabas  who all the time had been eyeing past the letter  which he could not have read in any case if he was hiding it too close to his face
 oh   said k    you promise me that you ll see to it  but can i really believe you  i m in need of a trustworthy messenger  now more than ever   k
bit his lip with impatience
 sir   replied barnabas  with a gentle inclination of the head   k
almost allowed himself to be seduced by it again into believing barnabas   i ll certainly see to it  and i ll certainly see to the message you gave me last time as well    what   cried k    haven t you seen to that yet then  weren t you at the castle next day    no   replied barnabas   my father is old  you ve seen him yourself  and there happened to be a great deal of work just then  i had to help him  but now i ll be going to the castle again soon    but what are you thinking of  you incomprehensible fellow   cried k   beating his brow with his fist   don t klamm s affairs come before everything else  then  you re in an important position  you re a messenger  and yet you fail me in this wretched manner  what does your father s work matter  klamm is waiting for this information  and instead of breaking your neck hurrying with it to him  you prefer to clean the stable    my father is a cobbler   replied barnabas calmly   he had orders from brunswick  and i m my father s assistant   cobbler  orders from brunswick   cried k bitingly  as if he wanted to abolish the words for ever  and who can need boots here in these eternally empty streets  and what is all this cobbling to me  i entrusted you with a letter  not so that you might mislay it and crumple it on your bench  but that you might carry it at once to klamm   k
became a little more composed now as he remembered that after all klamm had apparently been all this time in the herrenhof and not in the castle at all
but barnabas exasperated him again when  to prove that he had not forgotten k  s first message  he now began to recite it
 enough  i don t want to hear any more   he said
 don t be angry with me  sir   said barnabas  and as if unconsciously wishing to show disapproval of k
he withdrew his gaze from him and lowered his eyes  but probably he was only dejected by k  s outburst  i m not angry   said k   and his exasperation turned now against himself   with you  but it s a bad lookout for me only to have a messenger like you for important affairs    look here   said barnabas  and it was as if  to vindicate his honour as a messenger  he was saying more than he should   klamm is really not waiting for your message  he s actually cross when i arrive  another new message   he said once  and generally he gets up when he sees me coming in the distance and goes into the next room and doesn t receive me
besides  it isn t laid down that i should go at once with every message
if it were laid down of course i would go at once
but it isn t laid down  and if i never went at all  nothing could be said to me
when i take a message it s of my own free will    well and good   replied k   staring at barnabas and intentionally ignoring the assistants  who kept on slowly raising their heads by turns behind barnabas s shoulder as from a trapdoor  and hastily disappearing again with a soft whistle in imitation of the whistling of the wind  as if they were terrified at k 
they enjoyed themselves like this for a long time  what it s like with klamm i don t know  but that you can understand everything there properly i very much doubt  and even if you did  we couldn t better things there
but you can carry a message and that s all i ask you
a quite short message
can you carry it for me to morrow and bring me the answer to morrow  or at least tell me how you were received  can you do that and will you do that  it would be of great service to me
and perhaps i ll have a chance yet of rewarding you properly  or have you any wish now  perhaps  that i can fulfil    certainly i ll carry out your orders   said barnabas
 and will you do your utmost to carry them out as well as you can  to give the message to klamm himself  to get a reply from klamm himself  and immediately  all this immediately  to morrow  in the morning  will you do that    i ll do my best   replied barnabas   but i always do that    we won t argue any more about it now   said k this is the message   the land surveyor begs the director to grant him a personal interview
he accepts in advance any conditions which may be attached to the permission of this
he is driven to make this request because until now very intermediary has completely failed
in proof of this he advances the fact that till now he has not carried out any surveying at all  and according to the information given him by the village superintendent will never carry out such work
consenuently it is with humiliation and despair that he has read the last letter of the director
only a personal interview with the director can be of any help here
the land surveyor knows how extraordinary his request is  but he will exert himself to make his disturbance of the director as little felt as possible he submits himself to any and every limitation of time  also any stipulation which may be considered necessary as to the number of words which may be allowed him during the interview  even with ten words he believes he will be able to manage in profound respect and extreme impatience he awaits your decision   k
had forgotten himself while he was speaking  it was as if he were standing before klamm s door talking to the porter  it has grown much longer than i had thought   he said   but you must learn it by heart  i don t want to write a letter  it would only go the same endless way as the other papers   so for barnabas s guidance  k
scribbled it on a scrap of paper on the back of one of the assistants  while the other assistant held up the lantern
but already k
could take it down from barnabas s dictation  for he had retained it all and spoke it out correctly without being put off by the misleading interpolations of the assistants
 you ve an extraordinary memory   said k   giving him the paper   but now show yourself extraordinary in the other thing as well
and any requests  have you none  it would reassure me a little  i say it frankly   regarding the fate of my message  if you had any   at first barnabas remained silent  then he said    my sisters send you their greetings    your sisters   replied k
 oh  yes  the big strong girls    both send you their greetings  but amalia in particular   said barnabas   besides it was she who brought me this letter for you to day from the castle   struck by this piece of information  k
asked    couldn t she take my message to the castle as well  or couldn t you both go and each of you try your luck    amalia is not allowed into the chancellery   said barnabas   otherwise she would be very glad to do it    i ll come and see you perhaps to morrow   said k    only you come to me first with the answer
i ll wait for you in the school
give my greetings to your sisters too   k  s promise seemed to make barnabas very happy  and after they had shaken hands he could not help touching k
lightly on the shoulder
as if everything were once more as it had been when barnabas first walked into the inn among the peasants in all his glory  k
felt his touch on his shoulder as a distinction  though he smiled at it
in a better mood now  he let the assistants do as they pleased on the way home
he reached the school chilled through and through  it was quite dark  the candles in the lanterns had burned down
led by the assistants  who already knew their way here  he felt his road into one of the classrooms  your first praiseworthy service   he said  remembering klamm s letter
still half asleep frieda cried out from the corner   let k
sleep  don t disturb him   so entirely did k
occupy her thoughts  even though she had been so overcome with sleep that she had not been able to wait up for him
now a light was got  but the lamp could not be turned up very far  for there was only a little paraffin left
the new household was still without many necessaries
the room had been heated  it was true  but it was a large one  sometimes used as the gymnasium   the gymnastic apparatus was standing about and hanging from the ceiling   and it had already used up all the supply of wood   had been very warm and cosy too  as k
was assured  but unfortunately had grown quite cold again
there was  however  a large supply of wood in a shed  but the shed was locked and the teacher had the key
he only allowed this wood to be used for heating the school during teaching hours
the room could have been endured if there had been beds where one might have taken refuge
but in that line there was nothing but one sack stuffed with straw  covered with praiseworthy tidiness by a woollen rug of frieda s  but with no feather bed and only two rough  stiff blankets  which hardly served to keep one warm
and it was precisely at this wretched bed of straw that the assistants were staring greedily  but of course without any hope of ever being allowed to lie on it frieda looked anxiously at k 
that she knew how to make a room  even the most wretched  habitable  she had proved in the bridge inn  but here she had not been able to make any headway  quite without means as she was  our only ornaments are the gymnastic contraptions   said she  trying to smile through her tears
but for the chief deficiencies  the lack of sleeping accommodation and fuel  she promised absolutely to find help the very next day  and begged k
only to be patient till then
from no word  no hint  no sign could one have concluded that she harboured even the slightest trace of bitterness against k
in her heart  although  as he had to admit himself  he had torn her away first from the herrenhof and now from the bridge inn as well so in return k
did his best to find everything tolerable  which was not difficult for him  indeed  because in thought he was still with barnabas repeating his message word for word  not however as he had given it to barnabas  but as he thought it would sound before klamm
after all  however  he was very sincerely glad of the coffee which frieda had boiled for him on a spirit burner  and leaning against the almost cold stove followed the nimble  practised movements with which she spread the indispensable white table cover on the teacher s table  brought out a flowered cup  then some bread and sausage  and actually a tin of sardines
now everything was ready
frieda  too  had not eaten yet  but had waited for k
two chairs were available  there k
and frieda sat down to their table  the assistants at their feet on the dais  but they could never stay quiet  even while eating they made a disturbance
although they had received an ample store of everything and were not yet nearly finished with it  they got up from time to time to make sure whether there was still anything on the table and they could still expect something for themselves k
paid no attention to them and only began to take notice when frieda laughed at them
he covered her hand with his tenderly and asked softly why she was so indulgent to them and treated even their naughtiness so kindly
in this way one would never get rid of them  while through a certain degree of severity  which besides was demanded by their behaviour  one could manage either to curb them or  what was both more probable and more desirable  to make their position so hot for them that they would have finally to leave
the school here didn t seem to be a very pleasant place to live in for long  well  it wouldn t last very long in any case
but they would hardly notice all the drawbacks if the assist  ants were once gone and they two had the quiet house to themselves and didn t she notice  too  that the assistants were becoming more impudent every day  as if they were actually encouraged now by frieda s presence and the hope that k
wouldn t treat them with such firmness as he would have done in other circumstances  besides  there were probably quite simple means of getting rid of them at once  without ceremony  perhaps frieda herself knew of these  seeing that she was so well acquainted with all the circumstances and from all appearances one would only be doing the assistants a favour if one got rid of them in some way  for the advantage they got by staying here couldn t be great  and besides the lazy spell which they must have enjoyed till now must cease here  to a certain extent at any rate  for they would have to work while frieda spared herself after the excitements of the last few days  and he  k   was occupied in finding a way out of their painful position
all the same  if the assistants should go away  he would be so relieved that he felt he could quite easily carry out all the school work in addition to his other duties
frieda  who had been listening attentively  stroked his arm and said that that was her opinion too  but that perhaps he took the assistants  mischief too seriously
they were mere lads  full of spirits and a little silly now that they were for the first time in strange service  just released from the strict discipline of the castle  and so a little dazed and excited
and being in that state they of course committed lots of follies at which it was natural to be annoyed  but which it would be more sensible to laugh at
often she simply couldn t keep from laughing
all the same she absolutely agreed with k
that it would be much better to send the assistants away and be by themselves  just the two of them she pressed closer to k
and hid her face on his shoulder
and there she whispered something so low that k
had to bend his head to hear
it was that all the same she knew of no way dealing with the assistants and she was afraid that all that if had suggested would be of no avail
so far as she knew it
k
himself who had asked for them  and now he had them  would have to keep them it would be best to treat them as a joke  which they certainly were
that would be the best way to put up with them
k
was displeased by her answer  half in jest  half in earnest  he replied that she seemed actually to be in league with them  or at least to have a strong inclination in their favour
well  they were good looking lads  but there was nobody who couldn t be got rid of if only one had the will  and he would show her that that was so in the case of the assistants
frieda said that she would be very grateful to him if he could manage it
and from now on she wouldn t laugh at them any more  or have any unnecessary talk with them
besides she didn t find anything now to laugh at  it was really no joke always to be spied on by two men  she had learned to look at the two of them with k  s eyes
and she actually shrank a little when the assistants got up again  partly to have a look at the food that was left  partly to get to the bottom of the continued whispering
k
employed this incident to increase frieda s disgust for the assistants  drew her towards him  and so side by side they finished their supper
now it was time to go to bed  for they were all very sleepy
one of the assistants had actually fallen asleep over his food
this amused the other one greatly  and he did his best to get the others to look at the vacant face of his companion  but he had no success
k
and frieda sat on above without paying any attention
the cold was becoming so extreme that they shirked going to bed
at last k
declared that the room must be heated  otherwise it would be impossible to get to sleep
he looked round to see if he could find an axe or something
the assistants knew of one and fetched it  and now they proceeded to the wood shed in a few minutes the flimsy door was smashed and torn open as if they had never yet experienced anything so glorious  the assistants began to carry the wood into the classroom  hounding each other on and knocking against each other
soon there was a great pile  the stove was set going  everybody lay down round it  the assistants were given a blanket to roll themselves in   it was quite ample for them  for it was decided that one of them should always remain awake and keep the fire going   and soon it was so hot round the stove that the blankets were no longer needed  the lamps were put out  and k and frieda happily stretched themselves out to sleep in the warm silence k was awakened during the night by some noise or other  and in his first vague sleepy state felt for frieda
he found that  instead of frieda  one of the assistants was lying beside him
probably because of the exacerbation which being suddenly awakened is sufficient in itself to cause  this gave him the greatest fright that he had ever had since he first came to the village
with a cry he sat up  and not knowing what he was doing he gave the assistant such a buffet that he began to cry
however the whole thing was cleared up in a moment
frieda had been awakened   at least so it had seemed to her   by some huge animal  a cat probably  which had sprung on to her breast and then leapt away again
she had got up and was searching the whole room for the beast with a candle
one of the assistants had seized the opportunity to enjoy the sack of straw for a little  an attempt which he was now bitterly repenting
frieda could find nothing  however
perhaps it had only been a delusion  she went back to k
and on the way she stroked the crouching and whimpering assistant over the hair to comfort him  as if she had forgotten the evening s conversation
k
said nothing  but he asked the assistant to stop putting wood on the fire  for owing to almost all the heap having been squandered the room was already too hot
next morning nobody awoke until the school children were there  standing with gaping eyes round the sleepers
this was unpleasant  for on account of the intense heat  which now towards morning had given way  however  to a coldness which could be felt  they had all taken off everything but their shirts  and just as they were beginning to put on their clothes  gisa  the lady teacher  appeared at the door  a fair  tall  beautiful  but somewhat stiff young woman
she was evidently prepared for the new janitor  and seemed also to have been given her instructions by the teacher  for as soon as he appeared at the door  she began   i can t put up with this
this is a fine state of affairs
you have permission to sleep in the classroom  but that s all
i am not obliged to teach in your bedroom
a janitor s family that loll in their beds far into the forenoon   well  something might be said about that  particularly as far as the family and the beds were concerned  thought k   while with frieda s help   the assistants were of no use  lying on the floor they looked in amazement at the lady teacher and the children
he dragged across the parallel bars and the vaulting horse  threw the blanket over them  and so constructed a little room in which one could at least get on one s clothes protected from the children s gaze
he was not given a minute s peace  however  for the lady teacher began to scold because there was no fresh water in the washing basin k
had just been thinking of fetching the basin for himself and frieda to wash in  but he had at once given up the idea so as not to exasperate the lady teacher too much  but his renunciation was of no avail  for immediately afterwards there was a loud crash unfortunately  it seemed  they had forgotten to clear away the remains of the supper from the teacher s table  so she sent it all flying with her ruler and everything fell on the floor she didn t need to bother about the sardine oil and the remainder of the coffee being spilt and the coffee pot smashed to pieces  the janitor of course could soon clear that up
clothed once more  k
and frieda  leaning on the parallel bars  witnessed the destruction of their few things
the assistants  who had obviously never thought of putting on their clothes  had stuck their heads through a fold of the blankets near the floor  to the great delight of the children
what grieved frieda most was naturally the loss of the coffee pot
only when k
to comfort her assured her that he would go immediately to the village superintendent and demand that it should be replaced  and see that this was done  was she able to gather herself together sufficiently to run out of their stockade in her chemise and skirt and rescue the table cover at least from being stained any more
and she managed it  though the lady teacher to frighten her kept on hammering on the table with the ruler in the most nerve racking fashion
when k
and frieda were quite clothed they had to compel the assistants   who seemed to be struck dumb by these events  to get their clothes on as well
had not merely to order them and push them  indeed  but actually to put some of their clothes on for them
then  when all was ready  k
shared out the remaining work
the assistants were to bring in wood and light the fire  but in the other classroom first  from which another and greater danger threatened  for the teacher himself was probably already there frieda was to scrub the floor and k
would fetch fresh water and set things to rights generally for the time being breakfast could not be thought of
but so as to find out definitively the attitude of the lady teacher  k
decided to issue from their shelter himself first  the others were only to follow when he called them he adopted this policy on the one hand because he did not want the position to be compromised in advance by any stupid act of the assistants  and on the other because he wanted frieda to be spared as much as possible
for she had ambitions and he had none  she was sensitive and he was not  she only thought of the petty discomforts of the moment  while he was thinking of barnabas and the future
frieda followed all his instructions implicitly  and scarcely took her eyes from him
hardly had he appeared when the lady teacher cried amid the laughter of the children  which from now on never stopped   slept well   and as k
paid no attention   seeing that after all it was not a real question but began to clear up the washstand  she asked   what have you been doing to my cat   a huge  fat old cat was lying lazily outstretched on the table  and the teacher was examining one of its paws which was evidently a little hurt so frieda had been right after all  this cat had not of course leapt on her  for it was past the leaping stage  but it had crawled over her  had been terrified by the presence of people in the empty house  had concealed itself hastily  and in its unaccustomed hurry had hurt itself
k
tried to explain this quietly to the lady teacher  but the only thing she had eyes for was the injury itself and she replied   well  then it s your fault through coming here
just look at thiss   and she called k
over to the table  showed him the paw  and before he could get a proper look at it  gave him a whack with the tawse over the back of his hand
the tails of the tawse were blunted  it was true  but  this time without any regard for the cat  she had brought them down so sharply that they raised bloody weals
 and now go about your business   she said impatiently  bowing herself once more over the cat
frieda  who had been looking on with the assistants from behind the parallel bars  cried out when she saw the blood
k
held up his hand in front of the children and said   look  that s what a sly  wicked cat has done to me   he said it  indeed  not for the children s benefit  whose shouting and laughter had become continuous  so that it needed no further occasion or incitement  and could not be pierced or influenced by any words of his
but seeing that the lady teacher  too  only acknowledged the insult by a brief side glance  and remained still occupied with the cat  her first fury satiated by the drawing of blood  k
called frieda and the assistants  and then work began
when k
had carried out the pail with the dirty water  fetched fresh water  and was beginning to turn out the classroom  a boy of about twelve stepped out from his desk  touched k  s hand  and said something which was quite lost in the general uproar then suddenly every sound ceased and k
turned round
the thing he had been fearing all morning had come
in the door stood the teacher
in each hand the little man held an assistant by the scruff of the neck
he had caught them  it seemed  while they were fetching wood  for in a mighty voice he began to shout  pausing after every word   who has dared to break into the wood shed  where is the villain  so that i may annihilate him   then frieda got up from the floor  which she was trying to clean near the feet of the lady teacher  looked across at k as if she were trying to gather strength from him  and said  a little of her old superciliousness in her glance and bearing   i did it  mr teacher i couldn t think of any other way
if the classrooms were to be heated in time  the wood shed had to be opened i didn t dare to ask you for the key in the middle of die night  my fiance was at the herrenhof  it was possible that he might stay there all night  so i had to decide for myself
if i have done wrongly  forgive my inexperience
i ve been scolded enough by my fiance  after he saw what had happened
yes  he even forbade me to light the fires early  because he thought that you had shown by locking the wood shed that you didn t want them to be put on before you came yourself
so it s his fault that the fires are not on  but mine that the shed has been broken into    who broke open the door   asked the teacher  turning to the assistants  who were still vainly struggling to escape from his grip
 the gentleman   they both replied  and  so that there might be no doubt  pointed at k
frieda laughed  and her laughter seemed to be still more conclusive than her words
then she began to wring out in the pail the rag with which she had been scrubbing the floor  as if the episode had been closed with her declaration  and the evidence of the assistants were merely a belated jest
only when she was at work on her knees again did she add   our assistants are mere children who in spite of their age should still be at their desks in school
last evening i really did break open the door myself with the axe  it was quite easy  i didn t need the assistants to help me  they would only have been a nuisance
but when my fiand arrived later in the night and went out to see the damage and if possible put it right  the assistants ran out after him  likely because they were afraid to stay here by themselves  and saw my fiance working at the broken door  and that s why they say now   but they re only children      true  the assistants kept on shaking their heads during frieda s story  pointed again at k and did their best by means of dumb show to deflect her from her story
but as they did not succeed they submitted at last  took frieda s words as a command  and on being questioned anew by the teacher made no reply
 so   said the teacher   you ve been lying  or at least you ve groundlessly accused the janitor   they still remained silent  but their trembling and their apprehensive glances seemed to indicate guilt
 then i ll give you a sound thrashing straight away   he said  and he sent one of the children into the next room for his cane
then as he was raising it  frieda cried   the assistants have told the truth   flung her scrubbing cloth in despair into the pail  so that the water splashed up on every side  and ran behind the parallel bars  where she remained concealed
 a lying crew   remarked the lady teacher  who had just finished bandaging the pawr  and she took the beast into her lap  for which it was almost too big
 so it was the janitor   said the teacher  pushing the assistants away and turning to k   who had been listening all the time leaning on the handle of his broom   this fine janitor who out of cowardice allows other people to be falsely accused of his own villainies    well   said k   who had not missed the fact that frieda s intervention had appeased the first uncontrollable fury of the teacher   if the assistants had got a little taste of the rod i shouldn t have been sorry
if they get off ten times when they should justly be punished  they can well afford to pay for it by being punished unjustly for once
but besides that it would have been very welcome to me if a direct quarrel between me and you  mr teacher  could have been avoided perhaps you would have liked it as well yourself too
but seeing that frieda has sacrificed me to the assistants now   here k
paused  and in the silence frieda s sobs could be heard behind the screen    of course a clean breast must be made of the whole business    scandalous   said the lady teacher
 i am entirely of your opinion  fraulein gisa   said the teacher
 you  janitor  are of course dismissed from your post for these scandalous doings
your further punishment i reserve meantime  but now clear yourself and your belongings out of the house at once
it will be a genuine relief to us  and the teaching will manage to begin at last
now quick about it    i shan t move a foot from here   said k
 you re my superior  but not the person who engaged tne for this post
it was the superintendent who did that  and i ll only accept notice from him
and he certainly never gave me this post so that i and my dependants should freeze here  but as you told me yourself   to keep me from doing anything thoughtless or desperate
to dismiss me suddenly now would therefore be absolutely against his intentions
till i hear the contrary from his own mouth i refuse to believe it
besides it may possibly be greatly to your own advantage  too  if i don t accept your notice  given so hastily    so you don t accept it   asked the teacher
k
shook his head
 think it over carefully   said the teacher   your decisions aren t always for the best
you should reflect  for instance  on yesterday afternoon  when you refused to be examined    why do you bring that up now   asked k
 because it s my whim   replied the teacher   and now i repeat for the last tune  get out   but as that too had no effect the teacher went over to the table and consulted in a whisper with fraulefo gisa
she said something about the police  but the teacher rejected it  finally they seemed in agreement  the teacher ordered the children to go into his classroom  they would be taught there along with the other children
this change delighted everybody  the room was emptied in a moment amid laughter and shouting  the teacher and fraulein gisa followed last
the latter carried the class register  and on it in all its bulk the perfectly indifferent cat
the teacher would gladly have left the cat behind  but a suggestion to that effect was negatived decisively by fraulein gisa with a reference to k  s inhumanity
so  in addition to all his other annoyances  the teacher blamed k
for the cat as well
and that influenced his last words to k   spoken when he reached the door   the lady has been driven by force to leave the room with her children  because you have rebelliously refused to accept my notice  and because nobody can ask of her  a young girl  that she should teach in the middle of your dirty household affairs
so you are left to yourself  and you can spread yourself as much as you like  undisturbed by the disapproval of respectable people
but it won t last for long  i promise you that   with that he slammed the door
hardly was everybody gone when k
said to the assistants   clear out   disconcerted by the unexpectedness of the command  they obeyed  but when k
locked the door behind them they tried to get in again  whimpered outside and knocked on the door
 you are dismissed   cried k    never again will i take you into my service   but that  of course  was just what they did not want  and they kept hammering on the door with their hands and feet
 let us back to you  sir   they cried  if they were being swept away by a flood and k
were dry wood
but k
did not relent  he waited impatiently for the unbearable din to force the teacher to intervene
that soon happened
 let your confounded assistants in   he shouted
 i ve dismissed them   k
shouted back
it had the incidental effect of showing the teacher what it was to be strong enough not merely to give notice but to enforce it
the teacher next tried to soothe the assistants by kindly assurances that they had only to wait quietly and k
would have to let them in sooner or later
then he went away
and now things might have settled down if k
had not begun to shout at them again that they were finally dismissed once and for all  and had not the faintest chance of being taken back
upon that they recommenced their din
once more the teacher entered  but this time he no longer tried to reason with them  but drove them  apparently with his dreaded rod  out of the house
soon they appeared in front of the windows of the gymnasium  rapped on the panes and cried something  but their words could no longer be distinguished
they did not stay there long either  in the deep snow they could not be as active as their frenzy required
so they flew to the railings of the school garden and sprang on to the stone pediment  where  moreover  though only from a distance  they had a better view of the room
there they ran to and fro holding on to the railings  then remained standing and stretched out their clasped hands beseechingly towards k  they went on like this for a long time  without thinking of the uselessness of their efforts
they were as if obsessed  they did not even stop when k
drew down the window blinds so as to rid himself of the sight of them in the now darkened room k
went over to the parallel bars to look for frieda
on encountering his gaze she got up  put her hair in order  dried her tears and began in silence to prepare the coffee
although she knew of everything  k
formally announced to her all the same that he had dismissed the assistants
she merely nodded
k
sat down at one of the desks and followed her tired movements
it had been her unfailing aliveliness and decision that had given her insignificant physique its beauty
now that beauty was gone
a few days of living with k
had been enough to achieve this
her work in the taproom had not been light  but apparently it had been more suited to her
or was her separation from klamm the real cause of her falling away  it was the nearness of klamm that had made her so irrationally seductive
that was the seduction which had drawn k
to her  and now she was withering in his arms  frieda   said k
she put away the coffee mill at once and went over to k
at his desk
 you re angry with me   asked she
 no   replied k
 i don t think you can help yourself
you were happy in the herrenhof
i should have let you stay there    yes   said frieda  gazing sadly in front of her   you should have let me stay there  i m not good enough for you to live with
if you were rid of me  perhaps you would be able to achieve all that you want
out of regard for me you ve submitted yourself to the tyranny of the teacher  taken on this wretched post  and are doing your utmost to get an interview with klamm all for me  but i don t give you much in return    no  no   said k   putting his arm round her comfortingly
 all these things are trifles that don t hurt me  and it s not only on your account that i want to get to klamm
and then think of all you ve done for me  before i knew you i was going about in a blind circle
nobody took me up  and if i made up to anybody i was soon sent about my business
and when i was given the chance of a little hospitality it was with people that i always wanted to run away from  like barnabas s family     you wanted to run away from them  you did  darling   cried frieda eagerly  and after a hesitating  yes   from k   sank back once more into her apathy
but k
had no longer resolution enough to explain in what way everything had changed for the better for him through his connexion with frieda
he slowly took away his arm and they sat for a little in silence  until   as if his arm had given her warmth and comfort  which now she could not do without   frieda said   i won t be able to stand this life here
if you want to keep me with you  we ll have to go away somewhere or other  to the south of france  or to spain    i can t go away   replied k
 i came here to stay
i ll stay here   and giving utterance to a self contradiction which he made no effort to explain  he added as if to himself   what could have enticed me to this desolate country except the wish to stay here   then he went on   but you want to stay here too  after all it s your own country only you miss klamm and that gives you desperate ideas    i miss klamm   said frieda
 i ve all i want of klamm here  too much klamm
it s to escape from him that i want to go away
it s not klamm that i miss  it s you
i want to go away for your sake  because i can t get enough of you  here where everything distracts me
i would gladly lose my pretty looks  i would gladly be sick and ailing  if i could be left in peace with you   k
had only paid attention to one thing
 then klamm is still in communication with you   he asked eagerly   he sends for you    i know nothing about klamm   replied frieda   i was speaking just now of others  i mean the assistants    oh  the assistants   said k
in disappointment   do they persecute you    why  have you never noticed it   asked frieda
 no   replied k   trying in vain to remember anything   they re certainly importunate and lascivious young fellows  but i hadn t noticed that they had dared to lift their eyes to you    no   said frieda   did you never notice that they simply weren t to be driven out of our room in the bridge inn  that they jealously watched all our movements  that one of them finished up by taking my place on that sack of straw  that they gave evidence against you a minute ago so as to drive you out of this and ruin you  and so as to be left alone with me  you ve never noticed all that   k
gazed at frieda without replying
her accusations against the assistants were true enough  but all the same they could be interpreted far more innocently as simple effects of the ludicrously childish  irresponsible  and undisciplined characters of the two
and didn t it also speak against their guilt that they had always done their best to go with k
everywhere and not to be left with frieda  k
halfsuggested this
 it s their deceit   said frieda   have you never seen through it  well  why have you driven them away  if not for those reasons   and she went to the window  drew the blind aside a little  glanced out  and then called k
over
the assistants were still clinging to the railings
tired as they must have been by now  they still gathered their strength together every now and then and stretched their arms out beseechingly towards the school so as not to have to hold on all the time  one of them had hooked himself on to the railings behind by the tail of his coat  poor things  poor things   said frieda  you ask why i drove them away   asked k
 you were the sole cause of that    i   asked frieda without taking her eyes from the assistants
 your much too kind treatment of the assistants   said k    the way you forgave their offences and smiled at them and stroked their hair  your perpetual sympathy for them    poor things  poor things   you said just now and finally this last thing that has happened  that you haven t scrupled even to sacrifice me to save the assistants from a beating    yes  that s just it  that s what i ve been trying to tell you  that s just what makes me unhappy  what keeps me from you even though i can t think of any greater happiness than to be with you all the time  without interruption  endlessly  even though i feel that here in this world there s no undisturbed place for our love  neither in the village nor anywhere else
and i dream of a grave  deep and narrow  where we could clasp each other in our arms as with iron bars  and i would hide my face in you and you would hide your face in me  and nobody would ever see us any more but here   look  there are the assistants  it s not you they think of when they clasp their hands  but me    and it s not i who am looking at them   said k    but you    certainly  me   said frieda almost angrily   that s what i ve been saying all the time
why else should they be always at my heels  even if they are messengers of klamm s    messengers of klamm s   repeated k
extremely astonished by this designation  though it seemed natural enough at the same time
 certainly  messengers of klamm s   said frieda
 even if they are  still they re silly boys  too  who need to have more sense hammered into them
what ugly black young demons they are  and how disgusting the contrast is between their faces  which one would say belonged to grown ups  almost to students  and their silly childish  behaviour
do you think i don t see that  it makes me feel ashamed for them
well  that s just it  they don t repel me  but i feel ashamed for them
i can t help looking at them
when one ought to be annoyed with them  i can only laugh at tem
when people want to strike them  i can only stroke rheir hair
and when i m lying beside you at night i can t sleep and must always be leaning across you to look at them  one of them lying rolled up asleep in the blanket and the other kneeling before the stove door putting in wood  and i have to bend forward so far that i nearly waken you
and it wasn t the cat that frightened me   oh  i ve had experience of cats and i ve bad experience as well of disturbed nights in the taproom   it wasn t the cat that frightened me  i m frightened at myself
no  it didn t need that big beast of a cat to waken me  i start up at the slightest noise
one minute i m afraid you ll waken and spoil everything  and the next i spring up and light the candle to force you to waken at once and protect me    i knew nothing of all this   said k    it was only a vague suspicion of it that made me send them away
but now they re gone  and perhaps everything will be all right    yes  they re gone at last   said frieda  but her face was worried  not happy   only we don t know who they are
messengers of klamm s i call them in my mind  though not seriously  but perhaps they are really that
their eyes   those ingenuous and yet flashing eyes   remind me somehow of klamm s
yes  that s it  it s klamm s glance that sometimes runs through me from their eyes
and so it s not true when i say that i m ashamed for them
i only wish it were
i know quite well that anywhere else and in anyone else their behaviour would seem stupid and offensive  but in them it isn t
i watch their stupid tricks with respect and admiration
but if they re klamm s messengers who ll rid us of them  and besides would it be a good thing to be rid of them  wouldn t you have to fetch them back at once in that case and be happy if they were still willing to come    you want me to bring them back again   asked k  no  no   said frieda   it s the last thing i desire
the sight of them  if they were to rush in here now  their joy at seeing me again  the way they would hop round like children and stretch out their arms to me like men no  i don t i would be able to stand that but all the same when i that if you keep on hardening your heart to them  it keep you  perhaps  from ever getting admittance to klamm  i want to save you by any means at all from such consequences
in that case my only wish is for you to let them in
in that case let them in now at once
don t bother about me
what do i matter  i ll defend myself as long as i can  but if i have to surrender  then i ll surrender with the consciousness that that  too  is for your sake    you only strengthen me in my decision about the assistants   said k
 never will they come in with my will
the fact that i ve got them out of this proves at least that in certain circumstances they can be managed  and therefore  in addition  that they have no real connexion with klamm only last night i received a letter from klamm from which it was clear that klamm was quite falsely informed about the assistants  from which again one can only draw the conclusion that he is completely indifferent to them  for if that were not so he would certainly have obtained exact information about them
and the fact that you see klamm in them proves nothing  for you re still  unfortunately  under the landlady s influence and see klamm everywhere
you re still klamm s sweetheart  and not my wife yet by a long chalk
sometimes that makes me quite dejected  i feel then as if i had lost everything  i feel as if i had only newly come to the village  yet not full of hope  as i actually came  but with the knowledge that only disappointments await me  and that i will have to swallow them down one after another to the very dregs
but that is only sometimes   k
added smiling  when he saw frieda s dejection at hearing his words   and at bottom it merely proves one good thing  that is  how much you mean to me
and if you order me now to choose between you and the assistants  that s enough to decide the assistants  fate
what an idea  to choose between you and the assistants  but now i want to be rid of them finally  in word and thought as well
besides who knows whether the weakness that has come over us both mayn t be due to the fact that we haven t had breakfast yet    that s possible   said frieda  smiling wearily and going about her work
k   too  grasped the broom again
after a while there was a soft rap at the door
 barnabas   cried k   throwing down the broom  and with a few steps he was at the door
frieda stared at him  more terrified at the man than anything else
with his trembling hands k 
could not turn the old lock immediately
 i ll open in a minute   he kept on repeating instead of asking who was actually there
and then he had to face the fact that through the wide open door came not barnabas  but the little boy who had tried to speak to him before
but k
had no wish to be reminded of him
 what do you want here   he asked
 the classes are being taught next door    i ve come from there   replied the boy  looking up at k
quietly with his great brown eyes  and standing at attention  with his arms by his side  what do you want then  out with it i  said k   bending a little forward  for the boy spoke in a low voice
 can i help you   asked the boy
 he wants to help us  said k
to frieda  and then to the boy   what s your name    hans brunswick   replied the boy   fourth standard  son of otto brunswick  master cobbler in madeleinegasse    i see  your name is brunswick   said k   now in a kinder tone
it came out that hans had been so indignant at seeing the bloody weals which the lady teacher had raised on k  s hand  that he had resolved at once to stand by k
he had boldly slipped away just now from the classroom next door at the risk of severe punishment  somewhat as a deserter goes over to the enemy
it may indeed have been chiefly some such boyish fancy that had impelled him
the seriousness which he evinced in everything he did seemed to indicate it
shyness held him back at the beginning  but he soon got used to k
and frieda  and when he was given a cup of good hot coffee he became lively and confidential and began to question them eagerly and insistently  as if he wanted to know the gist of the matter as quickly as possible  to enable him to come to an independent decision about what they should do
there was something imperious in his character  but it was so mingled with childish innocence that they submitted to it without resistance  half smilingly  half in earnest
in any case he demanded all their attention for himself work completely stopped  the breakfast lingered on unconscionably
although hans was sitting at one of the scholars  desks and k
in a chair on the dais with frieda beside him  it looked as if hans were the teacher  and as if he were examining them and passing judgement on their answers
a faint smile round his soft mouth seemed to indicate that he knew quite well that all this was only a game  but that made him only the more serious in conducting it
perhaps  too  it was not really a smile but the happiness of childhood that played round his lips
strangely enough he only admitted quite late in the conversation that he had known k
ever since his visit to lasemann s
k
was delighted
 you were playing at the lady s feet   asked k
 yes   replied hans   that was my mother   and now he had to tell about his mother  but he did so hesitatingly and only after being repeatedly asked
and it was clear now that he was only a child  out of whose mouth  it is true   especially in his questions   sometimes the voice of an energetic  far seeing man seemed to speak
but then all at once  without transition  he was only a schoolboy again who did not understand many of the questions  misconstrued others  and in childish inconsiderateness spoke too low  although he had the fault repeatedly pointed out to him  and out of stubbornness silently refused to answer some of the other questions at all  quite without embarrassment  however  as a grown up would have been incapable of doing
he seemed to feel that he alone had the right to ask questions  and that by the questions of frieda and k
some regulation were broken and time wasted
that made him sit silent for a long time  his body erect  his head bent  his underlip pushed out
frieda was so charmed by his expression at these moments that she sometimes put questions to him in the hope that they would evoke it
and she succeeded several times  but k
was only annoyed
all that they found out did not amount to much
hans s mother was slightly unwell  but what her illness was remained indefinite
the child which she had had in her lap was hans s sister and was called frieda  hans was not pleased by the fact that her name was the same as the lady s who was questioning him   the family lived in the village  but not with lasemann   they had only been there on a visit and to be bathed  seeing that lasemann had the big tub in which the younger children  to whom hans didn t belong  loved to bathe and splash about
of his father hans spoke now with respect  now with fear  but only when his mother was not occupying the conversation
compared with his mother his father evidently was     of little account  but all their questions about brunswick s family life remained  in spite of their efforts  unanswered
k
learned that the father had the biggest shoemaker s business in the place  nobody could compete with him  a fact which quite remote questions brought again and again
he actually gave out work to the other shoemakers  for example to barnabas s father
in this last case he had done it of course as a special favour   at least hans s proud toss of the head seemed to hint at this  a gesture which made frieda run over and give him a kiss
the question whether he had been in the castle yet he only answered after it had been repeated several times  and with a  no   the same question regarding his mother he did not answer at all
at last k
grew tired
to him  too  these questions seemed useless  he admitted that the boy was right
besides there was something humiliating in ferreting out family secrets by taking advantage of a child
doubly humiliating  however  was the fact that in spite of his efforts he had learned nothing
and when to finish the matter he asked the boy what was the help he wanted to offer  he was no longer surprised to hear that hans had only wanted to help with the work in the school  so that the teacher and his assistant might not scold k
so much
k
explained to hans that help of that kind was not needed  scolding was part of the teacher s nature and one could scarcely hope to avoid it even by the greatest diligence  the work itself was not hard  and only because of special circumstances had it been so far behind that morning  besides scolding hadn t the same effect on k as on a scholar  he shook it off  it was almost a matter of indifference to him  he hoped  too  to get quite clear of the teacher soon
though hans had only wanted to help him in dealing with the teacher  however  he thanked him sincerely  but now hans had better return to his class  with luck he would not be punished if he went back at once
although k
did not emphasize and only involuntarily suggested that it was simply help in dealing with the teacher which he did not require  leaving the question of other kinds of help open  hans caught the suggestion clearly and asked whether perhaps k
needed any other assistance
he would be very glad to help him  and if he were not in a position to help him himself  he would ask his mother to do so  and then it would be sure to be all right when his father had difficulties  he  too  asked hans s mother for help
and his mother had already asked once about k   she herself hardly ever left the house  it had been a great exception for her to be at lasemann s that day
but he  hans  often went there to play with lasemann s children  and his mother had once asked him whether the land surveyor had ever happened to be there again
only his mother wasn t supposed to talk too much  seeing she was so weak and tired  and so he had simply replied that he hadn t seen the land surveyor there  and nothing more had been said
but when he had found k
here in the school  he had had to speak to him  so that he might tell his mother the news
for that was what pleased his mother most  when without her express command one did what she wanted
after a short pause for reflection k
said that he did not need any help  he had all that he required  but it was very good of hans to want to help him  and he thanked him for his good intentions
it was possible that later he might be in need of something and then he would turn to hans  he had his address
in return perhaps he  k   might be able to offer a little help
he was sorry to hear that hans s mother was ill and that apparently nobody in the village understood her illness
if it was neglected like that a trifling malady might sometimes lead to grave consequences
now he  k   had some medical knowledge  and  what was of still more value  experience in treating sick people
many a case which the doctors had given up he had been able to cure
at home they had called him  the bitter herb  on account of his healing powers
in any case he would be glad to see hans s mother and speak with her
perhaps he might be able to give her good advice  for if only for hans s sake he would be delighted to do it
at first hans s eyes lit up at this offer  exciting k
to greater urgency  but the outcome was unsatisfactory  for to several questions hans replied  without showing the slightest trace of regret  that no stranger was allowed to visit his mother  she had to be guarded so carefully
although that day k
had scarcely spoken to her she had had to stay for several days in bed  a thing indeed that often happened
but his father had then been very angry with k
and he would certainly never k
to come to the house
he had actually wanted to seek out at the time to punish him for his impudence  only hans s bother had held him back
but in any case his mother never wanted to talk with anybody whatever  and her inquiry about k
was no exception to the rule
on the contrary  seeing he had been  mentioned  she could have expressed the wish to see him  but she hadn t done so  and in that had clearly made known her will
she only wanted to hear about k
but she did not want to speak to him
besides it wasn t any real illness that she was suffering from  she knew quite well the cause of her state and often had actually indicated it
apparently it was the climate here that she could not stand  but all the same she would not leave the place  on account of her husband and children  besides  she was already better in health than she used to be
here k
felt hans s powers of thought visibly increasing in his attempt to protect his mother from k   from k
whom he had ostensibly wanted to help
yes  in the good cause of keeping k
away from his mother he even contradicted in several respects what he had said before  particularly in regard to his mother s illness
nevertheless k
remarked that even so hans was still well disposed towards him  only when his mother was in question he forgot everything else
whoever was set up beside his mother was immediately at a disadvantage
just now it had been k   but it could as well be his father  for example
k
wanted to test this supposition and said that it was certainly thoughtful of hans s father to shield his mother from any disturbance  and if he  k   had only guessed that day at this state of things  he would never have thought of venturing to speak to her  and he asked hans to make his apologies to her now
on the other hand he could not quite understand why hans s father  seeing that the cause of her sickness was so clearly known as hans said  kept her back from going somewhere else to get well
one had to infer that he kept her back  for she only remained on his account and the children s  but she could take the children with her  and she need not have to go away for any long time or for any great distance  even up on the castle hill the air was quite different
hans s father had no need to fear the cost of the holiday  seeing he was the biggest shoemaker in the place  and it was pretty certain that he or she had relations or acquaintances in the castle who would be glad to take her in
why did he not let her go  he shouldn t underestimate an illness like this  k
had only seen hans s mother for a minute  but it had actually been her striking pallor and weakness that had impelled him to speak to her
even at that time he had been surprised that her husband had let her sit there in the damp steam of the washing and bathing when she was ill  and had put no restraint either on his loud talk with the others
hans s father really did not know the actual state of things
even if her illness had improved in the last few weeks  illnesses like that had ups and downs  and in the end  if one did not fight them  they returned with redoubled strength  and then the patient was past help
even if k
could not speak to hans s mother  still it would perhaps be advisable if he were to speak to his father and draw his attention to all this
hans had listened intently  had understood most of it  and had been deeply impressed by the threat implicit in this dark advice
nevertheless he replied that k
could not speak to his father  for his father disliked him and would probably treat him as the teacher had done
he said this with a shy smile when he was speaking of k   but sadly and bitterly when he mentioned his father
but he added that perhaps k
might be able to speak to his mother all the same  but only without his father s knowledge
then deep in thought hans stared in front of him for a little   just like a woman who wants to do something forbidden and seeks an opportunity to do it without being punished   and said that the day after to morrow it might be possible  his father was going to the herrenhof in the evening  he had a conference there
then he  hans  would come in the evening and take k
along to his mother  of course  assuming that his mother agreed  which was however very improbable
she never did anything at all against the wishes of his father  she submitted to him in everything  even in things whose unreasonableness he  hans  could see through
long before this k
had called hans up to the dais  drawn him between his knees  and had kept on caressing him cornfortingly
the nearness helped  in spite of hans s occasional reluctance  to bring about an understanding
they agreed finally to the following  hans would first tell his mother the entire truth  but  so as to make her consent easier  add that k
wanted to speak to brunswick himself as well  not about her at all but about his own affairs besides this was true
in the course of the conversation k
had remembered that brunswick  even if he were a bad and dangerous man  could scarcely be his enemy now  if he had been  according to the information of the superintendent  the leader of those who  even if only on political grounds  were in favour of engaging a land surveyor
k  s arrival in the village must therefore have been welcomed by brunswick
but in that case his morose greeting that first day and the dislike of which hans spoke were almost incomprehensible   perhaps  however  brunswick had been hurt simply because k
had not turned to him first for help  perhaps there existed some other misunderstanding which could be cleared up by a few words
but if that were done k
might very well secure in brunswick a supporter against the teacher  yes and against the superintendent as well
the whole official plot   for was it anything else really    by means of which the superintendent and the teacher were keeping him from reaching the castle authorities and had driven him into taking a janitor s post  might be unmasked
if it came anew to a fight about k
between brunswick and the superintendent  brunswick would have to include k
on his side  k
would become a guest in brunswick s house  brunswick s fighting resources would be put at his disposal in spite of the superintendent
who could tell what he might not be able to achieve by those means  and in any case he would often be in the lady s company   so he played with his dreams and they with him  while hans  thinking only of his mother  painfully watched k  s silence  as one watches a doctor who is sunk in reflexion while he tries to find the proper remedy for a grave case with k  s proposal to speak to brunswick about his post as land surveyor hans was in agreement  but only because by means of this his mother would be shielded from his father  and because in any case it was only a last resort which with good luck might not be needed
he merely asked farther how k
was to explain to his father the lateness of the visit  and was content at last  though his face remained a little overcast  with the suggestion that k
would say that his unendurable post in the school and the teacher s humiliating treatment had made him in sudden despair forget all caution
now that  so far as one could see  everything had been provided for  and the possibility of success at least conceded  hans  freed from his burden of reflexion  became happier  and chatted for some time longer with k
and afterwards with frieda   who had sat for a long time as if absorbed by quite different thoughts  and only now began to take part in the conversation again
among other things she asked him what he wanted to become  he did not think long but said he wanted to be a man like k
when he was asked next for his reasons he really did not know how to reply  and the question whether he would like to be a janitor he answered with a decided negative
only through further questioning did they perceive by what roundabout ways he had arrived at his wish
k  s present condition was in no way enviable  but wretched and humiliating even hans saw this clearly without having to ask other people
he himself would have certainly preferred to shield his mother from k  s slightest word  even from having to see him in spite of this  however  he had come to k
and had begged to be allowed to help him  and had been delighted when k
agreed
he imagined  too  that other people felt the same
and  most important of all  it had been his mother herself who had mentioned k  s name
these contradictions had engendered in him the belief that though for the moment k
was wretched and looked down on  yet in an almost unimaginable and distant future he would excel everybody and it was just this absurdly distant future and the glorious developments which were to lead up to it that attracted hans
that was why he was willing to accept k
even in his present state
the peculiar childish  grown up acuteness of this wish consisted in the fact that hans looked on k
as on a younger brother whose future would reach further than his own  the future of a very little boy
and it was with an almost troubled seriousness that  driven into a corner by frieda s questions  he at last confessed those things
k
only cheered him up again when he said that he knew what hans envied him for
it was for his beautiful walking stick  which hans had been playing with constantly during the conversation
now k
knew how to produce sticks like that  and if their plan were successful he would make hans an even more beautiful one
it was no longer quite clear now whether hans had not really meant merely the walkingstick  so happy was he made by k  s promise
and he said goodbye with a glad face  not without pressing k  s hand firmly and saying   the day after to morrow  then   it had been high time for hans to go  for shortly afterwards the teacher flung open the door and shouted when he saw k
and frieda sitting idly at the table   forgive my intrusion  but will you tell me when this place is to be finally put in order  we have to sit here packed like herring  so that the teaching can t go on
and there are you lolling about in the big gymnasium  and you ve even sent away the assistants to give yourselves more room
at least get on to your feet now and get a move on   then to k    now go and bring me my lunch from the bridge inn   all this was delivered in a furious shout  though the words were comparatively inoffensive
k
was quite prepared to obey  but to draw the teacher he said   but i ve been given notice    notice or no notice  bring me my lunch   replied the teacher
 notice or no notice  that s just what i want to be sure about   said k
 what nonsense is this   asked the teacher
 you know you didn t accept the notice    and is that enough to make it invalid   asked k
 not for me   said the teacher   you can take my word for that  but for the superintendent  it seems  though i can t understand it but take to your heck now  or else i ll fling you out in earnest   k
was content the teacher then had spoken with the superintendent  or perhaps he hadn t spoken after all  but had merely thought over carefully the superintendent s probable intentions  and these had weighed in k  s favour
now k
was setting out hastily to get the lunch  but the teacher called him back from the very doorway  either because he wanted by this counter order to test k  s willingness to serve  so that he might know how far he could go in future  or because a fresh fit of imperiousness had seized him  and it him pleasure to make k
run to and fro like a waiter  on his side k
knew that through too great compliance he would only become the teacher s slave and scapegoat  but within tain limits he decided for the present to give way to the fellow s caprices  for even if the teacher  as had been shown  had noted the power to dismiss him  yet he could certainly make the post so difficult that it could not be borne
and the post was more important in k  s eyes now than ever before
the conversation with hans had raised new hopes in him  improbable  he admitted  completely groundless even  but all the same not to be put out of his mind
they almost superseded barnabas himself if he gave himself up to them   and there was no choice   then he must husband all his strength  trouble about nothing else  food  shelter  the village authorities  no not even about frieda and in reality the whole thing turned only on frieda  for everything else only gave him anxiety in relation to her for this reason he must try to keep this post which gave frieda a certain degree of security  and he must not complain if for this end he were made to endure more at the teacher s hands than he would have had to endure in the ordinary course
all that sort of thing could be put up with  it belonged to the ordinary continual petty annoyances of life  it was nothing compared with what k
was striving for  and he had not come here simply to lead an honoured and comfortable life
and so  as he had been ready to run over to the inn  he showed himself now willing to obey the second order  and first set the room to rights so that the lady teacher and her children could come back to it but it had to be done with all speed  for after that k
had to go for the lunch  and the teacher was already ravenous
k
assured him that it would all be done as he desired
for a little the teacher looked on while k
hurried up  cleared away the sack of straw  put back the gymnastic apparatus in its place  and swept the room out while frieda washed and scrubbed the dais
their diligence seemed to appease the teacher  he only drew their attention to the fact that there was a pile of wood for the fire outside the door   he would not allow k
further access to the shed  of course   and then went back to his class with the threat that he would return soon and inspect
after a few minutes of silent work frieda asked k
why he submitted so humbly to the teacher now
the question was asked in a sympathetic  anxious tone  but k   who was thinking of little frieda had succeeded in keeping her original promise to shield him from the teacher s orders and insults  merely replied shortly that since he was the janitor he must fulfil the janitor s duties
then there was silence again until k   reminded vividly by this short exchange of words that frieda had been for a long time lost in anxious thought   and particularly through almost the whole conversation with hans   asked her bluntly while he carried in the firewood what had been troubling her
slowly turning her eyes upon him she replied that it was nothing definite  she had only been thinking of the landlady and the truth of much of what she said
only when k
pressed her did she reply more consecutively after hesitating several times  but without looking up from her work   not that she was thinking of it  for it was making no progress  but simply so that she might not be compelled to look at k
and now she told him that during his talk with hans she had listened quietly at first  that then she had been startled by certain words of his  then had begun to grasp the meaning of them more dearly  and that ever since she had not been able to cease reading into his words a confirmation of a warning which the landlady had once given her  and which she had always refused to believe
exasperated by all this circumlocution  and more irritated than touched by frieda s tearful  complaining voice   but annoyed above all because the landlady was coming into his affairs again  though only as a recollection  for in person she had had little success up till now   k
flung the wood he was carrying in his arms on to the floor  sat down on it  and in tones which were now serious demanded the whole truth  more than once   began frieda   yes  since the beginning  the landlady has tried to make me doubt you  she didn t hold that you were lying  on the contrary she said that you were childishly open  but your character was so different from ours  she said  that  even when you spoke frankly  it was bound to be difficult for us to believe you
and if we did not listen to good advice he would have to learn to believe you through bitter experience
even she with her keen eye for people was almost taken in
but after her last talk with you in the bridge inn   i am only repeating her own words   she woke up to your tricks  she said and after that you couldn t deceive her even if you did your best to hide your intentions
but you hid nothing  she repeated that again and again  and then she said afterwards   try to listen to him carefully at the first favourable opportunity  not superficially  but carefully  carefully   that was all that she had done and your own words had told her all this regarding myself
that you made up to me   she used those very words   only because i happened to be in your way  because i did not actually repel you  and because quite erroneously you considered a barmaid the destined prey of any guest who chose to stretch out his hand for her moreover  you wanted  as the landlady learned at the herrenhof  for some reason or other to spend that night at the herrenhof  and that could in no circumstances be achieved except through me now all that was sufficient cause for you to become my lover for one night  but something more was needed to turn it into a more serious affair
and that something more was klamm
the landlady doesn t claim to know what you want from klamm  she merely maintains that before you knew me you strove as eagerly to reach klamm as you have done since
the only difference was this  that before you knew me you were without any hope  but that now you imagine that in me youhave a reliable means of reaching klamm certainly and quickly and even with advantage to yourself
how startled i was   but that was only a superficial fear without deeper causewhen you said to day that before you knew me you had gone about here in a blind circle
these might actually be the same words that the landlady used  she  too  says that it s only since you have known me that you ve become aware of your goal
that s because you believe you have secured in me a sweetheart of klamm s  and so possess a hostage which can only be ransomed at a great price
your one endeavour is to treat with klamm about this hostage
as in your eyes i am nothing and the price everything  so you are ready for any concession so far as i m concerned  but as for the price you re adamant
so it s a matter of indifference to you that i ve lost my post at the herrenhof and that i ve had to leave the bridge inn as well  a matter of indifference that i have to endure the heavy work in the school
you have no tenderness to spare for me  you hardly even time for me  you leave me to the assistants  the idea of being jealous never comes into your mind  my only value for you is that i was old klamm s sweetheart  in your ignorance you exert yourself to keep me from forgetting klamm  so that when the decisive moment comes i should not make any resistance
yet at the same time you carry on a feud with the landlady  the only one you think capable of separating me from you  and that s why you brought your quarrel with her to a crisis  so as to have to leave the bridge inn with me
but that  so far as i m concerned  i belong to you whatever happens  you haven t the slightest doubt
you think of the interview with klamm as a business deal  a matter of hard cash
you take every possibility into account
providing that you reach your end you re ready to do anything
should klamm want me you are prepared to give me to him  should he want you to suck to me you ll stick to me  should he want you to fling me out  you ll fling me out  but you re prepared to play a part too
if it s advantageous to you  you ll give out that you love me  you ll try to combat his indifference by emphasizing your own littleness  and then shame him by the fact that you re his successor  or you ll be ready to carry him the protestations of love for him which you know i ve made  and beg him to take me on again  of course on your terms and if nothing else answers  then you ll simply go and beg from him in the name of k
and wife
but  the landlady said finally  when you see then that you have deceived yourself in everything  in your assumptions and in your hopes  in your ideas of klamm and his relations with me  then my purgatory will begin  for then for the first time i ll be in reality the only possession you ll have to fall back on  but at the same time it will be a possession that has proved to be worthless  and you ll treat it accordingly  seeing that  you have no feeling for me but the feeling of ownership   with his lips tightly compressed k
had listened intently  the wood he was sitting on had rolled asunder though he had not noticed it  he had almost slid on to the floor  and now at last he got up  sat down on the dais  took frieda s hand  she feebly tried to pull away  and said   in what you ve haven t always been able to distinguish the landlady s thoughts from your own    they re the landlady s sentiment  purely   said frieda   i heard her out because i respected her but it was the first time in my life that i completely and wholly refused to accept her opinion
all that she said seemed to me so pitiful  so far from any understanding of how things stood between us
there seemed actually to be more truth to me at the direct opposite of what she said
i thought of that sad morning after our first night together
you kneeling beside me with a look as if everything were lost
and how it really seemed then that in spite of all i could do  i was not helping you but hindering you
it was through me that the landlady had become your enemy  a powerful enemy  whom even now you still undervalue
it was for my sake that you had to take thought  that you had to fight for your post  that you were at a disadvantage before the superintendent  that you had to humble yourself before the teacher and were delivered over to the assistants  but worst of all for my sake you had perhaps lost your chance with klamm
that you still went on trying to reach klamm was only a kind of feeble endeavour to propitiate him in some way
and i told myself that the landlady  who certainly knew far better than i  was only trying to shield me by her suggestions from bitter self reproach
a well meant but superfluous attempt
my love for you had helped me through everything  and would certainly help you on too  in the long run  if not here in the village  then somewhere else
it had already given a proof of its power  it had rescued you from barnabas s family    that was your opinion  then  at the time   said k    and has it changed since    i don t know   replied frieda  glancing down at k  s hand which still held hers   perhaps nothing has changed
when you re so close to me and question me so calmly  then i think that nothing has changed
but in reality    she drew her hand away from k   sat erect opposite him and wept without hiding her face
she held her tear covered face up to him as if she were weeping not for herself and so had nothing to hide  but as if she were weeping over k  s treachery and so the pain of seeing her tears was hidden
 but in reality everything has changed since i ve listened to you talking with that boy
how innocently you began asking about the family  about this and that  to me you looked just due you did that night when you came into the taproom  impetuous and frank  trying to catch my attention with such a childlike eagerness
you were just the same as then  and all i wished was that the landlady had been here and could have listened to you  and then we should have seen whether she could soil stick to her opinion
but then quite suddenly   i don t know how it happened   i noticed that you were talking to him with a hidden intention
you won his trust   and it wasn t easy to win   by sympathetic words  simply so that you might with greater ease reach your end  which i began to recognize more and more clearly
your end was that woman
in your apparently solkitous inquiries about her i could see quite nakedly your simple preoccupation with your own affairs
you were betraying that woman even before you had won her
in your words i recognized not only my past  but my future as well  it was as if the landlady were sitting beside me and explaining everything  and with all my strength i tried to push her away  but i saw clearly the hopelessness of my attempt  and yet it was not really myself who was going to be betrayed  it was not i who was really being betrayed  but that unknown woman
and then when i collected myself and asked hans what he wanted to be and he said he wanted to be like you  and i saw that he had fallen under your influence so completely already  well what great difference was there between him  being exploited here by you  the poor boy  and myself that time in the taproom    everything   said k   who had regained his composure in listening
 everything that you say is in a certain sense justifiable  it is not untrue  it is only partisan
these arc the landlady s ideas  my enemy s ideas  even if you imagine that they re your own
and that comforts me
but they re instructive  one can learn a great deal from the landlady
she didn t express them to me personally  although she did not spare my feelings other ways
evidently she put this weapon in your hands in the hope that you would employ it at a particularly bad or decisive point for me
if i am abusing you  then she is abusing you in the same way
but  frieda  just consider
even if every  thing were just as the landlady says  it would only be shameful on one supposition  that is  that you did not love me
then only then  would it really seem that i had won you through calculation and trickery  so as to profiteer by possessing you
in that case it might even have been part of my plan to appear before you arm in arm with olga so as to evoke your pity  and the landlady has simply forgotten to mention that too in her list of my offences
but if it wasn t as bad as all that  if it wasn t a sly beast of prey that seized you that night  but you came to meet me  just as i went to meet you  and we found one another without a thought for ourselves  in that case  frieda  tell me  how would things look  if that were really so  in acting for myself i was acting for you too  there is no distinction here  and only an enemy could draw it
and that holds in everything  even in the case of hans
besides  in your condemnation of my talk with hans your sensitiveness makes you exaggerate things morbidly  for if hans s intentions and my own don t quite coincide  still that doesn t by any means amount to an actual antagonism between them  moreover our discrepancies were not lost on hans  if you believe that you do grave injustice to the cautious little man  and even if they should have been all lost on him  still nobody will be any the worse for it  i hope    it s so difficult to see one s way  k    said frieda with a sigh
 i certainly had no doubts about you  and if i have acquired something of the kind from the landlady  i ll be only too glad to throw it off and beg you for forgiveness on my knees  as i do  believe me  all the time  even when i m saying such horrible things
but the truth remains that you keep many things from me
you come and go  i don t know where or from where
just now when hans knocked you cried out barnabas s name
i only wish you had once called out my name as lovingly as for some incomprehensible reason you called that hateful name
if you have no trust in me  how can i keep mistrust from rising  it delivers me completely to the landlady  whom you justify in appearance by your behaviour
not in everything  i won t say that you justify her in everything  for was it not on my account alone that you sent the assistants packing  oh  if you but knew ith what passion i try to find a grain of comfort for myself in all that you do and say  even when it gives me pain    once and for all  frieda   said k    i conceal not the slightest thing from you
see how the landlady hates me  and how she does her best to get you away from me  and what despicable means she uses  and how you give in to her  frieda  how you give in to her  tell me  now  in what way do i hide anything from you  that i want to reach klamm you know  that you can t help me to do it and that accordingly i must do it by my own efforts you know too
that i have not succeeded up till now you see for yourself
am i to humiliate myself doubly  perhaps  by telling you of all the bootless attempts which have already humiliated me sufficiently  am i to plume myself on having waited and shivered in vain all an afternoon at the door of klamm s sledge  only too glad not to have to think of such things any more  i hurry back to you  and i am greeted again with all those reproaches from you
and barnabas  it s true i m waiting for him
he s klamm s messenger  it isn t i who made him that    barnabas again   cried frieda
 i can t believe that he s a good messenger    perhaps you re right   said k    but he s the only messenger that s sent to me    all the worse for you   said frieda   all the more reason why you should beware of him    unfortunately he has given me no cause for that till now   said k
smiling
 he comes very seldom  and what messages he brings are of no importance
only the fact that they come from klamm gives them any value    but listen to me   said frieda   for it is not even klamm that s your goal now  perhaps that disturbs me most of all
that you always longed for klamm while you had me was bad enough  but that you seem to have stopped trying to reach klamm now is much worse  that s something which not even the landlady foresaw
according to the landlady your happiness  a questionable and yet very real happiness  would end on the day when you finally recognized that the hopes you founded on klamm were in vain
but now you don t wait any longer even for that day  a young lad suddenly comes in and you begin to fight with him for his mother  as if you were fighting for your very life    you ve understood my talk with hans quite correctly   said k    it was really so
but is your whole former life so completely from your mind   all except the landlady  of course  who allow herself to be wiped out   that you can t remember longer how one must fight to get to the top  especially when one begins at the bottom  how one must take advantage of every  thing that offers any hope whatever  and this woman comes from the castle  she told me herself on my first day here  when i happened to stray into lasemann s
what s more natural than to ask her for advice or even for help
if the landlady only knows the obstacles which keep one from reaching klamm  then this woman probably knows the way to him  for she has come here by that way herself    the way to klamm   asked frieda
 to klamm  certainly  where else   said k
then he jumped up   but now it s high time i was going for the lunch   frieda implored him to stay  urgently  with an eagerness quite disproportionate to the occasion  as if only his staying with her would confirm all the comforting things he had told her
but k
was thinking of the teacher  he pointed towards the door  which any moment might fly open with a thunderous crash  and promised to return at once  she was not even to light the fire  he himself would see about it finally frieda gave in in silence
as k
was stamping through the snow outside   the path should have been shovelled free long ago  strange how slowly the work was getting forward i   he saw one of the assistants  now dead tired  still holding to the railings
only one  where was the other  had k
broken the endurance of one of them  then  at least  the remaining one was certainly still zealous enough  one could see that when  animated by the sight of k   he began more feverishly than ever to stretch out his arms and roll his eyes  his obstinacy is really wonderful   k told himself  but had to add   he ll freeze to the railings if he keeps it up   outwardly  however  k had nothing for the assistant but a threatening gesture with his fist  which prevented any nearer approach
indeed the assistant actually retreated for an appreciable distance
just then frieda opened one of the windows so as to air the room before putting on the fire  as she had promised k   immediately the assistant turned his attention from k   and crept as if irresistibly attracted to the window
her face torn between a glance for the assistant and a beseeching helpless glance which she threw at k
frieda put her hand out hesitatingly from the window  it was not clear whether it was a greeting or a cormmand to go away  nor did the assistant let it deflect him from resolve to come nearer
then frieda closed the outer window hastily  but remained standing behind it  her hand on the sash  with her head bent sideways  her eyes wide  and a fixed smile a her face
did she know that standing like that she was more likely to attract the assistant than repel him  but k
did not look back again  he thought he had better hurry as fast as he could and get back quickly
at long last  late in the afternoon  when it was already dark  k
had cleared the garden path  piled the snow high on either side  beaten it down hard  and also accomplished his work for the day
he was standing by the garden gate in the middle of a wide solitude
he had driven off the remaining assistant hours before  and chased him a long way  but the fellow had managed to hide himself somewhere between the garden and the schoolhouse and could not be found  nor had he shown himself since frieda was indoors either starting to wash clothes or still washing gisa s cat
it was a sign of great confidence on gisa s part that this task had been entrusted to frieda  an unpleasant and uncalled for task  indeed  which k
would not have suffered her to attempt had it not been advisable in view of their various shortcomings to seize every opportunity of securing gisa s goodwill
gisa had looked on approvingly while k
brought down the little children s bath from the garret  heated water  and finally helped to put the cat carefully into the bath
then she actually left the cat entirely in charge of frieda  for schwarzer  k  s acquaintance of the first evening  had arrived  had greeted k
with a mixture of embarrassment   arising out of the events of that evening   and of unmitigated contempt such as one accords to a debtor  and had vanished with gisa into the other schoolroom
the two of them were still there
schwarzer  k
had been told in the bridge inn  had been living in the village for some time  although he was a castellan s son  because of his love for gisa  and through his influential connexions had got himself appointed as a pupil teacher  a position which he filled chiefly by attending all gisa s classes  either sitting on a school bench among the children  or preferably at gisa s feet on the teacher s dais his presence was no longer a disturbance  the children had got quite used to it  all the more easily  perhaps  because schwarzer neither liked nor understood children and rarely spoke to them except when he took over the gymnastic lesson from gisa  and was content merely to breathe the same air as gisa and bask in her warmth and nearness
the only astonishing thing about it was that in the bridge inn at least schwarzer was spoken of with a certain degree of respect  even if his actions were ridiculous rather than praiseworthy  and that gisa was included in this respectful atmosphere
it was none the less unwarranted of schwarzer to assume that his position as a pupil teacher gave him a great superiority over k   for this superiority was non existent
a school janitor was an important person to the rest of the staff   and should have been especially so to such an assistant as schwarzer   a person not to be lightly despised  who should at least be suitably conciliated if professional considerations were not enough to prevent one from despising him
k
decided to keep this fact in mind  also that schwarzer was still in his debt on account of their first evening  a debt which had not been lessened by the way in which events of succeeding days had seemed to justify schwarzer s reception of him
for it must not be forgotten that this reception had perhaps determined the later course of events
because of schwarzer the full attention of the authorities had been most unreasonably directed to k
at the very first hour of his arrival  while he was still a complete stranger in the village without a single acquaintance or an alternative shelter
overtired with walking as he was and quite helpless on his sack of straw  he had been at the mercy of any official action
one night later might have made all the difference  things might have gone quietly and been only half noticed
at any rate nobody would have known anything about him or have had any suspicions  there would have been no hesitation in accepting him at least for one day as a stray wanderer  his handiness and trustworthiness would have been recognized and spoken of in the neighbourhood  and probably he would soon have found accommodation somewhere as a servant
of course the authorities would have found him out
but there would have been a big difference between having the central bureau  or whoever was on the telephone  disturbed on his account in the middle of the night by an insistent although ostensibly humble request for an immediate decision  made  too  by schwarzer  who was probably not in the best odour up there  and a quiet visit by k
to the superintendent on the next day during official hours to report himself in proper form as a wandering stranger who had already found quarters in a respectable house  and who would probably be leaving the place in another day s time unless the unlikely were to happen and he found some work in the village  only for a day or two  of course  since he did not mean to stay longer that  or something like that  was what would have happened had it not been for schwarzer
the authorities would have pursued the matter further  but calmly  in the ordinary course of business  unharassed by what they probably hated most  the impatience of a waiting client
well  all that was not k  s fault  it was schwarzer s fault  but schwarzer was the son of a castellan  and had behaved with outward propriety  and so the matter could only be visited on k  s head
and what was the trivial cause of it all  perhaps an ungracious mood of gisa s that day  which made schwarzer roam sleeplessly all night  and vent his annoyance on k
of course on the other hand one could argue that schwarzer s attitude was something k
had to be thankful for
it had been the sole precipitant of a situation k
would never by himself have achieved  nor have dared to achieve  and which the authorities themselves would hardly have allowed  namely  that from the very beginning without any dissimulation he found himself confronting the authorities face to face  in so fcur as that was at all possible still  that was a dubious gift  it spared k
indeed the necessity of lying and contriving  but it him almost defenceless  handicapped him anyhow in the struggle  and might have driven him to despair had he not been able to remind himself that the difference in strength between the authorities and himself was so enormous that all the guile of which he was capable would hardly have served appreciably to reduce the difference in his favour yet that was only a reflexion for his own consolation  schwarzer was none the less in his debt  and having harmed k
then could be called upon now to help
k
would be in need of help in the quite trivial and tentative opening moves  for barnabas seemed to have failed him again
on frieda s account k
had refrained all day from going to barnabas s house to make inquiries
in order to avoid receiving barnabas in frieda s presence he had laboured out of doors  and when his work was done had continued to linger outside in expectation of barnabas  but barnabas had not come
the only thing he could do now was to visit the sisters  only for a minute or two  he would only stand at the door and ask  he would be back again soon
so he thrust the shovel into the snow and set off at a run
he arrived breathless at the house of barnabas  and after a sharp knock flung the door open and asked  without looking to see who was inside   hasn t barnabas come back yet   only then did he notice that olga was not there  that the two old people  who were again sitting at the far end of the table in a state of vacancy  had not yet realized what was happening at the door and were only now slowly turning their faces towards it  and finally that amalia had been lying beside the stove under a blanket and in her alarm at k  s sudden appearance had started up with her hand to her brow in an effort to recover her composure
if olga had been there she would have answered immediately  and k
could have gone away again  but as it was he had at least to take a step or two towards amalia  give her his hand which she pressed in silence  and beg her to keep the startled old folks from attempting to meander through the room  which she did with a few words
k
learned that olga was chopping wood in the yard  that amalia  exhausted   for what reason she did not say   had had to lie down a short time before  and that barnabas had not yet indeed returned  but must return very soon  for he never stayed overnight in the castle
k
thanked her for the information  wbich left him at liberty to go  but amalia asked if he would not wait to see olga
however  she added  he had already spoken to olga during the day
he answered with surprise that he had not  and asked if olga had something of particular importance to say to him
as if faintly irritated amalia screwed up her mouth silently  gave him a nod  obviously in farewell  and lay down again
from her recumbent position she let her eyes rest on him as if she were astonished to see him still there
her gaze was cold  clear  and steady as usual  it was never levelled exactly on the object she regarded but in some disturbing way always a little past it  hardly perceptibly  but yet unquestionably past it  not from weakness  apparently  nor from embarrassment  nor from duplicity  but from a persistent and dominating desire for isolation  which she herself perhaps only became conscious of in this way
k
thought he could remember being baffled on the very first evening by that look  probably even the whole hatefulness of the impression so quickly made on him by this family was traceable to that look  which in itself was not hateful but proud and upright in its reserve
 you are always so sad  amalia   said k    is anything troubling you  can t you say what it is  i have never seen a country girl at all like you
it never struck me before
do you really belong to this village  were you born here   amalia nodded  as if k
had only put the last of those questions  and then said   so you ll wait for olga    i don t know why you keep on asking me that   said k
 i can t stay any longer because my fiancee s waiting for me at home   amalia propped herself on one elbow
she had not heard of the engagement
k
gave frieda s name
amalia did not know it
she asked if olga knew of their betrothal
k
fancied she did  for she had seen him with frieda  and news like that was quick to fly round in a village
amalia assured him  however  that olga knew nothing about it  and that it would make her very unhappy  for she seemed to be in love with k
she had not directly said so  for she was very reserved  but love betrayed itself involuntarily
k
was convinced that amalia was mistaken
amalia smiled  and this smile of hers  although sad  lit up her gloomy face  made her silence eloquent  her strangeness  intimate  and unlocked a mystery jealously guarded hitherto  a mystery which could indeed be concealed again  but never so completely
amalia said that she was certainly not mistaken  she would even go further and affirm that k   too  had an in
clination for olga  and that his visits  which were ostensibly concerned with some message or other from barnabas  were really intended for olga
but now that amalia knew all about it he need not be so strict with himself and could come oftener to see them that was all she wanted to say
k
shook his head  and reminded her of his betrothal
amalia seemed to set little store by this betrothal  the immediate impression she received from k   who was after all unaccompanied  was in her opinion decisive  she only asked when k
had made the girl s acquaintance  for he had been but a few days in the village
k
told her about his night at the herrenhof  whereupon amalia merely said briefly that she had been very much against his being taken to the herrenhof
she appealed for confirmation to olga  who had just come in with an armful of wood  fresh and glowing from the frosty air  strong and vivid  as if transformed by the change from her usual aimless standing about inside
she threw down the wood  greeted k
frankly  and asked at once after frieda
k
exchanged a look with amalia  who seemed  however  not at all disconcerted
a little relieved  k
spoke of frieda more freely than he would otherwise have done  described the difficult circumstances in which she was managing to keep house in a kind of way in the school  and in the haste of his narrativ e  for he wanted to go home at once   so far forgot himself when bidding them goodbye as to invite the sisters to come and pay him a visit he began to stammer in confusion  however  when amalia  giving him no time to say another word  interposed with an acceptance of the invitation
then olga was compelled to associate herself with it but k   still harassed by the feeling that he ought to go at once  and becoming uneasy under amalia s gaze  did not hesitate any longer to confess that the invitation had been quite unpremeditated and had sprung merely from a personal impulse  but that unfortunately he could not confirm it since there was a great hostility  to him quite incomprehensible  between her who cried and their family
 it s not hostility   said amalia  getting off from her couch and flinging the blanket behind her   it s nothing so big as that s only a parrot repetition of what she hears everywhere
and now  go away  go to your young woman  i can see you re in a hurry
you needn t be afraid that we ll come  i only said it at first for fun  put of mischief
but you can come often enough to see us  there s nothing to hinder you  you can always plead barnabas s messages as an excuse
i ll make it easier for you by telling you that barnabas  even if he has a message from the castle for you  can t go all the way up to the school to find you
he can t trail about so much  poor boy  he wears himself out in the service  you ll have to come yourself to get the news   k had never before heard amalia utter so many consecutive sentences  and they sounded differently from her usual comments  they had a kind of dignity which obviously impressed not only k
but olga too  although she was accustomed to her sister
she stood a little to one side her arms folded  in her usual stolid and somewhat stooping posture once more  with her eyes fixed on amalia  who on the other hand looked only at k  it s an error   said k    a gross error to imagine that i m not in earnest in looking for barnabas  it s my most urgent wish  really my only wish  to get my business with the authorities properly settled
and barnabas has to help me in that  most of my hopes are based on him
i grant he has disappointed me greatly once as it is  but that was more my fault than his
in the bewilderment of my first hours in the village i believed that everything could be settled by a short walk in the evening  and when the impossible proved impossible i blamed him for it
that influenced me even in my opinion of your family and of you
but that is all past  i think i understand you better now  you are even    k
tried to think of the exact word  but could not find it immediately  so contented himself with a makeshift    you seem to be the most good natured people in the village so far as my experience goes but now  amalia  you re putting me off the track again by your depreciation   if not of your brother s service   then of the importance he has for me
perhaps you aren t acquainted with his affairs  in which case it doesn t matter  but perhaps you are acquainted with both of them   and that s the impression i incline to have   in which case it s a bad thing  for that would indicate that your brother is deceiving me    calm yourself   cried amalia   i m not acquainted with them  nothing could induce me to become acquainted with them  nothing at all  not even my consideration for you  which would move me to do a great deal  for  as you say  we are good natured people
but my brother s affairs are his own business  i know nothing about them except what i hear by chance now and then against my will
on the other hand olga can tell you all about them  for she s in his confidence   and amalia went away  first to her parents  with whom she whispered  then to the kitchen
she went without taking leave of k   as if she knew that he would stay for a long time yet and that no good bye was necessary
seeing that with a somewhat astonished face k
remained standing where he was  olga laughed at him and drew him towards the settle by the stove  she seemed to be really happy at the prospect of sitting there alone with him  but it was a contented happiness without a single hint of jealousy
and precisely this freedom of hers from jealousy and therefore from any kind of claim upon him did k
good  he was glad to look into her blue eyes which were not cajoling  nor hectoring  but shyly simple and frank
it was as if the warning of frieda and the landlady had made him  not more susceptible to all those things  but more observant and more discerning
and he laughed with olga when she expressed her wonder at his calling amalia good natured  of all things  for amalia had many qualities  but good nature was certainly not one of them
whereupon k
explained that of course his praise had been meant for olga  only amalia was so masterful that she not only took to herself whatever was said in her presence  but induced other people of their own free will to include her in everything
 that s true   said olga becoming more serious   truer than you think
amalia s younger than me  and younger than barnabas  but hers is the final  decisive voice in the family for good or for ill  of course she has the burden of it more than anybody  the good as well as the bad   k 
thought that an exaggeration  for amalia had just said that she paid no attention  for instance  to her brother s flairs  while olga knew all about them
 how can i make it clear   said olga   amalia bothers neither about barnabas nor about me  she really bothers about nobody but the old people whom she tends day and night
now she has just asked them again if they want anything and has gone into the kitchen to cook them something  and for their sakes she has overcome her indisposition  for she s been ill since midday and been lying here on the settle
but although she doesn t bother about us we re as dependent on her as if she were the eldest  and if she were to advise us in our affairs we should certainly follow her advice  only she doesn t do it  she s different from us
you have experience of people  you come from a strange land  don t you think  too  that she s extraordinarily clever    extraordinarily unhappy is what she seems to me   said k    but how does it go with your respect for her that barnabas  for example  takes service as a messenger  in spite of amalia s evident disapproval  and even her scorn    if he knew what else to do he would give up being a messenger at once  for it doesn t satisfy him    isn t he an expert shoemaker   asked k  of course he is   said olga   and in his spare time he does work for brunswick  and if he liked he could have enough work to keep him going day and night and earn a lot of money    well then   said k    that would be an alternative to his services as a messenger    an alternative   asked olga in astonishment
 do you think he does it for money    maybe he does   said k    but didn t you say he was discontented    he s discontented  and for various reasons   said olga   but it s castle service  anyhow a kind of castle service  at least one would suppose so    what   said k    do you even doubt that    well   said olga   not really  barnabas goes into the bureaux and is accepted by the attendants as one of themselves  he sees various officials  too  from the distance  is entrusted with relatively important letters  even with verbally delivered messages  that s a good deal  after all  and we should be proud of what he has achieved for a young man of his years   k nodded and no longer thought of going home
 he has a uniform of his own  too   he asked
 you mean the jacket   said olga
 no  amalia made that for him long before he became a messenger
but you re touching on a sore spot now
he ought long ago to have had  not a uniform  for there aren t many in the castle  but a suit provided by the department  and he has been promised one  but in things of that kind the castle moves slowly  and the worst of it is that one never knows what this slowness means
it can mean that the matter s being considered  but it can also mean that it hasn t yet been taken up  that barnabas for instance is still on probation  and in the long run it can also mean that the whole thing has been settled  that for some reason or other the promise has been cancelled  and that barnabas will never get his suit
one can never find out exactly what is happening  or only a long time afterwards
we have a saying here  perhaps you ve heard it  official decisions are as shy as young girls    that s a good observation   said k   he took it still more seriously than olga   a good observation  and the decisions may have other characteristics in common with young girls    perhaps   said olga
 but as far as the official suit s concerned  that s one of barnabas s great sorrows  and since we share all our troubles  it s one of mine too
we ask ourselves in vain why he doesn t get an official suit
but the whole affair is not just so simple as that
the officials  for instance  apparently have no official dress
so far as we know here  and so far as barnabas tells us  the officials go about in their ordinary clothes  very fine clothes  certainly
well  you ve seen klamm
now  barnabas is certainly not an official  not even one in the lowest category  and he doesn t overstep his limitations so far as to want to be one
but according to barnabas  the highergrade servants  whom one certainly never sees down here in the village  have no official dress
that s a kind of comfort  one might suppose  but it s deceptive comfort  for is barnabas a high grade servant  not he
however partial one might be towards him one couldn t maintain that  the fact that he comes to the village and even lives here is sufficient proof of the contrary  for the higher grade servants are even more inaccessible than the officials  perhaps rightly so  perhaps they are even of higher rank than many an official  there s some evidence of that  they work less  and barnabas says it s a marvellous sight to see these tall and distinguished men slowly walking through the corridors  barnabas always gives them a wide berth
well  he might be one of the lower grade servants  then  but these always have an official suit  at least whenever they come down into the village  it s not exactly a uniform  there are many different versions of it  but at any rate one can always tell castle servants by their clothes  you ve seen some of them in the herrenhof
the most noticeable thing about the clothes is that they re mostly closefitting  a peasant or a handworker couldn t do with them
well  a suit like that hasn t been given to barnabas and it s not merely the shame of it or the disgrace   one could put up with that but the fact that in moments of depression   and we often have such moments  none too rarely  barnabas and i   it makes us doubt everything
is it really castle service barnabas is doing  we ask ourselves then
granted  he goes into the bureaux  but are the bureaux part of the real castle  and even if there are bureaux actually in the castle  are they the bureaux that barnabas is allowed to enter  he s admitted into certain rooms  but they re only a part of the whole  for there are barriers behind which there are more rooms not that he s actually forbidden to pass the barriers  but he can t very well push past them once he has met his chiefs and been dismissed by them
besides  everybody is watched there  at least so we believe
and even if he did push on farther what good would it be to him  if he had no official duties to carry out and were a mere intruder  and you mustn t imagine that these barriers are a definite dividing line
barnabas is always impressing that on me
there are barriers even at the entrance to the rooms where he s admitted  so you see there are barriers he can pass  and they re just the same as the ones he s never yet passed  which looks as if one oughtn t to suppose that behind the ultimate barriers the bureaux are any different from those barnabas has already seen only that s what we do suppose in moments of depression
and the doubt doesn t stop there  we can t keep it within bounds
barnabas sees officials  barnabas is given messages
but who are those officials  and what are the messages  now  so he says  he s assigned to klamm  who gives him his instructions in person
well  that would be a great favour  even higher grade servants don t get so far as that  it s almost too much to believe  almost terrifying
only think  directly assigned to klamm  speaking with him face to face  but is it really the case  well  suppose it is so  then why does barnabas doubt that the official who is referred to as klamm is really klamm    olga   said k    you surely must be joking
how can there be any doubt about klamm s appearance  everybody knows what he looks like  even i have seen him    of course not  k    said olga
 i m not joking at all  i m desperately serious
yet i m not telling you all this simply to relieve my own feelings and burden yours  but because amalia charged me to tell you  since you were asking for barnabas  and because i think too that it would be useful for you to know more about it
i m doing it for barnabas s sake as well  so that you won t pin too many hopes upon him  and suffer disappointment  and make him suffer too because of your disappointment
he s very sensitive  for instance he didn t sleep all night because you were displeased with him yesterday evening
he took you to say that it was a bad lookout for you to have only a messenger like him
these words kept him off his sleep
i don t suppose that you noticed how upset he was  for castle messengers must keep themselves well under control but he hasn t an easy time  not even with you  although from your point of view you don t ask too much of him  for you have your own prior conception of a messenger s powers and make your demands accordingly
but in the castle they have a different conception of a messenger s duties  which couldn t be reconciled with yours  even if barnabas were to devote himself entirely to the task  which  unfortunately  he often seems inclined to do still  one would have to submit to that and raise no objections if it weren t for the question whether barnabas is really a messenger or not
before you  of course  he can t express any doubt of it whatever  to do that would be to undermine his very existence and to offend grievously against laws which he believes himself still plighted to  and even to me he doesn t speak freely  i have to cajole him and kiss his doubts out of him  and even then he rarely likes to admit that his doubts are doubts he has something of a man in him
and i m sure that he doesn t tell me everything  although i m his sole confidante
but we do often speak about klamm  whom i ve never seen
you know frieda doesn t like me and has never let me look at him  still his appearance is well known in the village  some people have seen him  everybody has heard of him  and out of glimpses and rumours and through various distorting factors an image of klamm has been constructed which is certainly true in fundamentals
but only in fundamentals
in detail it fluctuates  and yet perhaps not so much as klamm s real appearance
for he s reported as having one appearance when he comes into the village and another on leaving it
after having his beer he looks different from what he does before it  when he s awake he s different from when he s asleep  when he s alone he s different from when he s talking to people  and   what is incomprehensible after all that   he s almost another person up in the castle
and even within the village there are considerable differences in the accounts given of him  differences as to his height  his bearing  his size  and the cut of his beard
fortunately there s one thing in which all the accounts agree  he always wears the same clothes  a black morning coat with long tails
now of course all these differences aren t the result of magic  but can be easily explained
they depend on the mood of the observer  on the degree of his excitement  on the countless graduations of hope or despair which are possible for him when he sees klamm  and besides  he can usually see klamm only for a second or two
i m telling you all this just as barnabas has often told it to me  and  on the whole  for anyone not personally interested in the matter  it would be a sufficient explanation
not for us  however
it s a matter of life or death for barnabas whether it s really klamm he speaks to or not    and for me no less   said k   and they moved nearer to each other on the settle
all this depressing information of olga s certainly affected k   but he regarded it as a great consolation to find other people who were at least externally much in the same situation as him with whom he could join forces and whom he could touch at many points  not merely at a few points as in frieda s case
he was indeed gradually giving up all hope of achieving success through barnabas  but the worse it went with barnabas in the castle the nearer he felt drawn to him down here  never would k
have believed that in the village itself such a despaired struggle could go on as barnabas and his sister were involved in
of course it was as yet far from being adequately explained and might turn out to be quite the reverse  one shouldn t let olga s unquestionable innocence mislead one into taking barnabas s uprightness for granted
 barnabas is familiar with all those accounts of klamm s appearance   went on olga   he has collected and compared a great many  perhaps too many he even saw klamm once through a carriage window in the village  or believed he saw him  and so was sufficiently prepared to recognize him again  and yet   how can you explain this    when he entered a bureau in the castle and had one of several officials pointed out to him as klamm he didn t recognize him  and for a long time afterwards couldn t accustom himself to the idea that it was klamm but if you ask barnabas what was the difference between that klamm and the usual description given of klamm  he can t tell you  or rather he tries to tell you and describes the official of the castle  but his description coincides exactly with the descriptions we usually hear of klamm
well then  barnabas  i say to him  why do you doubt it  why do you torment yourself  whereupon in obvious distress he begins to reckon up certain characteristics of the castle official  but he seems to be thinking them out rather than describing them  and besides that they are so trivial   a particular way of nodding the head  for instance  or even an unbuttoned waistcoat   that one simply can t take them seriously much more important seems to me the way in which klamm receives barnabas barnabas has often described it to me  and even sketched the room he s usually admitted into a large room  but the room isn t klamm s bureau  nor even the bureau of any particular official
it s a room divided into two by a single reading desk stretching all its length from wall to wall one side is so narrow that two people can hardly squeeze past each other  and that s reserved for the officials  the other side is spacious  and that s where clients wait  spectators  servants  messengers
on the desk there are great books lying open  side by side  and officials stand by  most of them reading
they don t always stick to the same book  yet it isn t the books that they change but their places  and it always astounds barnabas to see how they have to squeeze oast each other when they change places  because there s so little room
in front of the desk and close to it there are small low tables at which clerks sit ready to write from dictation  whenever the officials wish it
and the way that is done always amazes barnabas
there s no express command given by the official  nor is the dictation given in a loud voice  one could hardly tell that it was being given at all  the official just seems to go on reading as before  only whispering as he reads  and the clerk hears the whisper often it s so low that the clerk can t hear it at all in his seat  and then he has to jump up  catch what s being dictated  sit down again quickly and make a note of it  then jump up once more  and so on
what a strange business  it s almost incomprehensible
of course barnabas has time enough to observe it all  for he s often kept standing in the big room for hours and days at a time before klamm happens to see him
and even if klamm sees him and he springs to attention  that needn t mean anything  for klamm may turn away from him again to the book and forget all about him
that often happens
but what can be the use of a messenger service so casual as that  it makes me quite doleful to hear barnabas say in the early morning that he s going to the castle
in all likelihood a quite useless journey  a lost day  a completely vain hope
what s the good of it all  and here s cobbler s work piled up which never gets done and which brunswick is always asking for    oh  well   said k    barnabas has just to hang on till he gets a commission
that s understandable  the place seems to be over staffed  and everybody can t be given a job every day  you needn t complain about that  for it must affect everybody but in the long run even a barnabas gets commissions  he has brought two letters already to me    it s possible  of course   answered olga   that we re wrong in complaining  especially a girl like me who knows things only from hearsay and can t understand it all so well as barnabas  who certainly keeps many things to himself but let me tell you how the letters are given out  your letters  for example
barnabas doesn t get these directly from klamm  but from a clerk
on no particular ay at no particular hour   that s why the service  however easy it appears  is really very exhausting  for barnabas must be always on the alert   a clerk suddenly remembers about him and gives him a sign  without any apparent instructions from klamm who merely goes on reading in his book
true  sometimes klamm is polishing his glasses when barnabas comes up  but he often does that  anyhow   however  he may take a look at barnabas then  supposing  that is  that he can see anything at all without his glasses  which barnabas doubts
for klamm s eyes are almost shut  he generally seems to be sleeping and only polishing his glasses in a kind of dream meanwhile the clerk hunts among the piles of manuscripts and writings under his table and fishes out a letter for you  so it s not a letter newly written  indeed  by the look of the envelope  it s usually a very old letter  which has been lying there a long time
but if that is so  why do they keep barnabas waiting like that  and you too  and the letter too  of course  for it must be long out of date
that s how they get barnabas the reputation of being a bad and slow messenger
it s all very well for the clerk  he just gives barnabas the letter  saying   from klamm for k   and so dismisses him
but barnabas comes home breathless  with his hardly won letter next to his bare skin  and then we sit here on the settle like this and he tells me about it and we go into all the particulars and weigh up what he has achieved and find ultimately that it s very little  and questionable at that until barnabas lays the letter down with no longer any inclination to deliver it  yet doesn t feel inclined to go to sleep either  and so sits cobbling on his stool all night
that s how it is  k   and now you have all my secrets and you can t be surprised any longer at amalia s indifference to them    and what happens to the letter   asked k
 the letter   said olga
 oh  some time later when i ve plagued barnabas enough about it  it may be days or weeks later  he picks it up again and goes to deliver it
in such practical matters he s very dependent on me
for i can usually pull myself together after i ve recovered from the first impression of what he has told me  but he can t  probably because he knows more
so i always find something or other to to him  such as    what are you really aiming at barnabas  what kind of career  what ambition are you dreaming of  are you thinking of climbing so high that you ll have to leave or to leave me  completely behind you  is that what you re aiming at  how can i help believing so when it s  the only possible explanation why you re so dreadfully discontented with all you ve done already  only take a look round and see whether any of our neighbours has got on so well as you
i admit their situation is different from ours and they have no grounds for ambition beyond their daily work  but even without making comparisons it s easy to see that you re all right
hindrances there may be  doubts and disappointments  but that only means  what we all knew beforehand  that you get nothing without paying for it  that you have to fight for every trivial point
all the more reason for being proud instead of downcast
and aren t you fighting for us as well  doesn t that mean anything to you  doesn t that put new strength into you  and the fact that i m happy and almost conceited at having such a brother  doesn t that give you any confidence  it isn t what you ve achieved in the castle that disappoints me  but the little that i m able to achieve with you
you re allowed into the castle  you re a regular visitor in the bureaux  you spend whole days in the same room as klamm  you re an officially recognized messenger  with a claim on an official suit  you re entrusted with important commissions  you have all that to your credit  and then you come down here and instead of embracing me and weeping for joy you seem to lose all heart as soon as you set eyes on me  and you doubt everything  nothing interests you but cobbling  and you leave the letter  the pledge of our future  lying in a corner   that s how i speak to him  and after i ve repeated the same words day after day he picks up the letter at last with a sigh and goes off
yet probably it s not the effect of what i say that drives him out  but a desire to go to the castle again  which he dare not do without having delivered his message    but you re absolutely right in everything you say   said k    it s dazing how well you grasp it all
what an extraordinarily clear mind you have    no   said olga   it takes you in  and perhaps it takes him in too
for what has he really achieved  he s allowed into a bureau  but it doesn t seem to be even a bureau
he speaks to klamm  but is it klamm  isn t it rather someone who s a little like klamm  a secretary  perhaps  at the most  who resembles klamm a little and takes pains to increase the resemblance and poses a little in klamm s sleepy and dreamy style
that side of his nature is the easiest to imitate there are many who try it on  although they have sense enough not to attempt anything more
and a man like klamm who is so much sought after and so rarely seen is apt to take different shapes in people s imagination
for instance  klamm has a village secretary here called momus
you know him  do you  he keeps well in the background too  but i ve seen him several times
a stoutly built young man  isn t he  and so evidently not in the least like klamm
and yet you ll find people in the village who swear that momus is klamm  he and no other
that s how people work their own confusion
is there any reason why it should be different in the castle  somebody pointed out that particular official to barnabas as klamm  and there is actually a resemblance that barnabas has always questioned
and everything goes to support his doubt
are we to suppose that klamm has to squeeze his way among other officials in a common room with a pencil behind his ear  it s wildly improbable
barnabas often says  somewhat like a child and yet in a child s mood of trustfulness   the official is really very like klamm  and if he were sitting in his own office at his own desk with his name on the door i would have no more doubt at all   that s childish  but reasonable
of course it would be still more reasonable of barnabas when he s up there to ask a few people about the truth of things  for judging from his account there are plenty of men standing round
and even if their information were no more reliable than that of the man who pointed out klamm of his own accord  there would be surely some common ground  some ground for comparison  in the various things they said
that s not my idea  but barnabas s  yet he doesn t dare to follow it out  he doesn t venture to speak to anybody for fear of offending in ignorance against some unknown rule and so losing his job
you see how uncertain he feels
and this miserable uncertainty of his shows a clearer light on his position there than all his descriptions
how ambiguous and threatening everything must appear to him when he won t even risk opening his mouth to put an innocent question  when i reflect on that i blame myself for letting him into those unknown rooms  which have such an effect on him that  though he s daring rather than cowardly  he apparently trembles with fright as he stands there    here i think you ve touched on the essential point   said k  that s it  after all you ve told me  i believe i can see the matter clearly
barnabas is too young for this task
nothing he tells you is to be taken seriously at its face value
since he s beside himself with fright up there  he s incapable of observing  and when you force him to give an account of what he has seen you get simply confused fabrications that doesn t surprise me
fear of the authorities is born in you here  and is further suggested to you all your lives in the most various ways and from every side  and you yourselves help to strengthen it as much as possible
still  i have no fundamental objection to that
if an authority is good why should it not be feared  only one shouldn t suddenly send an inexperienced youngster like barnabas  who has never been farther than this village  into the castle  and then expect a truthful account of everything from him  and interpret each single word of his as if it were a revelation  and base one s own life s happiness on the interpretation
nothing could be more mistaken
i admit that i have let him mislead me in exactly the same way and have set hopes upon him and suffered disappointments through him  both based simply on his own words  that is to say  with almost no basis   olga was silent
 it won t be easy for me   went on k    to talk you out of your confidence in your brother  for i see how you love him and how much you expect from him
but i must do it  if only for the sake of that very love and expectation
for let me point out that there s always something   i don t know what it is   that hinders you from seeing clearly how much barnabas has   i ll not say achieved   but has had bestowed on him
he s permitted to go into the bureaux  or if you prefer  into an antechamber  well let it be an antechamber  it has doors that lead on   barriers which can be passed if one has the courage
to me  for instance  even this antechamber is utterly inaccessible for the present at least
who it is that barnabas speaks to there i have no idea  perhaps the clerk is the lowest in the whole staff but even if he is the lowest he can put one in touch with the next man above him  and if he can t do that he can at least give the other s name  and if he can t even do that he can refer to somebody who can give the name
this so called klamm may not have the smallest trait in common with the real one  the resemblance may not exist except in the eyes of barnabas  half  blinded by fear  he may be the meanest of the officials  he may not even be an official at all  but all the same he has work of some kind to perform at the desk  he reads something or other in his great book  he whispers something to the clerk  he thinks something when his eye falls on barnabas once in a while  and even if that isn t true and he and his acts have no significance whatever he has at least been set there by somebody for some purpose
all that simply means that something is there  something which barnabas has the chance of using  something or other at the very least
and that it is barnabas s own fault if he can t get any further than doubt and anxiety and despair
and that s only on the most unfavourable interpretation of things  which is extremely improbable
for we have the actual letters which i certainly set no great store on  but more than on what barnabas says
let them be worthless old letters  fished at random from a pile of other such worthless old letters  at random and with no more discrimination than the love birds show in the fairs when they pick one s fortune out of a pile  let them be all that  still they have some bearing on my fate
they re evidently meant for me  although perhaps not for my good  and  as the superintendent and his wife have testified  they arc written in klamm s own hand  and  again on the superintendent s evidence  they have a significance which is only private and obscure  it is true  but still great    did the superintendent say that   asked olga
 yes  he did   replied k
 i must tell barnabas that   said olga quickly   that will encourage him greatly    but he doesn t need encouragement   said k    to encourage him amounts to telling him that he s right  that he has only to go on as he is doing now  but that is just the way he will never achieve anything by
if a man has his eyes bound you can encourage him as much as you like to stare through the bandage  but he ll never see anything
he ll be able to see only when the bandage is removed
it s help barnabas needs  not encouragement
only think  up there you have all the inextricable complications of a great authority   i imagined that i had an approximate conception of its nature before i came here  but how childish my ideas were    up there  then  you have the authorities and over against them barnabas  nobody more  only barnabas  pathetically alone  where it would be enough honour for him to spend his whole life cowering in a dark and forgotten corner of some bureau    don t imagine  k   that we underestimate the difficulties barnabas has to face   said olga   we have reverence enough for the authorities  you said so yourself    but it s a mistaken reverence   said k    a reverence in the wrong place  the kind of reverence that dishonours its object
do you call it reverence that leads barnabas to abuse the privilege of admission to that room by spending his time there doing nothing  or makes him when he comes down again belittle and despise the men before whom he has just been trembling  or allows him because he s depressed or weary to put off delivering letters and fail in executing commissions entrusted to him  that s far from being reverence
but i have a further reproach to make  olga
i must blame you too  i can t exempt you
although you fancy you have some reverence for the authorities  you sent barnabas into the castle in all his youth and weakness and forlornness  or at least you didn t dissuade him from going    this reproach that you make   said olga   is one i have made myself from the beginning
not indeed that i sent barnabas to the castle  i didn t send him  he went himself  but i ought to have prevented him by all the means in my power  by force  by craft  by persuasion i ought to have prevented him  but if i had to decide again this very day  and if i were to feel as keenly as i did then and still do the straits barnabas is in  and our whole family  and if barnabas  fully conscious of the responsibility and danger ahead of him  were once more to free himself from me with a smile and set off  i wouldn t hold him back even to day  in spite of all that has happened in between  and i believe that in my place you would do exactly the same you don t know the plight we are in  that s why you re unfair to all of us  and especially to barnabas
at that time we had more hope than now  but even then our hope wasn t great  but our plight was great  and is so still
hasn t frieda told you anything about us    mere hints   said k    nothing definite  but the very mention of your name exasperates her    and has the landlady told you nothing either    no  nothing    nor anybody else    nobody    of course
how could anybody tell you anything  everyone knows something about us  either the truth  so far as it is accessible  or at least some exaggerated rumour  mostly invention  and everybody thinks about us more than need be  but nobody will actually speak about it  people are shy of putting these things into words
and they re quite right in that
it s difficult to speak of it even before you  k   and when you ve heard it all it s possible   isn t it    that you ll go away and not want to have anything more to do with us  however little it may seem to concern you
then we should have lost you  and i confess that now you mean almost more to me than barnabas s service in the castle
but yet   and this argument has been distracting me all the evening   you must be told  otherwise you would have no insight into our situation  and  what would vex me most of all  you would go on being unfair to barnabas
complete accord would fail between us  and you could neither help us  nor accept our additional help
but there is still one more question  do you really want to be told    why do you ask   said k    if it s necessary  i would rather be told  but why do you ask me so particularly    superstition   said olga
 you ll become involved in our affairs  innocent as you are  almost as innocent as barnabas    tell me quickly   said k    i m not afraid
you re certainly making it much worse than it is with such womanish fussing   amalia s secret  judge for yourself   said olga   i warn you it sounds quite simple  one can t comprehend at first why it should be of any importance
there s a great official in the castle called sortini    i ve heard of him already  said k    he had something to do with bringing me here    i don t think so   said olga   sortini hardly ever comes into the open
aren t you mistaking him for sordini  spelt with a  d     you re quite right   said k    sordini it was    yes   said olga   sordini is well known  one of the most industrious of the officials  he s often mentioned
sortini on the other hand is very retiring and quite unknown to most people
more than three years ago i saw him for the first and last time
it was on the third of july at a celebration given by the fire brigade  the castle too had contributed to it and provided a new fire engine
sortini  who was supposed to have some hand in directing the affairs of the fire brigade  but perhaps he was only deputizing for someone else   the officials mostly hide behind each other like that  and so it s difficult to discover what any official is actually responsible for   sortini took part in the ceremony of handing over the fire engine
there were of course many other people from the castle  officials and attendants  and true to his character sortini kept well in the background
he s a small  frail  reflective looking gentleman  and one thing about him struck all the people who noticed him at all  the way his forehead was furrowed
all the furrows   and there were plenty of them although he s certainly not more than forty   were spread fanwise over his forehead  running towards the root of his nose
i ve never seen anything like it
well then  we had that celebration
amalia and i had been excited about it for weeks beforehand  our sunday clothes had been done up for the occasion and were partly new  amalia s dress was specially fine  a white blouse foaming high in front with one row of lace after the other  our mother had taken every bit of her lace for it
i was jealous  and cried half the night before the celebration
only when the bridge inn landlady came to see us in the morning    the bridge inn landlady   asked k
 yes   said olga   she was a great friend of ours  well  she came and had to admit that amalia was the finer  so to console me she lent me her own necklace of bohemian garnets
when we were ready to go and amalia was standing beside me and we were all admiring her  my father said   to day  mark my words  amalia will find a husband 
then  i don t know why  i took my necklace  my great pride  and hung it round amalia s neck  and wasn t jealous any longer
i bowed before her triumph and i felt that everyone must bow before her  perhaps what amazed us so much was the difference in her appearance  for she wasn t really beautiful  but her sombre glance  and it has kept the same quality since that day  was high over our heads and involuntarily one had almost literally to bow before her
everybody remarked on it  even lasemann and his wife who came to fetch us    lasemann   asked k  yes  lasemann   said olga   we were in high esteem  and the celebration couldn t well have begun without us  for my father was the third in command of the fire brigade    was your father still so active   asked k
 father   returned olga  as if she did not quite comprehend   three years ago he was still relatively a young man  for instance  when a fire broke out at the herrenhof he carried an official  galater  who is a heavy man  out of the house on his back at a run
i was there myself  there was no real danger  it was only some dry wood near a stove which had begun to smoke  but galater was terrified and cried for help out of the window  and the fire brigade turned out  and father had to carry him out although the fire was already extinguished
of course galater finds it difficult to move and has to be careful in circumstances like that i m telling you this only on father s account
not much more than three years have passed since then  and look at him now   only then did k
become aware that amalia was again in the room  but she was a long way off at the table where her parents sat  she was feeding her mother who could not move her rheumaticky arms  and admonishing her father meanwhile to wait in patience for a little  it would soon be his turn but her admonition was in vain  for her father  greedily desiring his soup  overcame his weakness and tried to drink it first out of the spoon and then out of the bowl  and grumbled angrily when neither attempt succeeded
the spoon was empty long before he got it to his lips  and his mouth never reached the soup  for his drooping moustache dipped into it and scattered it everywhere except into his mouth
 and have three years done that to him   asked k   yet he could not summon up any sympathy for the old people  and for that whole corner with the table in it he felt only repulsion
 three years   replied olga slowly   or  more precisely  a few hours at that celebration
the celebration was held on a the village  at the brook
there was already a large crowd there when we arrived  many people had come in from eighbouring villages  and the noise was bewildering
of course my father took us first to look at the fire engine  he laughed with delight when he saw it  the new fire engine made him happy
he began to examine it and explain it to us  he wouldn t hear of any opposition or holding back  but made every one of us stoop and almost crawl under the engine if there was something there he had to show us  and he smacked barnabas for refusing
only amalia paid no attention to the engine  she stood upright beside it in her fine clothes and nobody dared to say a word to her  i ran up to her sometimes and took her arm  but she said nothing
even to day i cannot explain how we came to stand for so long in front of the fire engine without noticing sortini until the very moment my father turned away  for he had obviously been leaning on a wheel behind the fire engine all the time
of course there was a terrific racket all round us  not only the usual kind of noise  for the castle had presented the fire brigade with some trumpets as well as the engine  extraordinary instruments on which with the smallest effort   a child could do it   one could produce the wildest blasts
to hear them was enough to make one think the turks were there  and one could not get accustomed to them  every fresh blast made one jump
and because the trumpets were new everybody wanted to try them  and because it was a celebration  everybody was allowed to try
right at our ears  perhaps amalia had attracted them  were some of these trumpet blowers
it was difficult to keep one s wits about one  and obeying fadier and attending to the fire engine was the utmost we were capable of  and so it was that sortini escaped our notice for such a long time  and besides we had no idea who he was
 there is sortini   lasemann whispered at last to my father   i was beside him   and father  greatly excited  made a deep bow  and signed to us to do the same
without having met till now father had always honoured sortini as an authority in fire brigade matters  and had often spoken of him at home  so it was a very astonishing and important matter for us actually to see sortini with our own eyes
sortini  however  paid no attention to us  and in that he wasn t peculiar  for most of the officials hold themselves aloof in public besides he was tired  only his official duty kept him there it   not the worst officials who find duties like that particularly try
and anyhow there were other officials and attendants mingling with the people
but he stayed by the fire engine and discouraged by his silence all those who tried to approach him with some request or piece of flattery
so it happened that he didn t notice us until long after we had noticed him
only as we bowed respectfully and father was making apologies for us did he look our way and scan us one after another wearily  as if sighing to find that there was still another and another to look at  until he let his eyes rest on amalia  to whom he had to look up  for she was much taller than he
at the sight of her he started and leapt over the shaft to get nearer to her  we misunderstood him at first and began to approach him  father leading the way  but he held us off with uplifted hand and then waved us away
that was all
we teased amalia a lot about having really found a husband  and in our ignorance we were very merry the whole of that afternoon
but amalia was more silent than usual
 she s fallen head over ears in love with sortini   said brunswick  who is always rather vulgar and has no comprehension of natures like amalia s
yet this time we were inclined to think that he was right  we were quite mad all that day  and all of us  even amalia  were as if stupefied by the sweet castle wine when we came home about midnight    and sortini   asked k
 yes  sortini   said olga   i saw him several times during the afternoon as i passed by  he was sitting on the engine shaft with his arms folded  and he stayed there till the castle carriage came to fetch him he didn t even go over to watch the fire drill at which father  in the very hope that sortini was watching  distinguished himself beyond all the other men of his age    and did you hear nothing more from him   asked k  you seem to have a great regard for sortini    oh  yes  regard   said olga   oh  yes  and hear from him we certainly did next morning we were roused from our heavy sleep by a scream from amalia
the others rolled back into their beds again  but i was completely awake and ran to her
she was standing by the window holding a letter in her hand which had just been given her from the window by a man who was still waiting for an answer
the letter was short  and amalia had already read it  add held it in her drooping hand
how i always loved her when she was tired like that i i knelt down beside her and read the letter
hardly had i finished it when amalia after a brief glance at me took it back  but she couldn t bring herself to read it again  and tearing it in pieces she threw the fragments in the face of the man outside and shut the window
that was the morning which decided our fate
i say  decided   but every minute of the previous afternoon was just as decisive    and what was in the letter   asked k
 yes  i haven t told you that yet   said olga   the letter was from sortini addressed to the girl with the garnet necklace
i can t repeat the contents
it was a summons to come to him at the herrenhof  and to come at once  for in half an hour he was due to leave
the letter was couched in the vilest language  such as i have never heard  and i could only half guess its meaning from the context
anyone who didn t know amalia and saw this letter must have considered a girl who could be written to like that as dishonoured  even if she had never had a finger laid on her
and it wasn t a love letter  there wasn t a tender word in it  on the contrary sortini was obviously enraged because the sight of amalia had disturbed him and distracted him in his work
later on we pieced it all together for ourselves
evidently sortini had intended to go straight to the castle that evening  but on amalia s account had stayed in the village instead  and in the morning  being very angry because even overnight he hadn t succeeded in forgetting her  had written the letter
one couldn t but be furious on first reading a letter like that  even the most cold blooded person might have been  but though with anybody else fear at its threatening tone would soon have got the upper hand  amalia only felt anger  fear she doesn t know  neither for herself nor for others
and while i crept into bed again repeating to myself the closing sentence  which broke off in the middle   see that you come  at once  or else   i  amalia remained on the windowscat looking out  as if she were expecting further messengers and were prepared to treat them all as she had done the first    so that s what the officials are like   said k
reluctantly   that s the kind of type one finds among them
what did your father do  i hope he protested energetically in the proper quarter  if for didn t prefer a shorter and quicker way of doing it at the herrenhof
the worst thing about the story isn t the insult to amalia  that could easily have been made good  i don t know why you lay such exaggerated stress upon it
why should such a letter from sortini shame amalia for ever    which is what one would gather from your story  but that s a sheer impossibility  it would have been easy to make up for it to amalia  and in a few days the whole thing might have blown over  it was himself that sortini shamed  and not amalia it s sortini that horrifies me  the possibility of such an abuse of power
the very thing that failed this one time because it came naked and undisguised and found an effective opponent in amalia  might very well succeed completely on a thousand other occasions in circumstances just a little less favourable  and might defy detection even by its victim    hush   said olga   amalia s looking this way   amalia had finished giving food to her parents and was now busy taking off her mother s clothes she had just undone the skirt  hung her mother s arms round her neck  lifted her a little  while she drew the skirt off  and now gently set her down again her father  still affronted because his wife was being attended to first  which obviously only happened because she was even more helpless than he  was attempting to undress himself perhaps  too  it was a reproach to his daughter for her imagined slowness
yet although he began with the easiest and least necessary thing  the removal of the enormous slippers in which his feet were loosely stuck  he could not get them pulled off at all  and wheezing hoarsely was forced to give up trying  and leaned back stiffly in his chair again
 but you don t realize the really decisive thing   said olga   you may be right in all you say  but the decisive thing was amalia s not going to the herrenhof
her treatment of the messenger might have been excused  it could have been passed over
but it was because she didn t go that the curse was laid upon our family  and that turned her treatment of the messenger into an unpardonable offence  yes  it was even brought forward openly later as the chief offence    what   cried k
at once  lowering his voice again  as olga raised her hands imploringly   do you  her sister  actually say that amalia should have run to the herrenhof after sortini    no   said olga   heaven preserve me from such a suspicion  how can you believe that  i don t know anybody who s so right as amalia in everything she does
if she had gone to the herrenhof i should of course have upheld her just the same
but her not going was heroic
as for me  i confess it frankly  had i received a letter like that i should have gone
i shouldn t have been able to endure the fear of what might happen  only amalia could have done that
for there were many ways of getting round it
another girl  for instance  might have decked herself up and wasted some time in doing it and then gone to the herrenhof only to find that sortini had left  perhaps to find that he had left immediately after sending the messenger  which is very probable  for the moods of the gentlemen are fleeting
but amalia neither did that nor anything else  she was too deeply insulted  and answered without reserve
if she had only made some pretence of compliance  if she had but crossed the threshold of the herrenhof at the right moment  our punishment could have been turned aside  we have very clever advocates here who can make a great deal out of a mere nothing  but in this case they hadn t even the mere nothing to go on  there was  on the contrary  the disrespect to sortini s letter and the insult to his messenger    but what is all this about punishment and advocates   said k
 surely amalia couldn t be accused or punished because of sortini s criminal proceedings    yes   said olga   she could  not in a regular suit at law  of course
and she wasn t punished directly  but she was punished all right in other ways  she and the whole family  and how heavy the punishment has been you are surely beginning to understand
in your opinion it s unjust and monstrous  but you re the only one in the village of that opinion  it s an opinion favourable to us  and ought to comfort us  and would do that if it weren t so obviously based on error
i can easily prove that  and you must forgive me if i mention frieda by the way  but between frieda and klamm  leaving aside the final outcome of the two affairs  the first preliminaries were much the same as between amalia and sortini  and yet  although that might have shocked you at the beginning you accept it now as quite natural
and that s not merely because you re accustomed to it  custom alone couldn t blunt one s plain judgement  it s simply that you ve freed yourself from prejudice    no  olga   said k    i don t see why you drag in frieda  her case wasn t the same  don t confuse two such different things  and now go on with your story    please don t be offended   said olga   if i persist in the comparison  it s a lingering trace of prejudice on your part  even in regard to frieda that makes you feel you must defend her from a comparison
she s not to be defended  but only to be praised
in comparing the two cases  i don t say they re exactly alike  they stand in the same relation as black to white  and the white is frieda
the worst thing one can do to frieda is to laugh at her  as i did in the bar very rudely   and i was sorry for it later   but even if one laughs it s out of envy or malice  at any rate one can laugh
on the other hand  unless one is related to her by blood  one can only despise amalia
therefore the two cases are quite different  as you say  but yet they are alike    they re not at all alike   said k   and he shook his head stubbornly   leave frieda out of it  frieda got no such fine letter as that of sortini s  and frieda was really in love with klamm  and  if you doubt that  you need only ask her  she loves him still    but is that really a difference   asked olga
 do you imagine klamm couldn t have written to frieda in the same tone  that s what the gentlemen are like when they rise from their desks  they feel out of place in the ordinary world and in their distraction they say the most beastly things  not all of them  but many of them
the letter to amalia may have been the thought of a moment  thrown on the paper in complete disregard for the meaning to be taken out of it
what do we know of the thoughts of these gentlemen  haven t you heard of  or heard yourself  the tone in which klamm spoke to frieda  klamm s notorious for his rudeness  he can apparently sit dumb for hours and then suddenly bring out something so brutal that it makes one shiver
nothing of that kind is known of sortini  but then very little is known of him
all that s really known about him is that his name is like sordini s
if it weren t for that resemblance between the two names problably he wouldn t be known at all
even as the fire brigade uthority apparently he s confused with sordini  who is the real authority  and who exploits the resemblance in name to push things on to sortini s shoulders  especially any duties falling on him as a deputy  so that he can be left undisturbed to his work
when a man so unused to society as sortini suddenly felt himself in love with a village girl  he ll naturally take it quite differently from  say  the joiner s apprentice next door and one must remember  too  that between an official and a village cobbler s daughter there s a great gulf fixed which has to be somehow bridged over  and sortini tried to do it in that way  where someone else might have acted differently
of course we re all supposed to belong to the castle  and there s supposed to be no gulf between us  and nothing to be bridged over  and that may be true enough on ordinary occasions  but we ve had grim evidence that it s not true when anything really important crops up
at any rate  all that should make sortini s methods more comprehensible to you  and less monstrous
compared with klamm s they re comparatively reasonable  and even for those intimately affected by them much more endurable
when klamm writes a loving letter it s much more exasperating than the most brutal letter of sortini s
don t mistake me  i m not venturing to criticize klamm  i m only comparing the two  because you re shutting your eyes to the comparison
klamm s a kind of tyrant over women  he orders first one and then another to come to him  puts up with none of them for long  and orders them to go just as he ordered them to come
oh  klamm wouldn t even give himself the trouble of writing a letter first and in comparison with that is it so monstrous that sortini  who s so retiring  and whose relations with women are at least unknown  should condescend for once to write in his beautiful official hand a letter  however abominable  and if there s no distinction here in klamm s favour  but the reverse  how can frieda s love for him establish one  the relation existing between the women and the officials  believe me  is very difficult  or rather very easy to determine
love always enters into it
there s no such thing as an official s unhappy love affair
so in respect it s no praise to say of a girl   i m referring to many others besides frieda   that she gave herself to an official only out of love
she loved him and gave herself to him  that was all there s nothing praiseworthy in that
but you ll object that amalia didn t love sortini
well  perhaps she didn t love him  but then after all perhaps she did love him  who can decide  not even she herself
how can she fancy she didn t love him when she rejected him so violently  as no official has ever been rejected  barnabas says that even yet she sometimes trembles with the violence of the effort of closing the window three years ago
that is true  and therefore one can t ask her anything
she has finished with sortini  and that s all she knows
whether she loves him or not she does not know
but we do know that women can t help loving the officials once they give them any encouragement  yes  they even love them beforehand  let them deny it as much as they like  and sortini not only gave amalia encouragement  but leapt over the shaft when he saw her
although his legs were stiff from sitting at desks he leapt right over the shaft
but amalia s an exception  you will say
yes  that she is  that she has proved in refusing to go to sortini  that s exception enough  but if in addition she weren t in love with sortini  she would be too exceptional for plain human understanding
on that afternoon  i grant you  we were smitten with blindness  but the fact that in spite of our mental confusion we thought we noticed signs of amalia s being in love  showed at least some remnants of sense
but when all that s taken into account  what difference is left between frieda and amalia  one thing only  that frieda did what amalia refused to do    maybe   said k    but for me the main difference is that i m engaged to frieda  and only interested in amalia because she s a sister of barnabas s  the castle messenger  and because her destiny may be bound up with his duties
if she had suffered such a crying injustice at the hands of an official as your tale seemed to infer at the beginning  i should have taken the matter up seriously  but more from a sense of public duty than from any personal sympathy with amalia
but what you say has changed the aspect of the situation for me in a way i don t quite understand  but am prepared to accept  since it s you who tell me  and therefore i want to drop the whole affair
i m no member of the fire brigade  sortini means nothing to me
but frieda means something to me  i have trusted her completely and want to go on trusting her  and it surprises me that you go out of your way  while discussing amalia  to attack frieda and try to shake my confidence in her
i m not assuming that you re doing it with deliberate intent  far less with malicious intent  for in that case i should have left long ago
you re not doing it deliberately  you re betrayed into it by circumstances  impelled by your love for amalia you want to exalt her above all other women  and since you can t find enough virtue in amalia herself you help yourself out by belittling the others amalia s act was remarkable enough  but the more you say about it the less clearly can it be decided whether it was noble or petty  clever or foolish  heroic or cowardly
amalia keeps her motives locked in her own bosom and no one will ever get at them
frieda  on the other hand  has done nothing at all remarkable  she has only followed her own heart  for anyone who looks at her actions with goodwill that is clear  it can be substantiated  it leaves no room for slander
however  i don t want either to belittle amalia or to defend frieda  all i want is to let you see what my relation is to frieda  and that every attack on frieda is an attack on myself
i came here of my own accord  and of my own accord i have settled here  but all that has happened to me since i came  and  above all  any prospects i may have   dark as they are  they still exist   i owe entirely to frieda  and you can t argue that away
true  i was engaged to come here as a land surveyor  yet that was only a pretext  they were playing with me  i was driven out of everybody s house  they re playing with me still to day
but how much more complicated die game is now that i have  so to speak  a larger circumference   which means something  it may not be much   yet i have already a home  a position and real work to do  i have a promised wife who takes her share of my professional duties when i have other business  i m going to her and become a member of the community  and besides official connexion i have also a personal connexion with klamm  although as yet i haven t been able to make use of it
that s surely quite a lot  and when i come to you  why do you me welcome  why do you confide the history of your family to me  why do you hope that i might possibly help you  certainly not because i m  the land surveyor whom lasemann and brunswick  for instance  turned out of their house a week ago  but because i m a man with some power at my back
but that i owe to frieda  to frieda who is so modest that if you were to ask her about it  she wouldn t know it existed
and so  considering all this  it seems that frieda in her innocence has achieved more than amalia in all her pride  for may i say that i have the impression that you re seeking help for amalia and from whom  in the last resort from no one else but frieda    did i really speak so abominably of frieda   asked olga   i certainly didn t mean to  and i don t think i did  still  it s possible
we re in a bad way  our whole world is in ruins  and once we begin to complain we re  carried farther than we realize
you re quite right  there s a big difference now between us and frieda  and it s a good thing to emphasize it once in a while
three years ago we were respectable girls and frieda an outcast  a servant in the bridge inn  we used to walk past her without looking at her  i admit we were too arrogant  but that s how we were brought up
but that evening in the herrenhof probably enlightened you about our respective positions to day
frieda with the whip in her hand  and i among the crowd of servants
but it s worse even than that frieda may despise us  her position entitles her to do so  actual circumstances compel it but who is there who doesn t despise us  whoever decides to despise us will find himself in good company do you know frieda s successor  pepi  she s called
i met her for the first time the night before last  she used to be a chambermaid
she certainly outdoes frieda in her contempt for me
she saw me through the window as i was coming for beer  and ran to the door and locked it  so that i had to beg and pray for a long time and promise her the ribbon from my hair before she would let me in
but when i gave it to her she threw it into a corner
well  i can t help it if she despises me  i m partly dependent on her goodwill  and she s the barmaid in the herrenhof
only for the time being  it s true  for she certainly hasn t the qualities needed for permanent employment there
one only has to overhear how the landlord speaks to pepi and compare it with his tone to frieda
but that doesn t hinder pepi from despising even amalia  amalia  whose glance alone would be enough to drive pepi with all her plaits and ribbons out of the room much faster than her own fat legs would ever carry her
i had to listen again yesterday to her infuriating slanders against amalia until the customers took my part at last  although only in the kind of way you have seen already    how touchy you are   said k
 i only put frieda in her right place  but i had no intention of belittling you  as you seem to think
your family has a special interest for me  i have never denied it
but how this interest could give me cause for despising you i can t understand    oh  and   said olga   i m afraid that even you will understand it yet
can t you even understand that amalia s behaviour to sortini was the original cause of our being despised    that would be strange indeed   said k    one might admire or condemn amalia for such an action  but despise her  and even if she is despised for some reason i can t comprehend  why should the contempt be extended to you others  her innocent family  for pepi to despise you  for instance  is a piece of impudence  and i ll let her know it if ever i m in the herrenhof again    if you set out  k    said olga   to convert all the people who despise us you ll have your work cut out for you  for it s all engineered from the castle
i can still remember every detail of that day following the morning i spoke of
brunswick  who was our assistant then  had arrived as usual  taken his share of the work and gone home  and we were sitting at breakfast  all of us  even amalia and myself  very gay  father kept on talking about the celebration and telling us his plans in connection with the fire brigade  for you must know that the castle has its own fire brigade which had sent a deputation to the celebration  and there had been much discussion about it  the gentlemen present  from the castle had seen that performance of our fire brigade  had expressed great approval  and compared the castle brigade unfavourably with ours  so there had been some talk of reorganizing the castle brigade with the help of instructors from the village
there were several possible candidates  but father had hopes that he would be chosen
that was what he was discussing  and in his usual delightful way had sprawled over the table until he embraced half of it in his arms  and as he gazed through the open window at the sky his face was young and shining with hope  and that was the last time i was to see it like that then amalia  with a calm conviction we had never noticed in her before  said that too much trust shouldn t be placed in what the gentlemen said  they were in the habit of saying pleasant things on such occasions  but it meant little or nothing  the words were hardly out of their mouths before they were forgotten  only of course people were always ready to be taken in again next time
mother forbade her to say things like that  but father only laughed at her precocious air of wisdom  then he gave a start  and seemed to be looking round for something he had only just missed   but there was nothing missing   and said that brunswick had told him some story of a messenger and a torn up letter  did we know anything of it  who was concerned in it  and what it was all about  we kept silent
barnabas  who was as youthful then as a spring lamb  said something particularly silly or cheeky  the subject was changed  and the whole affair forgotten   amalia s punishment  but not long afterwards we were overwhelmed with questions from all sides about the story of the letter  we were visited by friends and enemies  acquaintances and complete strangers
not one of them stayed for any length of time  and our best friends were the quickest to go
lasemann  usually so slow and dignified  came in hastily as if only to see the size of the room  one look round it and he was gone  it was like a horrible kind of children s game when he fled  and father  shaking himself free from some other people  ran after him to the very door and then gave it up brunswick came and gave notice  he said quite honestly that he wanted to set up in business for himself  a shrewd man  he knew how to seize the right moment customers came and hunted round father s store room for the boots they had left to be repaired  at first father tried to persuade them to change their minds   and we all backed him up as much as we could   but later he gave it up  and without saying a word helped them to find their belongings  line after line in the order book was cancelled  the pieces of leather people had left with us were handed back
all debts owing us were paid  everything went smoothly without the slightest trouble  they asked for nothing better than to break every connexion with us quickly and completely  even if they lost by it
that counted for nothing
and finally  as we might have foreseen  seemann appeared  the captain of the fire brigade
i can still see the scene before me  seemann  tall and stout  but with a slight stoop from weakness in the lungs  a serious man who never could laugh  standing in front of my father whom he admired  whom he had promised in confidence to make a deputy captain  and to whom he had now to say that the brigade required his services no longer and asked for the return of his diploma
all the people who happened to be in our house left their business for the moment and crowded round the two men  seemann found it difficult to speak and only kept on tapping father on the shoulder  as if he were trying to tap out of him the words he ought to say and couldn t find
and he kept on laughing  probably to cheer himself a little and everybody else  but since he s incapable of laughing and no one had ever heard him laugh  it didn t occur to anybody that he was really laughing but father was too tired and desperate after the day he d had to help anybody out  he looked even too tired to grasp what was happening
we were all in despair  too  but being young didn t believe in the completeness of our ruin  and kept on expecting that someone in the long procession of visitors would arrive and put a stop to it all and make everything swing the other way again
in our foolishness we thought that seemann was that very man
we were all keyed up waiting for his laughter to stop  and for the decisive statement to come out at last
what could he be laughing at  if not at the stupid injustice of what had happened to us  oh  captain  captain  tell them now at last  we thought  and pressed close to him  but that only made him recoil from us in the most curious way
at length  however  he did begin to speak  in response not to our secret wishes  but to the encouraging or angry cries of the crowd
yet still we had hopes
he began with great praise for our father
called him an ornament to the brigade  an inimitable model to posterity  an indispensable member whose removal must reduce the brigade almost to ruin
that was all very fine  had he stopped there
but he went on to say that since in spite of that the brigade had decided  only as a temporary measure of course  to ask for his resignation  they would all understand the seriousness of the reason which forced the brigade to do so
perhaps if father had not distinguished himself so much at the celebration of the previous day it would not have been necessary to go so far  but his very superiority had drawn official attention to the brigade  and brought it into such prominence that the spotlessness of its reputation was more than ever a matter of honour to it and now that a messenger had been insulted  the brigade couldn t help itself  and he  seemann  found himself in the difficult position of having to convey its decision he hoped that father would not make it any more difficult for him
seemann was glad to have got it out
he was so pleased with himself that he even forgot his exaggerated tact  and pointed to the diploma hanging on the wall and made a sign with his finger father nodded and went to fetch it  but his hands trembled so much that he couldn t get it off the hook i climbed on a chair and helped him
from that moment he was done for  he didn t even take the diploma out of its frame  but handed the whole thing over to seemann
then he sat down in a corner and neither moved nor spoke to anybody  and we had to attend to the last people there by ourselves as well as we could    and where do you see in all this the influence of the castle   asked k
 so far it doesn t seem to have come in
what you ve told me about is simply the ordinary senseless fear of the people  malicious pleasure in hurting a neighbour  specious friendship  things that can be found anywhere  and  i must say  on the part of your father   at least  so it seems to me   a certain pettiness  for what was the diploma  merely a testimonial to his abilities  these themselves weren t taken from him  if they made him indispensable so much the better  and the one way he could have made things difficult for the captain would have been by flinging the diploma at his feet before he had said two words but the significant thing to me is that you haven t mentioned amalia at all
amalia  who was to blame for everything  apparently stood quietly in the background and watched the whole house collapse    no   said olga   nobody ought to be blamed  nobody could have done anything else  all that was already due to the influence of the castle    influence of the castle   repeated amalia  who had hopped in unnoticed from the courtyard
 the old people had been sitting with castle gossip you re at  still sitting with their heads together  and yet you wanted to go away immediately you came  k   and it s nearly ten now
are you really interested in that kind of gossip  there are people in the village who live on it  they stick their heads together just like you two and entertain each other by the hour
but i didn t think you were one of them    on the contrary   said k    that s exactly what i am  and moreover people who don t care for such gossip and leave it all to others don t interest me particularly    indeed   said amalia   well  there are many different kinds of interest  you know
i heard once of a young man who thought of nothing but the castle day and night  he neglected everything else and people feared for his reason  his mind was so wholly absorbed by the castle
it turned out at length  however  that it wasn t really the castle he was thinking of  but the daughter of a charwoman in the offices up there  so he got the girl and was all right again    i think i would like that man   said k
 as for your liking the man  i doubt it   said amalia   it s probably his wife you would like
well  don t let me disturb you  i ve got to go to bed  and i must put out the light for the old folks  sake
they re sound asleep now  but they don t really sleep for more than an hour  and after that the smallest glimmer disturbs them
good night   and actually the light went out at once  and amalia bedded herself somewhere on the floor near her parents
 who s the young man she mentioned   asked k
 i don t know   said olga   perhaps brunswick although it doesn t fit him exactly  but it might have been somebody else
it s not easy to follow her  for often one can t tell whether she s speaking ironically or in earnest
mostly she s in earnest but sounds conical    never mind explaining   said k
 how have you come to be so dependent on her  were things like that before the catastrophe  or did it happen later  and do you never feel that you want to be independent of her  and is there any sense in your dependence  she s the youngest  and should give way to you
innocently or not  she was the person who brought ruin on the family
and instead of begging your pardon for it every day she carries her head higher than anybody else  bother herself about nothing except what she chooses to do for your parents  nothing would induce her to become acquainted with your affairs  to use her own expression  and then if she docs speak to you at all she s mostly in earnest  but sounds ironical
does she queen it over you on account of her beauty  which you ve mentioned more than once  well  you re all three very like each other  but amalia s distinguishing mark is hardly a recommendation  and repelled me the first time i saw it  i mean her cold hard eye
and although she s the youngest she doesn t look it  she has the ageless look of women who seem not to grow any older  but seem never to have been young either
you see her every day  you don t notice the hardness of her face
that s why  on reflection  i can t take sortini s passion for her very seriously  perhaps he sent the letter simply to punish her  but not to summon her    i won t argue about sortini   said olga   for the castle gentlemen everything is possible  let a girl be as pretty or as ugly as you like
but in all the rest you re utterly mistaken so far as amalia is concerned
i have no particular motive for winning you over to amalia s side  and if i try to do it it s only for your own sake
amalia in some way or other was the cause of our misfortunes  that s true  but not even my father  who was the hardest hit  and who was never very sparing of his tongue  particularly at home  not even my father has ever said a word of reproach to amalia even in our very worst times
not because he approved of her action  he was an admirer of sortini  and how could he have approved of it  he couldn t understand it even remotely  for sortini he would have been glad to sacrifice himself and all that was his  although hardly io the way things actually happened  as an outcome apparendy of sortini s anger i say apparently  for we never heard another word from sortini
if he was reticent before then  from that day on he might as well have been dead
now you should have seen amalia at that time
we all knew that no definite punishment would be visited on us
we were only shunned
by the village and by the castle
but while we couldn t help noticing the ostracism of the village  the castle gave us no sign
of course we heard of the land surveyor from the castle in the past  so how could you notice the reverse  this blankness was the worst of all
it as far worse than the withdrawal of the people down here  for they hadn t deserted us out of conviction  perhaps they had nothing very serious against us  they didn t despise us then as you do to day  they only did it out of fear  and were waiting to see what would happen next
and we weren t afraid of being  stranded  for all our debtors had paid us  the settling up had keen entirely in our favour  and any provisions we didn t have were sent us secretly by relations  it was easy enough for us  it was harvest time   though we had no fields of pur own and nobody would take us on as workers  so that for the first time in our lives we were condemned to go nearly idle
so there we sat all together with the windows shut in the heats of july and august
nothing happened
no invitations  no news  no callers  nothing    well   said k    since nothing happened and you had no definite punishment hanging over you  what was there to be afraid of  what people you are    how am i to explain it   said olga
 we weren t afraid of anything in the future  we were suffering under the immediate present  we were actually enduring our punishment
the others in the village were only waiting for us to come to them  for father to open his workshop again  for amalia  who could sew the most beautiful clothes  fit for the best families  to come asking for orders again  they were all sorry to have had to act as they did
when a respected family is suddenly cut out of village life it means a loss for everybody  so when they broke with us they thought they were only doing their duty  in their place we should have done just the same
they didn t know very clearly what was the matter  except that the messenger had returned to the herrenhof with a handful of torn paper
frieda had seen him go out and come back  had exchanged a few words with him  and then spread what she had learned everywhere
but not in the least from enmity to us  simply from a sense of duty which anybody would have felt in the same circumstances and  as i ve said  a happy ending to the whole story would have pleased everybody else
if we had suddenly put in an appearance with the news that everything was that it had only been a misunderstanding  say  which was now quite cleared up  or that there had been actually cause for offence which had now been made good  or else   and even this would have satisfied people   that through our fluency in the castle the affair had been dropped  we should certainly have been received again with open arms  there would have been kissings and congratulations  i have seen that kind of thing happen to others once or twice already and it wouldn t have been necessary to say even as much as that
if we had only come out in the open and shown ourselves  if we had picked up our old connections without letting fall a single word about the affair of the letter  it would have been enough  they would all have been glad to avoid mentioning the matter
it was the painfulness of the subject as much as their fear that made them draw away from us  simply to avoid hearing about it or speaking about it or thinking about it or being affected by it in any way
when frieda gave it away it wasn t out of mischief but as a warning  to let the parish know that something had happened which everybody should be careful to keep clear of
it wasn t our family that was taboo  it was the affair  and our family only in so far as we were mixed up in the affair
so if we had quietly come forward again and let bygones be bygones and shown by our behaviour that the incident was closed  no matter in what way  and reassured public opinion that it was never likely to be mentioned again  whatever its nature had been  everything would have been made all right in that way  too  we should have found friends on all sides as before  and even if we hadn t completely forgotten what had happened people would have understood and helped us to forget it completely
instead of that we sat in the house
i don t know what we were expecting  probably some decision from amalia  for on that morning she had taken the lead in the family and she still maintained it
without any particular contriving or commanding or imploring  almost by her silence alone
we others  of course  had plenty to discuss  there was a steady whispering from morning till evening  sometimes father would call me to him in sudden panic and i would have to spend half the night on the edge of his bed
or we would often creep away together  i and barnabas  who did nothing about it all at first  and was always in a fever for some explanation  always the same  for he realized well enough that the carefree years that others of his age looked forward to were now out of the question for him  so we used to put our heads together  k   just like we two now  and forget that it was night  and that morning had come again
our mother was the feeblest of us all  probably because she had not only endured our cornmon sorrows but the private sorrow of each of us  and so we were horrified to see changes in her which  as we guessed  lay in wait for all of us
her favourite seat was the corner of the sofa  it s long since we parted with it  it stands now in brunswick s big living room  well  there she sat and   we couldn t tell exactly what was wrong   used to doze or carry on long conversations with herself  we guessed it from the moving of her lips
it was so natural for us to be always discussing the letter  to be always turning it over in all its known details and unknown potentialities  and to be always outdoing each other in thinking out plans for restoring our fortunes
it was natural and unavoidable  but not good  we only plunged deeper and deeper into what we wanted to escape from
and what good were these inspirations  however brilliant  none of them could be acted on without amalia  they were all tentative  and quite useless because they stopped short of amalia  and even if they had been put to amalia they would have met with nothing but silence
well  i m glad to say i understand amalia better now than i did then
she had more to endure than all of us  it s incomprehensible how she managed to endure it and still survive
mother  perhaps  had to endure all our troubles  but that was because they came pouring in on her
and she didn t hold out for long
no one could say that she s holding out against them to day  and even at that time her mind was beginning to go
but amalia not only suffered  she had the understanding to see her suffering clearly  we saw only the effects  but she knew the cause  we hoped for some small relief or other  she knew that everything was decided  we had to whisper  she had only to be silent
she stood face to face with the truth and went on living and endured her life then as now
in all our straits we were better off than she
of course  we had to leave our house
brunswick toot it on  and we were given this cottage  we brought our things over in several journeys with a handcart  barnabas and i pulling father and amalia pushing behind  mother was already sitting here on a chest  for we had brought her here first  and she whimpered softly all the time
yet i remember that even during those toilsome journeys   they were painful  too  for we often met harvest wagons  and the people became silent when they saw us and turned away their faces   even during those journeys barnabas and i couldn t stop discussing our troubles and our plans  so that we often stood stock still in the middle of pulling and had to be roused by father s  hallo  from behind
but all our talking made no difference to our life after the removal  except that we began gradually to feel the pinch of poverty as well
our relatives stopped sending us things  our money was almost done  and that was the time when people first began to despise us in the way you can see now
they saw that we hadn t the strength to shake ourselves clear of the scandal  and they were irritated
they didn t underestimate our difficulties  although they didn t know exactly what they were  and they knew that probably they wouldn t have stood up to them any better themselves  but that made it only all the more needful to keep clear of us   if we had triumphed they would have honoured us correspondingly  but since we failed they turned what had only been a temporary measure into a final resolve  and cut us off from the community for ever we were no longer spoken of as ordinary human beings  our very name was never mentioned  if they had to refer to us they called us barnabas s people  for he was the least guilty
even our cottage gained an evil reputation  and you yourself must admit  if you re honest  that on your first entry into it you thought it justified its reputation
later on  when people occasionally visited us again  they used to screw up their noses at the most trivial things  for instance  because the little oil lamp hung over the table
where should it hang if not over the table  and yet they found it insupportable
but if we hung the lamp somewhere else they were still disgusted
whatever we did  whatever we had  it was all despicable   petitions  what were we doing meanwhile  the worst thing we could have done  something much more deserving of contempt than our original offence   we betrayed amalia  we shook off her silent restraint  we couldn t go on living like that  without hope of any kind we could not live  and we began each in his or her own fashion with prayers or blustering to beg the castle s forgiveness
we knew  of course  that we weren t in a position to make anything good  and we knew too that the only likely connexion we had with the castle through sortini  who had been father s superior and had approved of him   was destroyed by what had happened  and yet we buckled down to the job
father began it  he started making senseless petitions to the village superintendent  to the secretaries  the advocates  the clerks  usually he wasn t received at all  but if by guile or chance he managed to get a hearing   and how we used to exult when the news came  and rub our hands    he was always thrown out immediately and never admitted again
besides  it was only too easy to answer him  the castle always has the advantage
what was it that he wanted  what had been done to him  what did he want to be forgiven for  when and by whom had so much as a finger been raised against him in the castle  granted he had become poor and lost his customers  etc   these were all chances of everyday life  and happened in all shops and markets was the castle to concern itself about things of that kind  it concerned itself about the common welfare  of course  but it couldn t simply interfere with the natural course of events for the sole purpose of serving the interest of one man
did he expect officials to be sent out to run after his customers and force them to come back  but  father would object   we always discussed the whole interview both before and afterwards  sitting in a corner as if to avoid amalia  who knew well enough what we were doing  but paid no attention   well  father would object  he wasn t complaining about his poverty  he could easily make up again for all he had lost  that didn t matter if only he were forgiven
but what was there to forgive  then came the answer
an accusation had come in against him  at least there was none in the registers  not in those registers anyhow which were accesible to the public advocates  consequently  so far as could be established  there was neither any accusation standing again him  nor one in process of being taken up
could he perhance refer to some official decree that had been issued against him  father couldn t do that
well then  if he knew of nothing and nothing had happened  what did he want  what was there to forgive him  nothing but the way he was aimlessly wasting official time  but that was just the unforgivable sin
father didn t give in  he was still very strong in those days  and his enforced leisure gave him plenty of time
 i ll restore amalia s honour  it won t take long now    he used to say to barnabas and me several times a day  but only in a low voice in case amalia should hear  and yet he only said it for her benefit  for in reality he wasn t hoping for the restoration of her honour  but only for forgiveness
yet before he could be forgiven he had to prove his guilt  and that was denied in all the bureaux
he hit upon the idea   and it showed that his mind was already giving way   that his guilt was being concealed from him because he didn t pay enough
until then he had paid only the established taxes  which were at least high enough for means like ours
but now he believed that he must pay more  which was certainly a delusion  for  although our officials accept bribes simply to avoid trouble and discussion  nothing is ever achieved in that way
still  if father had set his hopes on that idea  we didn t want them upset
we sold what we had left to sell   nearly all things we couldn t do without   to get father the money for his efforts and for a long time every morning brought us the satisfaction of knowing that when he went on his day s rounds he had at least a few coins to rattle in his pocket
of course we simply starved all day  and the only thing the money really did was to keep father fairly hopeful and happy
that could hardly be called an advantage  however
he wore himself out on these rounds of his  and the money only made them drag on and on instead of coming to a quick and natural end since in reality nothing extra could be done for him in return for those extra payments  clerks here and there tried to make a pretence ot giving something in return  promising to look the matter up  hinting that they were on the track of something  and that as a favour to father  and not as a duty  they would follow it up   and father  instead of growing sceptical  only became more and more credulous
he used to bring home such obviously worthless promises as if they were great triumphs  and it was a torment to see him behind amalia s back twisting his face in a smile and opening his eyes wide as he pointed to her and made signs to us that her salvation  which would have surprised nobody so much as herself  was coming nearer and nearer through his efforts  but that it was still a secret and we mustn t tell
things would certainly have gone on like this for a long time if we hadn t finally been reduced to the position of having oo more money to give him
barnabas  indeed  had been taken on meanwhile by brunswick  after endless imploring  as an assistant  on condition that he fetched his work in the dusk of the evening and brought it back again in the dark   it must be admitted that brunswick was taking a certain risk in his business for our sake  but in exchange he paid barnabas next to nothing  and barnabas is a model workman   yet his wages were barely enough to keep us from downright starvation very gently and after much softening of the blow we told our father that he could have no more money  but he took it very quietly
he was no longer capable of understanding how hopeless were his attempts at intervention  but he was wearied out by continual disappointments
he said  indeed and he spoke less clearly than before  he used to speak almost too clearly   that he would have needed only a very little more money  for to morrow or that very day he would have found out everything  and now it had all gone for nothing  ruined simply for lack of money  and so on  but the tone in which he said it showed that he didn t believe it all
besides  he brought out a new plan immediately of his own accord
since he had failed in proving his guilt  and consequently could hope for nothing more through official channels  he would have to depend on appeals alone  and would to move the officials personally
there must certainly be among them who had good sympathetic hearts  which couldn t give way to in their official capacity  but out of office hours  if one caught them at the right time  they surely listen   here k   who had listened with absorption hitherto  interrupted olga s narrative with the question   and don t you think he was right   although his question would have answered itself in the course of the narrative he wanted to know at once
 no   said olga   there could be no question of sympathy or anything of the kind
young and inexperienced as we were  we knew that  and father knew it too  of course  but he had forgotten it like nearly everything else
the plan he had hit on was to plant himself on the main road near the castle  where the officials pass in their carriages  and seize any opportunity of putting up his prayer for forgiveness to be honest  it was a wild and senseless plan  even if the impossible should have happened  and his prayer have really reached an official s ear
for how could a single official give a pardon  that could only be done at best by the whole authority  and apparently even the authority can only condemn and not pardon
and in any case even if an official stepped out of his carriage and was willing to take up the matter  how could he get any clear idea of the affair from the mumblings of a poor  tired  ageing man like father  officials are highly educated  but one sided
in his own department an official can grasp whole trains of thought from a single word  but let him have something from another department explained to him by the hour  he may nod politely  but he won t understand a word of it
that s quite natural  take even the small official affairs that concern the ordinary person   trifling things that an official disposes of with a shrug   and try to understand one of them  through and through  and you ll waste a whole lifetime on it without result
but even if father had chanced on a responsible official  no official can settle anything without the necessary documents  and certainly not on the main road
he can t pardon anything  he can only settle it officially  and he would simply refer to the official procedure  which had already been a complete failure for father
what a pass father must have been in to think of insisting on such a plan  if there were even the faintest possibility of getting pardon in that way  that part of the road would be packed with petitioners
but since it s sheer impossibility the road is absolutely empty
but maybe that strengthened father in his hopes  he found food for them everywhere
he had great need to find it  for a sound wouldn t have had to make such complicated calculations  he would have realized from external evidence that the thing was impossible
when officials travel to the village or back to the castle it s not for pleasure  but because there s work wailing for them in the village or in the castle  and so they travel at a neat pace
it s not likely to occur to them to look out of the carriage windows in search of petitioners  for the carriages are crammed with papers which they study on the way    but   said k    i ve seen the inside of an official sledge in which there weren t any papers   olga s story was opening for him such a great and almost incredible world that he could not help trying to put his own small experiences in relation to it  as much to convince himself of its reality as of his own existence  that s possible   said olga   but in that case it s even worse  for that means that the official s business is so important that the papers are too precious or too numerous to be taken with him  and those officials go at a gallop
in any case  none of them can spare time for father
and besides  there are several roads to the castle
now one of them is in fashion  and most carriages go by that  now it s another and everything drives pell mell there
and what governs this change of fashion has never yet been found out
at eight o clock one morning they ll all be on another road  ten minutes later on a third  and half an hour after that on the first road again  and then they may stick to that road all day  but every minute there s the possibility of a change
of course all the roads join up near the village  but by that tune all the carriages are racing like mad  while nearer the castle the pace isn t quite so fast
and the amount of traffic varies just as widely and incomprehensibly as the choice of roads
there are often days when there s not a carriage to be seen  and others when they travel in crowds
now  just think of all that in relation to father
in his best suit  which soon becomes his only suit  off he goes every morning from the house with our best wishes
he takes with him a small fire badge  which he has really no business to keep  to stick ia coat once he s out of the village  for in the village itself he is afraid to let it be seen  although it s so small that it can hardly be seen two paces away  but father insists that it s just the thing to draw a passing official s attention
not far from the castle entrance there s a market garden  belonging to a man called bertuch who sells vegetables to the castle  and there on the narrow stone ledge at the foot of the garden fence father took up his post
bertuch made no objection because he used to be verv friendly with father and had been one of his most faithful customers   you see  he has a lame foot  and he thought that nobody but father could make him a boot to fit it
well there sat father day after day  it was a wet and stormy autumn but the weather meant nothing to him
in the morning at his regular hour he had his hand on the latch and waved us goodbye  in the evening he came back soaked to the skin  every day  it seemed  a little more bent  and flung himself down in a corner at first he used to tell us all his little adventures  such as how bertuch for sympathy and old friendship s sake had thrown him a blanket over the fence  or that in one of the passing carriages he thought he had recognized this or the other official  or that this or the other coachman had recognized him again and playfully flicked him with his whip
but later he stopped telling us these things  evidently he had given up all hope of ever achieving anything there  and looked on it only as his duty  his dreary job  to go there and spend the whole day
that was when his rheumatic pains began  winter was coming on  snow fell early  the winter begins very early here
well  so there he sat sometimes on wet stones and at other times in the snow
in the night he groaned with pain  and in the morning he was many a time uncertain whether to go or not  but always overcame his reluctance and went
mother clung to him and didn t want to let him go  so he  apparently grown timid because his limbs wouldn t obey him  allowed her to go with him  and so mother began to get pains too
we often went out to them  to take them food  or merely to visit them  or to try to persuade them to come back home
how often we found them crouching together against each other on their narrow scat  huddled up under a thin blanket which scarcely covered them  and round them nothing but the grey of snow and mist  and far away for days at a time not a soul to be seen  not a carriage
sight that was  k   a sight to be seen
until one morning father couldn t move his stiff legs out of bed at all  he wasn t to be comforted  in a slight delirium he thought he could see an official stopping his carriage beside bertuch s just at that moment  hunting all along the fence for him and then climbing angrily into his carriage again with a shake of his head
at that father shrieked so loudly that it was as if he wanted to make the official hear him at all that distance  and to explain how blameless his absence was
and it became a long absence  he never went back again  and for weeks he never left his bed
amalia took over the nursing  the attending  the treatment  did everything he needed  and with a few intervals has kept it up to this day
she knows healing herbs to soothe his pain  she needs hardly any sleep  she s never alarmed  never afraid  never impatient  she does everything for the old folks
while we were fluttering around uneasily without being able to help in anything she remained cool and quiet whatever happened
then when the worst was past and father was able again to struggle cautiously out of bed with one of us supporting him on each side  amalia withdrew into the background again and left him to us   olga s plans  now it was necessary again to find some occupation for father that he was still fit for  something that at least would make him believe that he was helping to remove the burden of guilt from our family
something of the kind was not hard to find  anything at all in fact would have been as useful for the purpose as sitting in bertuch s garden  but i found something that actually gave me a little hope
whenever there had been any talk of our guilt among officials or clerks or anybody else  it was truly the insult to sortini s messenger that had always been brought up  further than that nobody dared to go
now  i said to myself  since public opinion  even if only ostensibly  recognise nothing but the insult to the messenger  then  even if it were still only ostensibly  everything might be put right if you could propitiate the messenger
no charge had actually been made  we were told  no department therefore had taken upth affair yet  and so the messenger was at liberty  as far as he was concerned   and there was no question of anything more   in forgive the offence
all that of course couldn t have any decisiy importance  was mere semblance and couldn t produce in turn  anything but semblance  but all the same it would cheer up my father and might help to harass the swarm of clerks who had been tormenting him  and that would be a satisfaction
first of course one had to find the messenger
when i told father of my plan  at first he was very annoyed  for to tell the truth he had become terribly self willed
for one thing he was convinced   this happened during his illness   that we had always held him back from final success  first by stopping his allowance and then by keeping him in his bed
and for another he was no longer capable of completely understanding any new idea
my plan was turned down even before i had finished telling him about it  he was convinced that his job was to go on waiting in bertuch s garden  and as he was in no state now to go there every day himself  we should have to push him there in a handbarrow but i didn t give in  and gradually he became reconciled to the idea  the only thing that disturbed him was that in this matter he was quite dependent on me  for i had been the only one who had seen the messenger  he did not know him
actually one messenger is very like another  and i myself was not quite certain that i would know this one again
presently we began to go to the herrenhof and look around among the servants
the messenger of course had been in sortini s service and sortini had stopped coming to the  village  but the gentlemen are continually changing their servants  one might easily find our man among the servants of another gentleman  and even if he himself was not to be found  still one might perhaps get news of him from the other servants for this purpose it was of course necessary to be in the herrenhof every evening  and people weren t very pleased to see us anywhere  far less in a place like that
and we couldn t appear either as paying customers
but it turned out that they could put us to some use all the same
you know what a trial the servants were to frieda
bottom they are mostly quiet people  but pampered by too little work    may you be as well off as a servant  is a favourite toast among the officials   and really  as far as an easy work goes servants seem to be the real masters in the castle  they know their own dignity too  and in the castle  there they have to behave in accordance with their regulations  they re quiet and dignified  several times i ve been assured of that  and one can find even among the servants down here some faint signs of that  but only faint signs  for usually  seeing that the castle regulations aren t fully binding on them in the village  they seem quite changed
a wild unmanageable lot  ruled by their insatiable impulses instead of by their regulations
their scandalous behaviour knows no limits  it s lucky for the village that they can t leave the herrenhof without permission  but in the herrenhof itself one must try to get on with them somehow
frieda  for instance  felt that very hard to do and so she was very glad to employ me to quieten the servants
for more than two years  at least twice a week  i ve spent the night with the servants in the stalls
earlier  when father was still able to go to the herrenhof with me  he slept somewhere in the taproom  and in that way waited for the news that i would bring in the morning
there wasn t much to bring
we ve never found the messenger to this day  he must be still with sortini who values him very highly  and he must have followed sortini when sortini retired to a more remote bureau
most of the servants haven t seen him since we saw him last ourselves  and when one or other claims to have seen him it s probably a mistake so my plan might have actually failed  and yet it hasn t failed completely
it s true we haven t found the messenger  and going to the herrenhof and spending the night there   perhaps his pity for me  too  any pity that he s still capable of   has unfortunately ruined my father  and for two years now he has ken in the state you ve seen him in  and yet things are perhaps better with him than with my mother  for we re waiting daily for her death
it has only been put off thanks to amalia s superhuman efforts
but what i ve achieved in the herrenhof is a certain connection with the castle
don t despise me when i that i don t repent what i ve done
what conceivable sort a connexion with the castle can this be  you ll no doubt be thinking
and you re right  it s not much of a connection
i know a great many of the servants now  of course  almost all the gentlemen s servants who have come to the village during the last two years  and if i should ever get into the castle  i shan t be a stranger there
of course  they re servants only in the village
in the castle they re quite different  and probably wouldn t know me or anybody else there that they ve had dealings with in the village  that s quite certain  even if they have sworn a hundred times in the stall that they would be delighted to see me again in the castle
besides  i ve already had experience of how little all these promises are worth
but still that s not the really important thing
it isn t only through the servants themselves that i have a connection with the castle  for apart from that i hope and trust that what i m doing is being noticed by someone up there   and the management of the staff of servants is really an extremely important and laborious official function   and that finally whoever is noticing me may perhaps arrive at a more favourable opinion of me than the others  that he may recognize that i m fighting for my family and carrying on my father s efforts  no matter in how poor a way if he should see it like that  perhaps he ll forgive me too for accepting money from the servants and using it for our family
and i ve achieved something more yet  which even you  i m afraid  will blame me for
i learned a great deal from the servants about the ways in which one can get into the castle service without going through the difficult preliminaries of official appointment lasting sometimes for years
in that case  it s true  one doesn t become an actual official employee  but only a private and semi official one  one has neither rights nor duties   and the worst is not to have any duties   but one advantage one does have  that one is on the spot  one can watch for favourable opportunities and take advantage of them  one may not be an employee  but by good luck some work may come one s way  perhaps no real employee is handy  there s a call  one flies to answer it  and one has become the very thing that one wasn t a minute before
an employee
only  when is one likely to get a chance like that  at once  one has hardly arrived  one has hardly had to look round before the chance is there  and many a one hasn t even the presence of mind  being quite new to the job  seize the opportunity
but in another case one may have to wait for even more years than the official employees  and after being a semi official servant for so long one can never be lawfully taken on afterwards as an official employee
so there s enough here to make one pause  but it sinks to nothing when one takes into account that the test for the official appointments is very stringent and that a member of any doubtful family is turned down in advance
let us say someone like that goes in for the examination  for years he waits in fear and trembling for the result  from the very first day everybody asks him in amazement how he could have dared to do anything so wild  but he still goes on hoping   how else could he keep alive  then after years and years  perhaps as an old man  he learns that he has been rejected  learns that everything is lost and that all his life has been in vain
here  too  of course there are exceptions  that s how one is so easily tempted
it happens sometimes that really shady customers are actually appointed  there are officials who  literally in spite of themselves  are attracted by those outlaws at the entrance examinations they can t help sniffing the air  smacking their lips  and rolling their eyes towards an entrant like that  who seems in some way to be terribly appetizing to them  and they have to stick close to their books of regulations so as to withstand him sometimes  however  that doesn t help the entrant to an appointment  but only leads to an endless postponement of the preliminary proceedings  which are never terminated  but only broken off by the death of the poor man
so official appointment no less than the other kind is full of obvious and concealed difficulties  and before one goes in for everything of the kind it s highly advisable to weigh everything carefully
now  we didn t fail to do that  barnabas and i
every time that i came back from the herrenhof we sat down together and i told the latest news that i had gathered  for days we talked it over  and barnabas s work lay idle for longer spells than was good for it
and here i may be to blame in your opinion
i knew quite well that much reliance was n to be put on the servants  stories
i knew that they never had much inclination to tell me things about the castle  that the always changed the subject  and that every word had to be dragged out of them  and then  when they were well started that they let themselves go  talked nonsense  bragged  tried to surpass one another in inventing improbable lies  so that in the continuous shouting in the dark stalls  one servant beginning where the other left off  it was clear that at best only a few scanty scraps of truth could be picked up but i repeated everything to barnabas again just as i had heard it  though he still had no capacity whatever to distinguish between what was true and what was false  and on account of the family s position was almost famishing to hear all these things
and he drank in everything and burned with eagerness for more
and as a matter of fact the cornerstone of my new plan was barnabas
nothing more could be done through the servants
sortini s messenger was not to be found and would never be found  sortini and his messenger with him seemed to be receding farther and farther  by many people their appearance and names were already forgotten  and often i had to describe them at length and in spite of that learn nothing more than that the servant i was speaking to could remember them with an effort  but except for that could tell nothing about them
and as for my conduct with the servants  of course i had no power to decide how it might be looked on and could only hope that the castle would judge it in the spirit i did it in  and that in return a little of the guilt of our family would be taken away  but i ve received no outward sign of that
still i stuck to it  for so far as i was concerned i saw no other chance of getting anything done for us in the castle
but for barnabas i saw another possibility
from the tales of the servants   if i had the inclination  and i had only too much inclination   i could draw the conclusion that anyone who was taken into the castle service could do a great deal for his family
but then what was there that was worthy or belief in these tales  it was impossible to make certain of that  but that there was very little was clear
for when  say  a servant that i would never see again  or that i would hardly recognize were i to see him again  solemnly promised me to help to get my brother a post in the castle  or at least  if barnabas should to the castle on other business  to support him  or at least to back him up   for according to the servants  stories it sometimes happens that candidates for posts become unconscious or deranged during the protracted waiting and then they re lost if some friend doesn t look after them   when things like that and a great many more were told to me  they were probably justified as warnings  but the promises that accompanied them were quite baseless
but not to barnabas
it s true i warned him not to believe them  but my mere telling of them was enough to enlist him for my plan
the reasons i advanced for it myself impressed him less  the thing that chiefly influenced him was the servants  stories
and so in reality i was completely thrown back upon myself
amalia was the only one who could make herself understood to my parents  and the more i followed  in my own way  the original plans of father  the more amalia shut herself off from me  before you or anybody else she talks to me  but not when we re alone
to the servants in the herrenhof i was a plaything which in their fury they did their best to wreck  not one intimate word have i spoken with any of them during those two years  i ve had only cunning or lying or silly words from them  so only barnabas remained for me  and barnabas was still very young
when i saw the light in his eyes as i told him those things  a light which has remained in them ever since  i felt terrified and yet i didn t stop  the things at stake seemed too great
i admit i hadn t my father s great though empty plans
i hadn t the resolution that men have
i confined myself to making good the insult to the messenger  and only asked that the actual modesty of my attempt should be put to my credit
but what i had failed to do by myself i wanted now to achieve in a different way and with certainty through barnabas
we had insulted a messenger and driven him into a more remote bureau
what was more natural than for us to offer a new messenger in the person of barnabas  so that the other messenger s work might be carried on by him  and the other messenger might remain quietly in retirement as long as he for as long a time as he needed to forget the insult  i was quite aware  of course  that in spite of all its modesty ther was a hint of presumption in my plan  that it might give way to the impression that we wanted to dictate to the authorities how they should decide a personal question  or that we doubted their ability to make the best arrangements  which they might have made long before we had struck upon the idea that something could be done
but then  i thought again that it was in fact possible that the authorities should misunderstand me so grossly or if they should  that they should do so intentionally  that in other words all that i did should be turned down in advance without further examination
so i did not give in and barnabas s ambition kept him from giving in
in this term of preparation barnabas became so uppish that he found that cobbling was far too menial work for him  a future bureau employee  yes  he even dared to contradict amalia  and flatly  on the few occasions that she spoke to him about it
i didn t grudge him this brief happiness  for with the first day that he went to the castle his happiness and his arrogance would be gone  a thing easy enough to foresee
and now began that parody of service of which i ve told you already
it was amazing with what little difficulty barnabas got into the castle that first time  or more correctly into the bureau which in a manner of speaking has become his workroom
this success drove me almost frantic at the time  when barnabas whispered the news to me in the evening after he came home
i ran to amalia  seized her  drew her into a corner  and kissed her so wildly that she cried with pain and terror
i could explain nothing for excitement  and then it had been so long since we had spoken to each other  so i put off telling her until the next day or the day after
for the next few days  however  there was really nothing more to tell
after the first quick success nothing more happened
for two long years barnabas led this heart breaking life
the servants failed us completely  i gave barnabas a short note to take with him recommending him to their consideration  reminding them at the same time of their promises  and barnabas  as often as he saw a servant  drew out the note and held it up  and even if i sometimes may have presented it to someone who didn t know me  and even if those who did know me were irritated by his hand holding out the note in silence   for he didn t dare to speak up there   yet all the same it was a shame that nobody helped him  and it was a relief which we could have secured  i must admit  by our own action and much earlier   when a servant who had probably been pestered several times already took the note  crushed it up and flung it into the wastepaper basket
almost as if he had said   that s just what you yourselves do with letters   it occurred to me
but barren of results as all this time was in other ways  it had a good effect on barnabas  if one can call it a good thing that he grew prematurely old  became a man before his time  yes  even in some ways more grave and sensible than most men
often it makes me sad to look at him and compare him with the boy that he was only two years ago
and with it all i m quite without the comfort and support that  being a man  he could surely give me
without me he could hardly have got into the castle  but since he is there  he s independent of me
i m his only intimate friend  but i m certain that he only tells me a small part of what he has on his mind
he tells me a great many things about the castle  but from his stories  from the trifling details that he gives  one can t understand in the least how those things could have changed him so much
in particular i can t understand how the daring he had as a boy   it actually caused us anxiety   how he can have lost it so completely up there now that he s a man
of course all that useless standing about and waiting all day  and day after day  and going on and on without any prospect of a change  must break a man down and make him unsure of himself and in the end actually incapable of anything   else but this hopeless standing about but why didn t he put up a fight even at the beginning  especially seeing that he soon recognized that i had been right and that there was no opportunity there for his ambition  though there might be some hope perhaps for the betterment of our family s condition
for up there  in spite of the servants  whims  everything goes on very soberly  ambition seeks its sole satisfaction in work  and as in this way the work itself gains the ascendancy  ambition ceases to have any place at all  for childish desires there s no room up there nevertheless barnabas fancied  so he has told me  that he could clearly see how great the power and knowledge even of those very mentionable officials were into whose bureau he is allowed
how fast they dictated  with half shut eyes and brief gestures  merely by raising a finger quelling the surly servants  and making thern smile with happiness even when they were checked
or perhaps rinding an important passage in one of the books and becoming quite absorbed in it  while the others would crowd round as near as the cramped space would allow them  and crane their necks to see it
these things and other things of the same kind gave barnabas a great idea of those men  and he had the feeling that if he could get the length of being noticed by them and could venture to address a few words to them  not as a stranger  but as a colleague   true a very subordinate colleague   in the bureau  incalculable things might be achieved for our family
but things have never got that length yet  and barnabas can t venture to do anything that might help towards it  although he s well aware that  young as he is  he s been raised to the difficult and responsible position of chief breadwinner in our family on account of this wholt unfortunate affair
and now for the final confession
it was a week after your arrival
i heard somebody mentioning it in the herrenhof  but didn t pay much attention
a land surveyor had come and i didn t even know what a land surveyor was
but next evening barnabas   at an agreed hour i usually set out to go a part of the way to meet him   came home earlier than usual  saw amalia in the sittingroom  drew me out into the street  laid his head on my shoulder  and cried for several minutes
he was again the little boy he used to be
something had happened to him that he hadn t been prepared for
it was as if a whole new world had suddenly opened to him  and he could not bear the joy and the anxieties of all this newness
and yet the only thing that had happened was that he had been given a letter for delivery to you
but it was actually the first letter  the first commission  that he had ever been given   olga stopped
everything was still except for the heavy  occasionally disturbed breathing of the old people
k
merely said casually  as if to round off olga s story   you ve all been playing with me
barnabas brought me the letter with the air of an old much occupied messenger  and you as well as amalia   who at that time must have been in with you   behaved as if carry   messages and the letter itself were matters of indifference    you must distinguish between us   said olga
 barnabas had in made a happy boy again by the letter  in spite of all the doubts that he had about his capability
he confined those doubts to himself and me  but he felt it a point of honour to look like a real messenger  as according to his ideas real messengers looked so although his hopes were now rising to an official uniform i had to alter his trousers  and in two hours  so that they would have some resemblance at least to the close fitting trews of the official uniform  and he might appear in them before you  knowing  of course  that on this point you could be easily taken in
so much for barnabas
but amalia really despises his work as a messenger  and now that he seemed to have had a little success   as she could easily guess from barnabas and myself and our talking and whispering together   she despised it more than ever
so she was speaking the truth  don t deceive yourself about that
but if i  k   have seemed to slight barnabas s work  it hasn t been with any intention to deceive you  but from anxiety
these two letters that have gone through barnabas s hands are the first signs of grace  questionable as they are  that our family has received for three years
this change  if it is a change and not deception   deceptions are more frequent than changes   is connected with your arrival here  our fate has become in a certain sense dependent on you  perhaps these two letters are only a beginning  and barnabas s abilities will be used for other things than these two letters concerning you   we must hope that as long as we can   for the time being  however  everything centres on you
now up in the castle we must rest content with whatever our lot happens to be  but down here we can  it may be  do something ourselves  that is  make sure of your goodwill  or at least save ourselves from your dislike  or  what s more important  protect you as far as our strength and experience go  so that your connexion with the castle   by which we might perhaps be helped too   might not be lost
now what was our best way of bringing that about  to prevent you from having any suspicion of us when we appealed   i preached you   for you re a stranger here and because of the certain to be full of suspicion  full of justifiable suspicion
and besides  we re despised by everybody and you must be influence by the general opinion  particularly through your fiancee how could we put ourselves forward without quite unintentionally setting ourselves up against your fiancee  and so offering you  and the messages  which i had read before you got them   barnabas didn t read them  as a messenger he couldn t allow himself to do that   seemed at the first glance obsolete and not of much importance  yet took on the utmost importance in as much as they referred you to the superintendent now in these circumstances how were we to conduct ourselves towards you  if we emphasized the letters  importance  we laid ourselves under suspicion by overestimating what was obviously unimportant  and in pluming ourselves as the vehicle of these messages we should be suspected of seeking our own ends  not yours more  in doing that we might depreciate the value of the letter itself in your eyes and so disappoint you sore against our will
but if we didn t lay much stress on the letters we should lay ourselves equally under suspicion  for why in that case should we have taken the trouble of delivering such an unimportant letter  why should our actions and our words be in such clear contradiction  why should we in this way disappoint not only you  the addressee  but also the sender of the letter  who certainly hadn t handed the letter to us so that we should belittle it to the addressee by our explanations  and to hold the mean  without exaggeration on either side  in other words to estimate the just value of those letters  is impossible  they themselves change in value perpetually  the reflections they give rise to are endless  and chance determines where one stops reflecting  and so even our estimate of them is a matter of chance and when on the top of that there came anxiety about you  everything became confused  and you mustn t judge whatever i said too severely
when  for example   as once happened   barnabas arrived with the news that you were dissatisfied with his work  and in his first distress   his professional vanity was wounded too i must admit   resolved to retire from the service altogether  then to make good the mistake i was certainly ready to deceive  to lie  to do anything  no matter how if it would only
but even then i would have been doing it  at least in my opinion  as much for your sake as for ours   there was a knock
olga ran to the door and unfastened it
a strip of light from a dark lantern fell across the threshold
the late visitor put questions in a whisper and was answered in the same way  but was not satisfied and tried to force his way to the room
olga found herself unable to hold him back any longer and called to amalia  obviously hoping that to keep the old people from being disturbed in their sleep amalia would do anything to eject the visitor
and indeed she hurried over at once  pushed olga aside  and stepped into the street and closed the door behind her
she only remained there for a moment  almost at once she came back again  so quickly had she achieved what had proved impossible for olga
k
then learned from olga that the visit was intended for him
it had been one of the assistants  who was looking for him at frieda s command
olga had wanted to shield k
from the assistant
if k
should confess his visit here to frieda later  he could  but it must not be discovered through the assistant
k
agreed
but olga s invitation to spend the night there and wait for barnabas he declined  for himself he might perhaps have accepted for it was already late in the night and it seemed to him that now  whether he wanted it or not  he was bound to this family in such a way that a bed for the night here  though for many reasons painful  nevertheless  when one considered this common bond  was the most suitable for him in the village all the same he declined it  the assistant s visit had alarmed him  it was incomprehensible to him how frieda  who knew his wishes quite well  and the assistants  who had learned to fear him  had come together again like this  so that frieda didn t scruple to send an assistant for him  only one of them  too  while the other had probably remained to keep her company
he asked olga whether she had a whip  she hadn t one  but she had a good hazel switch  and he took it
then he asked whether were was any other way out of the house  there was one through the yard  only one had to clamber over the wall of the neighbouring garden and walk through it before one reached the street
k
decided to do this
while olga was conducting through the yard  k
tried hastily to reassure her fears  told her that he wasn t in the least angry at the small artifices she had told him about  but understood them very well  thanked her for the confidence she had shown in him in telling him her story and asked her to send barnabas to the school as soon as he arrived  even if it were during the night
it was true  the messages which barnabas brought were not his only hope  otherwise things would be bad indeed with him  but he didn t by any means leave them out of account  he would hold to them and not forget olga either  for still more important to him than the messages themselves was olga  her bravery  her prudence  if he had to choose between olga and amalia it wouldn t cost him much reflection and he pressed her hand cordially once more as he swung himself on to the wall of the neighbouring garden when he reached the street he saw indistinctly in the darkness that a little farther along the assistant was still walking up and down before barnabas s house
sometimes he stopped and tried to peep into the room through the drawn blinds
k
called to him
without appearing visibly startled he gave up his spying on the house and came towards k
 who are you looking for   asked k   testing the suppleness of the hazel switch on his leg
 you   replied the assistant as he came nearer
 but who are you   asked k
suddenly  for this did not appear to be the assistant
he seemed older  wearier  more wrinkled  but fuller in the face  his walk too was quite different from the brisk walk of the assistants  which gave an impression as if their joints were charged with electricity
it was slow  a little halting  elegantly valetudinarian
 you don t recognize me   asked the man   jeremiah  your old assistant    i see   said k
tentatively producing the hazel switch again  which he had concealed behind his back
 but you look quite different    it s because i m by myself   said jeremiah
 when i m by myself then all my youthful spirits are gone    but where is arthur   asked k
 arthur   said jeremiah
 the little dear  he has left the service
you were rather hard and rough on us  you know  and the gentle soul couldn t stand it
he s gone back to the castle to put oa a complaint    and you   asked k
 i m able to stay here   said jeremiah   arthur is putting in a complaint for me too    what have you to complain about  then   asked k
 that you can t understand a joke
what have we done  jested a little  laughed a little  teased your fiancee a little
and all according to our instructions  too
when galater sent us to you     galater   asked k
 yes  galater   replied jeremiah   he was deputizing for klamm himself at the time when he sent us to you he said   i took a good note of it  for that s our business
you re to go down there as assistants to the land surveyor   we replied   but we don t know anything about the work   thereupon he replied   that s not the main point
if it s necessary  he ll teach you it the main thing is to cheer him up a little
according to the reports i ve received he takes everything too seriously
he has just got to the village  and starts off thinking that a great experience  whereas in reality it s nothing at all
you must make him see that    well   said k    was galater right  and have you carried out your task    that i don t know   replied jeremiah
 in such a short time it was hardly possible
i only know that you were very rough on us  and that s what we re complaining of
i can t understand how you  an employee yourself and not even a castle employee  aren t able to see that a job like that is very hard work  and that it s very wrong to make the work harder for the poor workers  and wantonly  almost childishly  as you have done
your total lack of consideration in letting us freeze at the railings  and almost felling arthur with your fist on the straw sack   arthur  a man who feels a single cross word for days   and in chasing me up and down in the snow all afternoon  so that it was an hour before i could recover from it t and i m no longer young    my dear jeremiah   said k    you re quite right about all this  only it s galater you should complain to
he sent you here of his own accord  i didn t beg him to send you
and as i hadn t asked you it was at my discretion to send you back again  and like you  i would much rather have done it peacefully than with violence  but evidently you wouldn t have it any other way
besides  why didn t you speak to me when you came first as frankly as you ve done just now    because i was in the service   said jeremiah   surely that s obvious   and now you re in the service no longer   asked k
 that s so  said jeremiah   arthur has given notice in the castle that we re giving up the job  or at least proceedings have been set going that will finally set us free from it    but you re still looking for me just as if you were in the service   said k
 no   replied jeremiah   i was only looking for you to reassure frieda
when you forsook her for barnabas s sister she was very unhappy  not so much because of the loss  as because of your treachery  besides she had seen it coming for a long time and had suffered a great deal already on that account
i only went up to the schoolwindow for one more look to see if you mightn t have become more reasonable
but you weren t there
frieda was sitting by herself on a bench crying
so then i went to her and we came to an agreement
everything s settled
i m to be waiter in the herrenhof  at least until my business is settled in the castle  and frieda is back in the taproom again
it s better for frieda
there was no sense in her becoming your wife
and you haven t known how to value the sacrifice that she was prepared to make for you either
but the good soul had still some scruples left  perhaps she was doing you an injustice  she thought  perhaps you weren t with the barnabas girl after all
although of course there could be no doubt where you were  i went all the same so as to make sure of it once and for all
for after all this worry frieda deserved to sleep peacefully for once  not to mention myself
so i went and not only found you there  but was able to see incidentally as well that you had the girls on a string
the black one especially   a real wild cat   she s set her cap at you
well  everyone to his taste
but all the same it wasn t necessary for you to take the roundabout way through the next door garden  i know that way   so now the thing had come after all which he had been able to foresee  but not to prevent
frieda had left him
it could not be final  it was not so bad as that  frieda could be won back  it was easy for any stranger to influence her  even for those assistants who considered frieda s position much the same as their own  and now that they had given notice had prompted frieda to do the same  but k
would only have to show himself and remind her of all that spoke in his favour  and she would come back to him  especially if he should be in a position to justify his visit to those girls by some success due entirely to them yet in spite of those reflexions  by which he sought to reassure himself on frieda s account  he was not reassured only a few minutes ago he had been praising frieda up to olga and calling her his only support
well  that support was not of the firmest  no intervention of the mighty ones had been needed to rob k
of frieda   even this not very savoury assistant had been enough   this puppet which sometimes gave one the impression of not being properly alive
jeremiah had already begun to disappear
k
called him back
 jeremiah   he said   i want to be quite frank with you
answer one question of mine too in the same spirit
we re no longer in the position of master and servant  a matter of congratulation not only to you but to me too
we have no grounds  then  for deceiving each other
here before your eyes i snap this switch which was intended for you  for it wasn t for fear of you that i chose the back way out  but so as to surprise you and lay it across your shoulders a few times
but don t take it badly  all that is over
if you hadn t been forced on me as a servant by the bureau  but had been simply an acquaintance  we would certainly have got on splendidly  even if your appearance might have disturbed me occasionally
and we can make up now for what we have missed in that way    do you think so   asked the assistant  yawning and closing his eyes wearily
 i could of course explain the matter more at length  but i have no time  i must go to frieda  the poor child is waiting for me  she hasn t started on her job yet  at my request the landlord has given her a few hours  grace   she wanted to fling herself into the work at once probably to help her to forget   and we want to spend that little time at least together
as for your proposal  i have no cause  certainly  to deceive you  but i have just as little to confide anything to you
my case  in other words  is different from yours
so long as my relation to you was that of a servant  you were naturally a very important person in my eyes  not because of your own qualities  but because of my office  and i have done anything for you that you wanted  but now you re of no importance to me
even your breaking the switch doesn t affect me  it only reminds me what a rough master i had  it is not calculated to prejudice me in your favour    you talk to me   said k   as if it were quite certain that you ll never have to fel anything from me again
but that isn t really so
from all appearances you re not free from me  things aren t settled here so quickly as that     sometimes even more quickly   jeremiah threw in
 sometimes   said k   but nothing points to the fact that it s so this time  at least neither you nor i have anything that we can show in black and white
the proceedings are only started  it seems  and i haven t used my influence yet to intervene  but i will if the affair turns out badly for you  you ll find that you haven t exactly endeared yourself to your master  and perhaps it was superfluous after all to break the hazel switch
and then you have abducted frieda  and that has given you an inflated notion of yourself  but with all the respect that i have for your person  even if you have none for me any longer  a few words from me to frieda will be enough   i know it   to smash up the lies that you ve caught her with
and only lies could have estranged frieda from me    these threats don t frighten me   replied jeremiah   you don t in the least want me as an assistant  you were afraid of me even as an assistant  you re afraid of assistants in any case  it was only fear that made you strike poor arthur    perhaps   said k    but did it hurt the less for that  perhaps i ll be able to show my fear of you in that way many times yet
once i see that you haven t much joy in an assistant s work  it ll give me great satisfaction again  in spite of all my fear  to keep you at it
and moreover i ll do my best next time to see that you come by yourself  without arthur  i ll be able then to devote more attention to you    do you think   asked jeremiah   that i have even the slightest fear of all this    i do think so   said k    you re a little afraid  that s certain  and if you re wise  very much afraid
if that isn t so why didn t you go straight back to frieda  tell me  are you in love with her  then    in love   said jeremiah
 she s a nice clever girl  a former sweetheart of klamm s  so respectable in any case
and as she kept on asking me to save her from you
why shouldn t i do her the favour  particularly as i wasn t doing you any harm  seeing that you ve consoled yourself with these damned barnabas girls    now i can see how frightened you are   said k    frightened out of your wits
you re trying to catch me with lies
all that frieda asked for was to be saved from those filthy swine of assistants  who were getting past bounds  but unfortunately i hadn t time to fulfil her wish completely  and now this is the result of my negligence    land surveyor  land surveyor   someone shouted down the street
it was barnabas
he came up breathless with running  but did not forget to greet k
with a bow
 it s done   he said
 what s done   asked k
 you ve laid my request before klamm    that didn t come off   said barnabas   i did my best  but it was impossible  i was urgent  stood there all day without being asked and so close to the desk that once a clerk actually pushed me away  for i was standing in his light  i reported myself when klamm looked up   and that s forbidden   by lifting my hand  i was the last in the bureau  was left alone there with only the servants  but had the luck all the same to see klamm coming back again  but it was not on my account  he only wanted to have another hasty glance at something in a book and went away immediately
finally  as i still made no move  the servants almost swept me out of the door with the broom
i tell you all this so that you need never complain of my efforts again    what good is all your zeal to me  barnabas   said k    when it hasn t the slightest success    but i have had success   replied barnabas
 as i was leaving my bureau   i call it my bureau   i saw a gentleman coming slowly towards me along one of the passages  which were quite empty except for him
by that time in fact it was very late
i decided to wait for him
it was a good pretext to wait longer  indeed i would much rather have waited in any case  so as not to have to bring you news of failure
but apart from that it was worth while waiting  for it was erlanger
you don t know him  he s one of klamm s chief secretaries
a weakly little gentleman  he limps a little
he recognized me at once  he s famous for his splendid memory and his knowledge of people  he just draws his brows together and that s enough for him to recognize anybody  often people even that he s never seen before  that he s only heard of or read about
for instance  he could hardly ever have seen me
but although he recognizes everybody immediately  he always asks first as if he weren t quite sure
 aren t you barnabas   he asked me
and then he went on   you know the land surveyor  don t you   and then he said   that s very lucky
i m just going to the herrenhof
the land surveyor is to report to me there
i ll be in room number 15
but he must come at once
i ve only a few things to settle there and i leave again for the castle at 5 o clock in the morning
tell him that it s very important that i should speak to him    suddenly jeremiah set off at a run
in his excitement barnabas had scarcely noticed his presence till now and asked   where s jeremiah going    to forestall me with erlanger   said k   and set off after jeremiah  caught him up  hung on to his arm  and said   is it a sudden desire for frieda that s seized you  i ve got it as well  so we ll go together side by side   before the dark herrenhof a little group of men were standing  two or three had lanterns with them  so that a face here and there could be distinguished
k
recognized only one acquaintance  gerstacker the carrier
gerstacker greeted him with the inquiry   you re still in the village    yes   replied k
 i ve come here for good    that doesn t matter to me   said gerstacker  breaking out into a fit of coughing and turning away to the others
it turned out that they were all waiting for erlanger
erlanger had already arrived  but he was consulting first with momus before he admitted his clients
they were all complaining at not being allowed to wait inside and having to stand out there in the snow
the weather wasn t very cold  but still it showed a lack of consideration to keep them standing there in front of the house in the darkness  perhaps for hours
it was certainly not the fault of erlanger  who was always very accommodating
he knew nothing about it  and would certainly be very annoyed if reported to him
it was the fault of the herrenhof landlady  who in her positively morbid determination to be refined  couldn t suffer a lot of people to come into the herrenhof at the same time
 if it absolutely must be and they must come   she used to say   then in heaven s name let them come one at a time   and she managed to arrange that the clients  who at first had waited simply in a passage  later on the stairs  then in the hall  and finally in the taproom  were at last pushed out into the street
but even that had not satisfied her
it was unendurable for her to be always  besieged   as she expressed herself  in her own house
it was incomprehensible to her why there should need to be clients waiting at all
 to dirty the front door steps   an official had once told her  obviously in annoyance  but to her this pronouncement had seemed very illuminating  and she was never tired of quoting it
she tried her best   and she had the approval in this case of the clients too   to get a building set up opposite the herrenhof where the clients could wait
she would have liked best of all if the interviews and examinations could have taken place outside the herrenhof altogether  but the officials opposed that  and when the officials opposed her seriously the landlady naturally enough was unable to gainsay them  though in lesser matters she exercised a kind of petty tyranny  thanks to her indefatigable  yet femininely insinuating zeal
and the landlady would probably have to endure those interviews and examinations in the herrenhof in perpetuity  for the gentlemen from the castle refused to budge from the place whenever they had official business in the village
they were always in a hurry  they came to the village much against their will  they had not the slightest intention of prolonging their stay beyond the time absolutely necessary  and so they could not be asked  simply for the sake of making things more pleasant in the herrenhof  to waste time by transferring themselves with all their papers to some other house the officials preferred indeed to get through their business in the taproom or in their rooms  if possible while they were at their food  or in bed before retiring for the night  or in the morning when they were too weary to get up and wanted to stretch themselves for a little longer yet the question of the erection of a waiting room outside seemed to be nearing a favourable solution but it was really a sharp blow for the landlady   people laughed a little over it   that this matter of a waiting room should itself make innumerable interviews necessary  so that the lobbies of the house were hardly ever empty
the waiting group passed the time by talking in half whispers about those things   k
was struck by the fact that  though their discontent was general  nobody saw any objection to erlanger s summoning his clients in the middle of the night
he asked why this was so and got the answer that they should be only too thankful to erlanger
it was only his goodwill and his high conception of his office that induced him to come to the village at all  he could easily if he wished   and it would probably be more in accordance with the regulations too   he could easily send an under secretary and let him draw up statements
still  he usually refused to do this  he wanted to see and hear everything for himself  but for this purpose he had to sacrifice his nights  for in his official time table there was no time allowed for journeys to the village k
objected that even klamm came to the village during the day and even stayed for several days
was erlanger  then  a mere secretary  more indispensable up there  one or two laughed good humouredly  others maintained an embarrassed silence  the latter gained the ascendancy  and k
received hardly any reply
only one man replied hesitatingly  that of course klamm was indispensable  in the castle as in the village
then the front door opened and momus appeared between two attendants carrying lamps
 the first who will be admitted to herr erlanger   he said   are gerstacker and k   are these two men here   they reported themselves  but before they could step forward jeremiah slipped in with an  i m a waiter here  and  greeted by momus with a smiling slap on the shoulder  disappeared inside  i ll have to keep a sharper eye on jeremiah   k
told himself  though he was quite aware at the same time that jeremiah was probably far less dangerous than arthur who was working against him in the castle perhaps it would actually have been wiser to let himself be annoyed by them as assistants  than to have them prowling about without supervision and allow them to carry on their intrigues in freedom  jntrigues for which they seemed to have special facilities as k
was passing momus the latter started as if only now did he recognize in him the land surveyor
 ah  the land surveyor   he said
 the man who was so unwilling to be examined and now is in a hurry to be examined
it would have been simpler to let me do it that time
well  really it s difficult to choose the right time for a hearing   since at these words k
made to stop  momus went on   go in  go in  i needed your answers then  i don t now   nevertheless k
replied  provoked by momus s tone   you only think of yourselves
i would never and will never answer merely because of someone s office  neither then nor now   momus replied   of whom  then  should we think  who else is there here  look for yourself   in the hall they were met by an attendant who led them the old way  already known to k   across the courtyard  then into the entry and through the low  somewhat downward sloping passage
the upper storeys were evidently reserved only for higher officials  the secretaries  on the other hand  had their rooms in this passage  even erlanger himself  although he was one of the highest among them the servant put out his lantern  for here it was brilliant with electric light
everything was on a small scale  but elegantly finished
the space was utilized to the best advantage
the passage was just high enough for one to walk without bending one s head
along both sides the doors almost touched each other
the walls did not quite reach to the ceiling  probably for reasons of ventilation  for here in the low cellar like passage the tiny rooms could hardly have windows the disadvantage of those incomplete walls was that the passage  and necessarily the rooms as well  were noisy many of the rooms seemed to be occupied  in most the people were still awake  one could hear voices  hammering  the clink of glasses but the impression was not one of particular gaiety
the voices were muffled  only a word here and there could be indistinctly made out  it did not seem to be conversation either  probably someone was only dictating something or reading something aloud
and precisely from the rooms where there was a sound of glasses and plates no word was to be heard  and the mering reminded k that he had been told some time or that certain of the officials occupied themselves occasionally with carpentry  model engines  and so forth  to recuperate from the continual strain of mental work the passage itself was empty except for a pallid  tall  thin gentleman in a fur coat  under which his night clothes could be seen  who was sitting before one of the doors
probably it had become too stuffy for him in the room  so he had sat down outside and was reading a newspaper  but not very carefully
often he yawned and left off reading  then bent forward and glanced along the passage  perhaps he was waiting for a client whom he had invited and who had omitted to come
when they had passed him the servant said to gerstacker   that s pinzgauer   gerstacker nodded   he hasn t been down here for a long time now   he said
 not for a long time now   the servant agreed
at last they stopped before a door which was not in any way different from the others  and yet behind which  so the servant informed them  was erlanger
the servant got k
to lift him on to his shoulders and had a look into the room through the open slit
 he s lying down   said the servant climbing down   on the bed  in his clothes  it s true  but i fancy all the same that he s asleep
often he s overcome with weariness like that  here in the village  what with the change in his habits
we ll have to wait
when he wakes up he ll ring
besides  it has happened before this for him to sleep away all his stay in the village  and then when he woke to have to leave again immediately for the castle
it s voluntary  of course  the work he does here    then it would be better if he just slept on   said gerstacker   for when he has a little time left for his work after he wakes  he s very vexed at having fallen asleep  and tries to get everything settled in a hurry  so that one can hardly get a word in    you ve come on account of the contract for the carting for the new building   asked the servant
gerstacker nodded  drew the servant aside  talked to him in a low voice  but the servant hardly listened  gazed away over gerstacker  whom he overtopped by more than a head  and stroked his hair slowly and seriously
then  as he was looking round aimlessly  k
saw frieda far away at a turn of the passage
she behaved as if she did not recognize him and only stared at him expressionlessly
she was carrying a tray with some empty dishes in her hand
he said to the servant  who  however  paid no attention whatever to him the more one talked to the servant the more absent minded he seemed to become   that he would be back in a moment  and ran off to frieda
reaching her he took her by the shoulders as if he were seizing his own property again  and asked her a few unimportant questions with his eyes holding hers
but her rigid bearing hardly as much as softened  to hide her confusion she tried to rearrange the dishes on the tray and said   what do you want from me  go back to the others   oh  you know whom i mean  you ve just come from them  i can see it   k
changed his tactics immediately
the explanation mustn t come so suddenly  and mustn t begin with the worst point  the point most unfavourable to himself  i thought you were in the taproom   he said
frieda looked at him in amazement and then softly passed her free hand over his brow and cheeks
it was as if she had forgotten what he looked like and were trying to recall it to mind again  even her eyes had the veiled look of one who was painfully trying to remember
 i ve been taken on in the taproom again   she said slowly at last  as if it did not matter what she said  but as if beneath her words she were carrying on another conversation with k
which was more important    this work here is not for me  anybody at all could do it
anybody who can make beds and look good natured and doesn t mind the advances of the boarders  but actually likes them
anybody who can do that can be a chambermaid
but in the taproom  that s quite different
i ve been taken on straight away for the taproom again  in spite of the fact that i didn t leave it with any great distinction  but  of course  i had a word put in for me
but landlord was delighted that i had a word put in for me to it easy for him to take me on again
it actually ended by the having to press me to take on the post
when you reflect what the taproom reminds me of you ll understand that
finally i decided to take it on
i m only here temporarily
pepi begged not to put her to the shame of having to leave the taproom at once  and seeing that she has been willing and has done everything to the best of her ability  we have given her a twenty four hours  extension    that s all very nicely arranged   said k    but once you left the taproom for my sake  and now that we re soon to be married are you going back to it again    there will be no marriage   said frieda
 because i ve been unfaithful to you   asked k
frieda nodded
 now  look here  frieda   said k
 we ve often talked already about this alleged unfaithfulness of mine  and every time you ve had to recognize finally that your suspicions were unjust
and since then nothing has changed on my side  all i ve done has remained as innocent as it was at first and as it must always remain
so something must have changed on your side  through the suggestions of strangers or in some way or other
you do me an injustice in any case  for just listen to how i stand with those two girls
the one  the dark one i m almost ashamed to defend myself on particular points like this  but you give me no choice   the dark one  then  is probably just as displeasing to me as to you
i keep my distance with her in every way i can  and she makes it easy  too  no one could be more retiring than she is    yes   cried frieda  the words slipped out as if against her will  k
was delighted to see her attention diverted  she was not saying what she had intended    yes  you may look upon her as retiring  you tell me that the most shameless creature of them all is retiring  and incredible as it is  you mean it honestly  you re not shamming  i know
the bridge inn landlady once said of you    i can t abide him  but i can t let him alone  either  one simply can t control oneself when one sees a child that can hardly walk trying to go too far for it  one simply has to interfere     pay attention to her advice for this once   said k
smiling   but that girl   whether she s retiring or shameless doesn t matter   i don t want to hear any more about her    but why do you call her retiring   asked frieda obdurtely   k
considered this interest of hers a favourable sign  have you found her so  or are you simply casting a reflexion on somebody else    neither the one nor the other   said k    i call her that out of gratitude  because she makes it easy for me to ignore her  and because if she said even a word or two to me i couldn t bring myself to go back again  which would be a great joss to me  for i must go there for the sake of both our futures  as you know
and it s simply for that reason that i have to talk with the other girl  whom i respect  i must admit  for her capability  prudence  and unselfishness  but whom nobody could say was seductive    the servants are of a different opinion   said frieda
 on that as on lots of other subjects   said k
 are you going to deduce my unfaithfulness from the tastes of the servants   frieda remained silent and suffered k
to take the tray from her  set it on the floor  and put his arm through hers  and walk her slowly up and down in the corner of the passage
 you don t know what fidelity is   she said  his nearness putting her a little on the defensive   what your relations with the girl may be isn t the most important point
the fact that you go to that house at all and come back with the smell of their kitchen on your clothes is itself an unendurable humiliation for me
and then you rush out of the school without saying a word
and stay with them  too  the half of the night
and when you re asked for  you let those girls deny that you re there  deny it passionately  especially the wonderfully retiring one
and creep out of the house by a secret way  perhaps actually to save the good name of the girls  the good name of those girls
no  don t let us talk about it any more    yes  don t let us talk of this   said k    but of something else  frieda
besides  there s nothing more to be said about it
you know why i have to go there
it isn t easy for me  but i overcome my feelings
you shouldn t make it any harder for me than it is
to night i only thought of dropping in there for a minute to see whether barnabas had come at last  for he had an important message which he should have brought long before
he hadn t come  but he was bound to come very soon  so i was assured  and it seemed very probable too
i didn t want to let him come after me  for you to be insulted by his presence
the hours passed and unfortunately he didn t
but another came all right  a man whom i hate
i had no insention of letting myself be spied on by him  so i left through the neighbour s garden  but i didn t want to hide from him either and i went up to him frankly when i reached the street  with a very good and supple hazel switch  i admit
that is all  so there s nothing more to be said about it
but there s plenty to say about something else
what about the assistants  the very mention of whose name is as repulsive to me as that family is to yours
compare your relations with them with my relations with that family
i understand your antipathy to barnabas s family and i can share it
it s only for the sake of my affairs that i go to see them  sometimes it almost seems to me that i m abusing and exploiting them but you and the assistants  you ve never denied that they persecute you  and you ve admitted that you re attracted by them
i wasn t angry with you for that  i recognized that powers were at work which you weren t equal to  i was glad enough to see that you put up a resistance at least  i helped to defend you  and just because i left off for a few hours  trusting in your constancy  trusting also  i must admit  in the hope that the house was securely locked and the assistants finally put to flight   i still underestimate them  i m afraid   just because i left off for a few hours and this jeremiah   who is  when you look at him closely  a rather unhealthy elderly creature had the impudence to go up to the window
just for this  frieda  i must lose you and get for a greeting   there will be no marriage   shouldn t i be the one to cast reproaches  but i don t  i have never done so   and once more it seemed advisable to k
to distract frieda s mind a little  and he begged her to bring him something to eat  for he had had nothing since midday
obviously relieved by the request  frieda nodded and ran to fetch something  not farther along the passage  however  where k conjectured the kitchen was  but down a few steps to the left
in a little she brought a plate with slices of meat and a bottle of wine  but they were clearly only the remains of a meal  the scraps of meat had been hastily ranged out anew so as to hide the fact  yet whole sausage skins had been overlooked  and the bottle was three quarters empty
however  k
said nothing and fell on the food with a good appetite
 you were in the kitchen   he asked
 no  in my own room   she said
 i have a room down there    you might surely have taken me with you   said k
 i ll go down now  so as to sit down for a little while i m eating    i ll bring you a chair   said frieda already making to go
 thanks   replied k
holding her back   i m neither going down there  nor do i need a chair any longer   frieda endured his hand on her arm defiantly  bowed her head and bit her lip
 well  then  he is down there   she said   did you expect anything else  he s lying on my bed  he got a cold out there  he s shivering  he s hardly had any food
at bottom it s all your fault  if you hadn t driven the assistants away and run after those people  we might be sitting comfortably in the school now
you alone have destroyed our happiness
do you think that jeremiah  so long as he was in service  would have dared to take me away  then you entirely misunderstood the way things are ordered here
he wanted me  he tormented himself  he lay in watch for me  but that was only a game  like the play of a hungry dog who nevertheless wouldn t dare to leap up on the table and just the same with me
i was drawn to him  he was a playmate of mine in my childhood   we played together on the slope of the castle hill  a lovely time  you ve never asked me anything about my past   but all that wasn t decisive as long as jeremiah was held back by his service  for i knew my duty as your future wife
but then you drove the assistants away and plumed yourself on it besides  as if you had done something for me by it
well  in a certain sense it was true
your plan has succeeded as far as arthur is concerned  but only for the moment  he s delicate  he hasn t jeremiah s passion that nothing can daunt  besides you almost shattered his health for him by the buffet you gave him that night   it was a blow at my happiness as well   he fled to the castle to complain  and even if he comes back soon  he s gone now all the same
but jeremiah stayed
when he s in service he fears the slightest look of his master  but when he s not in service there s nothing he s afraid of
he came and took me
forsaken by you  commanded by him  my old friend  i couldn t resist
i didn t unlock the school door
he smashed the window and lifted me out
we flew here  the landlord looks up to him  nothing could be more welcome to the guests  either  than to have such a waiter  so we were taken on  he isn t living with me  but we are staying in the same room    in spite of everything   said k    i don t regret having driven the assistants from our service
if things stood as you say and your faithfulness was only determined by the assistants being in the position of servants  then it was a good thing that it came to an end
the happiness of a married life spent with two beasts of prey  who could only be kept under by the whip wouldn t have been very great
in that case i m even thankful to this family who have unintentionally had some part in separating us   they became silent and began to walk backwards and forwards again side by side  though neither this time could have told who had made the first move
close beside him  frieda seemed annoyed that k
did not take her arm again
 and so everything seems in order   k went on   and we might as well say good bye  and you go to your jeremiah  who must have had this chill  it seems  ever since i chased him through the garden  and whom you ve already left by himself too long in that case  and i to the empty school  or  seeing that there s no place for me there without you  anywhere else where they ll take me in if i hesitate still in spite of this  it s because i have still a litde doubt about what you ve told me  and with good reason
i have a different impression of jeremiah
so long as he was in service  he was always at your heels and i don t believe that his position would have held him back permanently from making a serious attempt on you
but now that he considers that he s absolved from service  it s a different case
forgive me if i have to explain myself in this way
since you re no longer his master s fiancee  you re by no means such a temptation for him as you used to be
you may be the friend of his childhood  but   i only got to know him really from a short talk to night   in my opinion he doesn t lay much weight on such sentimental considerations
i don t know why he should seem a passionate person in your eyes
his mind seems to me on the contrary to be particularly cold he received from galater certain instructions relating to me  instructions probably not very much in my favour  he exerted himself to carry them out  with a certain passion for service  i ll admit   it s not so uncommon here   one of them was   he should wreck our relationship probably he tried to do it by several means  one of them was to tempt you by his evil languishing glances  another   here the landlady supported him   was to invent fables about my unfaithfulness
his attempt succeeded  some memory or other of klamm that clung to him may have helped  he has lost his position  it is true  but probably just at the moment when he no longer needed it  then he reaped the fruit of his labours and lifted you out through the school window  with that his task was finished  and his passion for jervice having left him now  he ll feel bored  he would rather be in arthur s shoes  who isn t really complaining up there at all  but earning praise and new commissions  but someone had to stay behind to follow the further developments of the affair
it s rather a burdensome task to him to have to look after you
of love for you he hasn t a trace  he frankly admitted it to me
as one of klamm s sweethearts he of course respects you  and to insinuate himself into your bedroom and feel himself for once a little klamm certainly gives him pleasure  but that is all  you yourself mean nothing to him now  his finding a place for you here is only a supplementary part of his main job so as not to disquieten you he has remained here himself too  but only for the time being  as long as he doesn t get further news from the castle and his cooling feelings towards you aren t quite cured    how you slander him   said frieda  striking her little fists together  slander   said k    no  i don t wish to slander him
but i may quite well perhaps be doing him an injustice  that is certainly possible
what i ve said about him doesn t lie on the surface for anybody to see  and it may be looked at differently too
but slander  slander could only have one object  to combat your love for him
if that were necessary and if slander were the most fitting means  i wouldn t hesitate to slander him
nobody could condemn me for it  his position puts him at such an advantage as compared with me that  thrown back solely on my own resources  i could even allow myself a little slander
it would be a comparatively innocent  but in the last resort a powerless  means of defence
so put down your fists   and k
took frieda s hand in his
frieda tried to draw it away  but smilingly and not with any great earnestness
 but i don t need slander   said k    for you don t love him  you only think you do  and you ll be thankful to me for ridding you of your illusion
for think  if anybody wanted to take you away from me without violence  but with the most careful calculation  he could only do it through the two assistants
in appearance  for childish  merry  irresponsible youths  fallen from the sky  from the castle  a dash of childhood s memories with them too
that of course must have seemed very nice  especially when i was the antithesis of it all  and was always running after affairs moreover which were scarcely comprehensible  which were exasperating to you  and which threw me together with people whom you considered deserving of your hate   something of which you carried over to me too  in spite of all my innocence
the whole thing was simply a wicked but very clever exploitation of the failings in our relationship
everybody s relations have their blemishes  even ours  we came together from two very different worlds  and since we have known each other the life of each of us has had to be quite different  we still feel insecure  it s all too new
i don t speak of myself  i don t matter so much  in reality i ve been enriched from the very first moment that you looked on me  and to accustom oneself to one s riches isn t very difficult
but   not to speak of anything else   you were torn away from klamm  i can t calculate how much that must have meant  but a vague idea of it i ve managed to arrive at gradually  you stumbled  you couldn t find yourself  and even if i was always ready to help you  still i wasn t always there  and when i was there you were held captive by your dreams or by something more palpable  the landlady  say   in short there were times when you turned away from me  longed  poor child  for vague inexpressible things  and at those periods any passable man had only to come within your range of vision and you lost yourself to him  succumbing to the illusion that mere fancies of the moment  ghosts  old memories  things of the past and things receding ever more into the past  life that had once been lived that all this was your actual present day life a mistake  frieda  nothing more than the last and  properly regarded  contemptible difficulties attendant on our final reconciliation
come to yourself  gather yourself together
even if you thought that the assistants were sent by klamm   it s quite untrue  they come from the plater   and even if they did manage by the help of this illusion to charm you so completely that even in their disreputable nicks and their lewdness you thought you found traces of them  just as one fancies one catches a glimpse of some precious stone that one has lost in a dung heap  while in reality one couldn t be able to find it even if it were there   all the same they re only hobbledehoys like the servants in the stall  except that they re not healthy like them  and a little fresh air makes them ill and compels them to take to their beds  which i must say that they know how to snuffle out with a servant s true cunning   frieda had let her head fall on k  s shoulder
their arms round each other  they walked silently up and down  if we had only   said frieda after a while  slowly  quietly  almost serenely  as if she knew that only a quite short respite of peace on k  s shoulder were reserved for her  and she wanted to enjoy it to the utmost   if we had only gone away somewhere at once that night  we might be in peace now  always together  your hand always near enough for mine to grasp
oh  how much i need your companionship  how lost i have felt without it ever since i ve known you  to have your company  believe me  is the only dream that i ve had  that and nothing else   then someone called from the side passage  it was jeremiah  he was standing there on the lowest step  he was in his shirt  but had thrown a wrap of frieda s round him
as he stood there  his hair rumpled  his thin beard lank as if dripping with wet  his eyes painfully beseeching and wide with reproach  his sallow cheeks flushed  but yet flaccid  his naked legs trembling so violently with cold that the long fringes of the wrap quivered as well  he was like a patient who had escaped from hospital  and whose appearance could only suggest one thought  that of getting him back in bed again
this in fact was the effect that he had on frieda  she disengaged herself from k   and was down beside jeremiah in a second
her nearness  the solicitude with which she drew the wrap closer round him  the haste with which she tried to force him back into the room  seemed to give him new strength  it was as if he only recognized k
now
 ah  the land surveyor   he said  stroking frieda s cheek to propitiate her  for she did not want to let him talk any  forgive the interruption
but i m not at all well  that must be my excuse
i think i m feverish  i must drink some tea and get a sweat
those damned railings in the school garden  they ll give me something to think about yet  and then  already chilling to the bone  i had to run about all night afterwards
one sacrifices one s health for things not really worth it  without noticing it at the time
but you  land surveyor  mustn t let yourself be disturbed by me  come into the room here with us  pay me a sick visit  and at the same time tell frieda whatever you have still to say to her
when two who are accustomed to one another say good bye  naturally they have a great deal to say to each other at the last minute which a third party  even if he s lying in bed waiting for his tea to come  can t possibly understand
but do come in  i ll be perfectly quiet    that s enough  enough   said frieda pulling at his arm
 he s feverish and doesn t know what he s saying
but you  k   don t you come in here  i beg you not to
it s my room and jeremiah s  or rather it s my room and mine alone  i forbid you to come in with us
you always persecute me
oh  k   why do you always persecute me  never  never will i go back to you  i shudder when i think of the very possibility
go back to your girls
they sit beside you before the fire in nothing but their shifts  i ve been told  and when anybody comes to fetch you they spit at him you must feel at home there  since the place attracts you so much
i ve always tried to keep you from going there  with little success  but all the same i ve tried
all that s past now  you are free
you ve a lovely life in front of you
for the one you ll perhaps have to squabble a little with the servants  but as for the other  there s nobody in heaven or earth that will grudge you her
the union is blessed beforehand
don t deny it  i know you can disprove anything  but in the end nothing is disproved
only think  jeremiah  he has disproved everything   they nodded with a smile of mutual understanding
 but   frieda went on   even if everything were disproved  what would be gained by that  what would it matter to me  what happens in that house is purely their business and his business  not mine
mine is to nurse you till you re well again  as you were at one time  before k
tormented you for my sake    so you re not coming in after all  surveyor   asked jeremiah  but was now definitely away by frieda  who did not even turn to look at k
in
there was a little door down there  still lower than the joors in the passage   not jeremiah only  even frieda had to stoop on entering   within it seemed to be bright and warm  a few whispers were audible  probably loving cajolements to get jeremiah to bed  then the door was closed
                                                                                                                              the text of the first german edition of the castle ends
it has been translated by willa and edwin mttir
what follows is the continuation of the text together with additional material  different versions  fragments  passages deleted by the author  etc   as found among kafka s papers after the publication of the first edition and included by the editor  max brod  in the definitive german edition the translation is by eithne willins and ernst kaiser                                                                                                                                only now did k
notice how quiet it had become in the passage  not only here in this part of the passage wher he had been with frieda  and which seemed to belong to the public rooms of the inn  but also in the long passage with the rooms that had earlier been so full of bustle so the gentlemen had gone to sleep at last after all k
too was very tired  perhaps it was from fatigue that he had not stood up to jeremiah as he should have
it would perhaps have been more prudent to take his cue from jeremiah  who was obviously exaggerating how bad his chill was   his woefulness was not caused by his having a chill  it was congenital and could not be relieved by any herbal tea   to take his cue entirely from jeremiah  make a similar display of his own really great fatigue  sink down here in the passage  which would in itself afford much relief  sleep a little  and then perhaps be nursed a little too
only it would not have worked out as favourably as with jeremiah  who would certainly have won this competition for sympathy  and rightly so  probably  and obviously every other fight too
k
was so tired that he wondered whether he might not try to go into one of these rooms  some of which were sure to be empty  and have a good sleep in a luxurious bed in his view this might turn out to be recompense for many things
he also had a night cap handy
on the tray that frieda had left on the floor there had been a small decanter of rum
k  did not shrink from the exertion of making his way back  and he drained the little bottle to the dregs
now he at least felt strong enough to go before erlanger
he looked for the door of erlanger s room  but since the servant and gerstacker were no longer to be seen and all the doors looked alike  he could not find it
yet he believed he remembered more or less in what part of the passage the door had been  and decided to open a door that in his opinion was probably the one he was looking for
the experiment could not be so very dangerous
if it was erlanger s room erlanger would doubtless receive him  if it was somebody else s room it would be possible to apologize and go away again  and if he was asleep  which was what was probable  then k  s visit not be noticed at all
it could turn out badly only if the was empty  for then k
would scarcely be able to resist the teptation to get into the bed and sleep for ages
he once more glanced along the passage to right and to left  to see whether after all there might not be somebody coming who would be able to give him some information and make the venture unnecessary  but the long passage was quiet and empty
then k
listened at the door
here too was no inmate
he knocked so quietly that it could not have wakened a sleeper  and when even now nothing happened he opened the door very cautiously indeed
but now he was met with a faint scream
it was a small room  more than half filled by a wide bed  on the night table the electric lamp was burning  beside it was a travelling handbag
in the bed  but completely hidden under the quilt  someone stirred uneasily and whispered through a gap between quilt and sheet   who is it   now k
could not withdraw again so easily  discontentedly he surveyed the voluptuous but unfortunately not empty bed  then remembered the question and gave his name
this seemed to have a good effect  the man in the bed pulled the quilt a little off his face  anxiously ready  however  to cover himself up again completely if something was not quite all right out there but then he flung back the quilt without qualms and sat up it was certainly not erlanger
it was a small  well looking gentleman whose face had a certain contradictoriness in that the cheeks were chubby as a child s and the eyes merry as a child s  but that the high forehead  the pointed nose  the narrow mouth  the lips of which would scarcely remain closed  the almost vanishing chin  were not like a child s at all  but revealed superior intellect
it was doubtless his satisfaction with this  his satisfaction with himself  that had preserved him a marked residue of something healthily childlike  do you know friedrich   he asked
k
said he did not
 but he knows you   the gentleman said  smiling
k
nodded  there was no lack of people who knew him  this was indeed one of the main obstacles in his way
 i am his secretary   the gentleman said   my name is burgel    excuse me   k
said  reaching for the door handle   i am sorry  i mistook your door for other
the fact is i have been summoned to secretary erlanger s   what a pity   burgel said
 not that you are summoned here  but that you made a mistake about the doors
the fact is once i am wakened i am quite certain not to go to sleep again
still  that need not sadden you so much  it s my personal misfortune
why  anyway  can t these doors be locked  eh  there s a reason for that  of course
because  according to an old saying the secretaries  doors should always be open
but that  again need not be taken quite so literally   burgel looked queryingly and merrily at k   in contrast to his lament he seemed thoroughly well rested
burgel had doubtessly never in his life been as tired as k
was now
 where do you think of going now   burgel asked
 it s four o clock
anyone to whom you might think of going you would have to wake  not everybody is as used to being disturbed as i am  not everyone will put up with it as tolerantly  the secretaries are a nervous species
so stay for a little while
round about five o clock people here begin to get up  then you will be best able to answer your summons
so please do let go of the door handle now and sit down somewhere  granted there isn t overmuch room here  it will be best if you sit here on the edge of the bed
you are surprised that i should have neither chair nor table here  well  i had the choice of getting either a completely furnished room with a narrow hotel bed  or this big bed and nothing else except the washstand
i chose the big bed  after all  in a bedroom the bed is undoubtedly the main thing  ah  for anyone who could stretch out and sleep soundly  for a sound sleeper  this bed would surely be truly delicious but even for me  perpetually tired as i am without being able to sleep  it is a blessing  i spend a large part of the day in it  deal with all my correspondence in it  here conduct all the interviews with applicants
it works quite well
of course the applicants have nowhere to sit  but they get over that  and after all it s more agreeable for them too if they stand and the recorder is at ease than if they sit cornfortably and get barked at
so the only place i have to offer is this here on the edge of the bed  but that is not an official place and is only intended for nocturnal conversations
but you are quiet  land surveyor    i am very tired   said k   who on receiving the invitation had instantly  rudely  without respect  sat down on the bed and leaned against the post
 of course   burgelsaid  laughing   everybody is tired here
the work  for instance  that i got through yesterday and have already got through even to day is no small matter
it s completely out of the question of course that i should go to sleep now  but if this most utterly unprobable thing should happen after all and i should go to sleep while you are still here  then please stay quiet and don t open the door  either
but don t worry  i shall certainly not go to sleep or at best only for a few minutes
the way it is with me is that probably because i am so very used to dealing with applicants i do actually find it easiest to go to sleep when i have company    do go to sleep  please do  mr secretary   k said  pleased at this announcement   i shall then  with your permission  sleep a little too    no  no   burgel said  laughing again   unfortunately i can t go to sleep merely on being invited to do so  it s only in the course of conversation that the opportunity may arise  it s most likely to be a conversation that puts me to sleep
yes  one s nerves suffer in our business
i  for instance  am a liaison secretary
you don t know what that is  well  i constitute the strongest liaison    here he hastily rubbed his hands in involuntary merriment    between friedrich and the village  i constitute the liaison between his castle and village secretaries  am mostly in the village  but not permanently
at every moment i must be prepared to drive up to the castle
you see the travelling bag   a restless life  not suitable for everyone
on the other hand it is true that now i could not do without this kind of work  all other work would seem insipid to me
and how do things stand with the land surveying    i am not doing any such work  i am not being employed as a land surveyor   k
said  he was not really giving his mind to the matter  actually he was only yearning for burgel to fall asleep  but even this was only out of a certain sense of duty towards himself  in his heart of hearts he was sure that the moment when burgel would go to sleep was still infinitely remote  that is amazing   burgel said with a lively jerk of his head  and pulled a note pad out from under the quilt in order to make a note
 you are a land surveyor and have no land surveying to do   k
mechanically  he had stretched out his left arm along the top the bed post and laid his head on it  he had already tried various ways of making himself comfortable  but this position was th most comfortable of all  and now  too  he could attend a little better to what burgel was saying  i am prepared   burgel continued   to follow up this matter further with us here things are quite certainly not in such a way that an expert employee should be left unused
and it must after all be painful to you too
doesn t it cause you distress    it causes me distress   k
said slowly and smiled to himself  for just now it was not distressing him in the least besides  burgel s offer made little impression on him
it was utterly dilettante
without knowing anything of the circumstances under which k  s appointment had come about  of the difficulties that it encountered in the community and at the castle  of the complications that had already occurred during k  s sojourn here or had been foreshadowed  without knowing anything of all this  indeed without even showing  what should have been expected of a secretary as a matter of course  that he had at least an inkling of it all  he offered to settle the whole affair up there in no time at all with the aid of his little note pad  you seem to have had some disappointments   burgel said  by this remark showing that he had after all some knowledge of human nature  and indeed  since entering the room  k
had from time to time reminded himself not to underestimate burgel but in his state it was difficult to form a fair judgement of anything but his own weariness  no   burgel said  as if he were answering a thought of k  s and were considerately trying to save him the effort of formulating it aloud
 you must not let yourself be frightened off by disappointments
much here does seem to be arranged in such a way as to frighten people off  and when one is newly arrived here the obstacles do appear to be completely insurmountable
i don t want to inquire into what all this really amounts to  perhaps the appearance does really correspond to the reality  in my position i lack the right detachment to come to a conclusion about that  but pay attention  there are sometimes after all opportunities that are almost not in accord with the general situation  opportunities in which by means of a glance  a sign of trust  more can be achieved than by means of lifelong exhausting efforts
indeed  that is how it is
good  then again  of course  these opportunities are in accord with the general situation in so far as they are never made use of
but why then are they never made use of  i ask time and again   k
did not know why
he did certainly realize that what burgel was talking about probably concerned him closely  but he now felt a great dislike of everything that concerned him  he shifted his head a little to one side as though in this manner he were making way for burgel s questions and could no longer be touched by them
 it is   burgel continued  stretching his arms and yawning  which was in bewildering contradiction to the gravity of his words   it is a constant complaint of the secretaries that they are compelled to carry out most of the village interrogations by night but why do they complain of this  because it is too strenuous for them  because they would rather spend the night sleeping  no  that is certainly not what they complain of among the secretaries there are of course those who are hardworking and those who are less hard working  as everywhere
but none of them complains of excessive exertion  and least of all in public
that is simply not our way
in this respect we make no distinction between ordinary time and working time
such distinctions are alien to us
but what then have the secretaries got against the night interrogations  is it perhaps consideration for the applicants  no  no  it is not that either
where the applicants are concerned  the secretaries are ruthless  admittedly not a lot more ruthless than towards themselves  but merely precisely as ruthless actually this ruthlessness is  when you come to think of it  nothing but a rigid obedience to and execution of their duty  the greatest consideration that the applicants can really wish for
and this is at bottom   granted  a superficial observer does not notice this   completely recognized
indeed  it is  for instance in this case  precisely the night interrogations that are welcomed by the applicants  no objections in principle come in regarding the night interrogations
why nevertheless the secretaries  dislike   this k
did not know   he knew so little  he could not even distinguish where burgel was seriously or only apparently expecting an answer
 you let me lie down in your bed   he thought   i shall answer all your questions for you at noon to morrow or  better still tomorrow evening   but burgel did not seem to be paying attention to him  he was far too much occupied with the question that he had put to himself   so far as i can see and so far as my own experience takes me  the secretaries have the following qualms regarding the night interrogations  the night is suitable for negotiations with applicants for the reason that by night it is difficult or positively impossible completely to preserve the official character of the negotiations this is not a matter of externals  the forms can of course  if desired  be just as strictly observed by night as by day so it is not that  on the other hand the official power of judgement suffers at night
one tends involuntarily to judge things from a more private point of view at night  the allegations of the applicants take on more weight than is due to them  the judgement of the case becomes adulterated with quite irrelevant considerations of the rest of the applicants  situation  their sufferings and anxieties  the necessary barrier between the applicants and the officials  even though externally it may be impeccably maintained  weakens  and where otherwise  as is proper  only questions and answers are exchanged  what sometimes seems to take place is an odd  wholly unsuitable changing of places between the persons this at least is what the secretaries say  and they are of course the people who  through their vocation  are endowed with a quite extraordinary subtlety of feeling in such matters
but even they   and this has often been discussed hi our circles   notice little of those unfavourable influences during the night interrogations
on the contrary  they exert themselves right from the beginning to counteract them and end up by believing they have achieved quite particularly good results if  however  one reads the records through afterwards one is often amazed at their obvious and glaring weaknesses
and these are defects  and  what is more  ever and again mean half unjustified gains for the applicants  which at least according to our regulations cannot be repaired by the usual direct method
quite certainly they will at some later time be corrected by a control officer  but this will only profit the law  but will not be able to damage that applicant more
are the complaints of the secretaries under such circumstances not thoroughly justified   k had already spent a little while sunk in half sleep  but now he was roused again
 why all this  why all this   he wondered  and from under lowered eyelids considered burgel not like an official discussing difficult questions with him  but only like something that was preventing him from sleeping and whose further meaning he could not discover
but burgel  wholly abandoned to the pursuit of his thoughts  smiled  as though he had just succeeded in misleading k
a little
yet he was prepared to bring him back on to the right road immediately
 well   he said   on the other hand one cannot simply go and call these complaints quite justified  either
the night interrogations are  indeed  nowhere actually prescribed by the regulations  so one is not offending against any regulation if one tries to avoid them  but conditions  the excess of work  the way the officials are occupied in the castle  how indispensable they are  the regulation that the interrogation of applicants is to take place only after the final conclusion of all the rest of the investigation  but then instantly  all this and much else has after all made the night interrogations an indispensable necessity
but if now they have become a necessity   this is what i say   this is nevertheless also  at least indirectly  a result of the regulations  and to find fault with the nature of the night interrogations would then almost mean   i am  of course  exaggerating a little  and only since it is an exaggeration can i utter it  as such   would then indeed mean finding fault with the regulations
on the other hand it may be conceded to the secretaries that they should try as best they can to safeguard themselves  within the terms of the regulations  against the night interrogations and their perhaps only apparent disadvantages this is in fact what they do  and indeed to the greatest extent
they permit only subjects of negotiation from which there is in every sense as litde as possible to be feared  test themselves closely prior to negotiations and  if the result of the test demands it  even at the very last moment cancel all examinations  strengthen their hand by summoning an applicant often as many as ten times before really dealing with him  have a liking for sending away   to deputize for them colleagues who are not competent to deal with the given case and who can  therefore  handle it with greater ease  schedule the negotiations at least for the beginning or the end of the night  avoiding the middle hours  there ar many more such measures  the secretaries are not the people to let anyone get the better of them so easily  they are almost a resilient as they are vulnerable   k was asleep  it was not real sleep  he could hear burgel s words perhaps better than during his former dead tired state of waking  word after word struck his ear  but the tiresome consciousness had gone  he felt free it was no longer burgel who held him  only he still sometimes groped towards burgel  he was not yet in the depths of sleep but immersed in it he certainly was
no one should deprive him of that now
and it seemed to him as though with this he had achieved a great victory and already there was a party of people there to celebrate it  and he or perhaps someone else raised the champagne glass in honour of this victory
and so that all should know what it was all about the fight and the victory were repeated once again or perhaps not repeated at all  but only took place now and had already been celebrated earlier and there was no leaving off celebrating it  because fortunately the outcome was certain
a secretary  naked  very like the statue of a greek god  was hard pressed by k
in the fight
it was very funny and k
in his sleep smiled gently about how the secretary was time and again startled out of his proud attitude by k  s assaults and would hastily have to use his raised arm and clenched fist to cover unguarded parts of his body and yet was always too slow in doing so
the fight did not last long
step for step  and they were very big steps  k
advanced
was it a fight at all  there was no serious obstacle  only now and then a squeak from the secretary
this greek god squeaked like a girl being tickled
and finally he was gone  k
was alone in the large room  ready for battle he turned round  looking for his opponent
but there was no longer anyone there  the company had also scattered  only the champagne glass lay broken on the floor
k
trampled it to smithereens
but the splinters pricked him  with a start he woke once again  he felt sick  like a small child being woken up
nevertheless  at the sight of burgel s chest a thought that was part of his dream brushed his awareness   here you have your greek god  go on  haul him out of bed    there is  however   burgel said  his face thoughtfully tilted towards the ceiling  as though he were searching his memory for examples  but without being able to find any   there is however  nevertheless  in spite of all precautionary measures  a way in which it is possible for the applicants to exploit this nocturnal weakness of the secretaries   always assuming that it is a weakness   to their own advantage
admittedly  a very rare possibility  or  rather  one that almost never occurs
it consists in the applicant s coming unannounced in the middle of the night
you marvel  perhaps  that this  although it seems to be so obvious  should happen so very seldom well  yes  you are not familiar with conditions here
but even you must  i suppose  have been struck by the foolproofness of the official organization
now from this foolproofness it does result that everyone who has any petition or who must be interrogated in any matter for other reasons  instantly  without delay  usually indeed even before he has worked the matter out for himself  more  indeed  even before he himself knows of it  has already received the summons he is not yet questioned this time  usually not yet questioned  the matter has usually not yet reached that stage  but he has the summons  he can no longer come unannounced  at best he can come at the wrong time  well  then all that happens is that his attention is drawn to the date and the hour of the summons  and if he then comes back at the right time he is as a rule sent away  that no longer causes any difficulty
having the summons in the applicant s hand and the case noted in the files are  it is true  not always adequate  but  nevertheless  powerful defensive weapons for the secretaries
this refers admittedly only to the secretary in whose competence the matter happens to lie
it would still  of course  be open to everyone to approach the others in the night  taking them by surprise
yet this is something scarcely anyone will do  it is almost senseless
first of all it would mean greatly annoying the competent secretary
we secretaries are  it is true  by no means jealous of each other with regard to work  as everyone carries far too great a burden of work  a burden that is piled on him truly stint  but in dealing with the applicants we simply must not tolerate any interference with our sphere of competence
an applicant  one before now  has lost the game because  thinking he would not be making progress with the competent authority  he tried to slip through by approaching some other  one not competent
such attempts must  besides  fail also because of the fact that a non competent secretary  even when he is taken unawares at dead of night and has die best will to help  precisely as a consequence of his non competence can scarcely intervene any more effectively than the next best lawyer  indeed at bottom much less so  for what he lacks  of course   even if otherwise he could do something  since after all he knows the secret paths of the law better than all these legal gentry   concerning things with regard to which he is not competent  what he lacks is quite simply time  he hasn t a moment to spare for it
so who then  the prospects being such  would spend his nights playing the non competent secretary  indeed  the applicants are in any case fully occupied if  besides carrying out their normal duties  they wish to respond to the summonses and hints from the competent authorities   fully occupied  that is to say in the sense in which it concerns the applicants  which is  of course  far from being the same as  fully occupied  in the sense in which it concerns the secretaries   k
nodded  smiling  he believed he now understood everything perfectly
not because it concerned him  but because he was now convinced he would fall fast asleep in the next few minutes  this time without dreaming or being disturbed
between the competent secretaries on the one hand and the non competent on the other  and confronted with the crowd of fully occupied applicants  he would sink into deep sleep and in this way escape everything
burgel s quiet  self satisfied voice  which was obviously doing its best to put its owner to sleep  was something he had now become so used to that it would do more to put him to sleep than to disturb him
 clatter  mill  clatter on and on   he thought   you clatter just for me    where then  now   burgel said  fidgeting at his underlip with two fingers  with widened eyes  craning neck  rather as though after a strenuous long walk he were approaching a delightful view   where now is that previously mentioned  rare possibility that never occurs  the secret lies in the regulations regardjug competence
the fact is things are not so constituted  and so such a large living organization cannot be so constituted  that there is only one definite secretary competent to deal with each case
it is rather that one is competent above all others  but partly others are in certain respects  even though to a smaller degree   also competent
who  even if he were the hardest of workers  could keep together on his desk  single handed  all the aspects of even the most minor incident  even what i have been saying about the competence above all others is saying too much
for is not the whole competence contained even in the smallest  is not what is decisive here the passion with which the case is tackled  and is this not always the same  always present in full intensity  in all things there may be distinctions among the secretaries  and there are countless such distinctions  but not in the passion
none of them will be able to restrain himself if it is demanded of him that he shall concern himself with a case in regard to which he is competent if only in the smallest degree outwardly  indeed  an orderly mode of negotiation must be established  and so it comes about that a particular secretary comes into the foreground for each applicant  one they have  officially  to keep to
this  however  does not even need to be the one who is in the highest degree competent in regard to the case  what is decisive here is the organization and its particular needs of the moment
that is the general situation
and now  land surveyor  consider the possibility that through some circumstances or other  in spite of the obstacles already described to you  which are in general quite sufficient  an applicant does nevertheless  in the middle of the night  surprise a secretary who has a certain degree of competence with regard to the given case i dare say you have never thought of such a possibility  i am quite prepared to believe it
nor is it at all necessary to think of that for it does  after all  practically never occur
what sort of and quite specially constituted  small  skilful grain would an applicant have to be in order to slip through the incomparable sieve  you think it cannot happen at all  you are right  it cannot happen at all
but some night   for who can vouch for everything    it does happen
admittedly  i don t know anyone among my acquaintances to whom it has ever happened  well  it is true that proves very little  the circle of those acquaintances is restricted in comparison to the number involved here  and besides it is by no means certain that a secretary to whom such a thing has happened will admit it  since it is  after all  a very personal affair and one that in a sense gravely touches the official sense of shame
nevertheless my experience does perhaps prove that what we are concerned with is a matter so rare  actually only existing by way of rumour  not confirmed by anything else at all  that there is  therefore  really no need to be afraid of it
even if it were really to happen  one can   one would think   positively render it harmless by proving to it  which is very easy  that there is no room for it in this world
in any case it is morbid to be so afraid of it that one hides  say  under the quilt and does not dare to peep out
and even if this perfect improbability should suddenly have taken on shape  is then everything lost  on the contrary
that everything should be lost is yet more improbable than the most improbable thing itself
granted  if the applicant is actually in the room things are in a very bad way
it constricts the heart
 how long will you be able to put up resistance   one wonders
but it will be no resistance at all  one knows that
you must only picture the situation correctly
the never beheld  always expected applicant  truly thirstingly expected and always reasonably regarded as out of reach   there this applicant sits
by his mute presence  if by nothing else  he constitutes an invitation to penetrate into his poor life  to look around there as in one s own property and there to suffer with him under the weight of his futile demands
this invitation in the silent night is beguiling
one gives way to it  and now one has actually ceased to function in one s official capacity
it is a situation in which it very soon becomes impossible to refuse to do a favour
to put it precisely  one is desperate
to put it still more precisely  one is very happy for the defenceless position in which one sits here waiting for the applicant to utter his plea and knowing that once it is uttered one must grant it  even if  at least in so far as one has oneself a general view of the situation  it positively tears the official organization to shreds  this is  i suppose  the worst thing that can happen to one in the fulfilment of one s duties  above all   apart from everything else   because it is also a promotion  one surpassing all conceptions  that one here for the pioment usurps
for it is inherent in our position that we are not empowered to grant pleas such as that with which we are here concerned  yet through the proximity of this nocturnal applicant our official powers do in a manner of speaking grow  we pledge ourselves to do things that are outside our scope
indeed  we shall even fulfil our pledges
the applicant wrings from us in the night  as the robber does in the forest  sacrifices of which we should otherwise never be capable
well  all right  that is the way it is now when the applicant is still there  strengthening us and compelling us and spurring us on  and while everything is still half unconsciously under way
but how it will be afterwards  when it is all over  when  sated and carefree  the applicant leaves us and there we are  alone  defenceless in the face of our misuse of official power   that does not bear thinking of
nevertheless  we are happy
how suicidal happiness can be  we might  of course  exert ourselves to conceal the true position from the applicant
he himself will scarcely notice anything of his own accord he has  after all  in his own opinion probably only for some indifferent  accidental reasons  being overtired  disappointed  ruthless and indifferent from over fatigue and disappointment   pushed his way into a room other than the one he wanted to enter  he sits there in ignorance  occupied with his thoughts  if he is occupied at all  with his mistake or with his fatigue
could one not leave him in that situation  one cannot
with the loquacity of those who are happy one has to explain everything to him
without being able to spare oneself in the slightest one must show him in detail what has happened and for what reasons this has happened  how extraordinarily rare and how uniquely great the opportunity is  one must show how the applicant  though he has stumbled into this opportunity in utter helplessness such as no other being is capable of than precisely an applicant  can  however  now  if he wants to  land surveyor  dominate everything and to that end has to do nothing but in some way or other put forward his plea  for which fulfilment is already what which indeed it is already coming to meet  all this one tn show
it is the official s hour of travail
but when one has do even that  then  land surveyor  all that is essential has been done  then one must resign oneself and wait   k
was asleep  impervious to all that was happening  his head  which had at first been lying on his left arm on top of the bedpost  had slid down as he slept and now hung unsupported  slowly dropping lower
the support of the arm above was no longer sufficient
involuntarily k
provided himself with new support by planting his right hand firmly against the foot of the bed whereby he accidentally took hold of burgel s foot  which happened to be sticking up under the quilt burgel looked down and abandoned the foot to him  tiresome though this might be
now there came some vigorous knocking on the partition wall
k
started up and looked at the wall
 isn t the land surveyor there   a voice asked
 yes   burgel said  freed his foot from k  s hold and suddenly stretched wildly and wantonly like a little boy  then tell him it s high time for him to come over here   the voice continued
there was no consideration shown for burgel or for whether he might still require k  s presence
 it s erlanger   burgel said in a whisper  seeming not at all surprised that erlanger was in the next room
 go to him at once  he s already annoyed  try to conciliate him
he s a sound sleeper
but still  we have been talking too loudly
one cannot control oneself and one s voice when one is speaking of certain things
well  go along now  you don t seem able to shake yourself out of your sleep
go along  what are you still doing here  no  you don t need to apologize for being sleepy  why should you  one s physical energies last only to a certain limit
who can help the fact that precisely this limit is significant in other ways too  no  nobody can help it that is how the world itself corrects the deviations in its course and maintains the balance
this is indeed an excellent  time and again unimaginably excellent arrangement  even if in other respects dismal and cheerless
well  go along  i don t know why you look at me like that
if you delay much longer erlanger will be down on roe  and that is something i should very much like to avoid    go along now
who knows what awaits you over there  everything here is full of opportunities  after all
only there are  of course  opportunities that are  in a manner of speaking  too great to be   made use of  there are things that are wrecked on nothing but themselves yes  that is astonishing
for the rest  i hope i shall now be able to get to sleep for a while after all
of course  it is five o clock by now and the noise will soon be beginning
if you would only go   stunned by suddenly being woken up out of deep sleep  still boundlessly in need of sleep  his body aching all over from having been in such an uncomfortable position  k
could for a long time not bring himself to stand up  but held his forehead and looked down at his lap even burgel s continual dismissals would not have been able to make him go  it was only a sense of the utter uselessness of staying any longer in this room that slowly brought him to it
how indescribably dreary this room seemed to him
whether it had become so or had been so all the time  he did not know
here he would not even succeed in going to sleep again
this conviction was indeed the decisive factor
smiling a little at this  he rose supporting himself wherever he found any support  on the bed  on the wall  on the door  and  as though he had long ago taken leave of burgel  left without saying good bye problaly he would have walked past erlanger s room just as indifferently if erlanger had not been standing in the open door  beckoning to him
one short sign with the forefinger
erlanger was already completely dressed to go out  he wore a black fur coat with a tight collar buttoned up high
a servant was just handing him his gloves and was still holding a fur cap
 you should have come long ago   erlanger said
k
tried to apologize
wearily shutting his eyes  erlanger indkated that ne was not interested in hearing apologies
 the matter is as follows   he said
 formerly a certain frieda was employed in toe taproom
i only know her name  i don t know the girl herself  she is no concern of mine
this frieda sometimes served klamm with beer
now there seems to be another girl well  this change is  of course  probably of no importance anyone  and quite certainly of none to klamm
but the bigger a job is  and klamm s job is  of course  the biggest  the less strength is left over for protecting oneself against the external world  and as a result any unimportant alteration in the most unimportant things can be a serious disturbance
the smallest alteration on the writing desk  the removal of a duty spot that has been there ever since anyone can remember  all this can be disturbing  and so  in the same way  can a new barmaid
well of course  all of this  even if it would disturb anyone else and in any given job  does not disturb klamm
that is quite out of the question
nevertheless we are obliged to keep such a watch over klamm s comfort that we remove even disturbances that are not such for him   and probably there are none whatsoever for him   if they strike us as being possible disturbances
it is not for his sake  it is not for the sake of his work  that we remove these disturbances  but for our sake  for the sake of our conscience and our peace of mind
for this reason this frieda must at once return to the taproom
perhaps she will be disturbing precisely through the fact of her return
well  then we shall send her away again  but  for the time being  she must return
you are living with her  as i am told  therefore arrange immediately for her return
in this no consideration can be given to personal feelings  that goes without saying  of course  hence i shall not enter into the least further discussion of the matter
i am already doing much more than is necessary if i mention that if you show yourself reliable in this trivial affair it may on some occasion be of use to you in improving your prospects
that is all i have to say to you   he gave k
a nod of dismissal  put on the fur cap handed to him by the servant  and  followed by the servant  went down the passage  rapidly  but limping a little
sometimes orders that were given here were very easy to carry out  but this case did not please k
not only because the order affected frieda and  though intended as an order  sounded to k
like scornful laughter  but above all because what it confronted k
with was the futility of all his endeavours and orders  the unfavourable and the favourable  disregarded him  and even the most favourable probably had an ultimate unfavourable core  but in any case they all disregarded him  and he was in much too lowly a position to be able to intervene or  far less  to silence them and to gain a hearing for his own voice
if erlanger waves you off  what are you going to do  and if he were not to wave you off  what could you say to him  true  k
remained aware that his weariness had to day done him more harm than all the unfavourableness of circumstances  but why could he  who had believed he could rely on his body and who would never have started out on his way without that conviction  why could he not endure a few bad nights and one sleepless night  why did he become so unmanageably tired precisely here where nobody was tired or  rather  where everyone was tired all the time  without this  however  doing any damage to the work  indeed  even seeming to promote it  the conclusion to be drawn from this was that this was in its way a quite different sort of fatigue from k  s here it was doubtless fatigue amid happy work  something that outwardly looked like fatigue and was actually indestructable repose  indestructable peace
if one is a little tired at noon  that is part of the happy natural course of the day
 for the gentlemen here it is always noon   k
said to himself and it was very much in keeping with this that now  at five o clock  things were beginning to stir everywhere on each side of the passage
this babel of voices in the rooms had something extremely merry about it once it sounded like the jubilation of children getting ready for a picnic  another time like daybreak in a hen roost  like the joy of being in complete accord with the awakening day
somewhere indeed a gentleman imitated the crowing of a cock
though the passage itself was still empty  the doors were already in motion  time and again one would be opened a little and quickly shut again  the passage buzzed with this opening and shutting of doors  now and then  too  in the space above the partition walls  which did not quite reach to the ceiling  k
saw towsled early morning heads appear and instantly vanish again
from far off there slowly came a little barrow pushed by a servant  containing files
a second servant walked beside it  with a catalogue in his hand  obviously comparing the numbers on the doors with those on the file
the little barrow stopped outside most of the doors  usually then  too  the door would open and the appropriate riles  sometimes  however  only a small sheet of paper   in such cases a little conversation came about between the room and the passage  probably the servant was being reproached   would be handed into the room
if the door remained shut  the files were carefully piled up on the threshold
in such cases it seemed to k
as though the movement of the doors round about did not diminish  even though there the files had already been distributed  but as though it were on the contrary increasing
perhaps the others were yearningly peering out at the files incomprehensibly left lying on the threshold  they could not understand how anyone should only need to open the door in order to gain possession of his files and yet should not do so
perhaps it was even possible that files that were never picked up at all might later be distributed among the other gentlemen  who were even now seeking to make sure  by frequent peering out  whether the files were still lying on the threshold and whether there was thus still hope for them
incidentally  these files that remained lying were for the most part particularly big bundles
and k
assumed that they had been temporarily left lying out of a certain desire to boast or out of malice or even out of justifiable pride that would be stimulating to colleagues
what strengthened him in this assumption was the fact that sometimes  always when he happened not to be looking  the bag  having been exposed to view for long enough  was suddenly and hastily pulled into the room and the door then remained as motionless as before  the doors round about then also became quiet again  disappointed or  it might be  content that this object of constant provocation had at last been removed  but then  however  they gradually came into motion again
k
considered all this not only with curiosity but also with sympathy
he almost enjoyed the feeling of being in the midst of this bustle  looked this way and that  following   even though at an appropriate distance   the servants  who  admittedly  had already more than once turned towards him with a severe glance  with lowered head and pursed lips  while he watched their work of distribution
the further it progressed the less smoothly it went  either the catalogue was not quite correct  of the files were not always clearly identifiable for the servants  or the gentlemen were raising objections for other reasons
at any rate it would happen that some of the distributions had to be withdrawn  then the little barrow moved back  and through the chink of the door negotiations were conducted about the return of files
these negotiations in themselves caused great difficulties  but it happened frequently enough that if it was a matter of return precisely those doors that had earlier on been in the most lively motion now remained inexorably shut  as though they did not wish to know anything more about the matter at all only then did the actual difficulties begin
he who believed he had a claim to the files became extremely impatient  made a great din inside his room  clapping his hands  stamping his feet  ever and again shouting a particular file number out into the passage through the chink of the door
then the little barrow was often left quite unattended
the one servant was busy trying to appease the impatient official  the other was outside the shut door battling for the return
both had a hard time of it
the impatient official was often made still more impatient by the attempts to appease him  he could no longer endure listening to the servant s empty words  he did not want consolation  he wanted files
such a gentleman once poured the contents of a whole wash basin through the gap at the top  on to the servant
but the other servant  obviously the higher in rank  was having a much harder time of it if the gentleman concerned at all deigned to enter into negotiations  there were matter of fact discussions during which the servant referred to his catalogue  the gentleman to his notes and to precisely those files that he was supposed to return  which for the time being  however  he clutched tightly in his hand  so that scarcely a corner of them remained visible to the servant s longing eyes
then  too  the servant would have to run back for fresh evidence to the little barrow  which had by itself rolled a little further along the slightly sloping passage  or he would have to go to the gentleman claiming the files and there report the objections raised by the gentleman now in possession  receiving in return fresh counter objections
such negotiations lasted a very long time sometimes agreement was reached  the gentleman would haps hand over part of the files or get other files as compensation  since all that had happened was that a mistake had been made
but it also happened sometimes that someone simply had to abandon all the files demanded  either because he had been driven into a corner by the servant s evidence or because he was tired of the prolonged bargaining  but then he did not give the files to the servant  but with sudden resolution flung them out into the passage  so that the strings came undone and the papers flew about and the servants had a great deal of trouble getting everything straight again
but all this was still relatively simple compared with what happened when the servant got no answer at all to his pleading for the return of the files
then he would stand outside the closed door  begging  imploring  citing his catalogue  referring to regulations  all in vain  no sound came from inside the room  and to go in without permission was obviously something the servant had no right to do
then even this excellent servant would sometimes lose his self control  he would go to his barrow  sit down on the files  wipe the sweat from his brow  and for a little while do nothing at all but sit there helplessly swinging his feet
all round there was very great interest in the affair  everywhere there was whispering going on  scarcely any door was quiet  and up above at the top of the partition wall faces queerly masked almost to the eyes with scarves and kerchiefs  though for the rest never for an instant remaining quiet in one place  watched all that was going on
in the midst of this unrest k
had been struck by the fact that burgel s door had remained shut the whole time and that the servant had already passed along this part of the passage  but no files had been allotted to burgel
perhaps he was still asleep  which would indeed  in all this din  have indicated that he was a very sound sleeper  but why had he not received any files  only very few rooms  and these probably unoccupied ones  had been passed over in this manner on the other hand there was already a new and particularly restless occupant of erlanger s room  erlanger must positively have been driven out in the night by him  this was not much in keeping with erlanger s cool  distant nature  but the fact that he had had to wait on the threshold for k
did after all indicate that it was so
ever and again k
would then soon return from all distracting observations to watching the servant
truly  what k
had otherwise been told about servants in general  about their slackness  their easy life  their arrogance  did not apply to this servant  there were doubtless exceptions among the servants too or  what was more probable  various groups among them  for here  as k 
noticed  there were many nuances of which he had up to now scarcely had as much as a glimpse
what he particularly liked was this servant s inexorability
in his struggle with these stubborn little rooms   to k it often seemed to be a struggle with the rooms  since he scarcely ever caught sight of the occupants   the servant never gave up his strength did sometimes fail   whose strength would not have failed    but he soon recovered  slipped down from the little barrow and  holding himself straight  clenching his teeth  returned to the attack against the door that had to be conquered and it would happen that he would be beaten back twice or three times  and that in a very simple way  solely by means of that confounded silence  and nevertheless was still not defeated
seeing that he could not achieve anything by frontal assault  he would try another method  for instance  if k
understood righdy  cunning
he would then seemingly abandon the door  so to speak allowing it to exhaust its own taciturnity  turned his attention to other doors  after a while returned  called the other servant  all this ostentatiously and noisily  and began piling up files on the threshold of the shut door  as though he had changed his mind  and as though there were no justification for taking anything away from this gentleman  but  on the contrary  something to be allotted to him
then he would walk on  still  however  keeping an eye on the door  and then when the gentleman  as usually happened  soon cautiously opened the door in order to pull the files inside  in a few leaps the servant was there  thrust his foot between the door and the doorpost  so forcing the gentleman at least to negotiate with him face to face  which then usually led after all to a more or less satisfactory result
and if this method was not successful or if at one door this seemed to him not the right approach  he would try another method
he would then transfer his attention to the gendeman who was claiming the files
then he pushed aside the other servant  who worked always only in a mechanical way  a fairly useless assistant to him  and himself began talking persuasively to the gentleman  whisperingly  furtively  pushing his head right round the door  probably making promises to him and assuring him that at the next distribution the other gentleman would be appropriately punished  at any rate he would often point towards the opponent s door and laugh  in as far as his fatigue allowed then  however  there were cases  one or two  when he did abandon all attempts  but even here k
believed that it was only an apparent abandonment or at least an abandonment for justifiable reasons  for he quietly walked on  tolerating  without glancing round  the din made by the wronged gentleman  only an occasional  more prolonged closing of the eyes indicating that the din was painful to him
yet then the gentleman would gradually quieten down  and just as a child s ceaseless crying gradually passes into ever less frequent single sobs  so it was also with his outcry
but even after it had become quite quiet there  there would  nevertheless  sometimes be a single cry or a rapid opening and slamming of that door
in any case it became apparent that here  too  the servant had probably acted in exactly the right way
finally there remained only one gentleman who would not quieten down  he would be silent for a long period  but only in order to gather strength  then he would burst out again  no less furiously than before
it was not quite clear why he shouted and complained in this way  perhaps it was not about the distribution of files at all
meanwhile the servant had finished his work
only one single file  actually only a little piece of paper  a leaf from a note pad  was left in the little barrow  through his helper s fault  and now they did not know whom to allot it to
 that might very well be my file   it flashed through k  s mind
the mayor had  after all  constantly spoken of this smallest of small cases
and  arbitrary and ridiculous though he himself at bottom regarded his assumption as being  k tried to get closer to the servant  who was thoughtfully glancing over the little piece of paper
this was not altogether easy  for the servant ill repaid k  s sympathy  even in the midst of his most strenuous work he had always still found time to look round at k   angrily or impatiently  with nervous jerks of his head
only now  after finishing the distribution  did he seem to have somewhat forgotten k   as indeed he had altogether become more indifferent  this being understandable as a result of his great exhaustion  nor did he give himself much trouble with the little piece of paper  perhaps not even reading it through  only pretending to do so  and although here in the passage he would probably have delighted any occupant of a room by allotting this piece of paper to him  he decided otherwise  he was now sick and tired of distributing things  with his forefinger on his lips he gave his companion a sign to be silent  tore   k was still far from having reached his side   the piece of paper into shreds and put the pieces into his pocket
it was probably the first irregularity that k
had seen in the working of the administration here  admittedly it was possible that he had misunderstood this too
and even if it was an irregularity  it was pardonable
under the conditions prevailing here the servant could not work unerringly  some time the accumulated annoyance  the accumulated uneasiness  must break out  and if it manifested itself only in the tearing up of a little piece of paper it was still comparatively innocent
for the yells of the gentleman who could not be quieted by any method were still resounding through the passage  and his colleagues  who in other respects did not adopt a very friendly attitude to each other  seemed to be wholly of one mind with respect to this uproar
it gradually began to seem as if the gentleman had taken on the task of making a noise for all those who simply by calling out to him and nodding their heads encouraged him to keep it up
but now the servant was no longer paying any further attention to the master  he had finished his job  he pointed to the handle of the little barrow  indicating that the other servant should take hold of it  and so they went away again as they had come  only more contentedly and so quickly that the little barrow bounced along ahead of them
only once did they start and glance back again  when the gentleman who was ceaselessly screaming and shouting  and outside whose door k
was now hanging about because he would have liked to discover what it really was that the gentleman wanted  evidently found shouting no longer adequate  probably had discovered the button of an electric bell and  doubtless enraptured at being relieved in this way  instead of shouting now began an uninterrupted ringing of the bell
hereupon a great muttering began in the other rooms  which seemed to indicate approval  the gentleman seemed to be doing something that all would have liked to do long ago and only for some unknown reason had had to leave undone was it perhaps attendance  perhaps frieda for whom the gentleman was ringing  if that was so  he could go on ringing for a long time
for frieda was busy wrapping jeremiah up in wet sheets  and even supposing he were well again by now  she had no time  for then she was in his arms but the ringing of the bell did instantly have an effect
even now the landlord of the herrenhof himself came hastening along from far off  dressed in black and buttoned up as always but it was as though he were forgetful of his dignity  he was in such a hurry
his arms were half outspread  just as if he had been called on account of some great disaster and were coming in order to take hold of it and instantly smother it against his chest  and at every little irregularity in the ringing he seemed briefly to leap into the air and hurry on faster still now his wife also appeared  a considerable distance behind him  she too running with outspread arms  but her steps were short and affected  and k thought to himself that she would come too late  the landlord would in the meantime have done all that was necessary and in order to make room for the landlord as he ran k
stood close back against the wall
but the landlord stopped straight in front of k   as though k
were his goal  and the next instant the landlady was there too  and both overwhelmed him with reproaches  which in the suddenness and surprise of it he did not understand  especially since the ringing of the gentleman s bell was also mixed up with it and other bells also began ringing  now no longer indicating a state of emergency  but only for fun and in excess of delight
because he was very much concerned to understand exactly what his fault was  k
was entirely in agreement with the landlord s taking him by the arm and walked away with him out of this uproar  which was continually increasing  for behind them   k
did not turn round at all  because the landlord  and even more  on the other side  the landlady  was talking to him urgently   the doors were now opening wide  the passage was becoming animated  traffic seemed to be beginning there as in a lively narrow little alley  the doors ahead of them were evidently waiting impatiently for k
to go past them at long last so that they could release the gentlemen  and in the midst of all this  pressed again and again  the bells kept on ringing as though celebrating a victory
now at last   they were by now again in the quiet white courtyard  where some sledges were waiting   k
gradually learnt what it was all about
neither the landlord nor the landlady could understand how k
could have dared to do such a thing
but what had he done  k
asked time and again  but for a long time could not get any answer because his guilt was all too much a matter of course to the two of them and hence it simply did not occur to them that he asked in good faith
only very slowly did k
realize how everything stood
he had had no right to be in the passage
in general it was at best the taproom  and this only by way of privilege and subject to revocation  to which he had entry
if he was summoned by one of the gentlemen  he had  of course  to appear in the place to which he was summoned  but had to remain always aware   surely he at least had some ordinary common sense    that he was in a place where he actually did not belong  a place whither he had only been summoned by one of the gentlemen  and that with extreme reluctance and only because it was necessitated by official business
it was up to him  therefore  to appear quickly  to submit to the interrogation  then  however  to disappear again  if possible even more quickly
had he then not had any feeling at all of the grave impropriety of being there in the passage  but if he had had it  how had he brought himself to roam about there like cattle at pasture  had he not been summoned to attend a night interrogation and did he not know why the night interrogations had been introduced  the night interrogations   and here k was given a new explanation of their meaning   had after all only the purpose of examining applicants
the sight of whom by day would be able to the gentlemen  and this quickly  at night  with the possibility of  immediately after the unendurable artificial interrogation  forgetting all the ugliness of it in sleep
k  s behaviour  however  had been a mockery of precautionary measures
even ghosts vanish towards morning  but k
had remained there  his hands in his pockets  as though he were expecting that  since he did not take himself off  the whole passage with all the rooms and gentlemen would take itself off and this   he could be sure of it   would quite certainly have happened if it had been in any way possible  for the delicacy of the gentlemen was limitless
none of them would drive k
away  or even say  what went after all without saying  that he should at long last go away
none of them would do that  although during the period of k  s presence they were probably trembling with agitation and the morning  their favourite time  was being ruined for them
instead of taking any steps against k   they preferred to suffer  in which  indeed  a certain part was probably played by the hope that k
would not be able to help gradually  at long last  coming to realize what was so glaringly obvious and  in accord with the gentlemen s anguish  would himself begin to suffer  to the point of unendurability  from his own standing there in the passage in the morning  visible to all  in that horribly unfitting manner a vain hope
they did not know or in their kindness and condescension did not want to admit there also existed hearts that were insensitive  hard  and not to be softened by any feeling of reverence
does not even the nocturnal moth  the poor creature  when day comes seek out a quiet cranny  flatten itself out there  only wishing it could vanish and being unhappy because it cannot  k
on the other hand planted himself precisely where he was most visible  and if by doing so he had been able to prevent day from breaking  he would have done so he could not prevent it  but  alas  he could delay it and make it more difficult
had he not watched the distribution of the files  something that nobody was allowed to watch except the people most closely involved
something that neither the landlord nor his wife had been allowed to see in their own house
something of which they had only heard tell and in allusions  as for instance to day from the servants
had he then not noticed under what difficulties the distribution of files had proceeded  something in itself incomprehensible  since after all each of the gentlemen served only the cause  never thinking of his personal advantage and hence being obliged to exert all his powers to seeing that the distribution of the files  this important  fundamental  preliminary work  should proceed quickly and easily and without any mistakes  and had k
then not been even remotely struck by the notion that the main cause of all the difficulties was the fact that the distribution had had to be carried out with the doors almost quite shut  without any chance of direct dealings between the gentlemen  who among each other naturally could come to an understanding in a twinkling  while the mediation through the servants inevitably dragged on almost for hours  never could function smoothly  and was a lasting torment to the gentlemen and the servants and would probably have damaging consequences in the later work  and why could the gentlemen not deal with each other  well  did k
still not understand  the like of it had never occurred in the experience of the landlady   and the landlord for his part confirmed this   and they had  after all  had to deal with many sorts of difficult people
things that in general one would not dare to mention in so many words one had to tell him frankly  for otherwise he would not understand the most essential things
well  then  since it had to be said  it was on his account  solely and exclusively on his account  that the gentlemen had not been able to come forth out of their rooms  since in the morning  so soon after having been asleep  they were too bashful  too vulnerable  to be able to expose themselves to the gaze of strangers they literally felt  however completely dressed they might be  too naked to show themselves it was admittedly difficult to say why they felt this shame  perhaps these everlasting workers felt shame merely because they had been asleep
but what perhaps made them feel even acuter shame than showing themselves was seeing strangers what they had successfully disposed of by means of the night interrogations  namely the sight of the applicants they found so hard to endure  they did not want now in the morning to have suddenly  without warning  in all its truth to nature  obtruding itself upon them all over again
that was the two gentlemen for the first time and had also had to answer their questions  into the bargain
everything  so far as he knew had worked out pretty well  but then that misfortune had occurred  which  after what had gone before  he could scarcely be blamed for
unfortunately only erlanger and burgel had realized what a condition he was in and they would certainly have looked after him and so prevented all the rest  but erlanger had had to go away immediately after the interrogation  evidently in order to drive up to the castle  and burgel  probably himself tired after that interrogation   and how then should k have been able to come out of it with his strength unimpaired    had gone to sleep and had indeed slept through the whole distribution of files
if k
had had a similar chance he would have been delighted to take it and would gladly have done without all the prohibited insight into what was going on there  and this all the more lightheartedly since in reality he had been quite incapable of seeing anything  for which reason even the most sensitive gentlemen could have shown themselves before him without embarrassment the mention of the two interrogations   particularly of that with erlanger   and the respect with which k
spoke of the gentlemen inclined the landlord favourably towards him
he seemed to be prepared to grant k  s request to be allowed to lay a board across the barrels and sleep there at least till dawn  but the landlady was markedly against it  twitching ineffectively here and there at her dress  the slovenly state of which she seemed only now to have noticed  she kept on shaking her head
a quarrel obviously of long standing with regard to the orderliness of the house was on the point of breaking out afresh
for k
in his fatigued state the talk between the couple took on exaggeratedly great significance
to be driven out from here again seemed to him to be a misfortune surpassing all that had happened to him hitherto
this must not be allowed to happen  even if the landlord and the landlady should unite against him
crumpled up on the barrel  he looked in eager expectancy at the two of them until the landlady  with her abnormal touchiness  which had long ago struck k   suddenly stepped aside and probably she had by now been discussing other things with the landlord  exclaimed   how he stares at me  do send him away now   but k   seizing the opportunity and now utterly  almost to the point of indifference  convinced that he would stay said   i m not looking at you  only at your dress    why my dress   the landlady asked agitatedly
k
shrugged his shoulders
 come on   the landlady said to the landlord
 don t you see he s drunk  the lout  leave him here to sleep it off   and she even ordered pepi  who on being called by her emerged out of the dark  towsled  tired  idly holding a broom in her hand  to throw k
some sort of a cushion
when k
woke up he at first thought he had hardly slept at all
the room was as empty and warm as before  all the walls in darkness  the one bulb over the beer taps extinguished  and outside the windows was the night
but when he stretched  and the cushion fell down and the bed and the barrels creaked  pepi instantly appeared  and now he learnt that it was already evening and that he had slept for well over twelve hours the landlady had asked after him several times during the day  and so had gerstacker  who had been waiting here in the dark  by the beer  while k
had been talking to the landlady in the morning  but then he had not dared to disturb k   had been here once in the meantime to see how k
was getting on  and finally  so at least it was alleged  frieda had also come and had stood for a moment beside k   yet she had scarcely come on k  s account but because she had had various things to make ready here  for in the evening she was to resume her old duties after all
 i suppose she doesn t like you any more   pepi asked  bringing coffee and cakes
but she no longer asked it maliciously  in her old way  but sadly  as though in the meantime she had come to know the malice of the world  compared with which all one s own malice fails and becomes senseless
she spoke to k
as to a fellow sufferer  and when he tasted the coffee and she thought she saw that it was not sweet enough for him  she ran and brought him the full sugar bowl
her sadness had  indeed  not prevented her from tricking herself out to day if anything even more than the last time
she wore an abundance of bows and ribbons plaited into her hair  along her forehead and on her temples the hair had been carefully curled with the tongs  and round her neck she had a little chain that hung down into the low cut opening of her blouse
when  in his contentment at having at last slept his fill and now being permitted to drink a good cup of coffee  k
furtively stretched his hand out towards one of the bows and tried to untie it  pepi said wearily   do leave me alone   and sat down beside him on a barrel and k
did not even need to ask her what was the matter  she at once began telling the story herself  rigidly staring into k  s coffeemug  as though she needed some distraction  even while she was talking  as though she could not quite abandon herself to her suffering even when she was discussing it  as that would be beyond her powers
first of all k
learnt that actually he was to blame for pepi s misfortunes  but that she did not bear him any grudge
and she nodded eagerly as she talked  in order to prevent k
from raising any objection
first he had taken frieda away from the taproom and thus made pepi s rise possible
there was nothing else that could be imagined that could have brought frieda to give up her situation  she sat tight there in the taproom like a spider in its web  with all the threads under her control  threads of which no one knew but she
it would have been quite impossible to winkle her out against her will  only love for some lowly person  that is to say  something that was not in keeping with her position  could drive her from her place
and pepi  had she ever thought of getting the situation for herself  she was a chambermaid  she had an insignificant situation with few prospects  she had dreams of a great future like any other girl  one can t stop oneself from having dreams  but she had never seriously thought of getting on in the world  she had resigned herself to staying in the job she had and now frieda suddenly vanished from the taproom  it had happened so suddenly that the landlord had not had a suitable substitute on hand at the moment  he had looked round and his glance had fallen on pepi  who had  admittedly  pushed herself forward in such a way as to be noticed
at that time she had loved k
as she had never loved anyone before
month after month she had been down there in her tiny dark room  prepared to spend years there  or  if the worst came to the worst  to spend her whole life here  ignored by everyone  and now suddenly k
had appeared  a hero  a rescuer of maidens in distress  and had opened up the way upstairs for her
admittedly he did not know anything about her  he had not done it for her sake  but that did not diminish her gratitude  in the night preceding her appointment   the appointment was not yet definite  but still  it was now very probable   she spent hours talking to him  whispering her thanks in his ear
and in her eyes it exalted what he had done still more that it should have been frieda  of all people  with whom he had burdened himself there was something incomprehensibly selfless in his making frieda his mistress in order to pave the way for pepi   frieda  a plain  oldish  skinny girl with short  thin hair  a deceitful girl into the bargain  always having some sort of secret  which was probably connected  after all  with her appearance
if her wretchedness was glaringly obvious in her face and figure  she must at least have other secrets that nobody could inquire into  for instance her alleged affair with klamm and even thoughts like the following had occurred to pepi at that time  is it possible that k
really loves frieda  isn t he deceiving himself or is he perhaps deceiving only frieda  and will perhaps the sole outcome of the whole thing after all be nothing but pepi s rise in the world  and will k then notice the mistake  or not want to cover it up any more  and no longer see frieda  but only pepi  which need not even be a crazy piece of conceit on pepi s part  for so far as frieda was concerned she was a match for her  one girl against another  which nobody would deny  and it had  after all  been primarily frieda s position and the glory that frieda had been able to invest it with that had dazzled k
at the moment
and so then pepi had dreamed that when she had the position k
would come to her  pleading  and she would then have the choice of either granting k  s plea and losing her situation or of rejecting him and rising further
and she had worked out for herself that she would renounce everything and lower herself to him and teach him what true love was  which he would never be able to learn from frieda and which was independent of her positions of honour in the world
but then everything turned out differently
and what was to blame for this  above all  k
and then  of course  frieda s artfulness
above all  k
for what was he after  what sort of strange person was he  what was he trying to get  what were these important things that kept him busy and made him forget what was nearest of all  best of all most beautiful of all  pepi was the sacrifice and everything was stupid and everything was lost
and anyone who had the strength to set fire to the whole herrenhof and burn it down  burn it to the ground  so that not a trace of it was left  burn it up like a piece of paper in the stove  he would to day be pepi s chosen love
well  so pepi came into the taproom  four days ago to day  shortly before lunch time
the work here was far from easy  it was almost killingly hard work  but there was a good deal to be got out of it too
even previously pepi had not lived only for the day  and even if she would never have aspired to this situation even in her wildest dreams  still  she had made plenty of observations  she knew what this situation involved  she had not taken on the situation without being prepared one could not take it on without being prepared  otherwise one lost it in the first few hours
particularly if one were to behave here the way the chambermaids did
as a chambermaid one did in time come to feel one was quite lost and forgotten
it was like working down a mine  at least that was the way it was in the secretaries  passage  for days on end there
except for a few daytime applicants who flitted in and out without daring to look up one didn t see a soul but two or three other chambermaids  and they were just as embittered
in the morning one wasn t allowed to leave the room at all  that was when the secretaries wished to be alone among themselves  their meals were brought to them from the kitchen by the men servants  the chambermaids usually had nothing to do with that  and during meal times  too  one was not allowed to show oneself in the passage it was only while the gentlemen were working that the chambermaids were allowed to do the rooms  but naturally not those that were occupied  only those that happened to be empty at the time  and the work had to be done quite quietly so that the gentlemen were not disturbed at their work but how was it possible to do the cleaning quietly when the gentlemen occupied their rooms for several days on end  and the men servants  dirty lot that they were  pottered about there into the bargain  and when the chambermaid was finally allowed to go into the room  it was in such a state that not even the flood could wash it clean  truly  they were exalted gentlemen  but one had to make a great effort to overcome one s disgust so as to be able to clean up after them it wasn t that the chambermaids had such a great amount of work  but it was pretty tough
and never a kind word  never anything but reproaches  in particular the following  which was the most tormenting and the most frequent  that files had got lost during the doing of the rooms in reality nothing ever got lost  every scrap of paper was handed over to the landlord  but in fact of course files did get lost  only it happened not to be the fault of the maids
and then commissions came  and the maids had to leave their rooms  and the members of the commission rummaged through the beds  the girls had no possessions  of course  their few things could be put in a basket  but still  the commission searched for hours all the same naturally they found nothing
how should files come to be there  what did the maids care about files  but the outcome was always the same  abuse and threats uttered by the disappointed commission and passed on by the landlord
and never any peace  neither by day nor by night  noise going on half through the night and noise again at the crack of dawn
if at least one didn t have to live in  but one had to  for it was the chambermaids  job to bring snacks from the kitchen as they might be ordered  in between times  particularly at night
always suddenly the first thumping on the chambermaids  door  the order being dictated  the running down to the kitchen  shaking the sleeping scullery lads  the setting down of the tray with the things ordered outside the chambermaids  door  from where the men servants fetched it how sad all that was but that was not the worst
the worst was when no order came  that was to say  when  at dead of night  when everyone ought to be asleep and most of them really were asleep at last  sometimes a tiptoeing around began outside the chambermaids  door
then the girls got out of bed   the bunks were on top of each other  for there was very little space there  the whole room the maids had being actually nothing more than a large cupboard with three shelves in it   listened at the door  knelt down  put their arms round each other in fear and whoever was tiptoeing outside the door could be heard all the time they would all be thankful if only he would come right in and be done with it  but nothing happened  nobody came in
and at the same time one had to admit to oneself that it need not necessarily be some danger threatening  perhaps it was only someone walking up and down outside the door  trying to make up his mind to order something  and then not being able to bring himself to it after all perhaps that was all it was  but perhaps it was something quite different
for really one didn t know the gentlemen at all  one had hardly set eyes on them
anyway  inside the room the maids were fainting in terror  and when at last it was quiet again outside they leant against the wall and had not enough strength left to get back into bed
this was the life that was waiting for pepi to return to it  this very evening she was to move back to her place in the maids  room
and why  because of k
and frieda
back again into that life she had scarcely escaped from  which she escaped from  it is true  with k  s help  but also  of course  through very great exertions of her own
for in that service there the girls neglected themselves  even those who were otherwise the most careful and tidy for whom should they smarten themselves  nobody saw them  at best the staff in the kitchen anyone for whom that was enough was welcome to smarten herself
but for the rest they were always in their little room or in the gentlemen s rooms  which it was madness and a waste so much as to set foot in with clean clodies on and always by artificial light and in that stuffy air   with the heating always on   and actually always tired
the one free afternoon in the week was best spent sleeping quietly and without fear in one of the cubby holes in the kitchen
so what should one smarten oneself up for  yes  one scarcely bothered to dress at all
and now pepi had suddenly been transferred to the taproom  where  if one wanted to maintain one s position there  exactly the opposite was necessary  where one was always in full view of people  and among them very observant gentlemen  used to the best of everything  and where one therefore always had to look as smart and pleasant as possible
well  that was a change
and pepi could say of herself that she had not failed to rise to the occasion
pepi was not worrying about how things would turn out later
she knew she had the abilities necessary in this situation  she was quite certain of it  she had this conviction even now and nobody could take it away from her  not even to day  on the day of her defeat
the only difficulty was how she was to stand the test in the very beginning  because she was  after all  only a poor chambermaid  with nothing to wear and no jewellery  and because the gentlemen had not the patience to wait and see how one would develop  but instantly  without transition  wanted a barmaid of the proper kind  or else they turned away
one would think they didn t expect so very much since  after all  frieda could satisfy them
but that was not right
pepi had often thought about this  she had  after all  often been together with frieda and had for a time even slept together with her
it wasn t easy to find frieda out  and anyone who was not very much on the look out   and which of the gentlemen was very much on the look out  after all    was at once misled by her
no one knew better than frieda herself how miserable her looks were  for instance when one saw her for the first time with her hair down  one clasped one s hands in pity  by rights a girl like that shouldn t even be a chambermaid
and she knew it  too  and many a night she had spent crying about it  pressing tight against pepi and laying pepi s hair round her own head
but when she was on duty all her doubts vanished  she thought herself better looking than anyone  and she had the knack of getting everyone to think the same
she knew what people were like  and really that was where her art lay
and she was quick with a lie  and cheated  so that people didn t have time to get a closer look at her
naturally that wouldn t do in the long run  people had eyes in their heads and sooner or later their eyes would tell them what to think
but the moment she noticed the danger of that she was ready with another method  recently  for instance  her affair with klamm
her affair with klamm  if you don t believe it  you can go and get proof
go to klamm and ask him
how cunning  how cunning
and if you don t happen to dare to go to klamm with an inquiry like that  and perhaps wouldn t be admitted to him with infinitely more important inquiries  and klamm is  in fact  completely inaccessible to you only to you and your sort  for frieda  for instance  pops in to see him whenever she likes   if that s how it is  you can still get proof of the thing  you only need to wait
after all  klamm won t be able to tolerate such a false rumour for long  he s certain to be very keen to know what stories go round about him in the taproom and in the public rooms  all this is of the greatest importance to him  and if it s wrong he will refute it at once but he doesn t refute it
well  then there is nothing to be refuted and it is sheer truth
what one sees  indeed  is only that frieda takes the beer into klamm s room and comes out again with the money
but what one doesn t see frieda tells one about  and one has to believe her
and she doesn t even tell it  after all  she s not going to let such secrets out
no  the secrets let themselves out wherever she goes and  since they have been let out once and for all  she herself  it is true  no longer shrinks from talking about them herself  but modestly  without asserting anything  only referring to what is generally known anyway not to everything
one thing  for instance  she does not speak of  namely that since she has been in the taproom klamm drinks less beer than formerly  not much less  but still perceptibly less beer  and there may indeed be various reasons for this  it may be that a period has come when klamm has less taste for beer or that it is frieda who causes him to forget about beer drinking
anyway  however amazing it may be  frieda is klamm s mistress
but how should the others not also admire what is good enough for klamm  and so  before anyone knows what is happening  frieda has turned into a great beauty  a girl of exactly the kind that the taproom needs
indeed  almost too beautiful  too powerful  even now the taproom is hardly good enough for her any more
and  in fact  it does strike people as odd that she is still in the taproom
being a barmaid is a great deal  and from that point of view the liaison with klamm seems very credible  but if the taproom girl has once become klamm s mistress  why docs he leave her in the taproom  and so long  why does he not take her up higher  one can tell people a thousand times that there is no contradiction here  that klamm has definite reasons for acting as he does  or that some day  perhaps even at any moment now  frieda s elevation will suddenly come about all this does not make much impression
people have definite notions and in the long run will not let themselves be distracted from them by any talk  however ingenious nobody any longer doubted that frieda was klamm s mistress  even those who obviously knew better were by now too tired to doubt it
 be klamm s mistress  and to hell with it   they thought   but if you are  we want to see signs of it in your getting on too   but one saw no signs of it and frieda stayed in the taproom as before and secretly was thoroughly glad that things remained the way they were
but she lost prestige with people  that  of course  she could not fail to notice  indeed she usually noticed things even before they existed
a really beautiful  lovable girl  once she has settled down in the taproom  does not need to display any arts
as long as she is beautiful  she will remain taproom maid  unless some particularly unfortunate accident occurs
but a girl like frieda must be continually worried about her situation  naturally she has enough sense not to show it  on the contrary  she is in the habit of complaining and cursing the situation
but in secret she keeps a weather eye open all the time
and so she saw how people were becoming indifferent  frieda s appearance on the scene was no longer anything that made it worth anyone s while even to glance up  not even the menservants bothered about her any more  they had enough sense to stick to olga and girls of that sort  from the landlord s behaviour  too  she noticed that she was becoming less and less indispensable  one could not go on for ever inventing new stories about klamm  everything has its limits  and so dear frieda decided to try something new
if anyone had only been capable of seeing through it immediately  pepi had sensed it  but unfortunately she had not seen through it
frieda decided to cause a scandal  she  klamm s mistress  throws herself away on the first comer  if possible on the lowest of the low
that will make a stir  that will keep people talking for a long time  and at last  at last  people will remember what it means to be klamm s mistress and what it means to throw away this honour in the rapture of a new love
the only difficulty was to find the suitable man with whom the clever game could be played
it must not be an acquaintance of frieda s  not even one of the men servants for he would probably have looked at her askance and have walked on  above all he would not have remained serious enough about it and for all her ready tongue it would have been impossible to spread the story that she  frieda  had been attacked by him  had not been able to defend herself against him and in an hour when she did not know what she was doing had submitted to him
and although it had to be one of the lowest of the low  it nevertheless had to be one of whom it could be made credible that in spite of his crude  coarse nature he longed for nobody but frieda herself and had no loftier desire than heavens above    to marry frieda
but although it had to be a common man  if possible even lower than a servant  much lower than a servant  yet it must be one on whose account one would not be laughed to scorn by every girl  one in whom another girl  a girl of sound judgement  might also at some time find something attractive
but where does one find such a man  another girl would probably have spent her whole life looking for him
frieda s luck brought the land surveyor into the taproom to her  perhaps on the very evening when the plan had come into her mind for the first time
the land surveyor  yes  what was k
thinking of  what special things had he in mind  was he going to achieve something special  a good appointment  a distinction  was he after something of that sort  well  then he ought to have set about things differendy from the very beginning
after all  he was a nonentity  it was heart rending to see his situation
he was a land surveyor  that was perhaps something  so he had learnt something  but if one didn t know what to do with it  then again it was nothing after all
and at the same time he made demands  without having the slightest backing  made demands not outright  but one noticed that he was making some sort of demands  and that was  after all  infuriating
did he know that even a chambermaid was lowering herself if she talked to him for any length of time  and with all these special demands he tumbled headlong into the most obvious trap on the very first evening
wasn t he ashamed of himself  what was it about frieda that he found so alluring  could she really appeal to him  that skinny  sallow thing  ah no  he didn t even look at her  she only had to tell him she was klamm s mistress  for him that was still a novelty  and so he was lost  but now she had to move out  now  of course  there was no longer any room for her in the herrenhof pepi saw her the very same morning before she moved out  the staff all came running up  after all  everyone was curious to see the sight
and so great was her power even then that she was pitied  she was pitied by everyone  even by her enemies
so correct did her calculations prove to be from the very start
having thrown herself away on such a man seemed incomprehensible to everyone and a blow of fate  the little kitchenmaids  who  of course  admire every barmaid  were inconsolable
even pepi was touched  not even she could remain quite unmoved  even though her attention was actually focused on something else
she was struck by how little sad frieda actually was
after all it was at bottom a dreadful misfortune that had come upon her  and indeed she was behaving as though she were very unhappy  but it was not enough  this acting could not deceive pepi
so what was it that was keeping her going  perhaps the happiness of her new love  well  this possibility could not be considered
but what else could it be  what gave her the strength to be as coolly pleasant as ever even to pepi  who was already regarded as her successor  pepi had not then had the time to think about it  she had had too much to do getting ready for the new job
she was probably to start on the job in a few hours and still had not had her hair done nicely  had no smart dress  no fine underclothes  no decent shoes
all this had to be procured in a few hours
if one could not equip oneself properly  then it was better to give up all thought of the situation  for then one was sure of losing it in the very first half hour
well  she succeeded partly
she had a special gift for hair dressing  once  indeed  the landlady had sent for her to do her hair  it was a matter of having a specially light hand  and she had it  of course  her abundant hair was the sort you could do anything you like with
there was help forthcoming in the matter of the dress too
her two colleagues kept faith with her  it was after all a sort of honour for them  too  if a girl out of their own group was chosen to be barmaid  and then later on  when she had come to power  pepi would have been able to provide them with many advantages
one of the girls had for a long time been keeping some expensive material  it was her treasure  she had often let the others admire it  doubtless dreaming of how some day she would make magnificent use of it and   this had been really very nice of her   now  when pepi needed it  she sacrificed it
and both girls had very willingly helped her with the sewing  if they had been sewing it for themselves they could not have been keener that was indeed a very merry  happy job of work
they sat  each on her bunk  one over the other  sewing and singing  and handed each other the finished parts and the accessories  up and down
when pepi thought of it  it made her heart ever heavier to think that it was all in vain and that she was going back to her friends with empty hands
what a misfortune and how frivolously brought about  above all by k
how pleased they had all been with the dress at that time  it seemed a pledge of success and when at the last moment it turned out that there was still room for another ribbon  the last doubt vanished
and was it not really beautiful  this dress  it was crumpled now and showed some spots  the fact was  pepi had no second dress  had to wear this one day and night  but it could still be seen how beautiful it was  not even that accursed barnabas woman could produce a better one
and that one could pull it tight and loosen it again as one liked  on top and at the bottom  so that although it was only one dress  it was so changeable   this was a particular advantage and was actually her invention
of course it wasn t so difficult to make clothes for her  pepi didn t boast of it  there it was   everything suited young  healthy girls
it was much harder to get hold of underclothing and boots  and here was where the failure actually began
here  too  her girl friends helped out as best they could  but they could not do much
it was  after all  only coarse underclothing that they got together and patched up  and instead of high heeled little boots she had to make do with slippers  of a kind one would rather hide than show
they comforted pepi
after all  frieda was not dressed so very beautifully either  and sometimes she went round looking so sluttish that the guests preferred to be served by the cellarmen rather than by her
this was in fact so  but frieda could afford to do that  she already enjoyed favour and prestige
when a lady for once makes an appearance looking besmirched and carelessly dressed  that is all the more alluring   but in the case of a novice like pepi  and besides  frieda could not dress well at all  she was simply devoid of all taste
if a person happened to have a sallow skin  then  of course  she must put up with it  but she needn t go around  like frieda  wearing a low cut cream blouse to go with it  so that one s eyes were dazzled by all that yellow
and even if it hadn t been for that  she was too mean to dress well
everything she earned  she hung on to  nobody knew what for
she didn t need any money in her job  she managed by means of lying and trickery  this was an example pepi did not want to and could not imitate  and that was why it was justifiable that she should smarten herself up like this in order to get herself thoroughly noticed right at the beginning
had she only been able to do it by stronger means  she would  in spite of all frieda s cunning  in spite of all k  s foolishness  have been victorious
after all  it started very well
the few tricks of the trade and things it was necessary to know she had found out about well beforehand
she was no sooner in the taproom than she was thoroughly at home there
nobody missed frieda at the job
it was only on the second day that some guests inquired what had become of frieda
no mistake was made  the landlord was satisfied  on the first day he had been so anxious that he spent all the time in the taproom  later he only came in now and then  finally  since the money in the till was correct   the takings were on the average even a little higher than in frieda s time   he left everything to pepi
she introduced innovations
frieda had even supervised the men servants  at least partly  particularly when anyone was looking  and this not out of keenness for the work  but out of meanness  out of a desire to dominate  out of fear of letting anyone else invade her rights  pepi on the other hand allotted this job entirely to the cellarmen  who  after all  are much better at it
in this way she had more time left for the private rooms  the guests got quick service  nevertheless she was able to chat for a moment with everyone  not like frieda  who allegedly reserved herself entirely for klamm and regarded every word every approach  on the part of anyone else as an insult to klamm this was  of course  quite clever of her  for  if for once she did allow anyone to get near her  it was an unheard of favour
pepi  however  hated such arts  and anyway they were no use at the beginning
pepi was kind to everyone and every  one requited with her kindness
all were visibly glad of the change
when the gentlemen  tired after their work  were at last free to sit down to their beer for a little while  one could positively transform them by a word  by a glance  by a shrug of the shoulders
so eagerly did all hands stroke pepi s curls that she had to do her hair again quite ten times a day  no one could resist the temptation offered by these curls and bows  not even k   who was otherwise so absent minded
so exciting days flew past  full of work  but successful
if only they had not flown past so quickly  if only there had been a little more of them  four days were too little even if one exerted oneself to the point of exhaustion  perhaps the fifth day would have been enough  but four days were too little
pepi had  admittedly  gained wellwishers and friends even in four days  if she had been able to trust all the glances she caught  when she came along with the beer mugs  she positively swam in a sea of friendliness  a clerk by the name of bartmeier was crazy about her  gave her this little chain and locket  putting his picture into the locket  which was  of course  brazen of him
this and other things had happened  but it had only been four days  in four days  if pepi set about it  frieda could be almost  but still not quite  forgotten
and yet she would have been forgotten  perhaps even sooner  had she not seen to it by means of her great scandal that she kept herself talked about  in this way she had become new to people  they might have liked to see her again simply for the sake of curiosity
what they had come to find boring to the point of disgust had  and this was the doing of the otherwise entirely uninteresting k   come to have charm for them again
of course they would not have given up pepi as long as she was there in front of them and exerting influence by her presence  but they were mostly elderly gentlemen  slow and heavy in their habits  it took some time for them to get used to a new barmaid  and however advantageous the exchange might be  it still took a few days  took a few days against the gentlemen s own will  only five days perhaps  but four days were not enough  in spite of everything pepi still counted only as the temporary barmaid
and then what was perhaps the greatest misfortune  in these four days  although he had been in the village during the first two  klamm did not come down into the saloon
had he come  that would have been pepi s most decisive test  a test  incidentally  that she was least afraid of  one to which she was more inclined to look forward
she would   though it is  of course  best not to touch on such things in words at all   not have become klamm s mistress  nor would she have promoted herself to that position by telling lies  but she would have been able to put the beer glass on the table at least as nicely as frieda  have said good day and good bye prettily without frieda s officiousness  and if klamm did look for anything in any girl s eyes at all  he would have found it to his entire satisfaction in pepi s eyes
but why did he not come  was it chance  that was what pepi had thought at the time  too
all those two days she had expected him at any moment  and in the night she waited too
 now klamm is coming   she kept on thinking  and dashed to and fro for no other reason than the restlessness of expectation and the desire to be the first to see him  immediately on his entry
this continual disappointment made her very tired
perhaps that was why she did not get so much as she could have got done
whenever she had a little time she crept up into the passage that the staff was strictly forbidden to enter  there she would squeeze into a recess and wait
 if only klamm would come now   she thought   if only i could take the gentleman out of his room and carry him down into the saloon on my arms i should not collapse under that burden  however great it might be   but he did not come
in that passage upstairs it was so quiet that one simply couldn t imagine it if one hadn t been there
it was so quiet that one couldn t stand being there for very long  the quietness drove one away
but over and over again  driven away ten times  ten times again pepi went up there
it was senseless  of course
if klamm wanted to come  he would come  but if he did not want to come  pepi would not lure him out  even if the beating of her heart half suffocated her there in the recess
it was senseless  but if he did not come  almost everything was senseless
and he did not come
to day pepi knew why klamm did not come
frieda would have found it wonderfully amusing if she had been able to see pepi up there in the passage  in the recess  both hands on her heart
klamm did not come down because frieda did not allow it
it was not by means of her pleading that she brought this about  her pleading did not penetrate to klamm
but   spider that she was   she had connections of which nobody knew
if pepi said something to a guest  she said it openly  the next table could hear it too
frieda had nothing to say  she put the beer on the table and went
there was only the rustling of her silk petticoat  the only thing on which she spent money
but if she did for once say something  then not openly  then she whispered it to the guest  bending low so that people at the next table pricked up their ears
what she said was probably quite trivial  but still  not always  she had connections  she supported the ones by means of the others  and if most of them foiled   who would keep on bothering about frieda    still  here and there one did hold firm
these connections she now began to exploit
k
gave her the chance to do this
instead of sitting with her and keeping a watch on her  he hardly stayed at home at all  wandering  having discussions here and there  paying attention to everything  only not to frieda  and finally  in order to give her still more freedom  he moved out of the bridge inn into the empty school
a very nice beginning for a honeymoon all this was
well  pepi was certainly the last person to reproach k
for not having been able to stand living with frieda
nobody could stand living with her
but why then did he not leave her entirely  why did he time and again return to her  why did he cause the impression  by his roaming about  that he was fighting for her cause  it really looked as though it were only through his contact with frieda that he had discovered what a nonentity he in fact was  that he wished to make himself worthy of frieda  wished to make his way up somehow  and for that reason was for the time being sacrificing her company in order to be able later to compensate himself at leisure for these hardships meanwhile frieda was not wasting her time  she sat tight in the school  where she had probably led k   and kept the herrenhof and k
under observation
she had excellent messengers at her disposal  k  s assistants  whom   one couldn t understand it  even if one knew k
one couldn t understand it   k
left entirely to her
she sent them to her old friends  reminded people of her existence  complained that she was kept a prisoner by a man like k   incited people against pepi  announced her imminent arrival  begged for help  implored them to betray nothing to klamm  behaved as if klamm s feelings had to be spared and as if for this reason he must on no account be allowed to come down into the taproom
what she represented to one as a way of sparing klamm s feelings she successfully turned to account where the landlord was concerned  drawing attention to the fact that klamm did not come any more
how could he come when downstairs there was only a pepi serving  true  it wasn t the landlord s fault  this pepi was after all the best substitute that could be found  only the substitute wasn t good enough  not even for a few days
all this activity of frieda s was something of which k
knew nothing  when he was not roaming about he was lying at her feet  without an inkling of it  while she counted the hours still keeping her from the taproom
but this running of errands was not the only thing the assistants did  they also served to make k
jealous  to keep him interested in frieda had known the assistants since her childhood  they certainly had no secrets from each other now  but in k  s honour they were beginning to have a yearning for each other  and for k
there arose the danger that it would turn out to be a great love
and k
did everything frieda wanted  even what was contradictory and senseless  he let himself be made jealous by the assistants  at the same time allowing all three to remain together while he went on his wanderings alone it was almost as though he were frieda s third assistant
and so  on the basis of her observations  frieda at last decided to make her great coup  she made up her mind to return
and it was really high time  it was admirable how frieda  the cunning creature  recognized and exploited this fact
this power of observation and this power of decision were frieda s inimitable art
if pepi had it  how different the course of her life would be
if frieda had stayed one or two days longer in the school  it would no longer be possible to drive pepi out  she would be barmaid once and for all  loved and supported by all  having earned enough money to replenish her scanty wardrobe in the most dazzling style  only one or two more days and klamm could not be kept out of the saloon by any intrigues any longer  would come  drink  feel comfortable and  if he noticed frieda s absence at all  would be highly satisfied with the change  only one or two more days and frieda  with her scandal  with her connections  with the assistants  with everything  would be utterly and completely forgotten  never would she come out into the open again
then perhaps she would be able to cling all the more tightly to k
and  assuming that she were capable of it  would really learn to love him  no  not that either
for it didn t take even k
more than one day to get tired of her  to recognize how infamously she was deceiving him  with everything  with her alleged beauty  her alleged constancy  and most of all with klamm s alleged love  it would only take him one day more  and no longer  to chase her out of the house  and together with her the whole dirty setup with the assistants
just think  it wouldn t take even k
any longer than that
and now  between these two dangers  when the grave was positively beginning to close over her   k
in his simplicity was still keeping the last narrow road open for her   she suddenly bolted
suddenly   hardly anyone expected such a thing  it was against nature suddenly it was she who drove away k   the man who still loved her and kept on pursuing her  and  aided by the pressure of her friends and the assistants  appeared to the landlord as the rescuer  as a result of the scandal associated with her much more alluring than formerly  demonstrably desired by the lowest as by the highest  yet having fallen a prey to the lowest only for a moment  soon rejecting him as was proper  and again inaccessible to him and to all others  as formerly
only that formerly all this was quite properly doubted  whereas now everyone was again convinced
so she came back  the landlord  with a sidelong glance at pepi  hesitated   should he sacrifice her  after she had proved her worth so well    but he was soon talked over  there was too much to be said for frieda  and above all  of course  she would bring klamm back to the saloon again
that is where we stand  this evening
pepi is not going to wait till frieda comes and makes a triumph out of taking over the job
she has already handed over the till to the landlady  she can go now
the bunk downstairs in the maids  room is waiting for her  she will come in  welcomed by the weeping girls  her friends  will tear the dress from her body  the ribbons from her hair  and stuff it all into a corner where it will be thoroughly hidden and won t be an unnecessary reminder of times better forgotten
then she will take the big pail and the broom  clench her teeth  and set to work
in the meantime  however  she had to tell k
everything so that he  who would not have realized this even now without help  might for once see clearly how horridly he had treated pepi and how unhappy he had made her
admittedly  he  too  had only been made use of and misused in all this
pepi had finished
taking a long breath  she wiped a few tears from her eyes and cheeks and then looked at k   nodding  as if meaning to say that at bottom what mattered was not her misfortune at all  she would bear it all right  for that she needed neither help nor comfort from anyone at all  least of all from k   even though she was so young she knew something about life  and her misfortune was only a confirmation of what she knew already  but what mattered was k   she had wanted to show him what he himself was like  even after the collapse of all her hopes she had thought it necessary to do that  what a wild imagination you have  pepi   k
said
 for it isn t true at all that you have discovered all these things only now
all this is  of course  nothing but dreams out of that dark  narrow room you chambermaids have downstairs  dreams that are in their place there  but which look odd here in the freedom of the taproom you couldn t maintain your position here with such ideas  that goes without saying
even your dress and your way of doing your hair  which you make such a boast of  are only freaks born of that darkness and those bunks in your room  there they are very beautiful  i am sure  but here everyone laughs at them  secretly or openly
and the rest of your story  so i have been misused and deceived  have i  no  my dear pepi  i have not been misused and deceived any more than you have
it is true  frieda has left me for the present or has  as you put it  run away with one of the assistants  you do see a glimmer of the truth  and it is really very improbable that she will ever become my wife  but it is utterly and completely untrue that i have grown tired of her and still less that i drove her out the very next day or that she deceived me  as other women perhaps deceive a man
you chambermaids are used to spying through keyholes  and from that you get this way of thinking  of drawing conclusions  as grand as they are false  about the whole situation from some little thing you really see
the consequence of this is that i  for instance  in this case know much less than you
i cannot explain by any means as exactly as you can why frieda left me
the most probable explanation seems to me to be that you have touched on but not elaborated  which is that i neglected her that is unfortunately true  i did neglect her  but there were special reasons for that  which have nothing to do with this discussion
i should be happy if she were to come back to me  but i should at once begin to neglect her all over again
this is how it is
while she was with me i was continually out on those wanderings that you make such a mock of
now that she is gone i am almost unemployed  am tired  have a yearning for a state of even more complete unemployment
have you no advice to give me  pepi    oh yes  i have   pepi said  suddenly becoming animated and seizing k
by the shoulders   we have both been deceived  let us stick together
come downstairs with me to the maids    so long as you complain about being deceived   k
said   i cannot come to an understanding with you
you are always claiming to have been deceived because you find it flattering and touching
but the truth is that you are not fitted for this job
how obvious your unfittedness must be when even i  who in your view know less about things than anyone can see that
you are a good girl  pepi
but it is not altogether easy to realize that  i for instance at first took you to be cruel and haughty  but you are not so  it is only this job that confuses you because you are not fitted for it  i am not going to say that the job is too grand for you
it is  after all not a very splendid job  perhaps  if one regards it closely  it is somewhat more honourable than your previous job  on the whole  however  the difference is not great  both are indeed so similar one can hardly distinguish between them
indeed  one might almost assert that being a chambermaid is preferable to the taproom  for there one is always among secretaries  here  on the other hand  even though one is allowed to serve the secretaries  chiefs in the private rooms  still  one also has to have a lot to do with quite common people  for instance with me actually i am not really supposed to sit about anywhere but right here in the taproom   and is it such a great and glorious honour to associate with me  well  it seems so to you  and perhaps you have your reasons for thinking so but precisely that makes you unfitted
it is a job like any other  but for you it is heaven  consequently you set about everything with exaggerated eagerness  trick yourself out as in your opinion the angels are tricked out   but in reality they are different   tremble for the job  feel you are constantly being persecuted  try by means of being excessively pleasant to win over everyone who in your opinion might be a support to you  but in this way bother them and repel them  for what they want at the inn is peace and quiet and not the barmaid s worries on top of their own
it is just possible that after frieda left none of the exalted guests really noticed the occurrence  but to day they know of it and are really longing for frieda  for frieda doubtless did manage everything quite differently
whatever she may be like otherwise and however much she valued her job  in her work she was greatly experienced  cool  and composed  you yourself stress that  though admittedly without learning anything from it
did you ever notice the way she looked at things  that was not merely a barmaid s way of looking at things  it was almost the way a landlady looks around
she saw everything  and every individual person into the bargain  and the glance that was left for each individual person was still intense enough to subdue him
what did it matter that she was perhaps a little skinny  a little oldish  that one could imagine cleaner hair  those are trifles compared with what she really had  and anyone whom these deficiencies disturbed would only have shown that he lacked any appreciation of greater things
one can certainly not charge klamm with that  and it is only the wrong point of view of a young  inexperienced girl that makes you unable to believe in klamm s love for frieda
klamm seems to you   and this rightly   to be out of reach  and that is why you believe frieda could not have got near to him either you are wrong
i should take frieda s own word for this  even if i had not infallible evidence for it
however incredible it seems to you and however little you can reconcile it with your notions of the world and officialdom and gentility and the effect a woman s beauty has  still  it is true  just as we are sitting here beside each other and i take your hand between my hands  so too  i dare say  and as though it were the most natural thing in the world  did klamm and frieda sit beside each other  and he came down of his own free will  indeed he came hurrying down  nobody was lurking in the passage waiting for him and neglecting the rest of the work  klamm had to bestir himself and come downstairs  and the faults in frieda s way of dressing  which would have horrified you  did not disturb him at all you won t believe her  and you don t know how you give yourself away by this  how precisely in this you show your lack of experience  even someone who knew nothing at all about the affair with klamm could not fail to see from her bearing that someone had moulded her  someone who was more than you and i and all the people in the village and that their conversations went beyond the jokes that are usual between customers and waitresses and which seem to be your aim in life
but i am doing you an injustice
you can see frieda s merits very well for yourself  you notice her power of observation  her resolution  her influence on people  only you do  of course  interpret it all wrongly  believing she turns everything self seekingly to account only for her own benefit and for evil purposes  or even as a weapon against you
no  pepi  even if she had such arrows  she could not shoot them at such short range
and self seeking  one might rather say that by sacrificing what she had and what she was entitled to expect she has given us both the opportunity to prove our worth in higher positions  but that we have both disappointed her and are positively forcing her to return here
i do not know whether it is like this  and my own guilt is by no means clear to me  only when i compare myself with you something of this kind dawns on me  it is as if we had both striven too intensely  too noisily  too childishly  with too little experience  to get something that for instance with frieda s calm and frieda s matter of factness can be got easily and without much ado
we have tried to get it by crying  by scratching  by tugging just as a child tugs at the tablecloth  gaining nothing  but only bringing all the splendid things down on the floor and putting them out of its reach for ever
i don t know whether it is like that  but what i am sure of is that it is more likely to be so than the way you describe it as being    oh well   pepi said   you are in love with frieda because she s run away from you  it isn t hard to be in love with her when she s not there
but let it be as you like  and even if you are right in everything  even in making me ridiculous  what are you going to do now  frieda has left you  neither according to my explanation nor according to your own have you any hope of her coming back to you  and even if she were to come back  you have to stay somewhere in the meantime  it is cold  and you have neither work nor a bed  come to us  you will like my girl friends  we shall make you comfortable  you will help us with our work  which is really too hard for girls to do all by themselves  we girls will not have to rely only on ourselves and won t be frightened any more in the night  come to us  my girl friends also know frieda  we shall tell you stories about her till you are sick and tired of it do come  we have pictures of frieda too and we ll show them to you
at that time frieda was more modest than she is to day  you will scarcely recognize her  only perhaps by her eyes  which even then had a suspicious  watchful expression
well now  are you coming    but is it permitted  only yesterday there was that great scandal because i was caught in your passage    because you were caught  but when you are with us you won t be caught
nobody will know about you  only the three of us
oh  it will be jolly
even now life there seems much more bearable to me than only a little while ago perhaps now i shall not lose so very much by having to go away from here
listen  even with only the three of us we were not bored  one has to sweeten the bitterness of one s life  it s made bitter for us when we re still young  well  the three of us stick together  we live as nicely as is possible there  you ll like henriette particularly  but you ll like emilie too  i ve told them about you  there one listens to such tales without believing them  as though outside the room nothing could really happen  it s warm and snug and tight there  and we press together still more tightly
no  although we have only each other to rely on  we have not become tired of each other
on the contrary  when i think of my girl friends  i am almost glad that i am going back
why should i get on better than they do  for that was just what held us together  the fact that the future was barred to all three of us in the same way  and now i have broken through after all and was separated from them
of course i have not forgotten them  and my first concern was how i could do something for them
my own position was still insecure   how insecure it was  i did not even realize   and i was already talking to the landlord about henriette and emilie
so far as henriette was concerned the landlord was not quite unrelenting  but for emilie  it must be confessed  who is much older than we are  she s about as old as frieda  he gave me no hope
but only think  they don t want to go away  they know it s a miserable life they lead there  but they have resigned themselves to it  good souls  i think their tears as we said goodbye were mostly because they were sad about my having to leave our common room  going out into the cold   to us there everything seems cold that is outside the room   and having to make my way in the big strange rooms with big strange people  for no other purpose than to earn a living  which after all i had managed to do up to now in the life we led together they probably won t be at all surprised when now i come back  and only in order to indulge me will they weep a little and bemoan my fate
but then they will see you and notice that it was a good thing after all that i went away
it will make them happy that now we have a man as a helper and protector  and they will be absolutely delighted that it must all be kept a secret and that through this secret we shall be still more tightly linked with each other than before
come  oh please come to us  no obligation will arise so far as you are concerned  you will not be bound to our room for ever  as we are
when the spring comes and you find a lodging somewhere else and if you don t like being with us any more  then you can go if you want to
only  of course  you must keep the secret even then and not go and betray us  for that would mean our last hour in the herrenhof had come  and in other respects too  naturally  you must be careful when you are with us  not showing yourself anywhere unless we regard it as safe  and altogether take our advice
that is the only thing that ties you  and this must count just as much with you as with us  but otherwise you are completely free  the work we shall share out to you will not be too hard  you needn t be afraid of that
well then  are you coming    how much longer is it till spring   k
asked
 till spring   pepi repeated
 winter is long here  a very long winter  and monotonous
but we don t complain about that down there  we are safe from the winter
well yes  some day spring comes too  and summer  and there s a time for that too  i suppose
but in memory  now  spring and summer seem as short as though they didn t last much longer than two days  and even on those days  even during the most beautiful day  even then sometimes snow falls   at this moment the door opened
pepi started  in her thoughts she had gone too far away from the taproom  but it was not frieda  it was the landlady
she pretended to be amazed at finding k
still here
k
excused himself by saying that he had been waiting for her  and at the same time he expressed his thanks for having been allowed to stay here overnight the landlady could not understand why k
had been waiting for her
k
said he had had the impression that she wanted to speak to him again  he apologized if that had been a mistake  and for the rest he must go now anyway  he had left the school  where he was a caretaker  to itself much  too long  yesterday s summons was to blame for everything  he still had too little experience of these matters  it would certainly not happen again that he would cause the landlady such inconvenience and bother as yesterday
and he bowed  on the point of going
the landlady looked at him as though she were dreaming
this gaze kept k
longer than was his intention
now she smiled a little  and it was only the amazement on k  s face that  as it were  woke her up
it was as though she had been expecting an answer to her smile and only now  since none came  did she wake up
 yesterday  i think  you had the impudence to say something about my dress   k
could not remember
 you can t remember  then it s not only impudence  but afterwards cowardice into the bargain   by way of excuse k
spoke of his fatigue of the previous day  saying it was quite possible that he had talked some nonsense  in any case he could not remember now
and what could he have said about the landlady s clothes  that they were more beautiful than any he had ever seen in his life
at least he had never seen any landlady at her work in such clothes
 that s enough of these remarks   the landlady said swiftly
 i don t want to hear another word from you about my clothes
my clothes are none of your business
once and for all  i forbid you to talk about them   k
bowed again and went to the door
 what do you mean   the landlady shouted after him   by saying you ve never before seen any landlady at work in such clothes  what do you mean by making such senseless remarks  it s simply quite senseless
what do you mean by it   k
turned round and begged the landlady not to get excited
of course the remark was senseless
after all  he knew nothing at all about clothes
in his situation any dress that happened to be clean and not patched seemed luxurious
he had only been amazed at the landlady s appearing there  in the passage  at night  among all those scantily dressed men  in such a beautiful evening dress  that was all
 well now   the landlady said   at last you seem to have remembered the remark you made yesterday  after all
and you put the finishing touch to it by some more nonsense
it s quite true you don t know anything about clothes
but then kindly refrain   this is a serious request i make to you   from setting yourself up as a judge of what are luxurious dresses or unsuitable evening dresses  and the like   
and let me tell you   here it seemed as if a cold shudder went through her    you ve no business to interfere with my clothes in any way at all  do you hear   and as k
was about to turn away again in silence  she asked   where did you get your knowledge of clothes  anyway   k
shrugged his shoulders  saying he had no knowledge
 you have none   the landlady said
 very well then  don t set up to have any  either
come over to the office  i ll show you something  then i hope you ll stop your impudent remarks for good   she went through the door ahead of him
pepi rushed forward to k   on the pretext of settling the bill
they quickly made their plans  it was very easy  since k
knew the courtyard with the gate opening into the side street  beside the gate there was a little door behind which pepi would stand in about an hour and open it on hearing a threefold knock
the private office was opposite the taproom  they only had to cross the hall  the landlady was already standing in the lighted office and impatiently looking towards k
but there was yet another disturbance
gerstacker had been waiting in the hall and wanted to talk to k
it was not easy to shake him off  the landlady also joined in and rebuked gerstacker for his intrusiveness
 where are you going  where are you going   gerstacker could still be heard calling out even after the door was shut  and the words were unpleasantly interspersed with sighs and coughs
it was a small  over heated room
against the end walls were a standing desk and an iron safe  against the side walls were a wardrobe and an ottoman
it was the wardrobe that took up most room
not only did it occupy the whole of the longer wall  its depth also made the room very narrow  it had three slidingdoors by which it could be opened completely
the landlady pointed to the ottoman  indicating that k
should sit down  she herself sat down on the revolving chair at the desk
 didn t you once learn tailoring   the landlady asked
 no  never   k
said
 what actually is it you are    land surveyor    what is that   k
explained  the explanation made her yawn
 you re not telling the truth
why won t you tell the truth    you don t tell the truth either    i  so now you re beginning your impudent remarks again  and if i didn t tell the truth   do i have to answer for it to you  and in what way don t i tell the truth then    you are not only a landlady  as you pretend    just listen to that  all the things you discover  what else am i then  but i must say  your impudence is getting thoroughly out of hand    i don t know what else you are
i only see that you are a landlady and also wear clothes that are not suitable for a landlady and of a kind that to the best of my knowledge nobody else wears here in the village    well  now we re getting to the point
the fact is you can t keep it to yourself  perhaps you aren t impudent at all  you re only like a child that knows some silly thing or other and which simply can t  by any means  be made to keep it to itself
well  speak up  what is so special about these clothes    you ll be angry if i say    no  i shall laugh about it  it ll be some childish chatter
what sort of clothes are they then    you insist on hearing
well  they re made of good material  pretty expensive  but they are old fashioned  fussy  often renovated  worn  and not suitable either for your age or for your figure or for your position
i was struck by them the very first time i saw you  it was about a week ago  here in the hall    so there now we have it  they are old fashioned  fussy  and what else did you say  and what enables you to judge all this    i can see for myself  one doesn t need any training for that     you can see it without more ado
you don t have to inquire anywhere  you know at once what is required by fashion
so you re going to be quite indispensable to me  for i must admit i have a weakness for beautiful clothes
and what will you say when i tell you that this wardrobe is full of dresses   she pushed the sliding doors open  one dress could be seen tightly packed against the next  filling up the whole length and breadth of the wardrobe  they were mostly dark  grey  brown  black dresses  all carefully hung up and spread out
 these are my dresses  all old fashioned  fussy  as you think
but they are only the dresses for which i have no room upstairs in my room  there i have two more wardrobes full  two wardrobes  each of them almost as big as this one
are you amazed    no
i was expecting something of the sort
didn t i say you re not only a landlady  you re aiming at something else    i am only aiming at dressing beautifully  and you are either a fool or a child or a very wicked  dangerous person
go  go away now   k
was already in the hall and gerstacker was clutching at his sleeve again  when the landlady shouted after him   i am getting a new dress to morrow  perhaps i shall send for you
