arrest conversation with mrs grubach then miss bürstner someone must have been telling lies about josef k   he knew he had done nothing wrong but  one morning  he was arrested every day at eight in the morning he was brought his breakfast by mrs grubach s cook mrs grubach was his landlady but today she didn t come that had never happened before k
waited a little while  looked from his pillow at the old woman who lived opposite and who was watching him with an inquisitiveness quite unusual for her  and finally  both hungry and disconcerted  rang the bell
there was immediately a knock at the door and a man was slim but firmly built  his clothes were black and closefitting  with many folds and pockets  buckles and buttons and a belt  all of which gave the impression of being very in his bed
the man  however  ignored the question as if his arrival simply had to be accepted  and merely replied   you free ebooks at planet ebook com  rang    anna should have brought me my breakfast   said silence  just through observation and by thinking about it  but the man didn t stay still to be looked at for very long
instead he went over to the door  opened it slightly  and said to someone who was clearly standing immediately behind it   he wants anna to bring him his breakfast   there was a little laughter in the neighbouring room  it was not clear from the sound of it whether there were several people laughing
the strange man could not have learned anything from it that he hadn t known already  but now he said to k   as if making his report  it is not possible    it would be the first time that s happened   said k   as he jumped out of bed and quickly pulled on his trousers
 i want to see who that is in the next room  and why it is that mrs grubach has let me be disturbed in this way   it immediately occurred to him that he needn t have said this out loud  and that he must to some extent have acknowledged their authority by doing so  but that didn t seem important to him at the time that  at least  is how the stranger took it  as he said   don t you think you d better stay where you are    i want neither to stay here nor to be spoken to by you until you ve introduced yourself    i meant it for your own good   said the stranger and opened the door  this time without being asked
the next with furniture  tablecloths  porcelain and photographs
perhaps there was a little more space in there than usual  the trial today  but if so it was not immediately obvious  especially as the main difference was the presence of a man sitting by the open window with a book from which he now looked up
 you should have stayed in your room  didn t franz tell you    and what is it you want  then   said k   looking back and forth between this new acquaintance and the one named franz  who had remained in the doorway
through the open window he noticed the old woman again  who had come close to the window opposite so that she could continue to see everything
she was showing an inquisitiveness that really made it seem like she was going senile
 i want to see mrs grubach …    said k   making a movement as if tearing himself away from the two men even though they were standing well away from him and wanted to go  no   said the man at the window  who threw his book down on a coffee table and stood up  you can t go away when you re under arrest    that s how it seems   said k  and why am i under arrest   he then asked
 that s something we re not allowed to tell you
go into your room and wait there
proceedings are underway and you ll learn about everything all in good time
it s not really part of my job to be friendly towards you like this  but i hope no one  apart from franz  will hear about it  and he s been more friendly towards you than he should have been  under the rules  himself if you carry on having as much good luck as you have been with your arresting officers then you can reckon on things going well with you   k
wanted to sit down  but then he saw that  apart from the chair by the window  there was nowhere anywhere in the room where he could sit
 you ll free ebooks at planet ebook com  get the chance to see for yourself how true all this is   said franz and both men then walked up to k
they were significantly bigger than him  especially the second man  who frequently slapped him on the shoulder
the two of them felt k  s nightshirt  and said he would now have to wear one that was of much lower quality  but that they would keep the nightshirt along with his other underclothes and return them to him if his case turned out well
 it s better for you if you give us the things than if you leave them in the storeroom   they said
 things have a tendency to go missing in the storeroom  and after a certain amount of time they sell things off  whether the case involved has come to an end or not
and cases like this can last a long time  especially the ones that have been coming up lately
they d give you the money they got for them  but it wouldn t be very much as it s not what they re offered for them when they sell them that counts  it s how much they get slipped on the side  and things like that lose their value anyway when they get passed on from hand to hand  year after year   k
paid hardly any attention to what they were saying  he did not place much value on what he may have still possessed or on who decided what happened to them
it was much more important to him to get a clear understanding of his position  but he could not think clearly while these people were here  the second policeman s belly and they could only be policemen looked friendly enough  sticking out towards him  but when k
looked up and saw his dry  boney face it did not seem to fit with the body
his strong nose twisted to one side as if ignoring k
and sharing an understanding with the other  the trial policeman
what sort of people were these  what were they talking about  what office did they belong to  k
was living in a free country  after all  everywhere was at peace  all laws were decent and were upheld  who was it who dared accost him in his own home  he was always inclined to take life as lightly as he could  to cross bridges when he came to them  pay no heed for the future  even when everything seemed under threat
but here that did not seem the right thing to do
he could have taken it all as a joke  a big joke set up by his colleagues at the bank for some unknown reason  or also perhaps because today was his thirtieth birthday  it was all possible of course  maybe all he had to do was laugh in the policemen s face in some way and they would laugh with him  maybe they were tradesmen from the corner of the street  they looked like they might be but he was nonetheless determined  ever since he first caught sight of the one called franz  not to lose any slight advantage he might have had over these people
there was a very slight risk that people would later say he couldn t understand a joke  but although he wasn t normally in the habit of learning from experience he might also have had a few unimportant occasions in mind when  unlike his more cautious friends  he he still had time
 allow me   he said  and hurried between the two policemen through into his room
 he seems sensible enough   he heard them say behind him once in free ebooks at planet ebook com  his room  he quickly pulled open the drawer of his writing desk  everything in it was very tidy but in his agitation he was unable to find the identification documents he was looking for straight away
he finally found his bicycle permit and was about to go back to the policemen with it when it seemed to him too petty  so he carried on searching until he found his birth certificate
just as he got back in the adjoining room the door on the other side opened and mrs for as soon as she recognised k she was clearly embarrassed  asked for forgiveness and disappeared  closing the door behind her very carefully
 do come in   k
could have said just then
but now he stood in the middle of the room with his papers in his hand and still looking at the door which did not open again
he stayed like that until he was startled out of it by the shout of the policeman who sat at the little table at the open window and  as k
now saw  was eating his breakfast
 why didn t she come in   he asked
 she s not allowed to   said the big policeman
 you re under arrest  aren t you    but how can i be under arrest  and how come it s like this    now you re starting again   said the policeman  dipping a piece of buttered bread in the honeypot
 we don t answer questions like that    you will have to answer them   said k
 here are my identification papers  now show me yours and i certainly want to see the arrest warrant    oh  my god   said the policeman
 in a position like yours  and you think you can start giving orders  do you  it won t do you any good to get us on the wrong side  even if you think it will we re probably more on your side  the trial that anyone else you know    that s true  you know  you d better believe it   said franz  holding a cup of coffee in his hand which he did not lift to his mouth but looked at k
in a way that was probably meant to be full of meaning but slapped his hand down on his papers and said   here are my identity documents    and what do you want us to do about it   replied the big policeman  loudly
 the way you re carrying on  it s worse than a child
what is it you want  do you want to get this great  bloody trial of yours over with quickly by talking about id and arrest warrants with us  we re just coppers  that s all we are
junior officers like us hardly know one end of an id card from another  all we ve got to do with you is keep an eye on you for ten hours a day and get paid for it
that s all we are
mind you  what we can do is make sure that the high officials we work for find out just what sort of person it is they re going to arrest  and why he should be arrested  before they issue the warrant
there s no mistake there
our authorities as far as i know  and i only know the lowest grades  don t go out looking for guilt among the public  it s the guilt that draws them out  like it says in the law  and they have to send us police officers out
that s the law
where d you think there d be any mistake there    i don t know this law   said k
 so much the worse for you  then   said the policeman
 it s probably exists only in your heads   said k   he wanted  in some way  to insinuate his way into the thoughts of the policemen  to re shape those thoughts to his benefit or to make free ebooks at planet ebook com  himself at home there but the policeman just said dismissively   you ll find out when it affects you   franz joined in  and said   look at this  willem  he admits he doesn t know the law and at the same time insists he s innocent    you re quite right  but we can t get him to understand a thing   said the other
k
stopped talking with them  do i  he thought to himself  do i really have to carry on getting tangled up with the chattering of base functionaries like this  and they admit themselves that they are of the lowest position they re talking about things of which they don t have the slightest understanding  anyway
it s only because of their stupidity that they re able to be so sure of themselves i just need few words with someone of the same social standing as myself and everything will be incomparably clearer  much clearer than a long conversation with these two can make it
he walked up and down the free space in the room a couple of times  across the street he could see the old woman who  now  had pulled an old man  much older than herself  up to the window and had her arms around him k
had to put an end to this display   take me to your superior   he said
 as soon as he wants to see you
not before   said the policeman  the one called willem
 and now my advice to you   he added   is to go into your room  stay calm  and wait and see what s to be done with you
if you take our advice  you won t tire yourself out thinking about things to no purpose  you need to pull yourself together as there s a lot that s going to required of you
you ve not behaved towards us the way we deserve after being so good to you  you forget that we  whatever we are  we re still free men and you re not  and 10 the trial that s quite an advantage
but in spite of all that we re still willing  if you ve got the money  to go and get you some breakfast from the cafž over the road   without giving any answer to this offer  k
stood still for some time
perhaps  if he opened the door of the next room or even the front door  the two of them would not dare to stand in his way  perhaps that would be the simplest way to settle the whole thing  by bringing it to a head
but maybe they would grab him  and if he were thrown down on the ground he would lose all the advantage he  in a certain respect  had over them
so he decided on the more certain solution  the way things would go in the natural course of events  and went back in his room without another word either from him or from the policemen
he threw himself down on his bed  and from the dressing table he took the nice apple that he had put there the previous evening for his breakfast now it was all the breakfast he had and anyway  as he confirmed as soon as he took his first  big bite of it  it was far better than a breakfast he could have had through the good will of the policemen from the dirty cafž
he felt well and confident  he had failed to go into work at the bank this morning but that could easily be excused because of the relatively high position he held there
should he really send in his explanation  he wondered about it
if nobody believed him  and in this case that would be understandable  he could bring mrs grubach in as a witness  or even the old pair from across the street  who probably even now were on their way over to the window opposite it puzzled k   at least it puzzled him looking at it free ebooks at planet ebook com 11 from the policemen s point of view  that they had made him go into the room and left him alone there  where he had ten different ways of killing himself at the same time  though  he asked himself  this time looking at it from his own point of view  what reason he could have to do so because those two were sitting there in the next room and had taken his breakfast  perhaps  it would have been so pointless to kill himself that  even if he had wanted to  the pointlessness would have made him unable maybe  if the policemen had not been so obviously limited in their mental abilities  it could have been supposed that they had come to the same conclusion and saw no danger in leaving him alone because of it
they could watch now  if they wanted  and see how he went over to the cupboard in the wall where he kept a bottle of good schnapps  how he first emptied a glass of it in place of his breakfast and how he then took a second glassful in order to give himself courage  the last one just as a precaution for the unlikely chance it would be needed then he was so startled by a shout to him from the other room that he struck his teeth against the glass
 the supervisor wants to see you   a voice said
it was only the shout that startled him  this curt  abrupt  military shout  that he would not have expected from the policeman called franz
in itself  he found the order very welcome
 at last   he called back  locked the cupboard and  without delay  hurried into the next room
the two policemen were standing there and chased him back into his bedroom as if that were a matter of course
 what d you think you re doing   they cried
 think you re going to see the supervisor dressed in 12 the trial just your shirt  do you  he d see to it you got a right thumping  and us and all    let go of me for god s sake   called k   who had already been pushed back as far as his wardrobe   if you accost me when i m still in bed you can t expect to find me in my evening dress    that won t help you   said the policemen  who always became very quiet  almost sad  when k
began to shout  and in that way confused him or  to some extent  brought him to his senses
 ridiculous formalities   he grumbled  as he lifted his coat from the chair and kept it in both his hands for a little while  as if holding it out for the policemen s inspection
they shook their heads
 it s got to be a black coat   they said
at that  k
threw the coat to the floor and said without knowing even himself what he meant by it  well it s not going to be the main trial  after all   the policemen laughed  but continued to insist   it s got to be a black coat    well that s alright by me if it makes things go any faster   said k he opened the wardrobe himself  spent a long time searching through all the clothes  and chose his best black suit which had a short jacket that had greatly surprised those who knew him  then he also pulled out a fresh shirt and began  carefully  to get dressed he secretly told himself that he had succeeded in speeding things up by letting the policemen forget to make him have a bath he watched them to see if they might remember after all  but of course it never occurred to them  although willem did not forget to send franz up to the supervisor with the message saying that k
was getting dressed
once he was properly dressed  k
had to pass by willem as he went through the next room into the one beyond  the free ebooks at planet ebook com 13 door of which was already wide open
k
knew very well that this room had recently been let to a typist called  miss burstner 
she was in the habit of going out to work very early and coming back home very late  and k
had never exchanged more than a few words of greeting with her
now  her bedside table had been pulled into the middle of the room to be used as a desk for these proceedings  and the supervisor sat behind it
he had his legs crossed  and had thrown one arm over the backrest of the chair
in one corner of the room there were three young people looking at the photographs belonging to miss burstner that had been put into a piece of fabric on the wall
hung up on the handle of the open window was a white blouse
at the window across the street  there was the old pair again  although now their number had increased  as behind them  and far taller than they were  stood a man with an open shirt that showed his chest and a reddish goatee beard which he squeezed and twisted with his fingers
 josef k    asked he looked round the room
k
nodded
 i daresay you were quite surprised by all that s been taking place this morning   said the supervisor as  with both hands  he pushed away the few items on the bedside table the candle and box of matches  a book and a pin cushion which lay there as if they were things he would need for his own business  certainly   said k   and he began to feel relaxed now that  at last  he stood in front of someone with some sense  someone with whom he would be able to talk about his situation
 certainly i m surprised  but i m not in any way very surprised    you re 14 the trial not very surprised   asked the supervisor  as he positioned the candle in the middle of the table and the other things in a group around it
 perhaps you don t quite understand me   k
hurriedly pointed out
 what i mean is …   here k
broke off what he was saying and looked round for somewhere to sit
 i may sit down  mayn t i   he asked
 that s not usual   the supervisor answered
 what i mean is …   said k
without delaying a second time   that  yes  i am very surprised but when you ve been in the world for thirty years already and had to make your own way through everything yourself  which has been my lot  then you become hardened to surprises and don t take them too hard
especially not what s happened today    why especially not what s happened today    i wouldn t want to say that i see all of this as a joke  you seem to have gone to too much trouble making all these arrangements for that
everyone in the house must be taking part in it as well as all of you  that would be going beyond what could be a joke
so i don t want to say that this is a joke    quite right   said the supervisor  looking to see how many matches were left in the box
 but on the other hand   k
went on  looking round at everyone there and even wishing he could get the attention of the three who were looking at the photographs   on the other hand this really can t be all that important
that follows from the offence for which i could be indicted
but even that is all beside the point  the main question is  who is issuing the indictment  what office is conducting this affair  are you officials  none of you is wearing a uniform  unless what you free ebooks at planet ebook com 15 are wearing  here he turned towards franz  is meant to be clear answer to all these questions  and i m quite sure that once things have been made clear we can take our leave of each other on the best of terms   the supervisor slammed the box of matches down on the table  you re making a big mistake   he said
 these gentlemen and i have got nothing for it
as to whether you re on a charge  i can t give you any sort of clear answer to that  i don t even know whether you are or not
you re under arrest  you re quite right about that  but i don t know any more than that
maybe these officers have been chit chatting with you  well if they have that s all it is  chitchat
i can t give you an answer to your questions  but i can give you a bit of advice  you d better think less about us and what s going to happen to you  and think a bit more about yourself
and stop making all this fuss about your sense of innocence  you don t make such a bad impression  but with all this fuss you re damaging it
and you ought to do a bit less talking  too
almost everything you ve said so far has been things we could have taken from your behaviour  even if you d said no more than a few words
and what k
stared at the supervisor
was this man  probably younger than he was  lecturing him like a schoolmaster  was he being punished for his honesty with a telling off  and was he to learn nothing about the reasons for his arrest 16 the trial or those who were arresting him  he became somewhat cross and began to walk up and down
no one stopped him doing this and he pushed his sleeves back  felt his chest  straightened his hair  went over to the three men  said   it makes no sense   at which these three turned round to face him and came towards him with serious expressions
he finally came again to a halt in front of the supervisor s desk
 state attorney hasterer is a good friend of mine   he said   can i telephone him    certainly   said the supervisor   but i don t know what the point of that will be  i suppose you must have some private matter you want to discuss with him    what the point is   shouted k   more disconcerted that cross
 who do you think you are  you want to see some point in it while you re carrying out something as pointless as it could be  it s enough to make you cry  these gentlemen first accost me  and now they sit or stand about in here and let me be hauled up in front of you
what point there would be  in telephoning a state attorney when i m ostensibly under arrest  very well  i won t make the telephone call    you can call him if you want to   said the supervisor  stretching his had out towards the outer room where the telephone was   please  go on  do make your phone call    no  i don t want to any more   said k   and went over to the window across the street  the people were still there at the window  and it was only now that k
had gone up to his window that they seemed to become uneasy about quietly watching what was going on
the old couple wanted to get up but the man behind them calmed them down
 we ve got some kind of audience over there   called k
to the su  free ebooks at planet ebook com 17 pervisor  quite loudly  as he pointed out with his forefinger
 go away   he then called across to them
and the three of them did immediately retreat a few steps  the old pair even found themselves behind the man who then concealed them with the breadth of his body and seemed  going by the movements of his mouth  to be saying something incomprehensible into the distance they did not disappear entirely  though  but seemed to be waiting for the moment when they could come back to the window without being noticed
 intrusive  thoughtless people   said k
as he turned back into the room
the supervisor may have agreed with him  at least k
thought that was what he saw from the corner of his eye
but it was just as possible that he had not even been listening as he had his hand pressed firmly down on the table and seemed to be comparing the length of his fingers
the two policemen were sitting on a chest covered with a coloured blanket  rubbing their knees
the three young people had put their hands on their hips and were looking round aimlessly
everything was still  like in some office that has been forgotten about
 now  gentlemen   called out k   and for a moment it seemed as if he was carrying all of them on his shoulders   it looks like your business with me is over with
in my opinion  it s best now to stop wondering about whether you re proceeding correctly or incorrectly  and to bring the matter to a peaceful close with a mutual handshake
if you are of the same opinion  then please …   and he walked up to the supervisor s desk and held out his hand to him
the supervisor raised his eyes  bit his lip and looked at k  s outstretched hand  k still 18 the trial believed the supervisor would do as he suggested but instead  he stood up  picked up a hard round hat that was laying on miss burstner s bed and put it carefully onto his head  using both hands as if trying on a new hat
 everything seems so simple to you  doesn t it   he said to k as he did so   so you think we should bring the matter to a peaceful close  do you
no  no  that won t do
mind you  on the other hand i certainly wouldn t want you to think there s no hope for you
no  why should you think that  you re simply under arrest  nothing more than that
that s what i had to tell you  that s what i ve done and now i ve seen how you ve taken it
that s enough for one day and we can take our leave of each other  for the time being at least
i expect you ll want to go in to the bank now  won t you    in to the bank   asked k    i thought i was under arrest   k
said this with a certain amount of defiance as  although his handshake had not been accepted  he was feeling more independent of all these people  especially since the supervisor had stood up
he was playing with them
if they left  he had decided he would run after them and offer to let them arrest him
that s why he even repeated   how can i go in to the bank when i m under arrest    i see you ve misunderstood me   said the supervisor who was already at the door
 it s true that you re under arrest  but that shouldn t stop you from carrying out your job
and there shouldn t be anything to stop you carrying on with your usual life    in that case it s not too bad  being under arrest   said k   and went up close to the supervisor
 i never meant it should be anything else   he replied
 it hardly seems to have been necessary notify free ebooks at planet ebook com 19 me of the arrest in that case   said k   and went even closer the others had also come closer
all of them had gathered together into a narrow space by the door
 that was my duty   said the supervisor
 a silly duty   said k   unyielding
 maybe so   replied the supervisor   only don t let s waste our time talking on like this
i had assumed you d be wanting to go to the bank
as you re paying close attention to every word i ll add this  i m not forcing you to go to the bank  i d just assumed you wanted to
and to make things easier for you  and to let you get to the bank with as little fuss as possible i ve put these three gentlemen  colleagues of yours  at your disposal    what s that   exclaimed k   and looked at the three in astonishment
he could only remember seeing them in their group by the photographs  but it too high and it showed a gap in the omniscience of the supervisor  but they were nonetheless junior members of staff at the bank
how could k
have failed to see that  how occupied he must have been with the supervisor and the policemen not to have recognised these three  rabensteiner  with his stiff demeanour and swinging hands  kullich  with his blonde hair and deep set eyes  and kaminer  with his involuntary grin caused by chronic muscle spasms  good morning   said k
after a while  extending his hand to the gentlemen as they bowed correctly to him
 i didn t recognise you at all
so  we ll go into work now  shall we   the gentlemen laughed and nodded enthusiastically  as if that was what they had been waiting for all the time  except 20 the trial that k
had left his hat in his room so they all dashed  one after another  into the room to fetch it  which caused a certain amount of embarrassment k
stood where he was and watched them through the open double doorway  the last to go  of course  was the apathetic rabensteiner who had broken into no more than an elegant trot
kaminer got to the hat and k   as he often had to do at the bank  forcibly reminded himself that the grin was not deliberate  that he in grubach opened the door from the hallway into the living room where all the people were she did not seem to feel guilty about anything at all  and k   as often before  looked down at the belt of her apron which  for no reason  cut so deeply into her hefty body
once downstairs  k   with his watch in his hand  decided to take a taxi he had already been delayed by half an hour and there was no need to make the delay any longer
kaminer ran to the corner to summon it  and the two others were making obvious efforts to keep k
diverted when kullich pointed to the doorway of the house on the other side of the street where the large man with the blonde goatee beard appeared and  a little embarrassed at first at letting himself be seen in his full height  stepped back to the wall and leant against it the old couple were probably still on the stairs
k
was cross with kullich him   he snapped  without noticing how odd it was to speak to free men in this way
but there was no explanation needed anyway as just then the taxi arrived  they sat inside and free ebooks at planet ebook com 21 set off
inside the taxi  k
remembered that he had not noticed the supervisor and the policemen leaving the supervisor had stopped him noticing the three bank staff and now the three bank staff had stopped him noticing the supervisor
this showed that k
was not very attentive  and he resolved to watch himself more carefully in this respect nonetheless  he gave it no thought as he twisted himself round and leant over onto the rear shelf of the car to catch sight of the supervisor and the policemen if he could but he turned back round straight away and leant comfortably into the corner of the taxi without even having made the effort to see anyone
although it did not seem like it  now was just the time when he needed some encouragement  but the gentlemen seemed tired just then  rabensteiner looked out of the car to the right  kullich to the left and only kaminer was there with his grin at k  s service
it would have been inhumane to make fun of that
that spring  whenever possible  k
usually spent his evenings after work he usually stayed in the office until nine o clock with a short walk  either by himself or in the company of some of the bank officials  and then he would go into a pub where he would sit at the regulars  table with mostly older men until eleven there were  however  also exceptions to this habit  times  for instance  when k
was invited by the bank s manager  whom he greatly respected for his industry and trustworthiness  to go with him for a ride in his car or to eat dinner with him at his large house
k
would also go  once a week  to see a girl called elsa who worked as a waitress in a wine bar through the night until 22 the trial late in the morning
during the daytime she only received visitors while still in bed
that evening  though  the day had passed quickly with a lot of hard work and many respectful and friendly birthday greetings k
wanted to go straight home
each time he had any small break from the day s work he considered  without flat seemed to have been put into great disarray by the events of that morning  and that it was up to him to put it back into order
once order had been restored  every trace of those events would have been erased and everything would take its previous course once more
in particular  there was nothing to fear from the three bank officials  they had immersed themselves back into their paperwork and there was no alteration to be seen in them k
had called each of them  separately or all together  into his office that day for no other reason than to observe them  he was always satisfied and had always been able to let them go again
at half past nine that evening  when he arrived back in front of the building where he lived  he met a young lad in the doorway who was standing there  his legs apart and smoking a pipe
 who are you   immediately asked k   bringing his face close to the lad s  as it was hard to see in the half light of the landing
 i m the landlord s son  sir   answered the lad  taking the pipe from his mouth and stepping to one side
 the landlord s son   asked k   and impatiently knocked on the ground with his stick
 did you want anything  sir  would you like me to fetch my father    no  no   said k   there was something forgiving in his voice  as if the free ebooks at planet ebook com 23 boy had harmed him in some way and he was excusing him  it s alright   he said then  and went on  but before going up the stairs he turned round once more
he could have gone directly to his room  but as he wanted to speak with mrs grubach he went straight to her door and knocked she was sat at the table with a knitted stocking and a pile of old stockings in front of her
k
apologised  a little embarrassed at coming so late  but mrs grubach was very friendly and did not want to hear any apology  she was always ready to speak to him  he knew very well that he was her best and her favourite tenant k
looked round dishes  which had been on the table by the window that morning  had already been cleared away
 a woman s hands will do many things when no one s looking   he thought  he might himself have smashed all the dishes on the spot but certainly would not have been able to carry it all out he looked at mrs grubach with some gratitude  why are you working so late   he asked
they were now both sitting at the table  and k
now and then sank his hands into the pile of stockings
 there s a lot of work to do   she said   during the day i belong to the tenants  if i m to sort out my own things there are only the evenings left to me    i fear i may have caused you some exceptional work today    how do you mean  mr k    she asked  becoming more interested and leaving her work in her lap
 i mean the men who were here this morning    oh  i see   she said  and went peacefully back to what she was doing   that was no trouble  not especially   k
looked on in silence as she took up 24 the trial the knitted stocking once more
she seems surprised at my mentioning it  he thought  she seems to think it s improper for me to mention it all the more important for me to do so
an old woman is the only person i can speak about it with
 but it must have caused some work for you   he said then   but it won t happen again    no  it can t happen again   she agreed  and smiled at k
in a way that was almost pained
 do you mean that seriously   asked k
 yes   she said  more gently   but the important thing is you mustn t take it too hard
there are so many awful things happening in the world  as you re being so honest with me  mr k   i can admit to you that i listened to a little of what was going on from behind the door  and that those two policemen told me one or two things as well
it s all to do with your happiness  and that s something that s quite close to my heart  perhaps more than it should be as i am  after all  only your landlady
anyway  so i heard one or two things but i can t really say that it s about anything very serious
no
you have been arrested  but it s not in the same way as when they arrest a thief
if you re arrested in the same way as a thief  then it s bad  but an arrest like this …
it seems to me that it s something very complicated forgive me if i m saying something stupid something very complicated that i don t understand  but something that you don t really need to understand anyway    there s nothing stupid about what you ve said  mrs grubach  or at least i partly agree with you  only  the way i judge the whole thing is harsher than yours  and think it s not only not something complicated but simply a fuss about free ebooks at planet ebook com 25 nothing i was just caught unawares  that s what happened if i had got up as soon as i was awake without letting myself get confused because anna wasn t there  if i d got up and paid no regard to anyone who might have been in my way and come straight to you  if i d done something like having my breakfast in the kitchen as an exception  asked you to bring my clothes from my room  in short  if i had behaved sensibly then nothing more would have happened  everything that was waiting to happen would have been stifled
people are so often unprepared
in the bank  for example  i am well prepared  nothing of this sort could possibly happen to me there  i have my own assistant there  there are telephones for internal and external calls in front of me on the desk  i continually receive visits from people  representatives  officials  but besides that  and most importantly  i m always occupied with my work  that s to say i m always alert  it would even be a pleasure for me to find myself faced with something of that sort
but now it s over with  and i didn t really even want to talk about it any more  only i wanted to hear what you  as a sensible woman  thought about it all  and i m very glad to hear that we re in agreement
but now you must give me your hand  an agreement of this sort needs to be confirmed with a handshake
  will she shake hands with me  the supervisor didn t shake hands  he thought  and looked at the woman differently from before  examining her
she stood up  as he had also stood up  and was a little selfconscious  she hadn t been able to understand everything that that k
said
as a result of this self consciousness she said something that she cer  26 the trial tainly did not intend and certainly was not appropriate
 don t take it so hard  mr k    she said  with tears in her voice and also  of course  forgetting the handshake
 i didn t know i was taking it hard   said k   feeling suddenly tired and seeing that if this woman did agree with him it was of very little value
before going out the door he asked   is miss burstner home    no   said mrs grubach  smiling as she gave this simple piece of information  saying something sensible at last  she s at the theatre
did you want to see her  should i give her a message    i  er  i just wanted to have a few words with her    i m afraid i don t know when she s coming in  she usually gets back late when she s been to the theatre    it really doesn t matter   said k
his head hanging as he turned to the door to leave   i just wanted to give her my apology for taking over her room today    there s no need for that  mr k   you re too conscientious  the young lady doesn t know anything about it  she hasn t been home since early this morning and everything s been tidied up again  you can see for yourself   and she opened the door to miss burstner s room
 thank you  i ll take your word for it   said k  but went nonetheless over to the open door
the moon shone quietly into the unlit room
as far as could be seen  everything was indeed in its place  not even the blouse was hanging on the window handle
the pillows on the bed looked remarkably plump as they lay half in the moonlight
 miss burstner often comes home late   said k   looking at mrs grubach as if that were her responsibility  that s how young people are   said mrs grubach in to excuse her  free ebooks at planet ebook com 27 self  of course  of course   said k    but it can be taken too far    yes  it can be   said mrs grubach   you re so right  mr k perhaps it is in this case
i certainly wouldn t want to say anything nasty about miss burstner  she is a good  sweet girl  friendly  tidy  punctual  works hard  i appreciate all that very much  but one thing is true  she ought to have more pride  be a bit less forthcoming
twice this month already  in the street over the way  i ve seen her with a different gentleman
i really don t like saying this  you re the only one i ve said this to  mr k   i swear to god  but i m going to have no choice but to have a few words with miss burstner about it myself
and it s not the only thing about her that i m worried about    mrs grubach  you are on quite the wrong track    said k   so angry that he was hardly able to hide it   and you have moreover misunderstood what i was saying about miss burstner  that is not what i meant you are quite mistaken  i know miss burstner very well and there is no truth at all in what you say
and what s more  perhaps i m going to far  i don t want to get in your way  say to her whatever you see fit
good night    mr k    said mrs grubach as if asking him for something and hurrying to his door which he had already opened   i don t want to speak to miss burstner at all  not yet  of course i ll continue to keep an eye on her but you re the only one i ve told what i know and it is  after all something that everyone who lets rooms has to do if she s to keep the house decent  that s all i m trying to do    decent   called out k through the crack in the door   if you want to keep the house decent you ll first have 28 the trial to give me notice   then he slammed the door shut  there was a gentle knocking to which he paid no more attention
he did not feel at all like going to bed  so he decided to stay up  and this would also give him the chance to find out when miss burstner would arrive home
perhaps it would also still be possible  even if a little inappropriate  to have a few words with her
as he lay there by the window  pressing his hands to his tired eyes  he even thought for a moment that he might punish mrs grubach by persuading miss burstner to give in her notice at the same time as he would but he immediately realised that that would be shockingly excessive  and there would even be the suspicion that he was moving house because of the incidents of that morning
nothing would have been more nonsensical and  above all  more pointless and contemptible
when he had become tired of looking out onto the empty street he slightly opened the door to the living room so he was and lay down on the couch
he lay there  quietly smoking a cigar  until about eleven o clock
he wasn t able to hold out longer than that  and went a little way into the hallway as if in that way he could make miss burstner arrive sooner
he had no particular desire for her  he could not even remember what she looked like  but now he wanted to speak to her and it irritated him that her late arrival home meant this day would be full of unease and disorder right to its very end
it was also her fault that he had not had any dinner that evening and that he had been unable to visit elsa as he had intended
he could still make up for both of free ebooks at planet ebook com 29 those things  though  if he went to the wine bar where elsa worked
he wanted to do so even later  after the discussion with miss burstner
it was already gone half past eleven when someone could be heard in the stairway
k   who had been lost in his thoughts in the hallway  walking up and down loudly as if it were his own room  fled behind his door
miss burstner had arrived
shivering  she pulled a silk shawl over her slender shoulders as she locked the door
the next moment she would certainly go into her room  where k
ought not to intrude in the middle of the night  that meant he would have to speak to her now  but  unfortunately  he had not put the electric light on in his room so that when he stepped out of the dark it would give the impression of being an attack and would certainly  at the very least  have been quite alarming
there was no time to lose  and in his helplessness he whispered through the crack of the door   miss burstner   it sounded like he was pleading with her  not calling to her
 is there someone there   asked miss burstner  looking round with her eyes wide open
 it s me   said k
and came out
 oh  mr k    said miss burstner with a smile
 good evening   and offered him her hand
 i wanted to have a word with you  if you would allow me    now   asked miss burstner   does it have to be now  it is a little odd  isn t it    i ve been waiting for you since nine o clock    well  i was at the theatre  i didn t know anything about you waiting for me    the reason i need to speak to you only came up today   i see  well i don t see why not  i suppose  apart from being so tired i could drop
come into my room for a few 30 the trial minutes then
we certainly can t talk out here  we d wake everyone up and i think that would be more unpleasant for us than for them
wait here till i ve put the light on in my room  and then turn the light down out here   k
did as he was told  and then even waited until miss burstner came out of her room and quietly invited him  once more  to come in
 sit down   she said  indicating the ottoman  while she herself remained standing by the bedpost despite the tiredness she had spoken of  she did not even take off her hat  which was small but decorated with an abundance of flowers
 what is it you wanted  then  i m really quite curious   she gently crossed her legs
 i expect you ll say   k
began   that the matter really isn t all that urgent and we don t need to talk about it right now  but …   i never listen to introductions   said miss burstner
 that makes my job so much easier   said k
 this morning  to some extent through my fault  your room was made a little untidy  this happened because of people i did not know and against my will but  as i said  because of my fault  i wanted to apologise for it    my room   asked miss burstner  and instead of looking round the room scrutinised k
 it is true   said k   and now  for the first time  they looked each other in the eyes   there s no interesting thing about it   said miss burstner
 no   said k
 well then   said miss burstner   i don t want to force my way into any secrets  if you insist that it s of no interest i won t insist
i m quite happy to forgive you for it  as you ask  especially as i can t see anything at all that s been left untidy   with her hand laid flat on her lower hip  she made a free ebooks at planet ebook com 31 tour around the room
at the mat where the photographs were she stopped
 look at this   she cried
 my photographs really have been put in the wrong places
oh  that s horrible
someone really has been in my room without permission   k
nodded  and quietly cursed kaminer who that had neither use nor purpose
 it is odd   said miss burstner   that i m forced to forbid you to do something that you ought to have forbidden yourself to do  namely to come into my room when i m not here    but i did explain to you   said k   and went over to join her by the photographs   that it wasn t me who interfered with your photographs  but as you don t believe me i ll have to admit that the investigating committee brought along three bank employees with them  one of them must have touched your photographs and as soon as i get the chance i ll ask to have him dismissed from the bank
yes  there was an investigating committee here   added k   as the young lady was looking at him enquiringly
 because of you   she asked
 yes   answered k
 no   the lady cried with a laugh
 yes  they were   said k    you believe that i m innocent then  do you    well now  innocent …   said the lady   i don t want to start making any pronouncements that might have serious consequences  i don t really know you after all  it means they re dealing with a serious criminal if they send an investigating committee straight out to get him
but you re not in custody now at least i take it you ve not escaped from prison considering that you seem quite calm so you can t have committed any crime of that sort    yes   said k    but 32 the trial it might be that the investigating committee could see that i m innocent  or not so guilty as had been supposed    yes  that s certainly a possibility   said miss burstner  who seemed very interested
 listen   said k    you don t have much experience in legal matters    no  that s true  i don t   said miss burstner   and i ve often regretted it  as i d like to know everything and i m very interested in legal matters
there  but i ll certainly be perfecting my knowledge in this area  as next month i start work in a legal office    that s very good   said k    that means you ll be able to give me some help with my trial    that could well be   said miss burstner   why not  i like to make use of what i know    i mean it quite seriously   said k    or at least  half seriously  as you do
this affair is too petty to call in a lawyer  but i could make good use of someone who could give me advice    yes  but if i m to give you advice i ll have to know problem   said k    i don t know that myself    so you have been making fun of me  then   said miss burstner exceedingly disappointed   you really ought not to try something like that on at this time of night   and she stepped away from the photographs where they had stood so long together
 miss burstner  no   said k    i m not making fun of you
please believe me  i ve already told you everything i know
i don t know what else to call them
there was no cross questioning at all  i was merely arrested  but by a commit  free ebooks at planet ebook com 33 tee   miss burstner sat on the ottoman and laughed again
 what was it like then   she asked
 it was terrible  said k   although his mind was no longer on the subject  he had become totally absorbed by miss burstner s gaze who was supporting her chin on one hand the elbow rested on the cushion of the ottoman and slowly stroking her hip with the other
 that s too vague   said miss burstner
 what s too vague   asked k
then he remembered himself and asked   would you like me to show you what it was like   he wanted to move in some way but did not want to leave  i m already tired   said miss burstner
 you arrived back so late   said k
 now you ve started telling me off
well i suppose i deserve it as i shouldn t have let you in here in the first place  and it turns out there wasn t even any point    oh  there was a point  you ll see now how important a point it was   said k
 may i move this table away from your bedside and put it here    what do you think you re doing   said miss burstner
 of course you can t    in that case i can t show you   said k   quite upset  as if miss burstner had committed some incomprehensible offence against him
 alright then  if you need it to show what you mean  just take the bedside table then   said miss burstner  and after a short pause added in a weak voice   i m so tired i m allowing more than i ought to   k
put the little table in the middle of the room and sat down behind it
 you have to get a proper idea of where the people were situated  it is very interesting
i m the supervisor  sitting over there on the chest are two policemen  standing next to the photographs there are three young people
hanging on the handle of the window is a 34 the trial white blouse i just mention that by the way
and now it begins
ah yes  i m forgetting myself  the most important person of all  so i m standing here in front of the table
the supervisor is sitting extremely comfortably with his legs crossed and his arm hanging over the backrest here like some layabout
and now it really does begin
the supervisor i m afraid  if i m to make it clear to you  i ll have to shout as well  and it s nothing more than my name that he shouts out   miss burstner  laughing as she listened to him  laid her forefinger on her mouth so that k
would not shout  but it was too late
k
was too engrossed in his role and slowly called out   josef k   
it was not as loud as he had threatened  but nonetheless  once he had suddenly called it out  the cry seemed gradually to spread itself all round the room
there was a series of loud  curt and regular knocks at the door of the adjoining room
miss burstner went pale and laid her hand on her heart
k
was especially startled  as for a moment he had been quite unable to think of anything other than the events of that morning and the girl for whom he was performing them
he had hardly pulled himself together when he jumped over to miss burstner and took her hand  don t be afraid   he whispered   i ll put everything right
but who can it be  it s only the living room next door  nobody sleeps in there    yes they do   whispered miss burstner into k  s ear   a nephew of mrs grubach s  an captain in the army  has been sleeping there since yesterday there s no other room free
i d forgotten about it free ebooks at planet ebook com 35 too
why did you have to shout like that  you ve made me quite upset    there is no reason for it   said k   and  now as she sank back onto the cushion  kissed her forehead
 go away  go away   she said  hurriedly sitting back up   get out of here  go  what is it you want  he s listening at the door he can hear everything
you re causing me so much trouble    i won t go   said k    until you ve calmed down a bit
come over into the other corner of the room  he won t be able to hear us there   she let him lead her there
 don t forget   he said   although this might be unpleasant for you you re not in any real danger
you know how much esteem mrs grubach has for me  she s the one who will make all the decisions in this  especially as the captain is her nephew  but she believes everything i say without question what s more  she has borrowed a large sum of money from me and that makes her dependent on me
i will confirm whatever you say to explain our being here together  however inappropriate it might be  and i guarantee to make sure that mrs grubach will not only say she believes the explanation in public but will believe it truly and sincerely you will have no need to consider me in any way
if you wish to let it be known that i have attacked you then mrs grubach will be informed of such and she will believe it without even losing her trust in me  that s how much respect she has for me   miss burstner looked at the floor in front of her  quiet and a little sunk in on herself  why would mrs grubach not believe that i ve attacked you   added k he looked at her hair in front of him  parted  bunched down  reddish and firmly held in place
he thought she would look up at him  36 the trial but without changing her manner she said   forgive me  but it was the suddenness of the knocking that startled me so much  not so much what the consequences of the captain being here might be
it was all so quiet after you d shouted  and then there was the knocking  that s was made me so shocked  and i was sitting right by the door  the knocking was right next to me
thank you for your suggestions  but i won t accept them
i can bear the responsibility for anything that happens in my room myself  and i can do so with anyone
i m surprised you don t realise just how insulting your suggestions are and what they imply about me  although i certainly acknowledge your good intentions
but now  please go  leave me alone  i need you to go now even more than i did earlier
the couple of minutes you asked for have grown into half an hour  more than half an hour now   k
took hold of her hand  and then of her wrist   you re not cross with me  though   he said
she pulled her hand away and answered   no  no  i m never cross with anyone   he grasped her wrist once more  she tolerated it now and  in that way  lead him to the door
he had fully intended to leave
but when he reached the door he came to a halt as if he hadn t expected to find a door there  miss burstner made use of that moment to get herself free  open the door  slip out into the hallway and gently say to k
from there   now  come along  please
look   she pointed to the captain s door  from under which there was a light shining   he s put a light on and he s laughing at us    alright  i m coming   said k   moved forward  took hold of her  kissed her on the mouth and then over her whole face like a thirsty animal lapping free ebooks at planet ebook com 37 with its tongue when it eventually finds water
he finally kissed her on her neck and her throat and left his lips pressed there for a long time
he did not look up until there was a noise from the captain s room
 i ll go now   he said  he wanted to address miss burstner by her christian name  but did not know it
she gave him a tired nod  offered him her hand to kiss as she turned away as if she did not know what she was doing  and went back into her room with her head bowed
a short while later  k
was lying in his bed
he very soon went to sleep  but before he did he thought a little while about his behaviour  he was satisfied with it but felt some surprise that he was not more satisfied  he was seriously worried about miss burstner because of the captain
38 the trial first cross examination k
was informed by telephone that there would be a small hearing concerning his case the following sunday
he was made aware that these cross examinations would follow one another regularly  perhaps not every week but quite frequently
on the one hand it was in everyone s interest to bring proceedings quickly to their conclusion  but on the other hand every aspect of the examinations had to be carried out thoroughly without lasting too long because of the associated stress
for these reasons  it had been decided to hold a series of brief examinations following on one after another
sunday had been chosen as the day for the hearings so that k
would not be disturbed in his professional work
it was assumed that he would be in agreement with this  but if he wished for another date then  as far as possible  he would be accommodated
cross examinations could even be held in the night  for instance  but k
would probably not be fresh enough at that time
anyway  as long as k
made no objection  the hearing would be left on sundays
it was a matter of course that he would have to appear without fail  there was probably no need to point this out to him
he would be given the number of the building where he was to present himself  which was in a street in a suburb well away free ebooks at planet ebook com 39 from the city centre which k had never been to before
once he had received this notice  k
hung up the receiver without giving an answer  he had decided immediately to go there that sunday  it was certainly necessary  proceedings had begun and he had to face up to it  and this first examination would probably also be the last
he was still standing in thought by the telephone when he heard the voice of the deputy director behind him he wanted to use the telephone but k
stood in his way
 bad news   asked the deputy director casually  not in order to find anything out but just to get k
away from the device
 no  no    said k   he stepped to one side but did not go away entirely
the deputy director picked up the receiver and  as he waited for his connection  turned away from it and said to k    one question  mr k   would you like to give me the pleasure of joining me on my sailing boat on sunday morning  there s quite a few people coming  you re bound to know some of them
one of them is hasterer  the state attorney
would you like to come along  do come along   k
tried to pay attention to what the deputy director was saying
it was of no small importance for him  as this invitation from the deputy director  with whom he had never got on very well  meant that he was trying to improve his relations with him
it showed how important k
had become in the bank and how its second most important official seemed to value his friendship  or at least his impartiality
he was only speaking at the side of the telephone receiver while he waited for his connection  but in giving this invitation the deputy director was humbling himself but k
would have to humiliate him 40 the trial a second time as a result  he said   thank you very much  but i m afraid i will have no time on sunday  i have a previous obligation    pity   said the deputy director  and turned to the telephone conversation that had just been connected
it was not a short conversation  but k   remained standing confused by the instrument all the time it was going on
it was only when the deputy director hung up that he was shocked into awareness and said  in order to partially excuse his standing there for no reason   i ve just received a telephone call  there s somewhere i need to go  but they forgot to tell me what time    ask them then   said the deputy director
 it s not that important   said k   although in that way his earlier excuse  already weak enough  was made even weaker
as he went  the deputy director continued to speak about other things
k
forced himself to answer  but his thoughts were mainly about that sunday  how it would be best to get there for nine o clock in the morning as that was the time that courts always start work on weekdays the weather was dull on sunday
k
was very tired  as he had stayed out drinking until late in the night celebrating with some of the regulars  and he had almost overslept
he dressed hurriedly  without the time to think and assemble the various plans he had worked out during the week
with no breakfast  he rushed to the suburb he had been told about
oddly enough  although he had little time to look around him  he came across the three bank officials involved in his case  rabensteiner  kullich and kaminer
the first two were travelling in a tram that went across k  s route  but kaminer sat on the terrace of a cafž and leant curiously over the wall free ebooks at planet ebook com 41 as k
came over
all of them seemed to be looking at him  surprised at seeing their superior running  it was a kind of pride that made k
want to go on foot  this was his affair and the idea of any help from strangers  however slight  was repulsive to him  he also wanted to avoid asking for anyone s help because that would initiate them into the affair even if only slightly
and after all  he had no wish at all to humiliate himself before the committee by being too punctual anyway  now he was running so that he would get there by nine o clock if at all possible  even though he had no appointment for this time
he had thought that he would recognise the building the building was in juliusstrasse  but when he stood at the street s entrance it consisted on each side of almost nothing but monotonous  grey constructions  tall blocks of flats occupied by poor people
now  on a sunday morning  most of the windows were occupied  men in their shirtsleeves leant out smoking  or carefully and gently held small children on the sills
other windows were piled up with bedding  above which the dishevelled head of a woman would briefly appear
people called out to each other across the street  one of the calls provoked a loud laugh about k
himself it was a long street  and spaced evenly along it were small shops below street level  selling various kinds of foodstuffs  which you reached by going down a few steps
women went in and out of them or stood chatting on the steps
a fruitmonger  42 the trial taking his goods up to the windows  was just as inattentive as k
and nearly knocked him down with his cart
just then  a gramophone  which in better parts of town would have been seen as worn out  began to play some murderous tune
k
went further into the street  slowly  as if he had plenty of time now  or as if the examining magistrate were looking at him from one of the windows and therefore knew that k
had found his way there
it was shortly after nine
the building was quite far down the street  it covered so much area it was almost extraordinary  and the gateway in particular was tall and long
it was clearly intended for delivery wagons belonging to the various warehouses all round the yard which were now locked up and carried the names of companies some of which k
knew from his work at the bank
in contrast with his usual habits  he remained standing a while at the entrance to the yard taking in all these external details
near him  there was a bare footed man sitting on a crate and reading a newspaper
there were two lads swinging on a hand cart
in front of a pump stood a weak  young girl in a bedjacket who  as the water flowed into her can  looked at k
there was a piece of rope stretched between two windows in a corner of the yard  with some washing hanging on it to dry a man stood below it calling out instructions to direct the work being done
k
went over to the stairway to get to the room where the hearing was to take place  but then stood still again as besides these steps he could see three other stairway entrances  and there also seemed to be a small passageway at the end free ebooks at planet ebook com 43 of the yard leading into a second yard
it irritated him that he had not been given more precise directions to the room  it meant they were either being especially neglectful with him or especially indifferent  and he decided to make that clear to them very loudly and very unambiguously
in the end he decided to climb up the stairs  his thoughts playing on something that he remembered the policeman  willem  which it followed that the courtroom must be on the stairway that k
selected by chance
as he went up he disturbed a large group of children playing on the stairs who looked at him as he stepped through their rows
 next time i come here   he said to himself   i must either bring sweets with me make them like me or a stick to hit them with   just before he reached the first landing he even had to wait a little while until a ball had finished its movement  two small lads with sly faces like grown up scoundrels held him by his trouser legs until it had  if he were to shake them off he would have to hurt them  and he was afraid of what noise they would make by shouting on the first floor  his search began for real
he still felt unable to ask for the investigating committee  and so he invented a joiner called lanz that name occurred to him because the captain  mrs grubach s nephew  was called lanz so that he could ask at every flat whether lanz the joiner lived there and thus obtain a chance to look into the rooms it turned out  though  that that was mostly possible without further ado  as almost all the doors were left open and the children ran in and out most of them were small  one  44 the trial windowed rooms where they also did the cooking many women held babies in one arm and worked at the stove with the other
half grown girls  who seemed to be dressed in just their pinafores worked hardest running to and fro
in every room  the beds were still in use by people who were ill  or still asleep  or people stretched out on them in their clothes k
knocked at the flats where the doors were closed and asked whether lanz the joiner lived there
it was usually a woman who opened the door  heard the enquiry and turned to somebody in the room who would raise himself from the bed  the gentleman s asking if a joiner called lanz  lives here    a joiner  called lanz   he would ask from the bed    that s right   k
would say  although it was clear that the investigating committee was not to be found there  and so his task was at an end
there were many who thought it must be very important for k
to find lanz the joiner and thought long about it  naming a joiner who was not called lanz or giving a name that had some vague similarity with lanz  or they asked neighbours or accompanied k
to a door a long way away where they thought someone of that sort might live in the back part of the building or where someone would be who could advise k
better than they could themselves k
eventually had to give up asking if he did not want to be led all round from floor to floor in this way
he regretted his initial plan  which had at first seemed so give up the search  took his leave of a friendly  young worker who wanted to lead him on still further and went down the stairs
but then the thought of how much time he was free ebooks at planet ebook com 45 wasting made him cross  he went back again and knocked at the first door on the fifth floor
the first thing he saw in the small room was a large clock on the wall which already showed ten o clock
 is there a joiner called lanz who lives here   he asked
 pardon   said a young woman with black  shining eyes who was  at that moment  washing children s underclothes in a bucket
she pointed her wet hand towards the open door of the adjoining room
k
thought he had stepped into a meeting
a medium sized  two windowed room was filled with the most diverse crowd of people nobody paid any attention to the person who by a gallery which was also fully occupied and where the people could only stand bent down with their heads and their backs touching the ceiling
k   who found the air too stuffy  stepped out again and said to the young woman  who had probably misunderstood what he had said   i asked for a joiner  someone by the name of lanz    yes   said the woman   please go on in   k
would probably not have followed her if the woman had not gone up to him  taken hold of the door handle and said   i ll have to close the door after you  no one else will be allowed in    very sensible   said k    but it s too full already   but then he went back in anyway
he passed through between two men who were talking beside the door one of them held both hands far out in front of himself making the movements of counting out money  the other looked him closely in the eyes and someone took him by the hand it was a small  red faced youth
 come in  come in   he said
k
let himself be led by him  and it turned 46 the trial out that there was surprisingly in a densely packed crowd of people moving to and fro a narrow passage which may and the right of him there was hardly any face looking in his direction  he saw nothing but the backs of people directing their speech and their movements only towards members of their own side most of them were dressed in black  in old  long  formal frock coats that hung down loosely around them
these clothes were the only thing that puzzled k   as he would otherwise have taken the whole assembly for a local political meeting
at the other end of the hall where k
had been led there was a little table set at an angle on a very low podium which was as overcrowded as everywhere else  and behind the table  near the edge of the podium  sat a small  fat  wheezing man who was talking with someone behind him
this second man was standing with his legs crossed and his elbows on the backrest of the chair  provoking much laughter
from time to time he threw his arm in the air as if doing a caricature of someone
the youth who was leading k
had some difficulty in reporting to the man
he had already tried twice to tell him something  standing on tiptoe  but without getting the man s attention as he sat there above him
it was only when one of the people up on the podium drew his attention to the youth that the man turned to him and leant down to hear what it was he quietly said
then he pulled out his watch and quickly looked over at k
 you should have been here one hour and five minutes ago   he said
k
was free ebooks at planet ebook com 47 going to give him a reply but had no time to do so  as hardly had the man spoken than a general muttering arose all over the right hand side of the hall
 you should have been here one hour and five minutes ago   the man now repeated  raising his voice this time  and quickly looked round the hall beneath him
the muttering also became immediately louder and  as the man said nothing more  died away only gradually
now the hall was much quieter than when k
had passing remarks
as far as could be distinguished  up in the half darkness  dust and haze  they seemed to be less well dressed than those below
many of them had brought pillows that they had put between their heads and the ceiling so that they would not hurt themselves pressed against it k
had decided he would do more watching than talking  so he did not defend himself for supposedly having come late  and simply said   well maybe i have arrived late  i m here now   there followed loud applause  once more from the right hand side of the hall easy people to get on your side  thought k   and was bothered only by the quiet from the left hand side which was directly behind him and from which there was applause from only a few individuals
he wondered what he could say to get all of them to support him together or  if that were not possible  to at least get the support of the others for a while
 yes   said the man   but i m now no longer under any obligation to hear your case  there was once more a muttering  but this time it was misleading as the man waved the people s objections aside with his hand and continued 48 the trial  i will  however  as an exception  continue with it today
but you should never arrive late like this again
and now  step forward   someone jumped down from the podium so that there would be a place free for k   and k
stepped up onto it
he stood pressed closely against the table  the press of the crowd behind him was so great that he had to press back against it if he did not want to push the judge s desk down off the podium and perhaps the judge along with it
the judge  however  paid no attention to that but sat very comfortably on his chair and  after saying a few words to close his discussion with the man behind him  reached for a little note book  the only item on his desk
it was like an old school exercise book and had become quite misshapen from much thumbing
 now then   said the judge  thumbing through the book
he turned to k
with the tone of someone  no   said k    i am the chief clerk in a large bank   this himself joining in with it the people supported themselves with their hands on their knees and shook as if suffering a serious attack of coughing even some of those in the gallery were laughing
the judge had become quite cross but seemed to have no power over those below him in the hall  he tried to reduce what harm had been done in the gallery and jumped up threatening them  his eyebrows  until then hardly remarkable  pushed themselves up and became big  black and bushy over his eyes the left hand side of the hall was still quiet  though  the free ebooks at planet ebook com 49 people stood there in rows with their faces looking towards the podium listening to what was being said there  they observed the noise from the other side of the hall with the same quietness and even allowed some individuals from in number than the right but probably were no more important than them  although their behaviour was calmer and that made it seem like they were
when k
now began to speak he was convinced he was doing it in the same way as them
 your question  my lord  as to whether i am a house merely imposed it on me is symptomatic of the whole way these proceedings against me are being carried out
perhaps you will object that there are no proceedings against me
you will be quite right  as there are proceedings only if i acknowledge that there are
but  for the moment  i do acknowledge it  out of pity for yourselves to a large extent
it s impossible not to observe all this business without feeling pity
i don t say things are being done without due care but i would like to make it clear that it is i who make the acknowledgement   k
stopped speaking and looked down into the hall
he had spoken sharply  more sharply than he had intended  but he had been quite right
it should have been rewarded with some applause here and there but everything was quiet  they were all clearly waiting for what would follow  perhaps the quietness was laying the ground for an outbreak of ac  50 the trial tivity that would bring this whole affair to an end
it was somewhat disturbing that just then the door at the end of the hall opened  the young washerwoman  who seemed to was only the judge who gave k
any direct pleasure  as he seemed to have been immediately struck by k  s words
until then  he had listened to him standing  as k  s speech had taken him by surprise while he was directing his attention to the gallery
now  in the pause  he sat down very slowly  as if he did not want anyone to notice
he took out the notebook again  probably so that he could give the impression of being calmer
 that won t help you  sir    continued k    even your little book will only confirm what i say   k
was satisfied to hear nothing but his own quiet words in this room full of strangers  and he even dared casually to pick up the examining judge s notebook and  touching it only with the tips of his fingers as if it were something revolting  lifted it in the air  holding it just by one of the middle pages so that the others on each side of it  closely written  blotted and yellowing  flapped down
 those are the official notes of the examining judge   he said  and let the notebook fall down onto the desk
 you can read in your book as much as you like  sir  i really don t have anything in this charge book to be afraid of  even though i don t have access to it as i wouldn t want it in my hand  i can only touch it with two fingers   the judge grabbed the notebook from where it had fallen on the desk which could only have been a sign of his deep humiliation  free ebooks at planet ebook com 51 or at least that is how it must have been perceived tried to tidy it up a little  and held it once more in front of himself in order to read from it the people in the front row looked up at him  showing such tension on their faces that he looked back down at them for some time
every one of them was an old man  some of them with white beards
could they perhaps be the crucial group who could turn the whole assembly one way or the other  they had sunk into a state of motionlessness while k
gave his oration  and it had not been possible to raise them from this passivity even when the judge was being humiliated
 what has happened to me   continued k   with less of the vigour he had had earlier  he continually scanned the faces in the first row  and this gave his address a not be of much importance as it s not of much importance to me  but it is a symptom of proceedings which are carried out against many
it s on behalf of them that i stand here now  not for myself alone   without having intended it  he had raised his voice
somewhere in the hall  someone raised his hands and applauded him shouting   bravo  why not then  bravo  again i say  bravo   some of the men in the first row groped around in their beards  none of them looked round to see who was shouting
not even k
thought him of any importance but it did raise his spirits  he no longer thought it at all necessary that all of those in the hall should applaud him  it was enough if the majority of them began to think about the matter and if only one of them  now and then  was persuaded
 i m not trying to be a successful orator   said k
after this thought   that s probably more than i m capable of anyway
i m sure the examining judge can speak far better than i can  it is part of his job after all
all that i want is a public discussion of a public wrong
listen  ten days ago i was placed under arrest  the arrest itself is something i laugh about but that s beside the point
they came for me in the morning when i was still in bed
maybe the order had been given to arrest some house painter that seems possible after what the judge has said someone who is as innocent as i am  but it was me they chose there were two police thugs occupying the next room
they could not have taken better precautions if i had been a dangerous robber
and these policemen were unprincipled riff raff  they talked at me till i was sick of it  they wanted bribes  they wanted to trick me into giving them my clothes  they wanted money  supposedly so that they could bring me my breakfast after they had blatantly eaten my own breakfast in front of my eyes
and even that was not enough
i was led in front of the supervisor in another room
this was the room of a lady who i have a lot of respect for  and i was forced to look on while the supervisor and the policemen made quite a mess of this room because of me  although not through any fault of mine
it was not easy to stay calm  but i managed to do so and was completely calm when i asked the supervisor why it was that i was under arrest
if he were here he would have to confirm what i say
i can see him now  sitting on the free ebooks at planet ebook com 53 chair belonging to that lady i mentioned a picture of dullwitted arrogance
what do you think he answered  what he told me  gentlemen  was basically nothing at all  perhaps he really did know nothing  he had placed me under arrest brought three junior employees from the bank where i work into the lady s room  they had made themselves busy interfering with some photographs that belonged to the lady and causing a mess there was  of course  another reason for bringing these employees  they  just like my landlady and her maid  were expected to spread the news of my arrest and damage my public reputation and in particular to remove me from my position at the bank
well they didn t succeed in any of that  not in the slightest  even my landlady  who is quite a simple person and i will give you here her name in full respect  her name is mrs grubach even mrs grubach was understanding enough to see that an arrest like this has no more significance than an attack carried out on the street by some youths who are not kept under proper control i repeat  this whole affair has caused me nothing but unpleasantness and temporary irritation  but could it not also have had some far worse consequences   k broke off here and looked at the judge  who said nothing
as he did so he thought he saw the judge use a movement of his eyes to give a sign to someone in the crowd
k
smiled and said   and now the judge  right next to me  is giving a secret sign to someone among you
there seems to be someone among you who is taking directions from above i don t know whether the sign is meant to produce booing or ap  54 the trial plause  but i ll resist trying to guess what its meaning is too soon
it really doesn t matter to me  and i give his lordship the judge my full and public permission to stop giving secret signs to his paid subordinate down there and give his orders in words instead  let him just say  boo now    and then the next time  clap now  
whether it was embarrassment or impatience  the judge rocked backwards and forwards on his seat
the man behind him  whom he had been talking with earlier  leant forward again  either to give him a few general words of encouragement or some specific piece of advice
below them strongly opposed to each other but now they began to intermingle  a few individuals pointed up at k   others pointed at the judge
the air in the room was fuggy and extremely oppressive  those who were standing furthest away could hardly even be seen through it
it must have been especially troublesome for those visitors who were in the gallery  as they were forced to quietly ask the participants in the glances at the judge
the replies they received were just as quiet  and given behind the protection of a raised hand
 i have nearly finished what i have to say   said k   and as there was no bell available he struck the desk with his fist in a way that startled the judge and his advisor and made them look up from each other
 non of this concerns me  and i am therefore able to make a calm assessment of it  and  assuming that this so called court is of any real importance  it free ebooks at planet ebook com 55 will be very much to your advantage to listen to what i have to say
if you want to discuss what i say  please don t bother to write it down until later on  i don t have any time to waste and i ll soon be leaving   there was immediate silence  which showed how well k
was in control of the crowd
there were no shouts among them as there had been at the start  no one even applauded  but if they weren t already persuaded they seemed very close to it
k was pleased at the tension among all the people there as they listened to him  a rustling rose from the silence which was more invigorating than the most ecstatic applause could have been
 there is no doubt   he said quietly   that there is some enormous organisation determining what is said by this court
in my case this includes my arrest and the examination taking place here today  an organisation that employs policemen who can be bribed  oafish supervisors and judges of whom nothing better can be said than that they are not as arrogant as some others
this organisation even maintains a high level judiciary along with its train of countless servants  scribes  policemen and all the other assistance that it needs  perhaps even executioners and torturers i m not afraid of using those words
and what  gentlemen  is the purpose of this enormous organisation  its purpose is to arrest innocent people and wage pointless prosecutions against them which  as in my case  lead to no result
how are we to avoid those in office becoming deeply corrupt when everything is devoid of meaning  that is impossible  not even the highest judge would be 56 the trial able to achieve that for himself that is why policemen try to steal the clothes off the back of those they arrest  that is why supervisors break into the homes of people they do not know  that is why innocent people are humiliated in front of crowds rather than being given a proper trial
the policemen only talked about the warehouses where they put the property of those they arrest  i would like to see these warehouses where the hard won possessions of people under arrest is left to decay  if  that is  it s not stolen by the thieving hands of the warehouse workers   k
was interrupted by a screeching from the far end of the hall  he shaded his eyes to see that far  as the dull light of day made the smoke whitish and hard to see through
it hard to see now whether it was her fault or not
k
could only see that a man had pulled her into a corner by the door and was pressing himself against her but it was not her who was screaming  but the man  he had opened his mouth wide and looked up at the ceiling
a small circle had formed around the two of them  the visitors near him in the gallery seemed delighted that the serious tone k
had introduced into the gathering had been disturbed in this way
k  s first thought was to run over there  and he also thought that everyone would want to bring things back into order there or at least to make the pair leave the room  but the first row of people in from of him stayed were they were  no one moved and no one let k
through
on the contrary  they stood in his way  old men held out their arms in front of him and free ebooks at planet ebook com 57 a hand from somewhere he did not have the time to turn round took hold of his collar k   by this time  had forgotten about the pair  it seemed to him that his freedom was being limited as if his arrest was being taken seriously  and  without any thought for what he was doing  he jumped down from the podium
now he stood face to face with the crowd
had he judged the people properly  had he put too much faith in the effect of his speech  had they been putting up a pretence all the time he had been speaking  and now that he come to the end and to what must follow  were they tired of pretending  what faces they were  all around him  dark  little eyes flickered here and there  cheeks drooped down like on drunken men  their long beards were thin and stiff  if they took hold of them it was more like they were making their hands into claws  not as if they were taking hold of their own beards
but underneath those beards and this was the real discovery made by k
there were badges of various sizes and colours shining on the collars of their coats
as far as he could see  every one of them was wearing one of these badges
all of them belonged to the same group  even though they seemed to be divided to the right and the left of him  and when he suddenly turned round he saw the same badge on the collar of the examining judge who calmly looked down at him with his hands in his lap
 so   called out k  throwing his arms in the air as if this sudden realisation needed more room   all of you are working for this organisation  i see now that you are all the very bunch of cheats and liars i ve just been speaking about  you ve all pressed yourselves in here in order to listen in and snoop 58 the trial wanted to learn how to trap an innocent man  well  i hope you haven t come here for nothing  i hope you ve either had some fun from someone who expected you to defend his innocence or else let go of me or i ll hit you   shouted k to a quivery old man who had pressed himself especially close so i wish you good luck in your trade   he briskly took his hat from where it lay on the edge of the table and  surrounded by a silence caused perhaps by the completeness of their as he was waiting for him at the doorway  one moment   he said
k
stood where he was  but looked at the door with his hand already on its handle rather than at the judge
 i merely wanted to draw your attention    said the judge   to something you seem not yet to be aware of  today  you have robbed yourself of the advantages that a hearing of this sort always gives to someone who is under arrest   k
laughed towards the door
 you bunch of louts   he called   you can keep all your hearings as a present from me   then opened the door and hurried down the steps
behind him  the noise of the assembly rose as it became lively once more and probably began to discuss these events as if making a scientific study of them
free ebooks at planet ebook com 59 in the empty courtroom the student the offices every day over the following week  k
expected another summons to arrive  he could not believe that his rejection of any more hearings had been taken literally  and when the expected summons really had not come by saturday evening he took it to mean that he was expected  without being told  to appear at the same place at the same time
so on sunday  he set out once more in the same direction  going without hesitation up the steps and through the corridors  some of the people remembered him and greeted him from their doorways  but he no longer needed to ask anyone the way and soon arrived at the right door
it was opened as soon as he knocked and  paying no attention to the woman he had seen last time who was standing at the doorway  he was about to go straight into the adjoining room when she said to him  there s no session today 
 what do you mean  no session   he asked  unable to believe it
but the woman persuaded him by opening the door to the next room
it was indeed empty  and looked even more dismal empty than it had the previous sunday
on the 60 the trial few books laying on it
 can i have a look at those books   asked k   not because he was especially curious but so that he would not have come for nothing
 no   said the woman as she re closed the door   that s not allowed
those books belong to the examining judge    i see   said k   and nodded   those books must be law books  and that s how this court does things  not only to try people who are innocent but even to try them without letting them know what s going on    i expect you re right   said the woman  who had again  then   said k
 should i give a message to the examining judge   asked the woman
 do you know him  then   asked k
 of course i know him   said the woman   my husband is the court usher   it was only now that k
noticed that the room  which before had held nothing but a washtub  had been fitted out as a living room
the woman saw how surprised he was and said   yes  we re allowed to live here as we like  only we have to clear the room out when the court s in session
there s lots of disadvantages to my husband s job    it s not so much the room that surprises me   said k   looking at her crossly   it s your being married that shocks me    are you thinking about what happened last time the court was in session  when i disturbed what you were saying   asked the woman
 of course   said k    it s in the past now and i ve nearly forgotten about it  but at the time it made me furious
and now you tell me yourself that you are a married woman    it wasn t any disadvantage for you to have your speech interrupted
the way they talked about you after you d gone was really bad    that could well free ebooks at planet ebook com 61 be   said k   turning away   but it does not excuse you    there s no one i know who d hold it against me   said the for most people  but i am for him
i ve got no protection from him  even my husband has had to get used to it  if he wants to keep his job he s got to put up with it as that man s a student and he ll almost certainly be very powerful later on
he s always after me  he d only just left when you arrived    that fits in with everything else   said k    i m not surprised    do you want to make things a bit better here   the woman asked slowly  watching him as if she were saying something that could be as dangerous for k
as for herself
 that s what i thought when i heard you speak  i really liked what you said
mind you  i only heard part of it  i missed the beginning of it and at the end i was lying on the floor with the student
it s so horrible here   she said after a pause  and took hold of k  s hand
 do you believe you really will be able to make things better   k
smiled and twisted his hand round a little in her soft hands
 it s really not my job to make things better here  as you put it   he said   and if you said that to the examining judge he would laugh at you or punish you for it
i really would not have become involved in this matter if i could have helped it  and i would have lost no sleep worrying about how this court needs to be made better
but because i m told that i have been arrested and i am under arrest it forces me to take some some service to you in the process i will  of course  be glad 62 the trial to do so
and i will be glad to do so not only for the sake of charity but also because you can be of some help to me    how could i help you  then   said the woman
 you could  for example  show me the books on the table there    yes  certainly   the woman cried  and pulled k
along behind her as she rushed to them
the books were old and well worn  the cover of one of them had nearly broken through in its middle  and it was held together with a few threads
 everything is so dirty here   said k   shaking his head  and before he could pick the books up the woman wiped some of the dust off with her apron
k
took hold of the book that lay on top and threw it open  an indecent picture appeared
a man and a woman sat naked on a sofa  the base intent of whoever drew it was easy to see but he had been so grossly lacking in skill that all that anyone could really make out were the man and the woman who dominated the picture with their bodies  sitting in overly upright postures that created a false perspective and made it difficult for them to approach each other
k
didn t thumb through that book any more  but just threw open the next one at its title page  it was a novel with the title  what grete suffered from her husband  hans
 so this is the sort of law book they study here   said k    this is the sort of person sitting in judgement over me    i can help you   said the woman   would you like me to    could you really do that without placing yourself in danger  you did say earlier on that your husband is wholly dependent on his superiors    i still want to help you   said the woman   come over here  we ve got to talk about it
don t say any more about what danger i m in  i only fear free ebooks at planet ebook com 63 danger where i want to fear it
come over here   she pointed to the podium and invited him to sit down on the step with her
 you ve got lovely dark eyes   she said after they had sat down  looking up into k  s face   people say i ve got nice eyes too  but yours are much nicer
it was the first thing i noticed when you first came here
that s even why i came in here  into the assembly room  afterwards  i d never normally do that  i m not really even allowed to   so that s what all this is about  thought k   she s offering herself to me  she s as degenerate as everything else around here  she s had enough of the court officials  which is understandable i suppose  and so she approaches any stranger and makes compliments about his eyes
with that  k
stood up in silence as if he had spoken his thoughts out loud and thus explained his only know the lower employees  and there are crowds of them milling about here
i m sure you re very familiar with them and could achieve a great deal through them  i ve no doubt of that  but the most that could be done through them would have no bearing at all on the final outcome of the trial
you  on the other hand  would lose some of your friends as a result  and i have no wish of that
carry on with these people in the same way as you have been  as it does seem to me to be something you cannot do without
i have no regrets in saying this as  in return for your compliment look at me as sadly as you are now  although you really have 64 the trial no reason to do so
you belong to the people i have to combat  and you re very comfortable among them  you re even in love with the student  or if you don t love him you do at least prefer him to your husband
it s easy to see that from what you ve been saying    no   she shouted  remained sitting where she was and grasped k  s hand  which he failed to pull away fast enough
 you can t go away now  you can t go away when you ve misjudged me like that  are you really capable of going away now  am i really so worthless that you won t even do me the favour of staying a little bit longer    you misunderstand me   said k   sitting back down   if it s really important to you for me to stay here then i ll be glad to do so  i have plenty of time  i came here thinking there would be a trial taking place
all i meant with what i said just now was to ask you not to do anything on my behalf in the proceedings against me
but even that is nothing for you to worry about when you consider that there s nothing hanging on the outcome of this trial  and that  whatever the verdict  i will just laugh at it
and that s even presupposing it ever even reaches any conclusion  which i very much doubt
i think it s much more likely that the court officials will be too lazy  too forgetful  or even to fearful ever to continue with these proceedings and that they will soon be abandoned if they haven t been abandoned already
it s even possible that they will pretend to be carrying on with the trial in the hope of receiving a large bribe  although i can tell you now that that will be quite in vain as i pay bribes to no one
perhaps one favour you could do me would be to tell the examining judge  or anyone else who likes to spread free ebooks at planet ebook com 65 important news  that i will never be induced to pay any sort of bribe through any stratagem of theirs and i m sure they have many stratagems at their disposal there is no prospect of that  you can tell them that quite openly
and what s more  i expect they have already noticed themselves  or even if they haven t  this affair is really not so important to me as they think those gentlemen would only save some work for themselves  or at least some unpleasantness for me  which  however  i am glad to endure if i know that each piece of unpleasantness for me is a blow against them and was the first one i thought of when i offered to help you
i didn t know he s only a minor official  but if you say so it must be true
mind you  i still think the report he gives to his superiors must have some influence
and he writes so many reports
you say these officials are lazy  but they re certainly not all lazy  especially this examining judge  he writes ever such a lot
last sunday  for instance  that session went on till the evening
everyone had gone  but the examining judge  he stayed in the hall  i had to bring him a lamp in  all i had was a little kitchen lamp but he was very satisfied with it and started to write straight away
meantime my husband arrived  he always has the day off on sundays  we got the furniture back in and got our room sorted out and then a few of the neighbours came  we sat and talked for a bit by a candle  in short  we forgot all about the examining judge and went to bed
all of a sudden in the night  it must have been quite late in the night  i wakes up  next to the bed  66 the trial there s the examining judge shading the lamp with his hand so that there s no light from it falls on my husband  he didn t need to be as careful as that  the way my husband sleeps the light wouldn t have woken him up anyway
i was quite shocked and nearly screamed  but the judge was very friendly  warned me i should be careful  he whispered to me he s been writing all this time  and now he s brought me the lamp back  and he ll never forget how i looked when he found me there asleep
what i mean  with all this  i just wanted to tell you how the examining judge really does write lots of reports  especially about you as questioning you was definitely one of the main things on the agenda that sunday
if he writes reports as long as that they must be of some importance
and besides all that  you can see from what happened that the examining judge is after me  and it s right now  when he s first begun to notice me  that i can have a lot of influence on him
and i ve got other proof i mean a lot to him  too
yesterday  he sent that student to me  the one he really trusts and who he works with  he sent him with a present for me  silk stockings
he said it was because i clear up in the courtroom but that s only a pretence  that job s no more than what i m supposed to do  it s what my husband gets paid for
nice stockings  they are  look   she stretched out her leg  drew her skirt up to her knee and looked  herself  at the stocking  they are nice stockings  but they re too good for me  really   she suddenly interrupted herself and lay her hand on k  s as if she wanted to calm him down  and whispered   be quiet  berthold is watching us   k slowly looked up
in the free ebooks at planet ebook com 67 doorway to the courtroom stood a young man  he was short  his legs were not quite straight  and he continually moved his finger round in a short  thin  red beard with which he hoped to make himself look dignified k
looked at him with some curiosity  he was the first student he had ever met of the unfamiliar discipline of jurisprudence  face to face at least  a man who would even most likely attain high office one day
the student  in contrast  seemed to take no notice of k
at all  he merely withdrew his finger from his beard long enough to beckon to the woman and went over to the window  the woman leant over to k
and whispered   don t be cross with me  please don t  and please don t think ill of me either  i ve got to go to him now  to this horrible man  just look at his bent legs
but i ll come straight back and then i ll go with you if you ll take me  i ll go wherever you want  you can do whatever you like with me  i ll be happy if i can be away from here for as long as possible  it d be best if i could get away from here for good   she stroked k  s hand once more  jumped up and ran over to the window
before he realised it  k
grasped for her hand but failed to catch it
not give in to her allure
it briefly crossed his mind that the woman meant to entrap him on behalf of the court  but that was an objection he had no difficulty in fending off
in what way could she entrap him  was he not still free  so free that he could crush the entire court whenever he wanted  as least where it concerned him  could he not have that much confidence in himself  and her offer of help sounded sincere  68 the trial and maybe it wasn t quite worthless and maybe there was no better revenge against the examining judge and his cronies than to take this woman from him and have her for himself maybe then  after much hard work writing dishonest reports about k   the judge would go to the woman s bed late one night and find it empty
and it would be empty because she belonged to k   because this woman at the window  this lush  supple  warm body in its sombre clothes of rough  heavy material belonged to him  totally to him and to him alone
once he had settled his thoughts towards the woman in this way  he began to find the quiet conversation at the window was taking too long  he rapped on the podium with his knuckles  and then even with his fist
the student briefly looked away from the woman to glance at k
over his even pressed himself close to the woman and put his arms around her she dropped her head down low as if listening to him carefully  as she did so he kissed her right on the neck  hardly even interrupting what he was saying
k
saw this as confirmation of the tyranny the student held over the woman and which she had already complained about  he stood up and walked up and down the room
glancing sideways at the student  he wondered what would be the quickest possible way to get rid of him  and so it was not unwelcome to him when the student  clearly disturbed by k  s to ing and fro ing which k
had now developed into a stamping up and down  said to him   you don t have to stay here  you know  if you re getting impatient
you could have free ebooks at planet ebook com 69 should have gone  you should have left as quickly as possible as soon as i got here   this comment could have caused all possible rage to break out between them  but k
also bore in mind that this was a prospective court official speaking to a disfavoured defendant  and he might well have been taking pride in speaking in this way
k
remained standing quite close to him and said with a smile   you re quite right  i am impatient  but the easiest way to settle this impatience would be if you left us
on the other hand  if you ve come here to study you are a student  i hear i ll be quite happy to leave the room to you and go away with the woman
i m sure you ll still have a lot of study to do before you re made into a judge
it s true that i m still not all that familiar with your branch of jurisprudence but i take it it involves a lot more than speaking roughly and i see you have no shame in doing that extremely well    he shouldn t have been allowed to move about so freely   said the student  as if he wanted to give the woman an explanation for k  s insults   that was a mistake
i ve told the examining judge so
he should at least have been detained in his room between hearings
sometimes it s impossible to understand what the judge thinks he s doing    you re wasting your breath   said k   then he reached his hand out towards the woman and said   come with me    so that s it   said the student   oh no  you re not going to get her   and with a strength you would not have expected from him  he glanced tenderly at her  lifted her up on one arm and  his back bent under the weight  ran with her to the door
in this way he showed  unmistakeably  that he was to some extent afraid of k   but he nonetheless dared 70 the trial to provoke him still further by stroking and squeezing the woman s arm with his free hand
k
ran the few steps up to him  but when he had reached him and was about to take hold of him and  if necessary  throttle him  the woman said   it s no good  it s the examining judge who s sent for me  i daren t go with you  this little bastard …   and here she ran her hand over the student s face   this little bastard won t let me    and you don t want to be set free   shouted k   laying his hand on the student s shoulder  who then snapped at it with his teeth
 no   shouted the woman  pushing k
away with both hands   no  no don t do that  what d you think you re doing   that d be the end of me
let go of him  please just let go of him
he s only carrying out the judge s orders  he s carrying me to him    let him take you then  and i want to see nothing more of you   said k   enraged by his disappointment and giving the student a thump in the back so that he briefly stumbled and then  glad that he had not fallen  immediately jumped up all the higher with his burden
k
followed them slowly
he realised that this was the first unambiguous setback he had suffered from these people
it was of course nothing to worry about  he accepted the setback only because he was looking for a fight
if he stayed at home and carried on with his normal life he would be a thousand times superior to these people and could get any of them out of his way just with a kick
and he imagined this contemptible student  this inflated child  this knockkneed redbeard  if he were kneeling at elsa s bed wringing his hands and begging for forgiveness
k
so enjoyed imag  free ebooks at planet ebook com 71 elsa with him if ever he should get the opportunity
k
was curious to see where the woman would be taken and he hurried over to the door  the student was not likely to carry her through the streets on his arm
it turned out that the journey was far shorter
directly opposite the flat there was a narrow flight of wooden steps which probably led up to the attic  they turned as they went so that it was not possible to see where they ended
the student carried the woman up these steps  and after the exertions of running with her he was soon groaning and moving very slowly
the woman waved down at k
and by raising and lowering her shoulders she tried to show that she was an innocent party in this abduction  although the gesture did not show a lot of regret
k
watched her without expression like a stranger  he wanted to show neither that he was disappointed nor that he would easily get over his disappointment
the two of them had disappeared  but k
remained standing in the doorway
he had to accept that the woman had not only cheated him but that she had also lied to him when she said she was being taken to the examining judge
the examining judge certainly wouldn t be sitting and waiting in the attic
the wooden stairs would explain nothing to him however long he stared at them
then k
noticed a small piece of paper next to them  went across to it and read  offices 
were the court offices here  in the attic of this tenement  then  if that was how they were accommodated it 72 the trial the accused to realise how little money this court had at its disposal if it had to locate its offices in a place where the tenants of the building  who were themselves among the poorest of people  would throw their unneeded junk on the other hand  it was possible that the officials had enough money but that they squandered it on themselves rather than use it for the court s purposes going by k  s experience of them so far  that even seemed probable  except that if the court were allowed to decay in that way it would not just humiliate the accused but also give him more encouragement than if the court were simply in a state of poverty
k
also now understood that the court was ashamed to summon those it accused to the attic of this building for the initial hearing  and why it preferred to impose upon them in their own homes
what a position it was that k
found himself in  compared with the judge sitting up in the attic  k   at the bank  had a big office with an ante room  and had an enormous window through which he could look down had no secondary income from bribes and fraud  and he couldn t tell a servant to bring him a woman up to the office on his arm k   however  was quite willing to do without such things  in this life at least
k
was still looking at the notice when a man came up the stairs  looked through the open door into the living room where it was also possible to see the courtroom  and finally asked k
whether he had just seen a woman there
 you re the court usher  aren t you   asked k
 that s right   said the man   oh  yes  you re defendant k   i recognise you now as well
nice to see you here   free ebooks at planet ebook com 73 and he offered k
his hand  which was far from what k
had expected
and when k
said nothing  he added   there s no court session planned for today  though    i know that   said k
as he looked at the usher s civilian coat which  beside its ordinary buttons  displayed two gilded ones as the only sign of his office and seemed to have been taken from an old army officer s coat
 i was speaking with your wife a little while ago
she is no longer here
the student has carried her off to the examining judge    listen to this   said the usher   they re always carrying her away from me
it s sunday today  and it s not part of my job to do any work today  but they send me off with some message which isn t even necessary just to get me away from here
what they do is they send me off not too far away so that i can still hope to get back on time if i really hurry
so off i go running as fast as i can  shout the message through the crack in the door of the office i ve been sent to  so out of breath they ll hardly be able to understand it  run back here again  but the student s been even faster than i have well he s got less far to go  he s only got to run down the steps
if i wasn t so dependent on them i d have squashed the student against the wall here a long time ago
right here  next to the sign
i m always dreaming of doing that
just here  just above the floor  that s where he s crushed onto the wall  his arms stretched out  his fingers spread apart  his crooked legs twisted round into a circle and blood squirted out all around him it s only ever been a dream so far  though    is there nothing else you do   asked k with a smile
 nothing that i know of   said the usher
 and it s going to get even worse now  up till now he s only 74 the trial been carrying her off for himself  now he s started carrying her off for the judge and all  just like i d always said he would    does your wife  then  not share some of the responsibility   asked k he had to force himself as he asked this question  as he  too  felt so jealous now  course she does   said the usher   it s more her fault than theirs
it was her who attached herself to him
all he did  he just chases after any woman
there s five flats in this block alone where he s been thrown out after working his way in there
and my wife is the best looking woman in the whole building  but it s me who s not even allowed to defend himself    if that s how things are  then there s nothing that can be done   said k  well why not   asked the usher
 he s a coward that student  if he wants to lay a finger on my wife all you d have to do is give him such a good hiding he d never dare do it again
but i m not allowed to do that  and nobody else is going to do me the favour as they re all afraid of his power
the only one who could do it is a man like you    what  how could i do it   asked k
in astonishment
 well you re facing a charge  aren t you   said the usher
 yes  but that s all the more reason for me to be afraid
even if he has no influence on the outcome of the trial he probably has some as if k  s view had been just as correct as his own
 only we don t usually get any trials heard here with no hope at all    i am not of the same opinion   said k    although that ought not to prevent me from dealing with the student if the opportunity arises    i would be very grateful to you   said the usher of the court  somewhat formally  not really free ebooks at planet ebook com 75 seeming to believe that his highest wish could be fulfilled
 perhaps   continued k    perhaps there are some other officials of yours here  perhaps all of them  who would deserve the same    oh yes  yes   said the usher  as if this was a matter of course
then he looked at k
trustingly which  despite all his friendliness  he had not done until then  and added   they re always rebelling   but the conversation seemed to have become a little uncomfortable for him  as he broke it off by saying   now i have to report to the office
would you like to come with me    there s nothing for me to do there   said k
 you d be able to have a look at it
no one will take any notice of you    is it worth seeing then   asked k
hesitatingly  although he felt very keen to go with him
 well   said the usher   i thought you d be interested in it    alright then   said k
finally   i ll come with you   and  quicker than the usher himself  he ran up the steps at the entrance he nearly fell over  as behind the door there was another step
 they don t show much concern for the public   he said
 they don t show any concern at all   said the usher   just look at the waiting room here   it consisted of a long corridor from which roughly made doors led out to the separate departments of the attic
there was no direct source of light but it was not entirely dark as many of the departments  instead of solid walls  had just wooden bars reaching up to the ceiling to separate them from the corridor
the light made its way in through them  and it was also possible to see individual officials through them as they sat writing at their desks or stood up at the wooden frameworks and watched the people on the corridor through the 76 the trial gaps
there were only a few people in the corridor  probably because it was sunday
they were not very impressive
they sat  equally spaced  on two rows of long wooden benches which had been placed along both sides of the corridor
all of them were carelessly dressed although the expressions on their faces  their bearing  the style of their beards and many details which were hard to identify showed that they belonged to the upper classes
there were no coat hooks for them to use  and so they had placed their hats under the bench  each probably having followed the example of the others
when those who were sitting nearest the door saw k
and the usher of the court they stood up to greet them  and when the others saw that  they also thought they had to greet them  so that as the two of them went by all the people there stood up
none of them stood properly upright  their backs were bowed  their knees bent  they stood like beggars on the street
k
waited for the usher  who was following just behind him
 they must all be very dispirited   he said
 yes   said the usher   they are the accused  everyone you see here has been accused    really   said k
 they re colleagues of mine then   and he turned to the nearest one  a tall  thin man with hair that was nearly grey
 what is it you are waiting for here   asked k   politely  but the man was startled at being spoken to unexpectedly  which was all the more pitiful to see because the man clearly had some experience of the world and elsewhere would certainly have been able to show his superiority and would not have easily given up the advantage he had acquired
here  though  he did not know what answer to give to such a simple ques  free ebooks at planet ebook com 77 tion and looked round at the others as if they were under some obligation to help him  and as if no one could expect any answer from him without this help
then the usher of the court stepped forward to him and  in order to calm him down and raise his spirits  said   the gentleman here s only asking what it is you re waiting for
you can give him an answer   the voice of the usher was probably familiar to him  and had a better effect than k  s
 i m … i m waiting …  he began  and then came to a halt
he had clearly chosen this beginning so that he could give a precise answer to the question  but now he didn t know how to continue
some of the others waiting had come closer and stood round the group  the usher of the court said to them   get out the way  keep the gangway free   they moved back slightly  but not as far as where they had been sitting before
in the meantime  the man whom k
had first approached had pulled himself together and even answered him with a smile  a month ago i made some applications for evidence to be heard in my case  and i m waiting for it to be settled    you certainly seem to be going to a lot of effort   said k
 yes   said the man   it is my affair after all    not everyone thinks the same way as you do   said k
 i ve been indicted as well but i swear on my soul that i ve neither submitted evidence nor done anything else of the sort
do you really think that s necessary    i him and therefore probably thought it best to repeat his earlier answer in order to avoid making any new mistakes
with k
looking at him impatiently  he just said   as far as 78 the trial i m concerned  i ve applied to have this evidence heard    perhaps you don t believe i ve been indicted   asked k
 oh  please  i certainly do   said the man  stepping slightly to one side  but there was more anxiety in his answer than belief
 you don t believe me then   asked k   and took hold of his arm  unconsciously prompted by the man s humble demeanour  and as if he wanted to force him to believe him
but he did not want to hurt the man and had only taken hold of him very lightly
nonetheless  the man cried out as if k
had grasped him not with two fingers but with red hot tongs
shouting in this ridiculous way finally made k
tired of him  if he didn t believe he was indicted then so much the better  maybe he even thought k
was a judge
and before leaving  he held him a lot harder  shoved him back onto the bench and walked on
 these defendants are so sensitive  most of them   said the usher of the court
almost all of those who had been waiting had now assembled around the man who  by now  had stopped shouted and they seemed to be asking him lots of precise questions about the incident
k
was approached by a security guard  identifiable mainly by his sword  of which the scabbard seemed to be made of aluminium
this greatly surprised k   and he reached out for it with his hand
the guard had come because of the shouting and asked what had been happening
the usher of the court said a few words to try and calm him down but the guard explained that he had to look into it himself  saluted  and hurried on  walking with very short steps  probably because of gout k
didn t concern himself long with the guard or these free ebooks at planet ebook com 79 people  especially as he saw a turning off the corridor  about half way along it on the right hand side  where there was no door to stop him going that way he asked the usher whether that was the right way to go  the usher nodded  and that is the way that k
went
the usher remained always one or two steps behind k  which he found irritating as in a place like this it could give the impression that he was being driven along by someone who had arrested him  so he frequently waited for the usher to catch up  but the usher always remained behind him
in order to put an end to his discomfort  k
finally said   now that i ve seen what it looks like here  i d like to go    you haven t seen everything yet   said the usher ingenuously
 i don t want to see everything   said k   who was also feeling very tired   i want to go  what asked the usher in amazement   you go down this way to the corner  then right down the corridor straight ahead as far as the door    come with me   said k    show me the way  i ll miss it  there are so many different ways here    it s the only way there is   said the usher  who had now started to sound quite reproachful   i can t go back with you again  i ve got to hand in my report  and i ve already lost a lot of time because of you as it is    come with me   k
repeated  now somewhat sharper as if he had finally caught the usher out in a lie
 don t shout like that   whispered the usher   there s offices all round us here
if you don t want to go back by yourself come on a bit further with me or else wait here till i ve sorted out my report  then i ll be glad to go back with you again    no  no   said k    i will not wait and 80 the trial you must come with me now   k
had still not looked round at anything at all in the room where he found himself  and it was only when one of the many wooden doors all around him opened that he noticed it a young woman  probably  what is it the gentleman wants   in the darkness behind her there was also a man approaching
k
looked at the usher
he had  after all  said that no one would take any notice of k   and now there were two people coming  it only needed a few and everyone in the office would become aware of him and asking for explanations as to why he was there
the only understandable and acceptable thing to say was that he was accused of something and wanted to know the date of his next hearing  but this was an explanation he did not want to give  especially as it was not true he had only come out of curiosity
or else  an explanation even less usable  he could say that he wanted to ascertain that the court was as revolting on the inside as it was on the outside
and it did seem that he had been quite right in this supposition  he had no wish to intrude any deeper  he was disturbed enough by what he had seen already  he was not in the right frame of mind just then to face a high official such as might appear from behind any door  and he wanted to go  either with the usher of the court or  if needs be  alone
but he must have seemed very odd standing there in silence  and the young woman and the usher were indeed looking at him as if they thought he would go through some major metamorphosis any second which they didn t want to miss seeing
and in the doorway stood the man whom free ebooks at planet ebook com 81 k
had noticed in the background earlier  he held firmly on to the beam above the low door swinging a little on the tips of his feet as if becoming impatient as he watched
but the young woman was the first to recognise that k  s behaviour was caused by his feeling slightly unwell  she brought a chair and asked   would you not like to sit down   k
sat down immediately and  in order to keep his place better  put his elbows on the armrests  you re a little bit dizzy  aren t you   she asked him
her face was now close in front of him  it bore the severe expression that many young women have just when they re in the bloom of their youth
 it s nothing for you to worry about   she said   that s nothing unusual here  almost everyone gets an attack like that the first time they come here
this is your first time is it  yes  it s nothing unusual then
the sun burns down on the roof and the hot wood makes the air so thick and heavy
it makes this place rather unsuitable for offices  whatever other advantages it might offer
but the air is almost impossible to breathe on days when there s a lot of business  and that s almost every day
and when you think that there s a lot of washing put out to dry here as well and we can t stop the tenants doing that it s not surprising you started to feel unwell
but you get used to the air alright in the end
when you re here for the second or third time you ll hardly notice how oppressive the air is
are you feeling any better now   k
made no answer  he felt too embarrassed at being put at the mercy of these people by his sudden weakness  and learning the reason for feeling ill made him feel not better but a little worse
the girl noticed it straight away  and to make the air fresher 82 the trial for k   she took a window pole that was leaning against the wall and pushed open a small hatch directly above k  s head that led to the outside
but so much soot fell in that the girl had to immediately close the hatch again and clean the soot off k  s hands with her handkerchief  as k
was too tired to do that for himself he would have liked just to sit quietly where he was until he had enough strength to leave  and the less fuss people made about him the sooner that would be
but then the girl said   you can t stay here  we re in people s way here …  k
looked at her as if to ask whose way they were impeding
 if you like  i can take you to the sick room   and turning to the man in the doorway said   please help me 
the man immediately came over to them  but k
did not want to go to the sick room  that was just what he wanted to avoid  being led further from place to place  the further he went the more difficult it must become
so he said   i am able to walk now   and stood up  shaking after becoming used to sitting so comfortably
but then he was unable to stay upright
 i can t manage it   he said shaking his head  and sat down again with a sigh
he remembered the usher who  despite everything  would have been able to lead him out of there but who seemed to have gone long before
k
looked out between the man and the young woman who were standing in front of him but was unable to find the usher
 i think   said the man  who was elegantly dressed and whose appearance was made especially impressive with a grey waistcoat that had two long  sharply tailored points   the gentleman is feeling unwell because of the atmosphere here  so the best thing  and what he would most prefer  free ebooks at planet ebook com 83 would be not to take him to the sick room but get him out of the offices altogether    that s right   exclaimed k   with such joy that he nearly interrupted what the man was saying   i m sure that ll make me feel better straight away  i m really not that weak  all i need is a little support under my arms  i won t cause you much trouble  it s not such a long way anyway  lead me to the door and then i ll sit on the stairs for a while and soon recover  as i don t suffer from attacks like this at all  i m surprised at it myself i also work in an office and i m quite used to office air  but here it seems to be too strong  you ve said so yourselves so please  be so kind as to help me on my way a little  i m feeling dizzy  you see  and it ll make me ill if i stand up by myself   and with that he raised his shoulders to make it easier for the two of them to take him by the arms the man  however  didn t follow this suggestion but just stood there with his hands in his trouser pockets and laughed out loud
 there  you see   he said to the girl   i was quite right
the gentleman is only unwell here  and not in general   the young woman smiled too  but lightly tapped the man s arm with the tips of her fingers as if he had allowed himself too much fun with k  so what do you think  then   said the man  still laughing   i really do want to lead the gentleman out of here    that s alright  then   said the girl  briefly inclining her charming head
 don t worry too much about him laughing   said the girl to k   who had become unhappy once more and stared quietly in front of himself as if needing no further explanation  this gentleman may i introduce you    the man gave his permission 84 the trial with a wave of the hand   so  this gentleman s job is to give out information
he gives all the information they need to people who are waiting  as our court and its offices are not very well known among the public he gets asked for quite a lot
he has an answer for every question  you can try him out if you feel like it
but that s not his only distinction  his other distinction is his elegance of dress
we  that s to say all of us who work in the offices here  we decided that the information giver would have to be elegantly dressed as he continually has to deal with the litigants and he s the first one they meet  so he needs to give a dignified first impression
the rest of us i m afraid  as you can see just by looking at me  dress very badly and old fashioned  and there s not much point in spending much on clothes anyway  as we hardly ever leave the offices  we even sleep here
but  as i said  we decided that the information giver would have to have nice clothes
as the management here is rather peculiar in this respect  and they would get them for us  we had a collection some of the litigants contributed too and bought him these lovely clothes and some others besides
so everything would be ready for him to give a good impression  except that he spoils it again by laughing and frightening people    that s how it is   said the man  mocking her   but i don t understand why it is that you re explaining all our you re pressing them on him  as i m sure he s not all interested
just look at him sitting there  it s clear he s occupied with his own affairs   k
just did not feel like contradicting him 
the girl s intention may have been good  perhaps she free ebooks at planet ebook com 85 chance to collect himself  but the attempt had not worked  i had to explain to him why you were laughing   said the girl
 i suppose it was insulting    i think he would forgive even worse insults if i finally took him outside   k
said nothing  did not even look up  he tolerated the two of them negotiating over him like an object  that was even what suited him best
but suddenly he felt the information giver s hand on one arm and the young woman s hand on the other
 up you get then  weakling   said the information giver
 thank you both very much   said k   pleasantly surprised  as he slowly rose and personally guided these unfamiliar hands to the places where he most needed support
as they approached the corridor  the girl said quietly into k  s ear   i must seem to think it s very important to show the information giver in a good light  but you shouldn t doubt what i say  i just want to say the truth
he isn t hard hearted
it s not really his job to help litigants outside if they re unwell but he s doing it anyway  as you can see
i don t suppose any of us is hard hearted  perhaps we d all like to be helpful  but working for the court offices it s easy for us to give the impression we are hard hearted and don t want to help anyone
it makes me quite sad    would you not like to sit down here a while   asked the information giver  there were already in the corridor and just in front of the defendant whom k
had spoken to earlier
k
felt almost ashamed to be seen by him  earlier he had stood so upright in front of him and now he had to be supported by two others  his hat was held up by the information giver balanced on outstretched 86 the trial fingers  his hair was dishevelled and hung down onto the sweat on his forehead but the defendant seemed to notice nothing of what was going on and just stood there humbly  as if wanting to apologise to the information giver for being there
the information giver looked past him
 i know   he said   that my case can t be settled today  not yet  but i ve come in anyway  i thought  i thought i could wait here anyway  it s sunday today  i ve got plenty of time  and i m not disturbing anyone here    there s no need to be so apologetic   said the information giver   it s very commendable for you to be so attentive
you are taking up space here when you don t need to but as long as you don t get in my way i will do nothing to stop you following the progress of your case as closely as you like
when one has seen so many people who shamefully neglect their cases one learns to show patience with people like you
do sit down    he s very good with the litigants   whispered the girl
k
nodded  but started to move off again when the information giver repeated   would you not like to sit down here a while    no   said k    i don t want to rest   he had said that with as decisively to sit down
it was as if he were suffering sea sickness
he felt as if he were on a ship in a rough sea  as if the water were hitting against the wooden walls  a thundering from the depths of the corridor as if the torrent were crashing over it  as if the corridor were swaying and the waiting litigants on each side of it rising and sinking
it made the calmness of the girl and the man leading him all the more incomprehensible
he was at their mercy  if they let go of him he free ebooks at planet ebook com 87 would fall like a board
their little eyes glanced here and there  k
could feel the evenness of their steps but could not do the same  as from step to step he was virtually being carried
he finally noticed they were speaking to him but he did not understand them  all he heard was a noise that filled all the space and through which there seemed to be an unchanging higher note sounding  like a siren
 louder   he whispered with his head sunk low  ashamed at having to ask them to speak louder when he knew they had spoken loudly enough  even if it had been  for him  incomprehensible
at last  a draught of cool air blew in his face as if a gap had been torn out in the wall in front of him  and next to him he heard someone say   first he says he wants to go  and then you can tell him a hundred times that this is the way out and he doesn t move   k
became aware that he was standing in front of the way out  and that the young woman had opened the door
it seemed to him that all his strength returned to him at once  and to get a foretaste of freedom he stepped straight on to one of the stairs and took his leave there of his companions  who bowed to him
 thank you very much   he repeated  shook their hands once more and did not let go until he thought he saw that they found it hard to bear the comparatively fresh air from the stairway after being so long used to the air in the offices
they were hardly able to reply  and the young woman might even have fallen over if k
had not shut the door extremely fast
k
then stood still for a while  combed his hair with the help of a pocket mirror  picked up his hat from the next stair the information giver must have thrown it down there and then he ran 88 the trial down the steps so fresh and in such long leaps that the contrast with his previous state nearly frightened him
his normally sturdy state of health had never prepared him for surprises such as this
did his body want to revolt and cause him a new trial as he was bearing the old one with such little effort  he did not quite reject the idea that he should see a doctor the next time he had the chance  but whatever he did and this was something on which he could advise himself he wanted to spend all sunday mornings in future better than he had spent this one free ebooks at planet ebook com 89 miss burstner s friend for some time after this  k
found it impossible to exchange even just a few words with miss burstner
he tried to reach her in many and various ways but she always found a way to avoid it
he would come straight home from the office  remain in her room without the light on  and sit watch on the empty hallway
if the maid went by and closed the door of the apparently empty room he would get up after a while and open it again
he got up an hour earlier than usual in the morning so that he might perhaps find miss burstner alone as she went to the office
but none of these efforts brought any success
then he wrote her a letter  both to the office and the flat  attempting once more to justify his behaviour  offered to make whatever amends he could  promised never to cross whatever boundary she might set him and begged merely to have the chance to speak to her some time  especially as he was unable to do anything with mrs grubach either until he had spoken with miss burstner  he finally informed her that the following sunday he would stay in his room all day waiting for a sign from her that there was some hope of his request being fulfilled  or at least that she would explain to him why she could not 90 the trial fulfil it even though he had promised to observe whatever stipulations she might make the letters were not returned  but there was no answer either
however  on the following sunday there was a sign that seemed clear enough
it was still early when k
noticed  through the keyhole  that soon abated
a french teacher  although she was german and called montag  a pale and febrile girl with a slight limp who had previously occupied a room of her own  was moving into miss burstner s room
she could be seen shuffling through the hallway for several hours  there was always another piece of clothing or a blanket or a book that she had forgotten and had to be fetched specially and brought into the new home when mrs grubach brought k his breakfast ever since the time when she had made k
so cross she didn t trust the maid to do the slightest job he had no choice but to speak to her  for the first time in five days
 why is there so much noise in the hallway today   he asked as she poured his coffee out   can t something be done about it  does this clearing out have to be done on a sunday   k
did not look up at mrs grubach  but he saw nonetheless that she seemed to feel some relief as she breathed in even sharp questions like this from mr k
she perceived as forgiveness  or as the beginning of forgiveness
 we re not clearing anything out  mr k    she said   it s just that miss montag is moving in with miss burstner and is moving her things across   she said nothing more  but just waited to see how k
would take it and whether he would allow her to carry on speaking
free ebooks at planet ebook com 91 but k
kept her in uncertainty  took the spoon and pensively stirred his coffee while he remained silent
then he looked up at her and said   what about the suspicions you had earlier about miss burstner  have you given them up    mr k    called mrs grubach  who had been waiting for this very question  as she put her hands together and held them out towards him  i just made a chance remark and you took it so badly
i didn t have the slightest intention of offending anyone  not you or anyone else
you ve known me for long enough  mr k   i m sure you re convinced of that
you don t know how i ve been suffering for the past few days  that i should tell lies about my tenants  and you  mr k   you believed it  and said i should give you notice  give you notice   at this last outcry  mrs grubach was already choking back her tears  she raised her apron to her face and blubbered out loud  oh  don t cry mrs grubach   said k   looking out the window  he was thinking only of miss burstner and how she was accepting an unknown girl into her room  now don t cry   he said again as he turned his look back into the room where mrs grubach was still crying  i meant no harm either when i said that
it was simply a misunderstanding between us
that can happen even between old friends sometimes   mrs grubach pulled her apron down to below her eyes to see whether k really was attempting a reconciliation
 well  yes  that s how it is   said k   and as mrs grubach s behaviour indicated that the captain had said nothing he dared to add   do you really think  then  that i d want to make an enemy of you for the sake of a girl 92 the trial we hardly know    yes  you re quite right  mr k    said mrs grubach  and then  to her misfortune  as soon as she felt just a little freer to speak  she added something rather inept  i kept asking myself why it was that mr k took such an interest in miss burstner
why does he quarrel with me over her when he knows that any cross word from him and i can t sleep that night  and i didn t say anything about miss burstner that i hadn t seen with my own eyes   k
said nothing in reply  he should have chased her from the room as soon as she had opened her mouth  and he didn t want to do that
he contented himself with merely drinking his coffee and letting mrs grubach feel that she was superfluous outside  the dragging steps of miss montag could still be heard as she went from one side of the hallway to the other  do you hear that   asked k
pointing his hand at the door
 yes   said mrs grubach with a sigh   i wanted to give her some help and i wanted the maid to help her too but she s stubborn  she wants to move everything in herself i wonder at miss burstner
i often feel it s a burden for me to have miss montag as a tenant but miss burstner accepts her into her room with herself    there s nothing there for you to worry about  said k   crushing the remains of a sugar lump in his cup
 does she cause you any trouble    no   said mrs grubach   in itself it s very good to have her there  it makes another room free for me and i can let my nephew  the captain  occupy it i began to worry he might be disturbing you when i had to let him live in the living room next to you over the last few days
he s not very considerate    what an idea   said k
standing up   there s no question of that
you free ebooks at planet ebook com 93 seem to think that because i can t stand this to ing and froing of miss montag that i m over sensitive and there she goes back again   mrs grubach appeared quite powerless  should i tell her to leave moving the rest of her things over till later  then  mr k   if that s what you want i ll do it immediately    but she has to move in with miss burstner   said k
 yes   said mrs grubach  without quite understanding what k meant
 so she has to take her things over there   mrs grubach just nodded k
was irritated all the more by this dumb helplessness which  seen from the outside  could have seemed like a kind of defiance on her part
he began to walk up and down the room between the window and the door  thus depriving mrs grubach of the chance to leave  which she otherwise probably would have done just as k
once more reached the door  someone knocked at it
it was the maid  to say that miss montag would like to have a few words with mr k   and therefore requested that he come to the dining room where she was waiting for him
k
heard the maid out thoughtfully  and then looked back at the shocked mrs grubach in a way that was almost contemptuous his look seemed to be saying that k
had been expecting this invitation for miss montag for a long time  and that it was confirmation of the suffering he had been made to endure that sunday morning from mrs grubach s tenants he sent the maid back with the reply that he was on his way  then he went to the wardrobe to change his coat  and in answer to mrs grubach s gentle whining about the nuisance miss montag was causing merely asked her to clear away the breakfast things  but you ve hardly touched 94 the trial it   said mrs grubach  oh just take it away   shouted k
it seemed to him that miss montag was mixed up in everything and made it repulsive to him
as he went through the hallway he looked at the closed door of miss burstner s room
but it wasn t there that he was invited  but the dining room  to which he yanked the door open without knocking
the room was long but narrow with one window
there was only enough space available to put two cupboards at an angle in the corner by the door  and the rest of the room was entirely taken up with the long dining table which started by the door and reached all the way to the great window  which was thus made almost inaccessible
the table was already laid for a large number of people  as on sundays almost all the tenants ate their dinner here at midday
the window along one side of the table
they greeted each other in silence
then miss montag  her head unusually erect as always  said   i m not sure whether you know me   k
looked at her with a frown
 of course i do   he said   you ve been living here with mrs grubach for quite some time now    but i get the impression you don t pay much attention to what s going on in the lodging house   said miss montag  no   said k
 would you not like to sit down   said miss montag
in silence  the two of them drew chairs out from the farthest end of the table and sat down facing each other
but miss montag stood straight up again as she had left her handbag on the window sill and went to fetch it  she shuffled down the whole length of the room when she free ebooks at planet ebook com 95 came back  the handbag lightly swinging  she said   i d like just to have a few words with you on behalf of my friend
she would have come herself  but she s feeling a little unwell today
perhaps you ll be kind enough to forgive her and listen to me instead
there s anyway nothing that she could have even more than her because i m relatively impartial
would you not agree    what is there to say  then   answered k   who was tired of miss montag continuously watching his lips
in that way she took control of what he wanted to say before he said it
 miss burstner clearly refuses to grant me the personal meeting that i asked her for    that s how it is   said miss montag    or rather  that s not at all how it is  the way you put it is remarkably severe
generally speaking  meetings are neither granted nor the opposite
but it can be that meetings are considered unnecessary  and that s how it is here
now  after your comment  i can speak openly
you asked my friend  verbally or in writing  for the chance to speak with her
now my friend is aware of your reasons for asking for this meeting or at least i suppose she is and so  for reasons i know nothing about  she is quite sure that very briefly  that she made it clear to me that such a meeting could be of no benefit for yourself either  she feels that it can only have been a matter of chance that such an idea came to you  and that even without any explanations from her  you will very soon come to realise yourself  if you have not done so already  the futility of your idea
my answer to that 96 the trial is that although it may be quite right  i consider it advantageous  if the matter is to be made perfectly clear  to give you an explicit answer
i offered my services in taking on the task  and after some hesitation my friend conceded
i hope  slightest uncertainty in the least significant of matters will always remain a cause of suffering and if  as in this case  it can be removed without substantial effort  then it is better if that is done without delay    i thank you   said k
as soon as miss montag had finished
he stood slowly up  looked at her  then across the table  then out the window the house opposite stood there in the sun and went to the door
miss montag followed him a few paces  as if she did not quite trust him
at the door  however  both of them had to step first time that k
had seen him close up
he was a large man of about forty with a tanned  fleshy face
he bowed slightly  intending it also for k   and then went over to miss montag and deferentially kissed her hand
he was very elegant in the way he moved
the courtesy he showed towards miss montag made a striking contrast with the way she had been treated by k
nonetheless  miss montag did not seem to be cross with k
as it even seemed to him that she wanted to introduce the captain
k
however  did not want to be introduced  he would not have been able to show any sort of friendliness either to miss montag or to the captain  the kiss on the hand had  for k   bound them into a group which would keep him at a distance from miss burstner whilst at the same time seeming to be totally harmless and unselfish
free ebooks at planet ebook com 97 k
thought  however  that he saw more than that  he thought he also saw that miss montag had chosen a means of doing it that was good  but two edged
she exaggerated the importance of the relationship between k
and miss burstner  and above all she exaggerated the importance of asking to speak with her and she tried at the same time to make out that k
was exaggerating everything
she would be disappointed  k
did not want to exaggerate anything  he was aware that miss burstner was a little typist who would not offer him much resistance for long
in doing so he deliberately took no account of what mrs grubach had told him about miss burstner all these things were going through his mind as he left the room with hardly a polite word
he wanted to go straight to his room  but a little laugh from miss montag that he heard from the dining room behind him brought him to the idea that he might prepare a surprise for the two of them  the captain and miss montag
he looked round and listened to find out if there might be any disturbance from any of the surrounding rooms  everywhere was quiet  the only thing to be heard was the conversation from the dining room and mrs grubach s voice from the passage leading to the kitchen this seemed an opportune time  k went to miss burstner s room and knocked gently
there was no sound so he knocked again but there was still no answer in reply
was she asleep  or was she really unwell  or was she just pretending as she realised it could only be k
knocking so gently  k
assumed she was pretending and knocked harder  eventually  when the knocking brought no result  he carefully opened the door with the sense of doing 98 the trial something that was not only improper but also pointless
in the room there was no one
what s more  it looked hardly at all like the room k
had known before
against the wall there were now two beds behind one another  there were clothes piled up on three chairs near the door  a wardrobe stood open
miss burstner must have gone out while miss montag was speaking to him in the dining room
k
was not greatly bothered by this  he had hardly expected to be able to find miss burstner so easily and had made this attempt for little more reason than to spite miss montag
but that made it all the more embarrassing for him when  as he was closing the door again  he saw miss montag and the captain talking in the open doorway of the dining room
they had probably been standing there ever since k
had opened the door  they avoided seeming to observe k
but chatted lightly and followed his movements with glances  the absent minded glances to the side such as you make during a conversation
but these glances were heavy for k   and he rushed alongside the wall back into his own room
free ebooks at planet ebook com 99 the whip man one evening  a few days later  k
was walking along one of the corridors that separated his office from the main stairway he was nearly the last one to leave for home that evening  there remained only a couple of workers in the light of a single bulb in the dispatch department when he heard a sigh from behind a door which he had himself never opened but which he had always thought just led into a junk room he stood in amazement and listened again to establish whether he might not be mistaken
for a while there was silence  but then came some more sighs
his first thought was to fetch one of the servitors  it might well have been worth having a witness present  but then he was taken by an uncontrollable curiosity that make him simply yank the door open it was  as he had thought  a junk room
old  unusable forms  empty stone ink bottles lay scattered behind the entrance but in the cupboard like room itself stood three men  crouching under the low ceiling
a candle fixed on a shelf gave them light
 what are you doing here   asked k
quietly  but crossly and without thinking
one of being dressed in a kind of dark leather costume which left his neck and chest and his arms exposed he did not an  100 the trial swer
but the other two called out   mr k   we re to be beaten because you made a complaint about us to the examining judge   and now  k
finally realised that it was third man held a cane in his hand with which to beat them
 well   said k   staring at them   i didn t make any complaint  i only said what took place in my home
and your behaviour was not entirely unobjectionable  after all    mr k    said willem  while franz clearly tried to shelter behind him as protection from the third man   if you knew how badly we get paid you wouldn t think so badly of us
i ve got a family to feed  and franz here wanted to get married  you just have to get more money where you can  you can t do it just by working hard  not however hard you try
i was sorely tempted by your fine clothes  policemen aren t allowed to do that sort of thing  course they aren t  and it wasn t right of us  but it s tradition that the clothes go to the officers  that s how it s always been  believe me  and it s understandable too  isn t it  what can things like that mean for anyone unlucky enough to be arrested  but if he starts talking about it openly then the punishment has to follow    i didn t know about any of this that you ve been telling me  and i made no principle    franz   said willem  turning to the other policeman   didn t i tell you that the gentleman didn t say he wanted us to be punished  now you can hear for yourself  he didn t even know we d have to be punished    don t you let them persuade you  talking like that   said the third man to k    this punishment is both just and unavoidable   free ebooks at planet ebook com 101  don t listen to him   said willem  interrupting himself only to quickly bring his hand to his mouth when it had received a stroke of the cane   we re only being punished because you made a complaint against us nothing would have happened to us otherwise  not even if they d found out what we d done
can you call that justice  both of us  me especially  we d proved our worth as good police officers over a long period you ve got to admit yourself that as far as official work was concerned we did the job well things looked good for us  we had prospects  it s quite certain that we would ve been made whip men too  like this one  only he had the luck not to have anyone make a complaint about him  as you really don t get many complaints like that
only that s all finished now  mr k   our careers are at an end  we re going to have to do work now that s far inferior to police work and besides all this we re going to get this terrible  painful beating    can the cane really cause so much pain  then   asked k   testing the cane that the whip man swang in front of him
 we re going to have to strip off totally naked   said willem
 oh  i see   said k   looking straight at the whip man  his skin was burned brown like a sailor s  and his face showed health and vigorous
 is there then no possibility of sparing these two their beating   he asked him
 no   said the whip man  shaking his head with a laugh
 get undressed   he ordered the policemen
and to k
he said   you shouldn t believe everything they tell you  it s the fear of being beaten  it s already made them a bit weak in the head
this one here  for instance   he pointed at willem   all that he told you about his career prospects  it s 102 the trial just ridiculous
look at him  look how fat he is the first strokes of the cane will just get lost in all that fat
do you know what it is that s made him so fat  he s in the habit of  everyone that gets arrested by him  he eats their breakfast
didn t he eat up your breakfast  yeah  i thought as much
but a man with a belly like that can t be made into a whipman and never will be  that is quite out of the question    there are whip men like that   willem insisted  who had just released the belt of this trousers
 no   said the whipman  striking him such a blow with the cane on his neck that it made him wince   you shouldn t be listening to this  just get undressed    i would make it well worth your while if you would let them go   said k   and without looking at the whip man again as such matters are best carried on with both pairs of eyes turned down he pulled out his wallet
 and then you d try and put in a complaint against me  too   said the whip man   and get me flogged
no  no    now  do be reasonable   said k    if i had wanted to get these two punished i would not now be trying to buy their freedom  would i
i could simply close the door here behind me  go home and see or hear nothing more of it
but that s not what i m doing  it really is of much more importance to me to let them go free  if i had realised they would be punished  or even that they might be punished  i would never have named them in the first place as they are not the ones i hold responsible
it s the organisation that s to blame  the high officials are the ones to blame    that s how it is   shouted the policemen  who then immediately received another blow on their backs  which were by now exposed
 if free ebooks at planet ebook com 103 you had a senior judge here beneath your stick   said k   pressing down the cane as he spoke to stop it being raised once more   i really would do nothing to stop you  on the contrary  i would even pay you money to give you all the more strength    yeah  that s all very plausible  what you re saying there   said the whip man    only i m not the sort of person you can bribe
it s my job to flog people  so i flog them   franz  the policeman  had been fairly quiet so far  probably in expectation of a good result from k  s intervention  but now he stepped forward to the door wearing just his trousers  kneeled down hanging on to k  s arm and whispered   even if you can t get mercy shown for both of us  at least try and get me set free
willem is older than me  he s less sensitive than me in every way  he even got a light beating a couple of years ago  but my record s still clean  i only did things the way i did because willem led me on to it  he s been my teacher both for good and bad
down in front of the bank my poor bride is waiting for me at the entrance  i m so ashamed of myself  it s pitiful   his face was flowing over with tears  and he wiped it dry on k  s coat
 i m not going to wait any longer   said the whip man  taking hold of the cane in both hands and laying in to franz while willem cowered back in a corner and looked on secretly  not even daring to turn his head
then  the sudden scream that shot out from franz was long and irrevocable  it seemed to come not from a human being but from an instrument that was being tortured  the whole corridor rang with it  it must have been heard by everyone in the building
 don t shout like that    called out k   unable to prevent 104 the trial himself  and  as he looked anxiously in the direction from which the servitor would come  he gave franz a shove  not hard  but hard enough for him to fall down unconscious  clawing at the ground with his hands by reflex  he still did not avoid being hit  the rod still found him on the floor  the tip of the rod swang regularly up and down while he rolled to and fro under its blows and now one of the servitors appeared in the distance  with another a few steps behind him
k
had quickly thrown the door shut  gone over to one of the windows overlooking the yard and opened it
the screams had completely stopped so that the servitor wouldn t come in  he called out   it s only me    good evening  chief clerk   somebody called back
 is there anything wrong    no  no   answered k    it s only a dog yelping in the yard   there was no sound from the servitors so he added   you can go back to what you were doing   he did not want to become involved with a conversation with them  and so he leant out of the window
a little while later  when he looked out in the corridor  they had already gone
now  k
remained at the window  he did not dare go back into the junk room  and he did not want to go home either
the yard he looked down into was small and rectangular  all around it were offices  all the windows were now dark and only those at the very top caught a reflection of the moon
k tried hard to see into the darkness of one corner of the yard  where a few handcarts had been left behind one another
he felt anguish at not having been able to prevent the flogging  but that was not his fault  if franz had not screamed like that clearly it must have caused a great deal of pain but it s free ebooks at planet ebook com 105 important to maintain control of oneself at important moments if franz had not screamed then it was at least highly probable that k
would have been able to dissuade the whipman
if all the junior officers were contemptible why would the whip man  whose position was the most inhumane of all  be any exception  and k
had noticed very clearly how his eyes had lit up when he saw the banknotes  he had obviously only seemed serious about the flogging to raise the level of the bribe a little
and k
had not been ungenerous  he really had wanted to get the policemen freed  if he really had now begun to do something against the degeneracy of the court then it was a matter of course that he would have to do something here as well
but of course  it became impossible for him to do anything as soon as franz started screaming
k
could not possibly have let the junior bank staff  and perhaps even all sorts of other people  come along and catch him by surprise as he haggled with those people in the junk room
nobody could really expect that sort of sacrifice of him
if that had been his intention then it would almost have been easier  k
would have taken his own clothes off and offered himself to the whip man in the policemen s place the whip man would certainly not have accepted this substitution anyway  as in that way he would have seriously violated his duty without gaining any benefit
he would most likely have violated his duty twice over  as court employees were probably under orders not to cause any harm to k
while he was facing charges  although there may have been special conditions in force here
however things stood  k
was able to do no more than throw the door 106 the trial shut  even though that would still do nothing to remove all the dangers he faced
it was regrettable that he had given franz a shove  and it could only be excused by the heat of the moment
in the distance  he heard the steps of the servitors  he did not want them to be too aware of his presence  so he closed the window and walked towards the main staircase
at the door of the junk room he stopped and listened for a little while
all was silent
the two policemen were entirely at the whip man s mercy  he could have beaten them to death
k
reached his hand out for the door handle but drew it suddenly back
he was no longer in any position to help anyone  and the servitors would soon be back  he did  though  promise himself that he would raise the matter again with somebody and see that  as far as it was in his power  those who really were guilty  the high officials whom nobody had so far dared point out to him  received their due punishment as he went down the main stairway at the front of the bank  he looked carefully round at everyone who was passing  but there was no girl to be seen who might have been waiting for somebody  not even within some distance from the bank
franz s claim that his bride was waiting for him was thus shown to be a lie  albeit one that was forgivable and intended only to elicit more sympathy
the policemen were still on k  s mind all through the following day  he was unable to concentrate on his work and had to stay in his office a little longer than the previous day so that he could finish it
on the way home  as he passed free ebooks at planet ebook com 107 by the junk room again  he opened its door as if that had been his habit
instead of the darkness he expected  he saw everything unchanged from the previous evening  and did the same as he had seen it when he had opened the door the previous evening
the forms and bottles of ink just inside the doorway  the whip man with his cane  the two policemen  still undressed  the candle on the shelf  and the two policemen began to wail and call out  mr k    k slammed the door immediately shut  and even thumped on it with his fists as if that would shut it all the firmer
almost in tears  he ran to the servitors working quietly at the copying machine
 go and get that junk room cleared out   he shouted  and  in amazement  they stopped what they were doing
 it should have been done long ago  we re sinking in dirt   they would be able to do the job the next day  k
nodded  it was too late in the evening to make them do it there and then as he had originally intended
he sat down briefly in order to keep them near him for a little longer  looked through a few of the copies to give the impression that he was checking them and then  as he saw that they would not dare to leave at the same time as himself  went home tired and with his mind numb 108 the trial k  s uncle leni one afternoon k
was very busy at the time  getting the post ready k  s uncle karl  a small country land owner  came into the room  pushing his way between two of the staff who were bringing in some papers
k
had long expected his uncle to appear  but the sight of him now shocked k
far less than the prospect of it had done a long time before
his uncle was bound to come  k
had been sure of that for about a month
he already thought at the time he could see how his uncle would arrive  slightly bowed  his battered panama hat in his left hand  his right hand already stretched out over the desk long before he was close enough as he rushed carelessly towards k knocking over everything that was in his way
k  s uncle was always in a hurry  as he suffered from the unfortunate belief that he had a number things to do while he was in the big city and had to settle all of them in one day his visits were only ever for one day and at the same time thought he could not forgo any conversation or piece of business or pleasure that might arise by chance
uncle karl was k  s former guardian  and so k
was duty bound to help him in all of this as well as to offer him a bed for the night
 i m haunted by a ghost from the country   he would say
free ebooks at planet ebook com 109 as soon as they had greeted each other k
had invited him to sit in the armchair but uncle karl had no time for that he said he wanted to speak briefly with k
in private
 it is necessary   he said with a tired gulp   it is necessary for my peace of mind   k
immediately sent the junior staff from the room and told them to let no one in
 what s this that i ve been hearing  josef   cried k  s uncle when they were alone  as he sat on the table shoving various papers under himself without looking at them to make himself more comfortable k
said nothing  he knew what was coming  but  suddenly relieved from the effort of the work he had been doing  he gave way to a pleasant lassitude and looked out the window at the other side of the street
from where he sat  he could see just a small  triangular section of it  part of the empty walls of houses between two shop windows
 you re staring out the window   called out his uncle  raising his arms   for god s sake  josef  give me an answer  is it true  can it really be true    uncle karl   said k   wrenching himself back from his daydreaming   i really don t know what it is you want of me    josef   said his uncle in a warning tone   as far as i know  you ve always told the truth am i to take what you ve just said as a bad sign    i think i know what it is you want   said k
obediently   i expect you ve heard about my trial    that s right   answered his uncle with a slow nod   i ve heard about your trial    who did you hear it from  then   asked k
 erna wrote to me   said his you don t pay very much attention to her  i m afraid to say  but she learned about it nonetheless
i got her letter today 110 the trial and  of course  i came straight here
and for no other reason  but it seems to me that this is reason enough i can read you out the part of the letter that concerns you   he drew the letter out from his wallet
 here it is
she writes   i have not seen josef for a long time  i was in the bank last week but josef was so busy that they would not let me through  i waited there for nearly an hour but then i had to go home as i had my piano lesson
i would have liked to have spoken to him  maybe there will be a chance another time
he sent me a big box of chocolates for my name day  that was very nice and attentive of him
i forgot to tell you about it when i wrote  and i only remember now that you ask me about it
chocolate  as i am sure you are aware  disappears straight away in this lodging house  almost as soon as you know somebody has given you chocolate it is gone
but there is something else i wanted to tell you about josef
like i said  they would not let me through to see him at the bank because he was negotiating with some gentleman just then
after i had been waiting quietly for quite a long time i asked one of the staff whether his meeting would last much longer
he said it might well do  as it was probably about the legal proceedings  he said  that were being conducted against him
i asked what sort of legal proceedings it was that were being conducted against the chief clerk  and whether he was not making some mistake  but he said he was not making any mistake  there were legal proceedings underway and even that they were about something quite serious  but he did not know any more about it
he would have liked to have been of some help to the chief clerk himself  as the free ebooks at planet ebook com 111 chief clerk was a gentleman  good and honest  but he did not know what it was he could do and merely hoped there would be some influential gentlemen who would take his side i m sure that is what will happen and that everything will turn out for the best in the end  but in the mean time things do not look at all good  and you can see that from the mood of the chief clerk himself of course  i did not place too much importance on this conversation  and even did my best to put the bank clerk s mind at rest  he was quite a simple man
i told him he was not to speak to anyone else about this  and i think it is all just a rumour  but i still think it might be good if you  dear father  if you looked into the matter the next time you visit
it will be easy for you to find out more detail and  if it is really necessary  to do something about it through the great and influential people you know
but if it is not necessary  and that is what seems most likely  then at least your daughter will soon have the chance to embrace you and i look forward to it   she s a good child   said k  s uncle when he had finished reading  and wiped a few tears from his eyes k
nodded
with all the different disruptions he had had recently he had completely forgotten about erna  even her birthday  and the story of the chocolates had clearly just been invented so that he wouldn t get in trouble with his aunt and uncle
it was very touching  and even the theatre tickets  which he would regularly send her from then on  would not be enough to repay her  but he really did not feel  now  that it was right for him to visit her in her lodgings and hold conversations with a little  eighteen year old schoolgirl
 and what do you have to say about that   asked his uncle who had forgotten all his rush and excitement as he read the letter  and seemed to be about to read it again
 yes  uncle   said k    it is true    true   called out his uncle
 what is true  how can this be true  what sort of trial is it  not a criminal trial  i hope    it s a criminal trial   answered k
 and you sit quietly here while you ve got a criminal trial round your neck   shouted his uncle  getting ever louder
 the more calm i am  the better it will be for the outcome   said k
in a tired voice   don t worry    how can i help worrying    shouted his uncle   josef  my dear josef  think about yourself  about your family  think about our good name  up till now  you ve always been our pride  don t now become our disgrace
i don t like the way you re behaving   he said  looking at k
with his head at an angle   that s not how an innocent man behaves when he s accused of something  not if he s still got any strength in him
just tell me what it s all about so that i can help you
it s something to do with the bank  i take it    no   said k
as he stood up   and you re speaking too loud  uncle  i expect one of the staff is listening at the door and i find that rather unpleasant
it s best if we go somewhere else  then i can answer all your questions  as far as i can
and i know very well that i have to account to the family for what i do    you certainly do   his uncle shouted   quite right  you do
now just get a move on  josef  hurry up now    i still have a few documents i need to prepare   said k   and  using the intercom  k  s uncle  still angry and excited  gestured with his hand to show that k
had summoned him  even though there was no free ebooks at planet ebook com 113 need whatever to do so
k
stood in front of the desk and explained to the young man  who listened calm and attentive  what would need to be done that day in his absence  speaking in a calm voice and making use of various documents
the presence of k  s uncle while this was going on was quite disturbing  he did not listen to what was being said  but at first he stood there with eyes wide open and nervously biting his lips
then he began to walk up and down the room  stopped now and then at the window  or stood in front of a picture always making various exclamations such as   that is totally incomprehensible to me   or  now just tell me  what are you supposed to make of that    the young man pretended to notice nothing of this and listened to k  s instructions through to the end  he made a few notes  bowed to both k
and his uncle and then left the room
k  s uncle had turned his back to him and was looking out the window  bunching up the curtains with his outstretched hands the door had hardly closed when he called out   at last  now that he s stopped jumping about we can go too   once they were in the front hall of the bank  where several members of staff were standing about and where  just then  the deputy director was walking across  there was unfortunately no way of stopping k  s uncle from continually asking questions about the trial
 now then  josef   he began  lightly acknowledging the bows from those around them as they passed   tell me everything about this trial  what sort of trial is it   k
made a few comments which conveyed little information  even laughed a little  and it was only when they reached the front steps that he explained to his uncle 114 the trial that he had not wanted to talk openly in front of those people
 quite right   said his uncle   but now start talking   with his head to one side  and smoking his cigar in short  impatient draughts  he listened
 first of all  uncle   said k    it s not a trial like you d have in a normal courtroom    so much the worse   said his uncle
 how s that   asked k   looking at him
 what i mean is  that s for the worse   he repeated
they were standing on the front steps of the bank  as the doorkeeper seemed to be listening to what they were saying k
drew his uncle down further  where they were absorbed into the bustle of the street
his uncle took k  s arm and stopped asking questions with such urgency about the trial  they walked on for a while in silence
 but how did all this come about   he eventually asked  stopping abruptly enough to startle the people walking behind  who had to avoid walking into him
 things like this don t come all of a sudden  they start developing a long time beforehand  there must have been warning signs of it  why didn t you write to me  you know i d do anything for you  to some extent i am still your guardian  and until today that s something i was proud of
i ll still help you  of course i will  only now  now that the trial is already underway  it makes it very difficult
but whatever  the best thing now is for you to take a short holiday staying with us in the country
you ve lost weight  i can see that now
the country life will give you strength  that will be good  there s bound to be a lot of hard work ahead of you
but besides that it ll be a way of getting you away from the court  to some extent
here they ve got every means of showing the powers at their disposal and they re free ebooks at planet ebook com 115 automatically bound to use them against you  in the country they ll either have to delegate authority to different bodies or just have to try and bother you by letter  telegram or telephone
and that s bound to weaken the effect  it won t release you from them but it ll give you room to breathe    you could forbid me to leave   said k   who had been drawn slightly into his uncle s way of thinking by what he had been saying
 i didn t think you would do it   said his uncle thoughtfully   you won t suffer too much loss of power by moving away   k
grasped his uncle under the arm to prevent him stopping still and said   i thought you d think all this is less important than i do  and now you re taking it so hard    josef   called his uncle trying to disentangle himself from him so that he could stop walking  but k did not let go   you ve completely changed  you used to be so astute  are you losing it now  do you want to lose the trial  do you realise what that would mean  that would mean you would be simply destroyed
and that everyone you know would be pulled down with you or at the very least humiliated  disgraced right down to the ground
josef  pull yourself together
the way you re so indifferent about it  it s driving me mad
looking at you i can almost believe that old saying   having a trial like that means losing a trial like that     my dear uncle   said k    it won t do any good to get excited  it s no good for you to do it and it d be no good for me to do it
the case won t be won by getting excited  and please just as i have always and still do respect your experience  even when it surprises me
you say that the family will also 116 the trial be affected by this trial  i really can t see how  but that s beside the point and i m quite willing to follow your instructions in all of this
only  i don t see any advantage in staying in the country  not even for you  as that would indicate flight and a sense of guilt
and besides  although i am more subject to persecution if i stay in the city i can also press the matter forward better here    you re right   said his uncle in a tone that seemed to indicate they were finally coming closer to each other   i just made the suggestion because  as i saw it  if you stay in the city the case will be put in danger by your indifference to it  and i thought it was better if i did the work for you
but will you push things forward yourself with all your strength  if so  that will naturally be far better    we re agreed then   said k
 and do you have any suggestions for what i should do next    well  naturally i ll have to think about it   said his uncle   you must bear in mind that i ve been living in the country for twenty years now  almost without a break  you lose your ability to deal with matters like this
but i do have some important connections with several people who  i expect  know their way around these things better than i do  and to i ve been getting out of condition  i m sure you re already aware of that
it s only at times like this that you notice it yourself
and this affair of yours came largely unexpected  although  oddly enough  i had expected something of the sort after i d read erna s letter  and today when i saw your face i knew it with almost total certainty
but all that is by the by  the important thing now is  we have no time to lose   free ebooks at planet ebook com 117 even while he was still speaking  k  s uncle had stood on tiptoe to summon a taxi and now he pulled k
into the car behind himself as he called out an address to the driver  we re going now to see dr
huld  the lawyer   he said   we were at school together
i m sure you know the name  don t you  no  well that is odd
he s got a very good reputation as a defence barrister and for working with the poor
but i esteem him especially as someone you can trust    it s alright with me  whatever you do   said k   although he was made uneasy by the rushed and urgent way his uncle was dealing with the matter
it was not very encouraging  as the accused  be to taken to a lawyer for poor people
 i didn t know   he said   that you could take on a lawyer in matters like this    well of course you can   said his uncle   that goes without saying
why wouldn t you take on a lawyer  and now  so that i m properly instructed in this matter  tell me what s been happening so far   k
instantly began telling his uncle about what had been happening  holding nothing back being completely open with him was the only way that k
could protest at his uncle s belief that the trial was a great disgrace
he mentioned miss burstner s name just once and in passing  but that did nothing to diminish his openness about the trial as miss burstner had no connection with it
as he spoke  he looked out the window and saw how  just then  they were getting closer to the suburb where the court offices were
he drew this to his uncle s attention  but he did not find the coincidence especially remarkable
the taxi stopped in front of a dark building
k  s uncle knocked at the very first door at ground level  while they waited he 118 the trial smiled  showing his big teeth  and whispered   eight o clock  not the usual sort of time to be visiting a lawyer  but huld won t mind it from me   two large  black eyes appeared in the spy hatch in the door  they stared at the two visitors for a while and then disappeared  the door  however  did not they had seen the two eyes
 a new maid  afraid of strangers   said k  s uncle  and knocked again
the eyes appeared once more
this time they seemed almost sad  but the open gas flame that burned with a hiss close above their heads gave off little light and that may have merely created an illusion
 open the door   called k  s uncle  raising his fist against it   we are friends of dr
huld  the lawyer    dr
huld is ill   whispered someone behind them
in a doorway at the far end of a narrow passage stood a man in his dressing gown  giving them this information in an extremely quiet voice
k  s uncle  who had already been made very angry by the long wait  turned abruptly round and retorted   ill  you say he s ill   and strode towards the gentleman in a way that seemed almost threatening  as if he were the illness himself  they ve opened the door for you  now   said the gentleman  pointing at the door of the lawyer
he pulled his dressing gown together and disappeared
the door had indeed been opened  a young girl k
recognised the dark  slightly bulging eyes stood in the hallway in a long white apron  holding a candle in her hand
 next time  open up sooner   said k  s uncle instead of a greeting  while the girl made a slight curtsey
 come along  josef   he then said to k
who was slowly moving over towards the girl
 dr
huld free ebooks at planet ebook com 119 is unwell   said the girl as k  s uncle  without stopping  rushed towards one of the doors
k
continued to look at the girl in amazement as she turned round to block the way into the living room  she had a round face like a puppy s  not only the pale cheeks and the chin were round but the temples and the hairline were too
 josef   called his uncle once more  and he asked the girl   it s trouble with his heart  is it    i think it is  sir   said the girl  who by now had found time to go ahead with the candle and open the door into the room
in one corner of the room  where the light of the candle did not reach  a face with a long beard looked up from the bed
 leni  who s this coming in   asked the lawyer  unable to recognise his guests because he was dazzled by the candle
 it s your old friend  albert   said k  s uncle
 oh  albert   said the lawyer  falling back onto his pillow as if this visit meant he would not need to keep up appearances
 is it really as bad as that   asked k  s uncle  sitting on the edge of the bed
 i don t believe it is
it s a recurrence of your heart trouble and it ll pass over like the other times    maybe   said the lawyer quietly   but it s just as much trouble as it s ever been
i can hardly breathe  i can t sleep at all and i m getting weaker by the day    i see   said k  s uncle  pressing his panama hat firmly against his knee with his big hand
 that is bad news
but are you getting the right sort of care  and it s so depressing in here  it s so dark
it s a long time since i was last here  but it seemed to me friendlier then
even your young lady here doesn t seem to have much life in her  unless she s just pretending   the maid was still standing by the door with the candle  as far as could be 120 the trial made out  she was watching k
more than she was watching his uncle even while the latter was still speaking about her
k
leant against a chair that he had pushed near to the girl
 when you re as ill as i am   said the lawyer   you need to have peace
i don t find it depressing   after a short pause he added   and leni looks after me well  she s a good girl   but that was not enough to persuade k  s uncle  he had visibly taken against his friend s carer and  even though he did not contradict the invalid  he persecuted her with his scowl as she went over to the bed  put the candle on the bedside table and  leaning over the bed  made a fuss of him by tidying the pillows
k  s uncle nearly forgot the need to show any consideration for the man who lay ill in bed  he stood up  walked up and down behind the carer  and k
would not have been surprised if he had grabbed hold of her skirts behind her and dragged her away from the bed
k
himself looked on calmly  he was not even disappointed at finding the lawyer unwell  he had been able to do nothing to oppose the enthusiasm his uncle had developed for the matter  he was glad having to do anything about it his uncle  probably simply wishing to be offensive to the lawyer s attendant  then said   young lady  now please leave us alone for a while  i have some personal matters to discuss with my friend   dr
huld s carer was still leant far over the invalid s bed and smoothing out the cloth covering the wall next to it  she merely turned her head and then  in striking contrast with the anger that first stopped k  s uncle from speaking and then let the words out in a gush  she said very quietly   you free ebooks at planet ebook com 121 can see that dr
huld is so ill that he can t discuss any matters at all   it was probably just for the sake of convenience that she had repeated the words spoken by k  s uncle  but an onlooker might even have perceived it as mocking him and he  of course  jumped up as if he had just been stabbed
 you damned …    in the first gurglings of his excitement his words could hardly be understood  k
was startled even though he had been expecting something of the sort and ran to his uncle with the intention  no doubt  of closing his mouth with both his hands
fortunately  though  behind the girl  the invalid raised himself up  k  s uncle made an ugly face as if swallowing something disgusting and then  somewhat calmer  said   we have naturally not lost our senses  not yet  if what i am asking for were not possible i would not be asking for it now please  go   the carer stood up straight by the bed directly facing k  s uncle  k
thought he noticed that with one hand she was stroking the lawyer s hand
 you can say anything in front of leni   said the invalid  in a tone that was unmistakably imploring
 it s not my business   said k  s uncle   and it s not my secrets   and he twisted himself round as if wanting to go into no more negotiations but giving himself a little more time to think  whose business is it then   asked the lawyer in an exhausted voice as he leant back again
 my nephew s   said k  s uncle   and i ve brought him along with me   and he introduced him   chief clerk josef k    oh   said the invalid  now with much more life in him  and reached out his hand towards k
 do forgive me  i didn t notice you there at all   then he then said to his carer   leni  go   stretching his 122 the trial hand out to her as if this were a farewell that would have to last for a long time this time the girl offered no resistance
 so you   he finally said to k  s uncle  who had also calmed down and stepped closer   you haven t come to visit me because i m ill but you ve come on business   the lawyer now looked so much stronger that it seemed the idea of being visited because he was ill had somehow made him weak  he remained supporting himself of one elbow  which must have been rather tiring  and continually pulled at a lock of hair in the middle of his beard  you already look much better   said k  s uncle   now that that witch has gone outside   he interrupted himself  whispered   i bet you she s listening   and sprang over to the door but behind the door there was no one  k  s uncle came back not disappointed  as her not listening seemed to him worse than if she had been  but probably somewhat embittered
 you re mistaken about her   said the lawyer  but did nothing more to defend her  perhaps that was his way of indicating that she did not need defending
but in a tone that was much more committed he went on   as far as your nephew s affairs are concerned  this will be an extremely difficult undertaking and i d count myself lucky if my strength lasted out long enough for it  i m greatly afraid it won t do  but anyway i don t want to leave anything untried  if i don t last out you can always get somebody else
to be honest  this matters interests me too much  and i can t bring myself to give up the chance of taking some part in it
if my heart does totally give out then at least it will have found a worthy affair to fail in   k
believed he understood not a word of this entire speech  he looked at free ebooks at planet ebook com 123 his uncle for an explanation but his uncle sat on the bedside table with the candle in his hand  a medicine bottle had rolled off the table onto the floor  he nodded to everything the lawyer said  agreed to everything  and now and then looked at k
urging him to show the same compliance
maybe k  s uncle had already told the lawyer about the trial
but that was impossible  everything that had happened so far spoke against it
so he said   i don t understand …    well  maybe i ve misunderstood what you ve been saying   said the lawyer  just as astonished and embarrassed as k
 perhaps i ve been going too fast
what was it you wanted to speak to me about  i thought it was to do with your trial    of course it is   said k  s uncle  who then asked k    so what is it you want    yes  but how is it that you know anything about me and my case   asked k
 oh  i see   said the lawyer with a smile
 i am a lawyer  i move in court circles  people talk about various different cases and the more interesting ones stay in your mind  especially when they concern the nephew of a friend
there s nothing very remarkable about that    what is it you want  then   asked k  s uncle once more   you seem so uneasy about it   you move in this court s circles   asked k
 yes   said the lawyer
 you re asking questions like a child   said k  s uncle
 what circles should i move in  then  if not with members of my own discipline   the lawyer added
it sounded so indisputable that k
gave no answer at all
 but you work in the high court  not that court in the attic   he had wanted to say but 124 the trial explaining something obvious  unnecessary and incidental   you have to realise that i also derive great advantage for my clients from mixing with those people  and do so in many different ways  it s not something you can keep talking about all the time
i m at a bit of a disadvantage now  of course  because of my illness  but i still get visits from some good friends of mine at the court and i learn one or two things
it might even be that i learn more than many of those who are in the best of health and spend all day in court
and i m receiving a very welcome visit right now  for instance   and he pointed into a dark corner of the room
 where   asked k   almost uncouth in his surprise
he looked round uneasily  the little candle gave off far too little light to reach as far as the wall opposite
and then  something did indeed begin to move there in the corner
in the light of the candle held up by k  s uncle an elderly gentleman could be seen sitting beside a small table
he had been sitting there for so long without being noticed that he could hardly have been breathing
now he stood up with a great deal of fuss  clearly unhappy that attention had been drawn to him
it was as if  by flapping his hands about like short wings  he hoped to deflect any introductions and greetings  as if he wanted on no account to disturb the others by his presence and seemed to be exhorting them to leave him back in the dark and forget about his being there
that  however  was something that could no longer be granted him
 you took us by surprise  you see   said the lawyer in explanation  cheerfully indicating to the gentleman that he should come closer  which  slowly  hesitatingly  looking all free ebooks at planet ebook com 125 around him  but with a certain dignity  he did
 the office director oh  yes  forgive me  i haven t introduced you this is my friend albert k   this is his nephew  the chief clerk josef k   and this is the office director so  the office director was kind enough to pay me a visit
it s only possible to appreciate just how valuable a visit like this is if you ve been let into the secret of what a pile of work the office director has heaped over him
well  he came anyway  we were having a peaceful chat  as far as i was able when i m so weak  and although we hadn t told leni she mustn t let anyone in as we weren t expecting anyone  we still would rather have remained alone  but then along came you  albert  thumping your fists on the door  the office director moved over into the corner pulling his table and chair with him  but now it turns out we might have  that is  if that s what you wish  we might have something to discuss with each other and it would be good if we can all come back together again
office director …     he said with his head on one side  pointing with a humble smile to an armchair near the bed
 i m afraid i ll only be able to stay a few minutes more   smiled the office director as he spread himself out in the armchair and looked at the clock  business calls
but i wouldn t want to miss the chance of meeting a friend of my friend   he inclined his head slightly toward k  s uncle  who seemed very happy with his new acquaintance  but he was not the sort of person to express his feelings of deference and responded to the office director s words with embarrassed  but loud  laughter
a horrible sight  k
was able to quietly watch everything as nobody paid any attention to him  the office 126 the trial director took over as leader of the conversation as seemed to be his habit once he had been called forward  the lawyer listened attentively with his hand to his ear  his initial weakness having perhaps only had the function of driving away his new visitors  k  s uncle served as candle bearer balancing the candle on his thigh while the office director frequently glanced nervously at it and was soon free of his embarrassment and was quickly enchanted not only by the office director s speaking manner but also by the gentle  waving hand movements with which he accompanied it
k   leaning against the bedpost  was totally ignored by the office director  perhaps deliberately  and served the old man only as audience
and besides  he had hardly any idea what the conversation was about and his thoughts soon turned to the care assistant and the ill treatment she had suffered from his uncle
soon after  he began to wonder whether he had not seen the office director somewhere before  perhaps among the people who were at his first hearing
he may have been mistaken  but thought the office director might well have been among the old gentlemen with the thin beards in the first row
there was then a noise that everyone heard from the hallway as if something of porcelain were being broken
 i ll go and see what s happened   said k   who slowly left the room as if giving the others the chance to stop him
he had hardly stepped into the hallway  finding his bearings in the darkness with his hand still firmly holding the door  when another small hand  much smaller than k  s own  placed itself on his and gently shut the door
it was the carer who had free ebooks at planet ebook com 127 been waiting there
 nothing has happened   she whispered to him   i just threw a plate against the wall to get you out of there    i was thinking about you  as well   replied k
uneasily
 so much the better   said the carer
 come with me 
a few steps along  they came to a frosted glass door which the carer opened for him
 come in here   she said
it was clearly the lawyer s office  fitted out with old  heavy furniture  as far as could be seen in the moonlight which now illuminated just a small  rectangular section of the floor by each of the three big windows
 this way   said the carer  pointing to a dark trunk with a carved  wooden backrest
when he had sat down  k
continued to look round the room  it was a large room with a high ceiling  the clients of this lawyer for the poor must have felt quite lost in it
k
thought he could see the little steps with which visitors would approach the massive desk
but then he forgot about all of this and had eyes only for the carer who sat very close beside him  almost pressing him against the armrest  i did think   she said  you would come out here to me by yourself with me having to call you first
it was odd
first you stare at me as soon as you come in  and then you keep me waiting
and you ought to call me leni  too   she added quickly and suddenly  as if no moment of this conversation should be lost
 gladly   said k
 but as for its being odd  leni  that s easy to explain
firstly  i had to listen to what the old men were saying and couldn t leave without a good reason  but secondly i m not a bold person  if anything i m quite shy  and you  leni  you didn t really look like you could be won over in one stroke  either    that s not it   said leni  laying one arm on the arm  128 the trial rest and looking at k    you didn t like me  and i don t suppose you like me now  either    liking wouldn t be very much   said k   evasively
 oh   she exclaimed with a smile  thus making use of k  s comment to gain an advantage over him
so k
remained silent for a while
by now  he had become used to the darkness in the room and was able to make out various fixtures and fittings
he was especially impressed by a large picture hanging to the right of the door  he leant forward in order to see it better
it depicted a man wearing a judge s robes  he was sitting on a lofty throne gilded in a way that shone forth from the picture
the odd thing about the picture was that this judge was not sitting there in dignified calm but had his left arm pressed against the back and armrest  his right arm  however  was completely free and only grasped the armrest with his hand  as if about to jump up any moment in vigorous outrage and make some decisive comment or even to pass sentence the accused was probably meant to be imagined at the foot of the steps  the top one of which could be seen in the picture  covered with a yellow carpet
 that might be my judge   said k   pointing to the picture with one finger
 i know him   said leni looking up at the picture   he comes here quite often
that picture is from when he was young  but he can never have looked anything like it  as he s tiny  minute almost
but despite that  he had himself made to look bigger in the picture as he s madly vain  just like everyone round here but even i m vain and that makes me very unhappy that you don t like me   k
replied to that last comment merely by embracing leni and drawing her towards him  free ebooks at planet ebook com 129 she lay her head quietly on his shoulder
to the rest of it  though  he said   what rank is he    he s an examining judge   she said  taking hold of the hand with which k
held her and playing with his fingers
 just an examining judge once again   said k
in disappointment   the senior officials keep themselves hidden but here he is sitting on a throne    that s all just made up   said leni with her face bent over k  s hand   really he s sitting on a kitchen chair with an old horse blanket folded over it
but do you have to be always thinking about your trial   she added slowly
 no  not at all   said k    i probably even think too little about it    that s not the mistake you re making   said leni   you re too unyielding  that s what i ve heard    who said that   asked k   he felt her body against his chest and looked down on her rich  dark  tightly bound hair
 i d be saying too much if i told you that   answered leni
 please don t ask for names  but do stop making these mistakes of yours  stop being so unyielding  there s nothing you can do to defend yourself from this court  you have to confess
so confess to them as soon as you get the chance
it s only then that they give you the chance to get away  not till then
only  without help from outside even that s impossible  but you needn t worry about getting this help as i want to help you myself    you understand a lot about this court and what sort of tricks are needed   said k
as he lifted her  since she was pressing in much too close to him  onto his lap
 that s alright  then   she said  and made herself comfortable on his lap by smoothing out her skirt and adjusting her blouse
then she hung both her arms around his neck  leant back 130 the trial and took a long look at him  and what if i don t confess  could you not help me then   asked k
to test her out
i m accumulating women to help me  he thought to himself almost in amazement  first miss burstner  then the court usher s wife  and now this little care assistant who seems to have some incomprehensible need for me the way she sits on my lap as if it were her proper place   no   answered leni  slowly shaking her head   i couldn t help you then
but you don t want my help anyway  it means nothing to you  you re too stubborn and won t be persuaded   then  after a while she asked   do you have a lover    no   said k
 oh  you must have   she said
 well  i have really   said k
 just think  i ve even betrayed her while i m carrying her photograph with me   leni insisted he show her a photograph of elsa  and then  hunched on his lap  studied the picture closely
the photograph was not one that had been taken while elsa was posing for it  it showed her just after she had been in a wild dance such as she liked to do in wine bars  her skirt was still flung out as she span round  she had placed her hands on her firm hips and  with her neck held taut  looked to one side with a laugh  you could not see from the picture whom her laugh was intended for
 she s very tightly laced   said leni  pointing to the place where she thought this could be seen
 i don t like her  she s clumsy and crude but maybe she s gentle and friendly towards you  that s the impression you get from the picture
big  strong girls like that often don t know how to be anything but gentle and friendly
would she be capable of sacrificing herself for you  though    no   said k    she isn t gentle or friendly  free ebooks at planet ebook com 131 and nor would she be capable of sacrificing herself for me
but i ve never yet asked any of those things of her
i ve never looked at this picture as closely as you    you can t think much of her  then   said leni
 she can t be your lover after all    yes she is   said k    i m not going to take my word back on that    well she might be your lover now  then   said leni   but you wouldn t miss her much if you lost her or if you exchanged her for somebody else  me for instance    that is certainly conceivable   said k
with a smile   but she does have one major advantage over you  she knows nothing about my trial  and even if she did she wouldn t think about it
she wouldn t try to persuade me to be les unyielding    well that s no advantage   said leni
 if she s got no advantage other than that  i can keep on hoping
has she got any bodily defects     bodily defects    asked k
 yeah   said leni   as i do have a bodily defect  just a little one
look   she spread the middle and ring fingers of her right hand apart from each other
between those fingers the flap of skin connecting them reached up almost as far as the top joint of the little finger
in the darkness  k
did not see at first what it was she wanted to show him  so she led his hand to it so that he could feel
 what a freak of nature   said k   and when he had taken a look at the whole hand he added   what a pretty claw   leni looked on with a kind of pride as k
repeatedly opened and closed her two fingers in amazement  until  finally  he briefly kissed them and let go
 oh   she immediately exclaimed   you kissed me   hurriedly  and with her mouth open  she clambered up k  s lap with her knees
he was almost aghast as he looked up at her  now 132 the trial that she was so close to him there was a bitter  irritating smell from her  like pepper  she grasped his head  leant out over him  and bit and kissed his neck  even biting into his hair
 i ve taken her place   she exclaimed from time to time
 just look  now you ve taken me instead of her   just then  her knee slipped out and  with a little cry  she nearly fell down onto the carpet  k
tried to hold her by putting his arms around her and was pulled down with her  now you re mine   she said
her last words to him as he left were   here s the key to the door  come whenever you want   and she planted an undirected kiss on his back
when he stepped out the front door there was a light rain falling  he was about to go to the middle of the street to see if he could still glimpse leni at the window when k  s uncle leapt out of a car that k   thinking of other things  had not seen waiting outside the building
he took hold of k
by both arms and shoved him against the door as if he wanted to nail him to it  young man   he shouted   how could you do a thing like that   things were going well with this business of yours  now you ve caused it terrible damage
you slope of with some dirty  little thing who  moreover  is obviously the lawyer s beloved  and stay away for hours
you don t even try to find an excuse  don t try to hide anything  no  you re quite open about it  you run off with her and stay there
and meanwhile we re sitting there  your uncle who s going to such effort for you  the lawyer who needs to be won over to your side  and above all the office director  a very important gentleman who is in direct command of your affair in its present stage
we wanted to discuss how best to help you  i had to free ebooks at planet ebook com 133 handle the lawyer very carefully  he had to handle the office director carefully  and you had most reason of all to at least give me some support
instead of which you stay away
eventually we couldn t keep up the pretence any longer  but these are polite and highly capable men  they didn t say anything about it so as to spare my feelings but in the end not even they could continue to force themselves and  as they couldn t speak about the matter in hand  they became silent we sat there for several minutes  listening to see whether you wouldn t finally come back
all in vain
in the end the office director stood up  as he had stayed far longer than he had originally intended  made his farewell  looked at me in sympathy without being able to help  he waited at the door for a long time although it s more than i can understand why he was being so good  and then he went
i  of course  was glad he d gone  i d been holding my breath all this time
all this had even more affect on the lawyer lying there ill  when i took my leave of him  the good man  he was quite unable to speak
you have probably contributed to his total collapse and so brought the very man who you are dependent on closer to his death
and me  your own uncle  you leave me here in the rain just feel this  i m wet right through waiting here for hours  sick with worry   134 the trial painter one winter morning snow was falling in the dull light outside k
was sitting in his office  already extremely tired despite the early hour
he had told the servitor he was engaged in a major piece of work and none of the junior staff should be allowed in to see him  so he would not be disturbed by them at least
but instead of working he turned round in his chair  slowly moved various items around his desk  but then  without being aware of it  he lay his arm stretched out on the desk top and sat there immobile with his head sunk down on his chest he was no longer able to get the thought of the trial out of his head he had often wondered whether it might not be a good idea to work out a written defence and hand it in to the court
it would contain a short description of his life and was in any way important  whether he now considered he doubt of the advantages a written defence of this sort would free ebooks at planet ebook com 135 was taking  it was certainly not a lot  it was more than a month since the lawyer had summoned him  and none of the previous discussions had given k
the impression that this man would be able to do much for him
most importantly  he had asked him hardly any questions
and there were so many questions here to be asked
asking questions were the most important thing
k
had the feeling that he would be able to ask all the questions needed here himself the lawyer  in contrast  did not ask questions but did all the talking himself or sat silently facing him  leant forward slightly over the desk  probably because he was hard of hearing  pulled on a strand of hair in the middle of his beard and looked down at the carpet  perhaps at the very spot where k had lain with leni
now and then he would give k
some vague warning of the sort you give to children
his speeches were as pointless as they were boring  and k
decided that when the final bill came he would pay not a penny for them
once the lawyer thought he had humiliated k
sufficiently  he usually started something that would raise his spirits again
he had already  he would then say  won many such cases  partly or in whole  cases which may not really have been as difficult as this one but which  on the face of it  had even less hope of success
he had a list of these cases here in the drawer here he would tap on one or other of the drawers in his desk but could  unfortunately  not show them to k
as they dealt with official secrets
nonetheless  the great experience he had acquired through all these cases would  of course  be of benefit to k
he had  of course  begun work straight away and was nearly ready to submit the first docu  136 the trial ments
they would be very important because the first impression made by the defence will often determine the whole course of the proceedings
unfortunately  though  he would still have to make it clear to k
that the first documents submitted are sometimes not even read by the court
they simply put them with the other documents and point out that  for the time being  questioning and observing the accused are much more important than anything written
if the applicant becomes insistent  then they add that before they come to any decision  as soon as all the material has been brought together  with due regard  of course  to all the documents  then these first documents to have been submitted will also be checked over
but unfortunately  even this is not usually true  the first documents submitted are usually mislaid or lost completely  and even if they do keep them right to the end they are hardly read  although the lawyer only knew about this from rumour
this is all very regrettable  but not entirely without its justifications
but k
should not forget that the trial would not be public  if the court deems it necessary it can be made public but there is no law that says it has to be as a result  the accused and his defence don t have access even to the court records  and especially not to the indictment  and that means we generally don t know or at least not precisely what the first documents need to be about  which means that if they do contain anything of relevance to the case it s only by a lucky coincidence
if anything about the individual charges and the reasons for them comes out clearly or can be guessed at while the accused is being questioned  then it s possible to work out and free ebooks at planet ebook com 137 submit documents that really direct the issue and present proof  but not before
conditions like this  of course  place the defence in a very unfavourable and difficult position
some dispute about whether the relevant parts of the law imply even that
so strictly speaking  there is no such thing as a counsel acknowledged by the court  and anyone who comes before this court as counsel is basically no more than a barrack room lawyer
the effect of all this  of course  is to remove the dignity of the whole procedure  the next time k
is in the court offices he might like to have a look in at the lawyers  room  just so that he s seen it
he might well be quite shocked by the people he sees assembled there
the room they ve been allocated  with its narrow space and low ceiling  will be enough to show what contempt the court has for these people
the only light in the room comes through a little window that is so high up that  if you want to look out of it  you first have to get one of your colleagues to support you on his back  and even then the smoke from the chimney just in front of it will go up your nose and make your face black
in the floor of this room to give yet another example of the conditions there there is a hole that s been there for more than a year  it s not so big that a man could fall through  but it is big enough for your foot to disappear through it
the lawyers  room is on the second floor of the attic  if your foot does go through it will hang down into the first floor of the attic underneath it  and right in the corridor where the litigants are waiting
it s no exaggeration 138 the trial when lawyers say that conditions like that are a disgrace
complaints to the management don t have the slightest effect  but the lawyers are strictly forbidden to alter anything in the room at their own expense
but even treating the lawyers in this way has its reasons
they want  as far as possible  to prevent any kind of defence  everything should be made the responsibility of the accused
no a bad point of view  basically  but nothing could be more mistaken than to think from that that lawyers are not necessary for the accused in this court
on the contrary  there is no court where they are less needed than here
this is because proceedings are generally kept secret not only from the public but also from the accused
only as far as that is possible  of course  but it is possible to a very large extent
and the accused doesn t get to see the court records either  and it s very difficult to infer what s in the court records from what s been said during questioning based on them  especially for the accused who is in a difficult situation and is faced with every possible counsel for the defence are not normally allowed to be present while the accused is being questioned  so afterwards  and if possible still at the door of the interview room  whatever he can that might be of use  even though what the accused has to report is often very confused
but that is not the most important thing  as there s really not a lot that can be learned in this way  although in this  as with anything else  a competent man will learn more than another
nonetheless  the most important thing is the lawyer s personal free ebooks at planet ebook com 139 connections  that s where the real value of taking counsel lies
now k
will most likely have already learned from his own experience that  among its very lowest orders  the court organisation does have its imperfections  the court is strictly closed to the public  but staff who forget their duty or who take bribes do  to some extent  show where the gaps are
this is where most lawyers will push their way in  this is even  in earlier times at least  been incidents where documents have been stolen
there s no denying that some surprisingly favourable results have been attained for the new clients  but for the further course of the proceedings it signifies either nothing or nothing good
the only things of understand
that is the only way the progress of the trial can be influenced  hardly noticeable at first  it s true  but from then on it becomes more and more visible
there are  of course  not many lawyers who can do this  and k
has made a very good choice in this matter
there were probably huld  but they don t bother with the company of the lawyers  room and have nothing to do with it
this means they all necessary for dr
huld to go to the court  wait in the ante rooms for the examining judges to turn up  if they turn up  and try to achieve something which  according to 140 the trial the judges  mood is usually more apparent than real and most often not even that no  k
has seen for himself that the court officials  including some who are quite high up  come forward without being asked  are glad to give information which is fully open or at least easy to understand  some cases they can be won over and are quite willing to adopt the other person s point of view however  when this happens  you should never trust them too far  as however firmly they may have declared this new point of view in favour of the defendant they might well go straight back to their offices and write a report for the court that says just the opposite  and might well be even harder on the defendant than the original view  the one they insist they ve been fully dissuaded from
and  of course  there s no way of defending yourself from this  something said in private is indeed in private and cannot then be used in public  it s not something that makes it easy for the defence to keep those gentlemen s favour
on the other hand  it s also true that the gentlemen don t become involved with the defence which will of course be done with great expertise just for philanthropic reasons or in order to be friendly  in some respects it would be truer to say that they  too  have it allocated to them
this is where the disadvantages of a court structure that  right from the start  stipulates that all proceedings take place in private  come into force
in normal  mediocre very well equipped for it  but here they don t  normal trials run their course all by themselves  almost  and just need a free ebooks at planet ebook com 141 nudge here and there  but when they re faced with cases that are especially difficult they re as lost as they often are with ones that are very simple  they re forced to spend all their time  day and night  with their laws  and so they don t have the right feel for human relationships  and that s a serious shortcoming in cases like this that s when they come for advice to the lawyer  with a servant behind them carrying the documents which normally are kept so secret
you could have seen many gentlemen at this window  gentlemen of whom you would least expect it  staring out this window in despair on the street below while the lawyer is at his desk studying the documents so that he can give them good advice
and at times like that it s also possible to see how exceptionally seriously these gentlemen take their professions and how they are thrown into great confusion by difficulties which it s just not in their natures to overcome
but they re not in an easy position  to regard their positions as easy would be to do them an injustice
the different ranks and hierarchies of the court are endless  and even someone who knows his way around them cannot always tell what s going to happen
but even for the junior officials  the proceedings in the courtrooms are usually kept secret  so they are hardly able to see how the cases they work with proceed  court affairs appear in their range of vision often without their knowing where they come from and they move on further without their learning where they go so civil servants like this are not able to learn the things you can learn from studying the successive stages that individual trials go through  the final verdict or the reasons for it
they re only 142 the trial allowed to deal with that part of the trial which the law allocates them  and they usually know less about the results of their work after it s left them than the defence does  even officials can learn many useful things from the defence
bearing all this in mind  does it still surprise k
that the officials are irritated and often express themselves about the litigants in unflattering ways which is an experience shared by everyone all the officials are irritated  even when they appear calm
this causes many difficulties for the junior advocates  of course
there is a story  for instance  that has very much the ring of truth about it
it goes like this  one of the older officials  a good and peaceful man  was dealing with a difficult matter for the court which had become very confused  especially thanks to the contributions from the lawyers
he had been studying it for a day and a night without a break as these officials are indeed hard working  no one works as hard as they do
when it was nearly morning  and he had been working for twenty four hours with probably very little result  he went to the front entrance  lawyers gathered together down in front of the steps and discussed with each other what they should do  on the one legally do to the official and  as i ve already mentioned  they would have to be careful not to set all the officials against free ebooks at planet ebook com 143 them
on the other hand  any day not spent in court is a day lost for them and it was a matter of some importance to force their way inside
in the end  they agreed that they would try to tire the old man out
one lawyer after another was sent out to run up the steps and let himself be thrown down again  offering what resistance he could as long as it was passive resistance  and his colleagues would catch him at the bottom of the steps that went on for about an hour until the old gentleman  who was already exhausted from working all night  was very tired and went back to his office
those who were at the bottom of the steps could not believe it at first  so they sent somebody out to go and look behind the door to see if there really was no one there  and only then did they all gather together and probably didn t even dare to complain  as it s far from being the lawyers  job to introduce any improvements in the court system  or even to want to
even the most junior lawyer can understand the relationship there to some extent  but one significant point is that almost every defendant  even very simple people  begins to think of suggestions for improving the court as soon as his proceedings have begun  many of them often even spend time and energy on the matter that could be spent far better elsewhere
the only right thing to do is to learn how to deal with the situation as it is
even if it were possible to improve any detail of it which is anyway no more than superstitious nonsense the best that they could achieve  the officials for any case that comes up in the future  and the 144 the trial court organism and how  to some extent  it remains in a state of suspension  and that even if you alter something in one place you ll draw the ground out from under your feet and might fall  whereas if an enormous organism like the court is disrupted in any one place it finds it easy to provide a substitute for itself somewhere else
everything is connected with everything else and will continue without any change or else  which is quite probable  even more closed  more attentive  more strict  more malevolent
so it s best to leave the work to the lawyers and not to keep disturbing them
it doesn t do much good to make accusations  especially if you can t make it clear what they re based on and their full significance  but it must be said that k
caused a great deal of harm to his own case by his behaviour towards the office director  he was a very influential man but now he might as well be struck off the list of those who might do anything for k
if the trial is mentioned  even just in passing  it s quite obvious that he s ignoring it
these officials are in many ways just like children
often  something quite harmless although k  s behaviour could unfortunately not be called harmless will leave them feeling so offended that they will even stop talking with good friends of theirs  they turn away when they see them and do everything they can to oppose them
but then  with no particular reason  surprisingly enough  some little joke that was only ever attempted because everything seemed so hopeless will free ebooks at planet ebook com 145 make them laugh and they ll be reconciled
it s both difficult and hard at the same time to deal with them  and there s hardly any reason for it
it s sometimes quite astonishing that a single  average life is enough to encompass so much that it s at all possible ever to have any success in one s work here
on the other hand  there are also dark moments  such as everyone has  when you think you ve achieved nothing at all  when it seems that the only trials to come to a good end are those that were determined to have a good end from the start and would do so without any help  while all the others are lost despite all the running to and fro  all the effort  all the little  apparent successes that gave such joy then you no longer feel very sure of anything and  if asked about a trial that was doing well by its own nature but which was turned for the worse because you assisted in it  would not even dare deny that
and even that is a kind of selfconfidence  but then it s the only one that s left
lawyers are especially vulnerable to fits of depression of that sort and they are no more than fits of depression of course when a case is suddenly taken out of their hands after they ve been conducting can happen to a lawyer
it s not that the accused takes the case away from him  that hardly ever happens  once a defendant has taken on a certain lawyer he has to stay with him whatever happens
how could he ever carry on by himself after he s taken on help from a lawyer  no  that just doesn t happen  but what does sometimes happen is that the trial takes on a course where the lawyer may not go along with it client and trial are both simply taken away from the lawyer  146 the trial help can be given  where it s being processed in courts to which no one has any access  where the defendant cannot and find all the documents you ve submitted  which you ve worked hard to create and which you had the best hopes for  lying on the desk  they ve been sent back as they can t be carried through to the next stage in the trial  they re just worthless scraps of paper
it doesn t meant that the case has been lost  not at all  or at least there is no decisive reason for supposing so  it s just that you don t know anything more about the case and won t be told anything of what s happening
well  cases like that are the exceptions  i m glad to say  and even if k  s trial is one of them  it s still  for the time being  a long way off
but there was still plenty of opportunity for lawyers to get to work  and k
could be sure they would be made use of
as he had said  the time for submitting documents was still in the future and there was no rush to prepare them  it was much more important to start the initial discussions with the appropriate officials  and they had already taken place
with varying degrees of success  it must be said
it was much better not to give away any details before their time  as in that way k
could only be influenced unfavourably and his hopes might be raised or he might be made too anxious  better just to say that some individuals have spoken very favourably and shown themselves very willing to help  although others have spoken less favour  free ebooks at planet ebook com 147 ably  but even they have not in any way refused to help so all in all  the results are very encouraging  only you should certainly not draw any particular conclusions as all preliminary proceedings begin in the same way and it was only the way they developed further that would show what the value of these preliminary proceedings has been
anyway  nothing has been lost yet  and if we can succeed in getting the office director  despite everything  on our side and several a clean wound  as a surgeon would say  and we can wait for the results with some comfort
when he started talking on in this way the lawyer was quite tireless
he went through it all again every time k
went to see him
there was always some progress  but he could never be told what sort of progress it was
the first set of documents to be submitted were being worked on but still not ready  which usually turned out to be a great advantage the next time k
went to see him as the earlier occasion would have been a very bad time to put them in  which they could not then have known
if k   stupefied from all this talking  ever pointed out that even considering all these difficulties progress was very slow  the lawyer would object that progress was not slow at all  but that they might have progressed far further if k
had come to him at the right time
but he had come to him late and that lateness would bring still further difficulties  and not only where time was concerned
the only welcome interruption during these visits was always when leni contrived to bring the lawyer his tea while k
was there
then she would stand behind k
148 the trial pretending to watch the lawyer as he bent greedily over his cup  poured the tea in and drank and secretly let k
hold her hand
there was always complete silence
the lawyer drank
k
squeezed leni s hand and leni would sometimes dare to gently stroke k  s hair
 still here  are you   the lawyer would ask when he was ready
 i wanted to take the dishes away   said leni  they would give each other s hands a final squeeze  the lawyer would wipe his mouth and then start talking at k
again with renewed energy
was the lawyer trying to comfort k
or to confuse him  k
could not tell  but it seemed clear to him that his defence was not in good hands
maybe everything the lawyer said was quite right  even though he obviously wanted to make himself as conspicuous as possible and probably had never even taken on a case as important as he said k  s was but it was still suspicious how he continually mentioned his exploited solely for k  s benefit  the lawyer never forgot to mention that they were dealing only with junior officials  which meant officials who were dependent on others  and the direction taken in each trial could be important for their own furtherment
could it be that they were making use of the lawyer to turn trials in a certain direction  which would  of course  always be at the cost of the defendant  it certain did not mean that they would do that in every trial  that was not likely at all  and there were probably also trials where they gave the lawyer advantages and all the room he needed to turn it in the direction he wanted  as it would free ebooks at planet ebook com 149 that really was their relationship  how would they direct attention from the very first time it came to court  there could not be much doubt about what they would do
the documents still had not been submitted even though the trial had already lasted several months  and that  according to the lawyer  everything was still in its initial stages  which was very effective  of course  in making the defendant passive and keeping him helpless
then he could be suddenly surprised with the verdict  or at least with a notification that the hearing had not decided in his favour and the matter would be passed on to a higher office
it was essential that k
take a hand in it himself on winter s mornings such as this  when he was very tired and everything dragged itself lethargically through his head  this belief of his seemed irrefutable
he no longer felt the contempt for the trial that he had had earlier
if he had been alone in the world it would have been easy for him to ignore it  although it was also certain that  in that case  the trial would never have arisen in the first place
but now  his uncle had already dragged him to see the lawyer  he had to take account of his family  his job was no longer totally separate from the progress of the trial  he himself had carelessly with a certain  inexplicable complacency mentioned it to acquaintances and others had learned about it in ways he did not know  his relationship with miss burstner seemed to be in trouble because of it in short  he no longer had any 150 the trial choice whether he would accept the trial or turn it down  he was in the middle of it and had to defend himself if he was tired  then that was bad
but there was no reason to worry too much before he needed to
he had been capable of working himself up to his high position in the bank in a relatively short time and to retain it with respect from everyone  now he simply had to apply some of the talents that had made that possible for him to the trial  and there was no doubt that it had to turn out well the most important thing  if something was to be achieved  was to reject in advance any idea that he might be in any way guilty
there was no guilt
the trial was nothing but a big piece of business  just like he had already concluded to the benefit of the bank many times  a piece of business that concealed many lurking dangers waiting in ambush for him  as they usually did  and these dangers would need to be defended against
if that was to be achieved then he must need to look after his own interests as closely as he could
seen in this way  there was no choice but to take his representation away from the lawyer very soon  at best that very evening
the lawyer had told him  as he talked to him  that that was something unheard of and would probably do him a great deal of harm  but k
could not tolerate any impediment to his efforts where his trial was concerned  and these impediments were probably caused by the lawyer himself but once he had shaken off the lawyer the documents would need to be submitted straight away and  if possible  he would need to see to it that they were being dealt with every day
free ebooks at planet ebook com 151 it would of course not be enough  if that was to be done  for k
to sit in the corridor with his hat under the bench like the others
day after day  he himself  or one of the women or somebody else on his behalf  would have to run after the officials and force them to sit at their desks and study k  s documents instead of looking out on the corridor through the grating there could be no let up in these efforts  everything would need to be organised and supervised  it was about time that the court came up against a defendant who knew how to defend and make use of his rights
but when k
had the confidence to try and do all this the difficulty of composing the documents was too much for him
earlier  just a week or so before  he could only have felt could also be difficult
he remembered one morning when  already piled up with work  he suddenly shoved everything to one side and took a pad of paper on which he sketched out some of his thoughts on how documents of this sort should proceed perhaps he would offer them to that slowwitted lawyer  but just then the door of the manager s office loud laugh
k
was very embarrassed  although the deputy director  of course  was not laughing at k  s documents  which he knew nothing about  but at a joke he had just heard about the stock exchange  a joke which needed an illustration if it was to be understood  and now the deputydirector leant over k  s desk  took his pencil from his hand  and drew the illustration on the writing pad that k
had intended for 152 the trial his ideas about his case
k
now had no more thoughts of shame  the documents had to be prepared and submitted
if  as was very likely  he could find no time to do it in the office he would have to do it at home at night
if the nights weren t enough he would have to take a holiday
above he could not stop half way  that was nonsense not only in business but always and everywhere
needless to say  the documents would mean an almost endless amount of work
it was easy to come to the belief  not only for those of an anxious disposition  that it was impossible ever to finish it
this was not because of laziness or deceit  which were the only things that might have hindered the lawyer in preparing it  but because he did not know what the charge was or even what consequences from all sides and checking and reconsidering them
it was also a very disheartening job
it would have been more suitable as a way of passing the long days after he had retired and become senile
but now  just when k
needed to apply all his thoughts to his work  when he was still rising and already posed a threat to the deputy director  when every hour passed so quickly and he wanted to enjoy the brief evenings and nights as a young man  this was the time he had to start working out these documents
once more  he began to feel resentment
almost involuntarily  only to put an end to it  his finger felt for the button of the electric bell in the ante room
as he pressed it he glanced up to the clock
it was eleven o clock  two hours  he had spent a great deal of free ebooks at planet ebook com 153 his costly time just dreaming and his wits were  of course  even more dulled than they had been before
but the time had  nonetheless  not been wasted  he had come to some decisions that could be of value
as well as various pieces of mail  the servitors brought two visiting cards from gentlemen who had already been waiting for k
for some time
should not really have been kept waiting under any circumstances why had they come at such an awkward time  and why  the gentlemen on the other side of the closed door seemed to be asking  was the industrious k
using up the best business time for his private affairs  tired from what had gone before  and tired in anticipation of what was to follow  k
stood up to receive the first of them
well
he apologised for disturbing k
at some important work  and k   for his part  apologised for having kept the was spoken in such a mechanical way and with such false noticed if he had not been fully preoccupied with his business affairs
instead  he hurriedly pulled calculations and tables out from all his pockets  spread them out in front of k   explained several items  corrected a little mistake in the arithmetic that he noticed as he quickly glanced over it all  and reminded k of a similar piece of business he d concluded with him about a year before  mentioning in passing that this time there was another bank spending great effort to get his business  and finally stopped speaking in order to 154 the trial learn k  s opinion on the matter
and k
had indeed  at first  he too was aware of how important the deal was  but unfortunately it did not last  he soon stopped listening  nodded at while  but eventually he stopped doing even that and did no more than stare at the bald head bent over the papers  that everything he was saying was useless
when he did stop talking  k
really thought at first that this was so that he would have the chance to confess that he was incapable made  he was sorry to realise that the business discussion had to be continued
so he bent his head as if he d been given an order and began slowly to move his pencil over the papers  now and then he would stop and stare at one of objection  perhaps his figures weren t really sound  perhaps they weren t the decisive issue  whatever he thought  deal was all about
 it is difficult   said k   pursing his lips
the only thing that could offer him any guidance were the view  so he just sank back against the arm of the chair
even when the door of the manager s office opened and revealed not very clearly  as if through a veil  the deputy director  he did no more than look up weakly
k
thought no more about free ebooks at planet ebook com 155 the matter  he merely watched the immediate effect of the deputy director s appearance and  for him  the effect was from his seat and hurried over to meet the deputy director  although k
would have liked to make him ten times livelier as he feared the deputy director might disappear again
he need not have worried  the two gentlemen met each other  shook each other s hand and went together over to k  s clerk so little inclined to do business  pointing to k
who  under the view of the deputy director  had bent back down over the papers
as the two men leant over the desk and the director s attention  k
felt as if they were much bigger than they really were and that their negotiations were about him
carefully and slowly turning his eyes upwards  he tried to learn what was taking place above him  took one of the papers from his desk without looking to see what it was  lay it on the flat of his hand and raised it slowly up as he rose up to the level of the two men himself he had no particular plan in mind as he did this  but merely felt this was how he would that was to remove his burden entirely
the deputy director had been paying all his attention to the conversation and did no more than glance at the paper  he did not read what was written on it at all as what was important for the chief clerk was not important for him  he took it from k  s hand saying   thank you  i m already familiar with everything   and lay it calmly back on the desk
k
gave him a bitter  side  156 the trial ways look
but the deputy director did not notice this at all  or if he did notice it it only raised his spirits  he frequently laughed out loud  one time he clearly embarrassed the but drew him immediately back out of his embarrassment by commenting adversely on himself  and finally invited him into his office where they could bring the matter to its it off his hands this is something that needs calm consideration
but he seems to be over burdened today  there are even some people in the room outside who ve been waiting there for hours for him   k still had enough control of himself to turn away from the deputy director and direct made no other retaliation  bent down slightly and supported himself with both hands on his desk like a clerk  and watched as the two gentlemen  still talking  took the papers from his desk and disappeared into the manager s office in make his farewell with k
just yet  he would of course let the chief clerk know about the success of his discussions but he also had a little something to tell him about
show anyone else into his office and only became vaguely aware of how nice it was that the people outside thought free ebooks at planet ebook com 157 reason  he could not let anyone in to see him  not even the servitor
he went over to the window  sat down on the ledge beside it  held firmly on to the handle and looked down onto the square outside
the snow was still falling  the weather still had not brightened up at all
he remained a long time sitting in this way  not knowing the door to the outer room where  mistakenly  he thought he d heard some noise
no one came  and that made him feel calmer  he went over to the wash stand  rinsed his face with cold water and  his head somewhat clearer  went back to his place by the window
the decision to take his defence into his own hands now seemed more of a burden than he had originally assumed
all the while he had left his defence up to the lawyer his trial had had little basic affect on him  he had observed it from afar as something that was scarcely able to reach him directly  when it suited him he looked to see how things stood but he was also able to draw his head back again whenever he wanted
now  in contrast  if he was to conduct his defence himself  he would have to devote himself entirely to the court for the time being  at least success would mean  later on  his complete and conclusive liberation  but if he was to achieve this he would have to place himself  to start with  in far greater danger than he had been in so far if he ever felt tempted to doubt this  then how could he have sat there totally convinced of the need 158 the trial to do his own defence  how would it be later  what would his life be like in the days ahead  would he find the way through it all to a happy conclusion  did a carefully worked out defence and any other sort would have made no sense did a carefully worked out defence not also mean he would need to shut himself off from everything else as much as he could  would he survive that  and how was he to succeed in conducting all this at the bank  it involved much more than just submitting some documents that he could probably prepare in a few days  leave  although it would have been great temerity to ask for time off from the bank just at that time  it was a whole trial and there was no way of seeing how long it might last this was an enormous difficulty that had suddenly been thrown into k  s life  and was he supposed to be doing the bank s work at a time like this  he looked down at his desk
was he supposed to let people in to see him and go into negotiations with them at a time like this  while his trial trundled on  while the court officials upstairs in the attic room sat looking at the papers for this trial  should he be worrying about the business of the bank  did this not seem like a kind of torture  acknowledged by the court  connected with the trial and which followed him around  and is it likely that anyone in the bank  when judging his work  would take any account of his peculiar situation  noone and never
there were those who knew about his trial  although it was not quite clear who knew about it or how much
but he hoped rumours had not reached as far as the deputy director  otherwise he would obviously soon find a way of making use of free ebooks at planet ebook com 159 it to harm k   he would show neither comradeship nor humaneness and what about the director  it was true that he was well disposed towards k   and as soon as he heard about the trial he would probably try to do everything he could to make it easier for him  but he would certainly not devote himself to it k
at one time had provided the counter balance to what the deputy director said but the director was now coming more and more under his influence  and the deputy director would also exploit the weakened condition of the director to strengthen his own power
so what could k
hope for  maybe considerations of this sort weakened his power of resistance  but it was still necessary not to deceive oneself and to see everything as clearly as it could be seen at that moment
for no particular reason  just to avoiding returning to his desk for a while  he opened the window
it was difficult to open and he had to turn the handle with both his hands
then  through the whole height and breadth of the window  the mixture of fog and smoke was drawn into the room  filling it with a slight smell of burning
a few flakes of snow were blown in with it
 it s a horrible autumn   said after seeing the deputy director and now stood behind k
and inform k
of the result of his negotiations with the was looking  knocked on his briefcase and without opening it said   you ll be wanting to hear how things turned out
160 the trial charming man  your deputy director he s got his dangers  though   he laughed as he shook k  s hand and wanted to make him laugh with him
but to k   it once more seemed the papers and saw nothing about his comments to laugh at
been affecting your mood  has it  you re looking so worried today    yes   said k   raising his hand and holding the temple of his head   headaches  worries in the family    quite and could never listen to anyone for very long   everyone else i d like to mention to you
i m very sorry if it s something that ll be a burden to you today of all days but i ve been to see you twice already  lately  and each time i forgot all about it
if i delay it any longer it might well lose its point altogether
that would be a pity  as i think what i ve got to say does have some value   before k
had had the time his knuckle lightly on his chest and said quietly   you ve got a trial going on  haven t you   k
stepped back and immediately exclaimed   that s what the deputy director s would the deputy director know about it    and what about you   asked k   already more in control of himself  i hear things about the court here and there   said the manufac  free ebooks at planet ebook com 161 turer   and that even applies to what it is that i wanted to tell you about    there are so many people who have connections with the court   said k
with lowered head  and  i m afraid it s not very much that i ve got to tell you about
only  in matters like this  it s best not to overlook the tiniest details
besides  i really want to help you in some way  however modest my help might be
we ve been good business partners up till now  haven t we  well then   k
wanted to apologise for his behaviour in the conversation earlier he was in a hurry  and carried on
 i know about your case through a certain titorelli
he s a painter  titorelli s just his artistic name  i don t even know what his real name is
he s been coming to me in my office for years from time to time  and brings little pictures with him which i buy more or less just for the sake of charity as he s hardly more than a beggar
and they re nice pictures  too  moorland landscapes and that sort of thing
we d both got used to doing business in this way and it always went smoothly
only  one time these visits became a bit too frequent  i began to tell him off for it  we started talking and i became interested how it was that he could earn a living just by painting  and then i learned to my amazement that his main source of income was painting portraits
 i work for the court   he said   what court   said i
and that s when he told me about the court
i m sure you can imagine how amazed i was at being told all 162 the trial this
ever since then i learn something new about the court every time he comes to visit  and so little by little i get to understand something of how it works
anyway  titorelli talks a lot and i often have to push him away  not only because he s bound to be lying but also  most of all  because a businessman like me who s already close to breaking point under the weight of his own business worries can t pay too much attention to other people s
but all that s just by the by
perhaps this is what i ve been thinking perhaps titorelli might be able to help you in some small way  he knows lots of judges and even if he can t have much influence himself he can give you some advice about how to get some influential people on your side and even if this advice doesn t turn out to make all the difference i still think it ll be very important once you ve got it
you re nearly a lawyer yourself
that s what i always say  mr k
the chief clerk is nearly a lawyer
oh i m sure this trial of yours will turn out all right
so do you want to go and see titorelli  then  if i ask him to he ll certainly do everything he possibly can
i really do think you ought to go
it needn t be today  of course  just some time  when you get the chance
and anyway i want titorelli  this advice from me doesn t place you under any obligation at all
no  if you think you can get by without titorelli it ll certainly be better to leave him completely out of it
maybe you ve already got a clear idea of what you re doing and titorelli could upset your plans
no  if that s the case then of course you shouldn t go there under any circumstances  and it certainly won t be easy to take advice free ebooks at planet ebook com 163 from a lad like that still  it s up to you
here s the letter of recommendation and here s the address   disappointed  k
took the letter and put it in his pocket
even at best  the advantage he might derive from this recommendation was incomparably smaller than the damage trial  and that the painter was spreading the news about
was already on his way to the door  a few words of thanks
to him  perhaps he would like to come to me in my office some time    i was sure you d find the best solution   said to avoid inviting people like this titorelli to the bank and talking about the trial here
and it s not always a good idea to send letters to people like titorelli  you don t know what might happen to them
but you re bound to have thought everything through and you know what you can and can t do   the ante room
but despite seeming calm on the outside he would write to titorelli only to show him in some way that he valued his recommendations and would consider the opportunity to speak with titorelli without delay  but if he had thought titorelli could offer any worthwhile assistance he comment that made k
realise what dangers that could lead to
was he really able to rely on his own understanding so 164 the trial little  if it was possible that he might invite a questionable from him about his trial  separated from the deputy director by no more than a door  was it not possible or even very likely that there were also other dangers he had failed to see or that he was even running towards  there was not always someone beside him to warn him
and just now  just when known had presented themselves and affected his own vigilance  the difficulties he had been feeling in carrying out his office work  were they now going to affect the trial too  now  at least  he found himself quite unable to understand how he could have intended to write to titorelli and invite him into the bank he shook his head at the thought of it once more as the servitor came up beside him and drew his attention to the three gentlemen who were waiting on a bench in the anteroom
they had already been waiting to see k
for a long time
now that the servitor was speaking with k
they had stood up and each of them wanted to make use of the opportunity to see k
before the others
it had been negligent of the bank to let them waste their time here in the waiting room  but none of them wanted to draw attention to this
 mr k   …  one of them was saying  but k
had told the servitor to fetch his winter coat and said to the three of them  as the servitor helped him to put it on   please forgive me  gentlemen  i m afraid i have no time to see you at present please do forgive me but i have some urgent busi  free ebooks at planet ebook com 165 ness to settle and have to leave straight away
you ve already seen yourselves how long i ve been delayed
would you be so kind as to come back tomorrow or some time  or perhaps we could settle your affairs by telephone  or perhaps you would like to tell me now  briefly  what it s about and i can then give you a full answer in writing
whatever  the best thing will be for you to come here again   the gentlemen now saw that their wait had been totally pointless  and these suggestions of k  s left them so astounded that they looked at each other without a word
 that s agreed then  is it   asked k   who had turned toward the servitor bringing him his hat
through the open door of k  s office they could see that the snowfall outside had become much heavier
so k
turned the collar of his coat up and buttoned it up high under his chin
just then the deputy director came out of the adjoining room  smiled as he saw k
negotiating with the gentlemen in his winter coat  and asked   are you about to go out    yes   said k   standing more upright   i have to go out on some business   but the deputy director had already turned towards the gentlemen
 and what about these gentlemen   he asked
 i think they ve already been waiting quite a long time    we ve already come to an understanding   said k
but now the gentlemen could be held back no longer  they surrounded k
and explained that they would not have been waiting for hours if it had not been about something important that had to be discussed now  at length and in private
the deputy director listened to them for a short while  he also looked at k
as he held his hat in his hand cleaning the dust off it here and there  and then he 166 the trial said   gentlemen  there is a very simple way to solve this
if you would prefer it  i ll be very glad to take over these negotiations instead of the chief clerk
your business does  of course  need to be discussed without delay
we are businessmen like yourselves and know the value of a businessman s time
would you like to come this way   and he opened the door leading to the ante room of his own office
the deputy director seemed very good at appropriating everything that k
was now forced to give up  but was k
not giving up more than he absolutely had to  by running off to some unknown painter  with  as he had to admit  very little hope of any vague benefit  his renown was suffering damage that could not me repaired
it would probably be much better to take off his winter coat again and  at the very least  try to win back the two gentlemen who were certainly still waiting in the next room
if k
had not then glimpsed the deputy director in his office  looking for something from his bookshelves as if they were his own  he would probably even have made the attempt
as k   somewhat agitated  approached the door the deputy director called out   oh  you ve still not left   he turned his face toward him its many deep folds seemed to show strength rather than age and immediately could you help me look for it  do you think   k
made a step forward  but the deputy director said   thank you  i ve already found it   and with a big package of papers  which certainly must have included many more documents than free ebooks at planet ebook com 167 his own office
 i can t deal with him right now   k
said to himself   but once my personal difficulties have been settled  then he ll certainly be the first to get the effect of it  and he certainly won t like it   slightly calmed by these thoughts  k gave the servitor  who had already long been holding the door to the corridor open for him  the task of telling the director  when he was able  that k
was going out of the bank on a business matter
as he left the bank he felt almost happy at the thought of being able to devote more of himself to his own business for a while he went straight to the painter  who lived in an outlying part of town which was very near to the court offices  although this area was even poorer  the houses were darker  the streets were full of dirt that slowly blew about over the half melted snow
in the great gateway to the building where the painter lived only one of the two doors was open  a hole had been broken open in the wall by the other door  and as k
approached it a repulsive  yellow  steaming liquid shot out causing some rats to scurry away into the nearby canal
down by the staircase there was a small child lying on its belly crying  but it could hardly be heard because of the noise from a metal workshop on the other side of the entrance hall  drowning out any other sound
the door to the workshop was open  three workers stood in a circle around some piece of work that they were beating with hammers
a large tin plate hung on the wall  casting a pale light that pushed its way in between two of the workers  lighting up their faces and their work aprons
k
did no 168 the trial more that glance at any of these things  he wanted to get things over with here as soon as possible  to exchange just a few words to find out how things stood with the painter and go straight back to the bank
even if he had just some tiny success here it would still have a good effect on his work at the bank for that day
on the third floor he had to slow down his pace  he was quite out of breath the steps  just like the height of each floor  were much higher than they needed to be and he d been told that the painter lived right up in the attic
the air was also quite oppressive  there was no proper stairwell and the narrow steps were closed in by walls on both sides with no more than a small  high window here and there
just as k
paused for a while some young girls ran out of one of the flats and rushed higher up the stairs  laughing
k
followed them slowly  caught up with one of the girls who had stumbled and been left behind by the others  and asked her as they went up side by side   is there a painter  titorelli  who lives here   the girl  hardly thirteen years old and somewhat hunchbacked  jabbed him with her elbow and looked at him sideways
her youth and her bodily defects had done nothing to stop her being already quite depraved
she did not smile once  but looked at k
earnestly  with sharp  acquisitive eyes
k
pretended not to notice her behaviour and asked   do you know titorelli  the painter   she nodded and asked in reply   what d you want to see him for   k
thought it would be to his advantage quickly to find out something more about titorelli
 i want to have him paint my portrait   he said
 paint your portrait   she asked  opening her mouth too wide and lightly hitting k
with her free ebooks at planet ebook com 169 hand as if he had said something extraordinarily surprising or clumsy  with both hands she lifted her skirt  which was already very short  and  as fast as she could  she ran off after the other girls whose indistinct shouts lost themselves in the heights at the next turn of the stairs  however  k
encountered all the girls once more
the hunchbacked girl had clearly told them about k  s intentions and they were waiting for him
they stood on both sides of the stairs  pressing themselves against the wall so that k could get through between them  and smoothed their aprons down with their hands
all their faces  even in this guard of honour  showed a mixture of childishness and depravity
up at the head of the line of girls  who now  laughing  began to close in around k   was the hunchback who had taken on the role of leader
it was thanks to her that k
found the right direction without delay he would have continued up the stairs straight in front of him  but she showed him that to reach titorelli he would need to need to turn off to one side
the steps that led up to the painter were especially narrow  very long without any turning  the whole length could be seen in one glance and  at the top  at titorelli s closed door  it came to its end
this door was much better illuminated than the rest of the stairway by the light from a small skylight set obliquely above it  it had been put together from unpainted planks of wood and the name  titorelli  was painted on it in broad  red brushstrokes
k
was no more than half way up the steps  accompanied by his retinue of girls  when  clearly the result of the noise of all those footsteps  the door opened slightly and in the crack a man who seemed to be dressed 170 the trial in just his nightshirt appeared
 oh   he cried  when he saw the approaching crowd  and vanished
the hunchbacked girl clapped her hands in glee and the other girls crowded in behind k
to push him faster forward
they still had not arrived at the top  however  when the painter up above them suddenly pulled the door wide on the other hand  he tried to keep away  he did not want to let any of them in however much they begged him and however much they tried to get in if they could not get in with his permission they would try to force their way in against his will
the only one to succeed was the hunchback when she slipped through under his outstretched arm  but the painter chased after her  grabbed her by the skirt  span her once round and set her down again by the door with the other girls who  unlike the first  had not dared to cross the doorstep while the painter had left his post k
did not know what he was to make of all this  as they all seemed to be having fun
one behind the other  the girls by the door stretched their necks up high and called out various words to the painter which were meant in jest but which k did not understand  and even the painter laughed as the hunchback whirled round in his hand
then he shut the door  bowed once more to k   offered him his hand and introduced himself  saying   titorelli  painter  k
pointed to the door  behind which the girls were whispering  and said   you seem to be very popular in this building    ach  those brats   said the painter  trying in vain to fasten his nightshirt at the neck
he was also bare footed and  apart free ebooks at planet ebook com 171 from that  was wearing nothing more than a loose pair of yellowish linen trousers held up with a belt whose free end whipped to and fro
 those kids are a real burden for me   he continued
the top button of his nightshirt came off and he gave up trying to fasten it  fetched a chair for k and made him sit down on it
 i painted one of them once she s not here today and ever since then they ve been following me about
if i m here they only come in when i allow it  but as soon as i ve gone out there s always at least one of them in here
they had a key made to my door and lend it round to each other
it s hard to imagine what a pain that is
suppose i come back home with a lady i m going to paint  i open the door with my own key and find the hunchback there or something  by the table painting her lips red with my paintbrush  and meanwhile her little sisters will be keeping guard for her  moving about and causing chaos in every corner of the room
or else  like happened yesterday  i might come back home late in the evening please forgive my appearance and the room being in a mess  it is to do with them so  i might come home late in the evening and want to go to bed  then i feel something pinching my leg  look under the bed and pull another of them out from under it
i don t know why it is they bother me like this  i expect you ve just seen that i do nothing to encourage them to come near me
and they make it hard for me to do my work too  of course
if i didn t get this studio for nothing i d have moved out a long time ago   just then  a little voice  tender and anxious  called out from under the door   titorelli  can we come in now    no   answered the painter
 not even just me  by 172 the trial myself   the voice asked again
 not even just you   said the painter  as he went to the door and locked it
meanwhile  k
had been looking round the room  if it had not been pointed out it would never have occurred to him that this wretched little room could be called a studio it was hardly long enough or broad enough to make two steps
everything  floor  walls and ceiling  was made of wood  between the planks narrow gaps could be seen
across from where k
was  the bed stood against the wall under a covering of many different colours
in the middle of the room a picture stood on an easel  covered over with a shirt whose arms dangled down to the ground behind k
was the window through which the fog made it impossible to see further than the snow covered roof of the neighbouring building
the turning of the key in the lock reminded k
that he and said   i learned about you from this gentleman  an acquaintance of yours  and it s on his advice that i ve come here 
the painter glanced through the letter and threw it clearly that titorelli was an acquaintance of his  a poor man who was dependent on his charity  then it would really have been quite possible to believe that titorelli did not know him or at least that he could not remember him
this impression was augmented by the painter s asking   were you wanting to buy some pictures or did you want to have yourself painted   k
looked at the painter in astonishment
free ebooks at planet ebook com 173 to find out more about his trial
he had been far too rash in coming here  but now he had to give the painter some sort of answer and  glancing at the easel  said   are you working on a picture currently    yes   said the painter  and he took the shirt hanging over the easel and threw it onto the bed after the letter
 it s a portrait
quite a good piece of work  although it s not quite finished yet   this was a convenient coincidence for k   it gave him a good opportunity to talk about the court as the picture showed  very clearly  a judge
what s more  it was remarkably similar to the picture in the lawyer s office  although this one showed a quite different judge  a heavy man with a full beard which was black and bushy and extended to the sides far up the man s cheeks
the lawyer s picture was also an oil painting  whereas this one had been made with pastel colours and was pale and unclear
but everything else about the picture was similar  as this judge  too  was holding tightly to the arm of his throne and seemed ominously about to rise from it
at first k
was about to say   he certainly is a judge   but he held himself back for the time being and went closer to the picture as if he wanted to study it in detail there was a large figure shown in middle of the throne s back rest which k
could not understand and asked the painter about it
that ll need some more work done on it  the painter told him  and taking a pastel crayon from a small table he added a few strokes to the edges of the figure but without making it any clearer as far as k
could make out
 that s the figure of justice   said the painter  finally
 now i see   said k    here s the blindfold and here are the scales
but aren t those wings on her heels  and isn t she moving    yes   said the painter  one    that is not a good combination   said k
with a smile
 justice needs to remain still  otherwise the scales will move about and it won t be possible to make a just verdict    i m just doing what the client wanted   said the painter
 yes  certainly   said k   who had not meant to criticise anyone by that figure or that throne  it s all just invention  but they told me what it was i had to paint    how s that   asked k
pretending not fully to understand what the painter said
 that is a judge sitting on the judge s chair  isn t it    yes    said the painter   but that judge isn t very high up and he s never sat on any throne like that    and he has himself painted in such a grand pose  he s sitting there just like the president of the court    yeah  gentlemen like this are very vain   said the painter  but they have permission from higher up to get themselves painted like this it s laid down quite strictly just what sort of portrait each of them can get for himself only it s a pity that you can t make out the details of his costume and pose in this picture  pastel colours aren t really suitable for showing people like this    yes   said k    it does seem odd that it s in pastel colours    that s what the judge wanted   said the painter   it s meant to be for a woman   the free ebooks at planet ebook com 175 sight of the picture seemed to make him feel like working  he rolled up his shirtsleeves  picked up a few of the crayons  and k
watched as a reddish shadow built up around the head of the judge under their quivering tips and radiated out the to edges of the picture
this shadow play slowly surrounded the head like a decoration or lofty distinction
but around the figure of justice  apart from some coloration that was barely noticeable  it remained light  and in this brightness the figure seemed to shine forward so that it now looked like neither the god of justice nor the god of victory  it seemed now  rather  to be a perfect depiction of the god of the hunt
k
found the painter s work more engrossing than he had wanted  but finally he reproached himself for staying so long without having done anything relevant to his own affair  what s the name of this judge   he asked suddenly
 i m not allowed to tell you that   the painter answered
he was bent deeply over the picture and clearly neglecting his guest who  at first  he had received with such care
k
took this to be just a foible of the painter s  and it irritated him as it made him lose time
 i take it you must be a trustee of the court   he said
the painter immediately put his crayons down  stood upright  rubbed his hands together and looked at k
with a smile
 always straight out with the truth   he said
 you want to learn something about the court  like it says in your letter of recommendation  but then you start talking about my pictures to get me on your side
still  i won t hold it against you  you weren t to know that that was entirely the wrong thing to try with me
oh  please   he said sharply  repelling k  s attempt to make some 176 the trial objection
he then continued   and besides  you re quite right in your comment that i m a trustee of the court   he made a pause  as if wanting to give k
the time to come to from behind the door
they were probably pressed around the keyhole  perhaps they could even see into the room through the gaps in the planks
k
forewent the opportunity the painter from what he was saying  or else perhaps he didn t want him to get too far above himself and in this way make himself to some extent unattainable  so he asked   is that a publicly acknowledged position    no   was the painter s curt reply  as if the question prevented him saying any more but k
wanted him to continue speaking and said   well  positions like that  that aren t officially acknowledged  can often have more influence than those that are    and that s how it is with me   said the painter  and nodded you  and i answered   he can come and see me if he likes   and now i m pleased to see you here so soon
this business seems to be quite important to you  and  of course  i m not surprised at that would you not like to take your coat off now   k
had intended to stay for only a very short time  but the painter s invitation was nonetheless very welcome
the air in the room had slowly become quite oppressive for him  he had several times looked in amazement at a small  iron stove in the corner that certainly could not have been lit  the heat of the room was inexplicable
as he took off his winter free ebooks at planet ebook com 177 overcoat and also unbuttoned his frock coat the painter said to him in apology   i must have warmth
and it is very cosy here  isn t it
this room s very good in that respect   k
made almost made it more difficult to breathe  the room had probably not been ventilated for a long time
the unpleasantness of this was made all the stronger for k
when the painter invited him to sit on the bed while he himself sat down on the only chair in the room in front of the easel the painter even seemed to misunderstand why k
remained at the edge of the bed and urged k
to make himself comfortable  and as he hesitated he went over to the bed himself and pressed k deep down into the bedclothes and pillows
then he went back to his seat and at last he asked his first objective question  which made k
forget everything else
 you re innocent  are you   he asked
 yes   said k
he felt a simple joy at answering this question  especially as the answer was given to a private individual and therefore would have no consequences
up till then no one had asked him this question so openly
to make the most of his pleasure he added   i am totally innocent    so   said the painter  and he lowered his head and seemed to be thinking
suddenly he raised his head again and said   well if you re innocent it s all very simple   k
began to scowl  this supposed trustee of the court was talking like an ignorant child
 my being innocent does not make things simple   said k
despite everything  he couldn t help smiling and slowly shook his head
 there are many fine details in which the court gets 178 the trial lost  but in the end it reaches into some place where originally there was nothing and pulls enormous guilt out of it    yeah  yeah  sure   said the painter  as if k
had been disturbing his train of thought for no reason
 but you are innocent  aren t you    well of course i am   said k
 that s the main thing   said the painter
there was no counter argument that could influence him  but although he had made up his mind it was not clear whether he was talking this way because of conviction or indifference
k   then  wanted to find out and said therefore   i m sure you re more familiar with the court than i am  i know hardly more about it than what i ve heard  and that s been from many very different people
but they were all agreed on one thing  and that was that when ill thought out accusations are made they are not ignored  and that once the court has made an accusation it is convinced of the guilt of the defendant and it s very hard to make it think otherwise    very hard   the painter asked  throwing one hand up in the air
 it s impossible to make it think otherwise
if i painted all the judges next to each other here on canvas  and you were trying to defend yourself in front of it  you d have more success with them than you d ever have with the real court    yes   said k
to himself  forgetting that he had only gone there to investigate the painter one of the girls behind the door started up again  and asked   titorelli  is he going to go soon    quiet   shouted the painter at the door   can t you see i m talking with the gentleman   but this was not enough to satisfy the girl and she asked   you going to paint his picture   and when the free ebooks at planet ebook com 179 painter didn t answer she added   please don t paint him  he s an  orrible bloke   there followed an incomprehensible  interwoven babble of shouts and replies and calls of agreement
the painter leapt over to the door  opened it very slightly the girls  clasped hands could be seen stretching through the crack as if they wanted something and said   if you re not quiet i ll throw you all down the stairs sit down here on the steps and be quiet   they probably did not obey him immediately  so that he had to command   down on the steps   only then it became quiet
 i m sorry about that   said the painter as he returned to k
k
had hardly turned towards the door  he had left it completely up to the painter whether and how he would place him under his protection if he wanted to
even now  he made hardly any movement as the painter bent over him and  whispering into his ear in order not to be heard outside  said   these girls belong to the court as well    how s that   asked k   as he leant his head to one side and looked at the painter
but the painter sat back down on his chair and  half in jest  half in explanation   well  everything belongs to the court    that is something i had never noticed until now   said k
curtly  this general comment of the painter s made his comment about the girls far less disturbing
nonetheless  k
looked for a while at the door  behind which the girls were now sitting quietly on the steps
except  that one of them had pushed a drinking straw through a crack between the planks and was moving it slowly up and down
 you still don t seem to have much general idea of what the court s about   said the painter  who had stretched 180 the trial his legs wide apart and was tapping loudly on the floor with the tip of his foot  but as you re innocent you won t need it anyway
i ll get you out of this by myself    how do you intend to do that   asked k
 you did say yourself not long ago that it s quite impossible to go to the court with reasons and proofs    only impossible for reasons and proofs you take to the court yourself   said the painter  raising his forefinger as if k
had failed to notice a fine distinction
 it goes differently if you try to do something behind the public court  that s to say in the consultation rooms  in the corridors or here  for instance  in my studio   k now began to find it far easier to believe what the painter was saying  or rather it was largely in agreement with what he had also been told by vain judges was especially important  and at the very least should not be undervalued
and the painter would fit in very well in the circle of assistants that k
was slowly gathering around himself he had been noted at the bank for his talent in organising  here  where he was placed entirely on his own resources  would be a good opportunity to test that talent to its limits
the painter observed the effect his explanation had had on k
and then  with a certain unease  said   does it not occur to you that the way i m speaking is it  of course  but i lose a lot  artistically speaking    how did free ebooks at planet ebook com 181 he wanted first to gain the painter s trust before he took him me
it s a position that s always inherited
the can t use new people for it  the rules governing how the various grades of officials are painted are so many and varied  and  above all  so secret that noone outside of certain families even knows them
in the drawer there  for instance  i ve got my father s notes  which i don t show to anyone
but you re only able to paint judges if you know what they say
although  even if i lost them no one could ever dispute my position because of all the rules i just carry round in my head
all the judges want to be painted like the old  great judges were  and i m the only one who can do that    you are to be envied   said k   thinking of his position at the bank
 your position is quite unassailable  then    yes  quite unassailable   said the painter  and he raised his shoulders in pride
 that s how i can even afford to help some poor man facing trial now and then    and how do you do that   asked k   as if the painter had not just described him as a poor man
the painter for instance  as you re totally innocent  this is what i ll do   the repeated mention of k  s innocence was becoming irksome to him
it sometimes seemed to him as if the painter was using these comments to make a favourable outcome to the trial a precondition for his help  which of course would make the help itself unnecessary
but despite these doubts k
forced himself not to interrupt the painter he did not want to do without the painter s help  that was what he had 182 the trial decided  and this help did not seem in any way less questionable than that of the lawyer
k
valued the painter s help far more highly because it was offered in a way that was more harmless and open
the painter had pulled his seat closer to the bed and continued in a subdued voice   i forgot to ask you  what sort of acquittal is it you want  there are three possibilities  absolute acquittal  apparent acquittal and deferment
absolute acquittal is the best  of course  only there s nothing i could do to get that sort of outcome
i don t think there s anyone at all who could do anything to get an absolute acquittal
probably the only thing that could do that is if the accused case you won t need me or any other kind of help   at first  k
was astonished at this orderly explanation  but then  just as quietly as the painter  he said   i think you re contradicting yourself    how s that   asked the painter patiently  leaning back with a smile
this smile made k
feel as if he were examining not the words of the painter but seeking out inconsistencies in the procedures of the court itself
nonetheless  he continued unabashed and said   you remarked earlier that the court cannot be approached with reasoned proofs  you later restricted this to the open court  and now you go so far as to say that an innocent man needs no assistance in court
that entails a contradiction
moreover  you said earlier that the judges can be influenced personally but now you insist that an absolute acquittal  as you call it  can never be attained through personal influ  free ebooks at planet ebook com 183 ence
that entails a second contradiction    it s quite easy to clear up these contradictions   said the painter
 we re talking about two different things here  there s what it says in the law and there s what i know from my own experience  you shouldn t get the two confused
i ve never seen it in writing  but the law does  of course  say on the one hand that the innocent will be set free  but on the other hand it doesn t say that the judges can be influenced
but in my experience it s the other way round
i don t know of any absolute acquittals but i do know of many times when a judge has been influenced
it s possible  of course  that there was no innocence in any of the cases i know about
but is that likely  not a single innocent defendant in so many cases  when i was a boy i used to listen closely to my father when he told us about court cases at home  and the judges that came to his studio talked about the court  in our circles nobody talks about anything else  i hardly ever got the chance to go to court myself but always made use of it when i could  i ve listened to countless trials at important stages in their development  i ve followed them closely as far as they could be followed  and i have to say that i ve never seen a single acquittal    so
not a single acquittal   said k   as if talking to himself and his hopes  that confirms the impression i already have of the court so there s no point in it from this side either
they could replace the whole court with a single hangman    you shouldn t generalise   said the painter  dissatisfied   i ve only been talking about my own experience    well that s enough   said k    or have you heard of any acquittals that happened earlier    they say 184 the trial there have been some acquittals earlier   the painter answered   but it s very hard to be sure about it
the courts don t make their final conclusions public  not even the judges are allowed to know about them  so that all we know about these earlier cases are just legends
but most of them did involve absolute acquittals  you can believe that  but they can t be proved
on the other hand  you shouldn t forget all about them either  i m sure there is some truth to them  and they are very beautiful  i ve painted a few pictures myself depicting these legends    my assessment will not be altered by mere legends   said k
 i don t suppose it s possible to cite these legends in court  is it   the painter laughed
 no  you can t cite them in court   he said
 then there s no point in talking about them   said k   he wanted  for the time being  to accept anything the painter told him  even if he thought it unlikely or contradicted what he had been told by others
he did not now have the time to examine the truth of everything the painter said or even to disprove it  he would have achieved as much as he could if the painter would help him in any way even if his help would not be decisive
as a result  he said   so let s pay no more attention to absolute acquittal  but you mentioned two other possibilities    apparent acquittal and deferment
they re the only possibilities   said the painter
 but before we talk about them  would you not like to take your coat off  you must be hot    yes   said k   who until then had paid attention to nothing but the painter s explanations  but now that he had had the heat pointed out to him his brow began to sweat heavily
 it s almost unbearable   the painter free ebooks at planet ebook com 185 nodded as if he understood k  s discomfort very well
 could we not open the window   asked k
 no   said the painter
 it s only a fixed pane of glass  it can t be opened   k
now realised that all this time he had been hoping the painter would suddenly go over to the window and pull it open
he had prepared himself even for the fog that he would breathe in through his open mouth the thought that here he was entirely cut off from the air made him feel dizzy
he tapped lightly on the bedspread beside him and  with a weak voice  said   that is very inconvenient and unhealthy    oh no   said the painter in defence of his window   as it can t be opened this room retains the heat better than if the window were double glazed  even though it s only a single pane
there s not much need to air the room as there s so much ventilation through the gaps in the wood  but when i do want to i can open one of my doors  or even both of them   k
was slightly consoled by this explanation and looked around to see where the second door was
the painter saw him do so and said   it s behind you  i had to hide it behind the bed   only then was k
able to see the little door in the wall
 it s really much too small for a studio here   said the painter  as if he wanted to anticipate an objection k
would make
 i had to arrange things as well as i could
that s obviously a very bad place for the bed  in front of the door
for instance when the judge i m painting at present comes he always comes through the door by the bed  and i ve even given him a key to this door so that he can wait for me here in the studio when i m not home
although nowadays he usually comes early in the morning when i m still asleep
186 the trial and of course  it always wakes me up when i hear the door opened beside the bed  however fast asleep i am
if you could hear the way i curse him as he climbs over my bed in the morning you d lose all respect for judges
i suppose i could take the key away from him but that d only make things worse
it only takes a tiny effort to break any of the doors here off their hinges   all the time the painter was speaking  k
was considering whether he should take off his coat  but he finally realised that  if he didn t do so  he would be quite unable to stay here any longer  so he took off his frock coat and lay it on his knee so that he could put it back on again as soon as the conversation was over
he had hardly done this when one of the girls called out   now he s taken his coat off   and they could all be heard pressing around the gaps in the planks to see the spectacle for themselves  the girls think i m going to paint your portrait   said the painter   and that s why you re taking your coat off    i see   said k   only slightly amused by this  as he felt little better than he had before even though he now sat in his shirtsleeves
with some irritation he asked   what did you say the two other possibilities were   he had already forgotten the terms used  apparent acquittal and deferment   said the painter
 it s up to you which one you choose
you can get either of them if i help you  but it ll take some effort of course  the difference between them is that apparent acquittal needs concentrated effort for a while and that deferment takes much less effort but it has to be sustained
now then  apparent acquittal
if that s what you want i ll write down an assertion of your innocence on a piece of pa  free ebooks at planet ebook com 187 per
the text for an assertion of this sort was passed down to me from my father and it s quite unassailable
i take this assertion round to the judges i know
so i ll start off with the one i m currently painting  and put the assertion to him when he comes for his sitting this evening
i ll lay the assertion in front of him  explain that you re innocent and give him my personal guarantee of it
and that s not just a superficial guarantee  it s a real one and it s binding   the painter s eyes seemed to show some reproach of k
for wanting to impose that sort of responsibility on him
 that would be very kind of you   said k
 and would the judge then believe you and nonetheless not pass an absolute acquittal    it s like i just said   answered the painter
 and anyway  it s not entirely sure that all the judges would believe me  many of them  for instance  might want me to bring you to see them personally
so then you d have to come along too
but at least then  if that happens  the matter course
what also happens  though  is that there are some judges who ll turn me down in advance  and that s worse
i ll certainly make several attempts  but still  we ll have to forget about them  but at least we can afford to do that as no one judge can pass the decisive verdict
then when i ve got enough judges  signatures on this document i take it to the judge who s concerned with your case
i might even have his signature already  in which case things develop a bit quicker than they would do otherwise
but there aren t usually many hold ups from then on  and that s the time that the 188 the trial defendant can feel most confident
it s odd  but true  that people feel more confidence in this time than they do after they ve been acquitted
there s no particular exertion needed now
when he has the document asserting the defendant s innocence  guaranteed by a number of other judges  the judge can acquit you without any worries  and although there are still several formalities to be gone through there s no doubt that that s what he ll do as a favour to me and several other acquaintances
you  however  walk out the court and you re free    so  then i ll be free   said k   hesitantly
 that s right   said the painter   but only apparently free or  to put it a better way  temporarily free  as the most junior judges  the ones i know  they don t have the right to give the final acquittal
only the highest judge can do that  in the court that s quite of reach for you  for me and for all of us
we don t know how things look there and  incidentally  we don t want to know
the right to acquit people is a major privilege and our judges don t have it  but they do have the right to free people from the indictment
that s to say  if they re freed in this way then for the time being the charge is withdrawn but it s still hanging over their heads and it only takes an order from higher up to bring it back into also tell you how the difference between absolute and apparent acquittal is described  just in a superficial way  in the directives to the court offices
if there s an absolute acquittal all proceedings should stop  everything disappears from the process  not just the indictment but the trial and even the acquittal disappears  everything just disappears
with free ebooks at planet ebook com 189 an apparent acquittal it s different
when that happens  nothing has changed except that the case for your innocence  for your acquittal and the grounds for the acquittal have been made stronger
apart from that  proceedings go on as before  the court offices continue their business and the case gets passed to higher courts  gets passed back down to the lower courts and so on  backwards and forwards  on
seen from outside it can sometimes seem that everything has been long since forgotten  the documents have been lost and the acquittal is complete
no one familiar with the court would believe it
no documents ever get lost  the court forgets nothing
one day no one expects it some judge or other picks up the documents and looks more closely at them  he notices that this particular case is still been talking here as if there s a long delay between apparent acquittal and re arrest  that is quite possible and i do know of cases like that  but it s just as likely that the defendant goes home after he s been acquitted and finds somebody there waiting to re arrest him
then  of course  his life as a free man is at an end    and does the trial start over again   asked k   finding it hard to believe
 the trial will always start over again   said the painter   but there is  once again as before  the possibility of getting an apparent acquittal
once again  the accused has to muster all his strength and mustn t give up   the painter said that last phrase possibly as a result of the impression that k   whose shoulders had 190 the trial dropped somewhat  gave on him
 but to get a second acquittal   asked k   as if in anticipation of further revelations by the painter   is that not harder to get than the first time    as far as that s concerned   answered the painter   there s nothing you can say for certain
you mean  do you  that the second arrest would have an adverse influence on the judge and the verdict he passes on the defendant  that s not how it happens
when the acquittal is passed the judges are already aware that re arrest is likely
so when it happens it has hardly any effect
but there are countless other reasons why the judges  mood and their legal acumen in the case can be altered  and efforts to obtain the second acquittal must therefore be suited to the new conditions  and generally just as vigorous as the first    but this second acquittal will once again not be final   said k   shaking his head
 of course not   said the painter   the second acquittal is followed by the third arrest  the third acquittal by the fourth arrest and so on
that s what is meant by the term apparent acquittal   k
was silent
 you clearly don t think an apparent acquittal offers much advantage   said the painter   perhaps deferment would suit you better
would you like me to explain what deferment is about   k
nodded
the painter had leant back and spread himself out in his chair  his nightshirt was wide open  he had pushed his hand inside and was stroking his breast and his sides  deferment   said the painter  looking vaguely in front of himself for a while as if trying to find a perfectly appropriate explanation   deferment consists of keeping proceedings permanently in their earliest stages to do that  the accused and those helping him need to keep free ebooks at planet ebook com 191 those helping him
i repeat  this doesn t require so much effort as getting an apparent acquittal  but it probably requires a lot more attention
you must never let the trial out of your sight  you have to go and see the appropriate judge at regular intervals as well as when something in particular comes up and  whatever you do  you have to try and remain friendly with him  if you don t know the judge personally you have to influence him through the judges you do know  and you have to do it without giving up on the direct discussions
as long as you don t fail to do any of these things you can be reasonably sure the trial won t get past its first stages
the trial doesn t stop  but the defendant is almost as certain of avoiding conviction as if he d been acquitted
compared with an apparent acquittal  deferment has the advantage that the defendant s future is less uncertain  he s safe from the shock of being suddenly re arrested and doesn t need to fear the exertions and stress involved in getting an apparent acquittal just when everything else in his life would make it most difficult
deferment does have certain disadvantages of its own though  too  and they shouldn t be under estimated
i don t mean by this that the defendant is never free  he s never free in the proper sense of the word with an apparent acquittal either
there s another disadvantage
proceedings can t be prevented from moving forward unless there are some at least ostensible reasons given
so something needs to seem to be happening when looked at from the outside
this means that from time to time various injunctions have to be obeyed  the accused has to be ques  192 the trial tioned  investigations have to take place and so on
the trial s been artificially constrained inside a tiny circle  and it has to be continuously spun round within it
and that  of course  brings with it certain unpleasantnesses for the accused  although you shouldn t imagine they re all that bad
all of this is just for show  the interrogations  for instance  they re only very short  if you ever don t have the time or don t feel like going to them you can offer an excuse  with some judges you can even arrange the injunctions together a long time in advance  in essence all it means is that  as the accused  you have to report to the judge from time to time   even while the painter was speaking those last words k
had laid his coat over his arm and had stood up
immediately  from outside the door  there was a cry of  he s standing up now  
 are you leaving already   asked the painter  who had also stood up
 it must be the air that s driving you out
i m very sorry about that
there s still a lot i need to tell you
i had to put everything very briefly but i hope at least it was all clear    oh yes   said k   whose head was aching from the effort of listening
despite this affirmation the painter summed it all up once more  as if he wanted to give k
something to console him on his way home
 both have in common that they prevent the defendant being convicted   he said
 but they also prevent his being properly acquitted   said k
quietly  as if ashamed to acknowledge it
 you ve got it  in essence   said the painter quickly
k
placed his hand on his winter overcoat but could not bring himself to put it on most of all he would have liked to pack everything together and run out to the fresh air
not even the girls free ebooks at planet ebook com 193 could induce him to put his coat on  even though they were already loudly telling each other that he was doing so
the painter still had to interpret k  s mood in some way  so he said   i expect you ve deliberately avoided deciding between my suggestions yet
that s good
i would even have advised against making a decision straight away
there s no more than a hair s breadth of difference between the advantages and disadvantages
everything has to be carefully weighed up
but the most important thing is you shouldn t lose too much time    i ll come back here again soon   said k   who had suddenly decided to put his frock coat on  threw his overcoat over his shoulder and hurried over to the door behind which the girls now began to scream
k
thought he could even see the screaming girls through the door
 well  you ll have to keep your word   said the painter  who had not followed him   otherwise i ll to the bank to ask about it myself    will you open this door for me   said k
pulling at the handle which  as he noticed from the resistance  was being held tightly by the girls on the other side
 do you want to be bothered by the girls   asked the painter
 it s better if you use the other way out   he said  pointing to the door behind the bed
k
agreed to this and jumped back to the bed
but instead of opening that door the painter crawled under the bed and from underneath it asked k    just a moment more  would you not like to see a picture i could sell to you   k
did not want to be impolite  the painter really had taken his side and promised to help him more in the future  and because of k  s forgetfulness there had been no mention of any payment for the painter s help  so k
could not turn him 194 the trial down now and allowed him to show him the picture  even though he was quivering with impatience to get out of the studio
from under the bed  the painter withdrew a pile of unframed paintings
they were so covered in dust that when the painter tried to blow it off the one on top the dust swirled around in front of k  s eyes  robbing him of breath for some time
 moorland landscape   said the painter passing the picture to k
it showed two sickly trees  well separated from each other in dark grass
in the background there was a multi coloured sunset
 that s nice   said k
 i ll buy it   k
expressed himself in this curt way without any thought  so he was glad when the painter did not take this amiss and picked up a second painting from the floor  this is a counterpart to the first picture   said the painter
perhaps it had been intended as a counterpart  but there was not the slightest difference to be seen between it and the first picture  there were the trees  there the grass and there the sunset
but this was of little importance to k
 they are beautiful landscapes   he said   i ll buy them both and hang them in my office    you seem to like this subject   said the painter  picking up a third painting   good job i ve still got another  similar picture here   the picture though  was not the painter was fully exploiting this opportunity to sell off his old pictures
 i ll take this one too   said k
 how much do the three paintings cost    we can talk about that next time   said the painter
 you re in a hurry now  and we ll free ebooks at planet ebook com 195 they re all moorland landscapes  i ve painted a lot of moorland landscapes
a lot of people don t like that sort of picture because they re too gloomy  but there are others  and you re one of them  who love gloomy themes   but k
was not in the mood to hear about the professional experiences of this painter cum beggar
 wrap them all up   he called out  interrupting the painter as he was speaking   my servant will come to fetch them in the morning    there s no need for that   said the painter  i expect i can find a porter for you who can go with you now   and  at last  he leant over the bed and unlocked the door
 just step on the bed  don t worry about that   said the painter   that s what everyone does who comes in here   even without this invitation  k
had shown no compunction in already placing his foot in the middle of the bed covers  then he looked out through the open door and drew his foot back again
 what is that   he asked the painter
 what are you so surprised at   he asked  surprised in his turn
 those are court offices
didn t you know there are court offices here  there are court offices in the court put it at my disposal   it was not so much finding court offices even here that shocked k   he was mainly shocked at himself  at his own na•vety in court matters it seemed to him that one of the most basic rules governing how a defendant should behave was always to be prepared  never allow surprises  never to look  unsuspecting  to the right when the judge stood beside him to his left and this was the very basic rule that he was continually violating
a 196 the trial long corridor extended in from of him  air blew in from it which  compared with the air in the studio  was refreshing
there were benches set along each side of the corridor just as in the waiting area for the office he went to himself there seemed to be precise rules governing how offices should be equipped
there did not seem to be many people visiting the offices that day
there was a man there  half sitting  half laying  his face was buried in his arm on the bench and he seemed to be sleeping  another man was standing in the half dark at the end of the corridor
k
now climbed over the bed  the painter followed him with the pictures
they soon came across a servant of the court k
was now able to recognise all the servants of the court from the gold buttons they wore on their civilian clothes below the normal buttons and the painter instructed him to go with k
carrying the pictures
k
staggered more than he walked  his handkerchief pressed over his mouth
they had nearly reached been able to avoid them
they had clearly seen that the second door of the studio had been opened and had gone around to impose themselves on him from this side  i can t come with you any further   called out the painter with a laugh as the girls pressed in
 goodbye  and don t hesitate too long   k
did not even look round at him
once on the street he took the first cab he came across
he now had to get rid of the servant  whose gold button continually caught his eye even if it caught no one else s
as a servant  the servant of the court was going to sit on the coach box
but k
chased him down from there
it was already well into the free ebooks at planet ebook com 197 afternoon when k
arrived in front of the bank
he would have liked to leave the pictures in the cab but feared there might be some occasion when he would have to let the painter see he still had them
so he had the pictures taken to his office and locked them in the lowest drawer of his desk so that he could at least keep them safe from the deputy director s view for the next few days
198 the trial block  the businessman dismissing the lawyer k
had at last made the decision to withdraw his defence from the lawyer
it was impossible to remove his doubts as to whether this was the right decision  but this was outweighed by his belief in its necessity
this decision  on the day he intended to go to see the lawyer  took a lot of the strength he needed for his work  he worked exceptionally slowly  he had to remain in his office a long time  and it was already past ten o clock when he finally stood in front of the lawyer s front door
even before he rang he considered whether it might not be better to give the lawyer notice by letter or telephone  a personal conversation would certainly do without it  if he gave notice by any other means it would be received in silence or with a few formulated words  and unless leni could discover anything k
would never learn how the lawyer had taken his dismissal and what its consequences might be  in the lawyer s not unimportant opinion
but sitting in front of him and taken by surprise by his dismissal  k
would be able easily to infer everything he wanted from the lawyer s face and behaviour  even if he could not be free ebooks at planet ebook com 199 induced to say very much
it was not even out of the question that k
might  after all  be persuaded that it would be best to leave his defence to the lawyer and withdraw his dismissal
as usual  there was at first no response to k  s ring at the door
 leni could be a bit quicker   thought k
but he could at least be glad there was nobody else interfering as usually happened  be it the man in his nightshirt or anyone else who might bother him
as k
pressed on the button for the second time he looked back at the other door  but this time it  too  remained closed
at last  two eyes appeared at the spy hatch in the lawyer s door  although they weren t leni s eyes
someone unlocked the door  but kept himself pressed against it as he called back inside   it s him    and only then did he open the door properly k
pushed against the door  as behind him he could already hear the key being hurriedly turned in the lock of the door to the other flat
when the door in front of him finally opened  he stormed straight into the hallway
through the corridor which led between the rooms he saw leni  to whom the warning cry of the door opener had been directed  still running away in her nightshirt he looked at her for a moment and then looked round at the person who had opened the door
it was a small  wizened man with a full beard  he held a candle in his hand
 do you work here   asked k
 no   answered the man   i don t belong here at all  the lawyer is only representing me  i m here on legal business    without your coat   asked k   indicating the man s deficiency of dress with a gesture of his hand
 oh  do forgive me   said the man  and 200 the trial he looked at himself in the light of the candle he was holding as if he had not known about his appearance until then  is leni your lover   asked k
curtly
he had set his legs slightly apart  his hands  in which he held his hat  were behind his back
merely by being in possession of a thick overcoat he felt his advantage over this thin little man
 oh god   he said and  shocked  raised one hand in front of his face as if in defence   no  no  what can you be thinking    you look honest enough   said k
with a smile   but come along anyway   k
indicated with his hat which way the man was to go and let him go ahead of him
 what is you name then   asked k
on the way
 block
i m a businessman   said the small man  twisting himself round as he thus introduced himself  although k did not allow him to stop moving
 is that your real name   asked k
 of course it is   was the man s reply   why do you doubt it    i thought you might have some reason to keep your name secret   said k
he felt himself as much at liberty as is normally only felt in foreign parts when speaking with people of lower standing  keeping everything about himself to himself  speaking only casually about the interests of the other  able to raise him to a level above one s own  but also able  at will  to let him drop again k
stopped at the door of the lawyer s office  opened it and  to the businessman who had obediently gone ahead  called   not so fast  bring some light here   k
thought leni might have hidden in here  he let the businessman search in every corner  but the room was empty
in front of the picture of the judge k
took hold of the businessman s braces to stop him moving on
 do you know him   he asked  point  free ebooks at planet ebook com 201 ing upwards with his finger
the businessman lifted the candle  blinked as he looked up and said   it s a judge    an important judge   asked k   and stood to the side and in front of the businessman so that he could observe what impression the picture had on him
the businessman was looking up in admiration
 he s an important judge    you don t have much insight   said k
 he is the lowest of the lowest examining judges    i remember now   said the businessman as he lowered the candle   that s what i ve already been told    well of course you have   called out k    i d forgotten about it  of course you would already have been told    but why  why   asked the businessman as he moved forwards towards the door  propelled by the hands of k
outside in the corridor k
said   you know where leni s hidden  do you    hidden   said the businessman   no  but she might be in the kitchen cooking soup for the lawyer    why didn t you say that immediately   asked k
 i was going to take you there  but you called me back again   answered the businessman  as if confused by the contradictory commands
 you think you re very clever  don t you   said k   now take me there   k
had never been in the kitchen  it was surprisingly big and very well equipped
the stove alone was three times bigger than normal stoves  but it was not possible to see any detail beyond this as the kitchen was at the time illuminated by no more than a small lamp hanging by the entrance
at the stove stood leni  in a white apron as always  breaking eggs into a pot standing on a spirit lamp
 good evening  josef   she said with a glance sideways
 good evening   said k   pointing with one hand to a chair 202 the trial in a corner which the businessman was to sit on  and he did indeed sit down on it
k
however went very close behind leni s back  leant over her shoulder and asked   who is this man   leni put one hand around k
as she stirred the soup with the other  she drew him forward toward herself and name of block
just look at him   the two of them looked back over their shoulders
the businessman was sitting on the chair that k
had directed him to  he had extinguished the candle whose light was no longer needed and pressed on the wick with his fingers to stop the smoke
 you were in your nightshirt   said k   putting his hand on her head and turning it back towards the stove
she was silent
 is he your lover   asked k
she was about to take hold of the pot of soup  but k
took both her hands and said   answer me   she said   come into the office  i ll explain everything to you    no   said k    i want you to explain it here   she put her arms around him and wanted to kiss him k   though  pushed her away and said   i don t want you to kiss me now    josef   said leni  looking at k
imploringly but frankly in the eyes   you re not going to be jealous of mr block now  are you  rudi   she then said  turning to the businessman   help me out will you  i m being suspected of something  you can see that  leave the candle alone   it had looked as though mr block had not been paying attention but he had been following closely
 i don t even know why you might k   looking at the businessman with a smile
leni laughed out loud and while k
was not paying attention took the op  free ebooks at planet ebook com 203 portunity of embracing him and whispering   leave him alone  now  you can see what sort of person he is
i ve been helping him a little bit because he s an important client of the lawyer s  and no other reason
and what about you  do you want to speak to the lawyer at this time of day  he s very unwell today  but if you want i ll tell him you re here
but you can certainly spend the night with me
it s so long since you were last here  even the lawyer has been asking about you
don t neglect your case  and i ve got some things to tell you that i ve learned about
but now  before anything else  take your coat off   she helped him off with his coat  took the hat off his head  ran with the things into the hallway to hang them up  then she ran back and saw to the soup
 do you want me to tell him you re here straight away or take him his soup first    tell him i m here first   said k
he was in a bad mood  he had originally intended a detailed discussion of his business with leni  especially the question of his giving the lawyer notice  but now he no longer wanted to because of the presence of the businessman
now he considered his affair too important to let this little businessman take part in it and perhaps change some of his decisions  and so he called leni back even though she was already on her way to the lawyer
 bring him his soup first   he said   i want him to get his strength up for the discussion with me  he ll need it    you re a client of the lawyer s too  aren t you   said the businessman quietly from his corner as if he were trying to find this out
it was not  however  taken well
 what business is that of yours   said k   and leni said   will you be quiet
i ll take him his soup first then  shall i   204 the trial and she poured the soup into a dish
 the only worry then is that he might go to sleep soon after he s eaten    what i ve got to say to him will keep him awake   said k   who still wanted to intimate that he intended some important negotiations with the lawyer  he wanted leni to ask him what it was and only then to ask her advice
but instead  she just promptly carried out the order he had given her
when she went over to him with the dish she deliberately brushed against him and whispered   i ll tell him you re here as soon as he s eaten the soup so that i can get you back as soon as possible    just go   said k    just go    be a bit more friendly   she said and  still holding the dish  turned completely round once more in the doorway
k
watched her as she went  the decision had finally been made that the lawyer was to be dismissed  it was probably better that he had not been able to discuss the matter any more with leni beforehand  she hardly understood the him against it and perhaps would even have prevented him from dismissing the lawyer this time  he would have remained in doubt and unease and eventually have carried out his decision after a while anyway as this decision was something he could not avoid
the sooner it was carried out the more harm would be avoided
and moreover  perhaps the businessman had something to say on the matter
k
turned round  the businessman hardly noticed it as he was about to stand up
 stay where you are   said k
and pulled up a chair beside him
 have you been a client of the lawyer s for a long time   asked k
 yes   said the business  free ebooks at planet ebook com 205 man   a very long time    how many years has he been representing you so far  then   asked k
 i don t know how you mean   said the businessman   he s been my business lawyer i buy and sell cereals he s been my business lawyer since i took the business over  and that s about twenty years now  but perhaps you mean my own trial and he s been representing me in that since it started  and that s been more than five years
yes  well over five years   he then added  pulling out an old briefcase   i ve got everything written remember everything
probably  my trial s been going on much longer than that  it started soon after the death of my wife  and that s been more than five and a half years now   k
moved in closer to him
 so the lawyer takes on ordinary legal business  does he   he asked
this combination of criminal and commercial business seemed surprisingly reassuring for k
 oh yes   said the businessman  and then he whispered   they even say he s more efficient in jurisprudence than he is in other matters   but then he seemed to regret saying this  and he laid a hand on k  s shoulder and said   please don t betray me to him  will you   k
patted his thigh to reassure him and said   no  i don t betray people    he can be so vindictive  you see   said the businessman
 i m sure he won t do anything against such a faithful client as you   said k
 oh  he might do   said the businessman   when he gets cross it doesn t matter who it is  and anyway  i m not really faithful to him    how s that then   asked k
 i m not sure i should tell you about it   said the businessman hesitantly
 i think it ll be alright   said k
 well then   206 the trial said the businessman   i ll tell you about some of it  but you ll have to tell me a secret too  then we can support each other with the lawyer    you are very careful   said k    but i ll tell you a secret that will set your mind completely at ease
now tell me  in what way have you been unfaithful to the lawyer    i ve …  said the businessman hesitantly  and in a tone as if he were confessing something dishonourable   i ve taken on other lawyers besides him    that s not so serious   said k   a little disappointed
 it is  here   said the businessman  who had had some difficulty breathing since making his confession but who now  after hearing k  s comment  began to feel more trust for him
 that s not allowed
and it s allowed least of all to take on petty lawyers when you ve already got a proper one
and that s just what i have done  besides him i ve got five petty lawyers    five   exclaimed k   astonished at this number   five lawyers besides this one   the businessman nodded
 i m even negotiating with a sixth one    but why do you need so many lawyers   asked k
 i need all of them   said the businessman
 would you mind explaining that to me   asked k
 i d be glad to   said the businessman
 most of all  i don t want to lose my case  well that s obvious
so that means i mustn t neglect anything that might be of use to me  even if there s very little hope of a particular thing being of any use i can t just throw it away
so everything i have i ve put to use in my case
i ve taken all the money out of my business  for example  the offices for my business used to occupy nearly a whole floor  but now all i need is a little room at the back where i work with one apprentice
it wasn t just using up the free ebooks at planet ebook com 207 money that caused the difficulty  of course  it was much more to do with me not working at the business as much as i used to
if you want to do something about your trial you don t have much time for anything else    so you re also working at the court yourself   asked k
 that s just what i want to learn more about    i can t tell you very much about that   said the businessman   at first i tried to do that too but i soon had to give it up again
it wears you out too much  and it s really not much use
and it turned out to be quite impossible to work there yourself and to negotiate  at least for me it was
it s a heavy strain there just sitting and waiting
you know yourself what the air is like in those offices    how do you know i ve been there  then   asked k
 i was in the waiting room myself when you went through    what a coincidence that is   exclaimed k   totally engrossed and forgetting how ridiculous the businessman had seemed to him earlier
 so you saw me  you were in the waiting room when i went through
yes  i did go through it one time    it isn t such a big coincidence   said the businessman   i m there nearly every day    i expect i ll have to go there quite often myself now   said k    although i can hardly expect to be shown the same respect as i was then
they all stood up for me
they must have thought i was a judge    no   said the businessman   we were greeting the servant of the court
we knew you were a defendant
that sort of news spreads very quickly    so you already knew about that   said k    the way i behaved must have seemed very arrogant to you
did you criticise me for it afterwards    no   said the businessman   quite the opposite
that was just stupidity   208 the trial  what do you mean   stupidity    asked k
 why are you asking about it   said the businessman in some irritation
 you still don t seem to know the people there and you might take it wrong
don t forget in proceedings like this there are always lots of different things coming up to talk about  things that you just can t understand with reason and so  instead  people rely on superstition
i m talking about the others  but i m no better myself
one of these superstitions  for example  is that you can learn a lot about the outcome of a defendant s case by looking at his face  especially the shape of his lips
there are lots who believe that  and they said they could see from the shape of your lips that you d definitely be found guilty very soon
i repeat that all this is just a ridiculous superstition  and in most cases it s society it s hard to hold yourself back from beliefs like that
just think how much effect that superstition can have
you spoke to one of them there  didn t you  he was hardly able to give you an answer
there are lots of things there that can make you confused  of course  but one of them  for him  was the appearance of your lips
he told us all later he thought he could see something in your lips that meant he d be convicted himself    on my lips   asked k   pulling out a pocket mirror and examining himself  i can see nothing special about my lips
can you    nor can i   said the businessman   nothing at all    these people are so superstitious   exclaimed k
 isn t that what i just told you   asked the free ebooks at planet ebook com 209 each other  exchanging each other s opinions   said k
 i ve kept myself completely apart so far    they don t normally  that would be impossible  there are so many of them
and they don t have much in common either
if a group of them ever thinks they have found something in common it soon turns out they were mistaken
there s nothing you can do as a group where the court s concerned
each case is examined separately  the court is very painstaking
so there s nothing to be achieved by forming into a group  only sometimes an individual will achieve something in secret  and it s only when that s been done the others learn about it  nobody knows how it was done
so there s no sense of togetherness  you meet people now and then in the waiting rooms  but we don t talk much there the superstitious beliefs were established a long time ago and they spread all by themselves    i saw those gentlemen in the waiting room   said k    it seemed so pointless for them to be waiting in that way    waiting is not pointless   said the businessman   it s only pointless if you try and interfere yourself i told you just now i ve got five lawyers besides this one
you might think i thought it myself at first you might think i could leave the whole thing entirely up to them now
that would be entirely wrong
i can leave it up to them less than when i had just the one
maybe you don t understand that  do you    no   said k   and to slow the businessman down  who had been speaking too fast  he laid his hand on the businessman s to reassure him   but i d like just to ask you to speak a little more slowly  these are many very important things for me  210 the trial right to remind me of that   said the businessman   you re new to all this  a junior
your trial is six months old  isn t it  yes  i ve heard about it
such a new case  but i ve already thought all these things through countless times  to me they re the most obvious things in the world    you must be glad your trial has already progressed so far  are you   asked k   he did not wish to ask directly how the businessman s affairs stood  but received no clear answer anyway
 yes  i ve been working at my trial for five years now   said the businessman as his head sank   that s no small achievement   then he was silent for a while
k
listened to hear whether leni was on her way back
on the one hand he did not want her to come back too soon as he still had many questions to ask and did not want her to find him in this intimate discussion with the businessman  but on the other hand it irritated him that she stayed so long with the lawyer when k
was there  much longer than she needed to give him his soup
 i and k
immediately gave him his full attention   when my case was as old as yours is now
i only had this one lawyer at that time but i wasn t very satisfied with him   now i ll find out everything  thought k   nodding vigorously as if he could thereby encourage the businessman to say everything worth knowing
 my case   the businessman continued   didn t move on at all  there were some hearings that took place and i went to every one of them  collected materials  handed all my business books to the court which i later found was entirely unnecessary i ran back and forth to the free ebooks at planet ebook com 211 lawyer  and he submitted various documents to the court too …   various documents   asked k
 yes  that s right   said the businessman
 that s very important for me   said k    in my case he s still working on the first set of documents
he still hasn t done anything
i see now that he s been neglecting me quite disgracefully    there can be lots of good reasons why the first documents still aren t ready   said the businessman   and anyway  it turned out later on that the ones he submitted for me were entirely worthless
i even read one of them myself  one of the officials at the court say anything
most of all  there was lots of latin  which i can t understand  then pages and pages of general appeals to the court  then lots of flattery for particular officials  they weren t named  these officials  but anyone familiar with the court must have been able to guess who they were  then there was self praise by the lawyer where he humiliated himself to the court in a way that was downright dog like  and then endless investigations of cases from the past which were supposed to be similar to mine although  as far as i was able to follow them  these investigations had been carried out very carefully
now  i don t mean to criticise the lawyer s work with all of this  and the document i read was only one of many  but even so  and this is something i will say  at that time i couldn t see any progress in my trial at all    and what sort of progress had you been hoping for   asked k
 that s a very sensible question   said the businessman with a smile   it s only very rare that you see any progress in these proceedings at all
but i didn t know that 212 the trial then
i m a businessman  much more in those days than now  i wanted to see some tangible progress  it should have all been moving to some conclusion or at least should have been moving on in some way according to the rules
instead of which there were just more hearings  and most of them went through the same things anyway  i had all the answers off pat like in a church service  there were messengers from the court coming to me at work several times a week  or they came to me at home or anywhere else they could find me  and that was very disturbing of course  but at least now things are better in that respect  it s much less disturbing my trial even started to spread among some of the people i do business with  and especially my relations  so i was being made to suffer in many different ways but there was still not the slightest sign that even the first hearing would take place soon
so i went to the lawyer and complained about it
he explained it all to me at length  but refused to do anything i asked for  no one has any influence on the way the trial proceeds  he said  to try and insist on it in any of the documents submitted like i was asking was simply unheard of and would do harm to both him and me
i thought to myself  what this lawyer can t or won t do another lawyer will
so i looked round for other lawyers
and before you say anything  none of them asked for a definite date for the main trial and none of them got one  and anyway  apart form one exception which i ll talk about in a minute  it really is impossible  that s one thing this lawyer didn t mislead me about  but besides  i had no reason to regret turning to oth  free ebooks at planet ebook com 213 er lawyers
perhaps you ve already heard how dr
huld talks about the petty lawyers  he probably made them sound very contemptible to you  and he s right  they are contemptible
but when he talks about them and compares them with himself and his colleagues there s a small error running through what he says  and  just for your interest  i ll tell you about it when he talks about the lawyers he mixes with he sets them apart by calling them the  great lawyers 
that s wrong  anyone can call himself  great  if he wants to  of course  but in this case only the usage of the court can make that distinction you see  the court says that besides the petty lawyers there are also minor lawyers and great lawyers
this one and his colleagues are only minor lawyers  and the difference in rank between them and the great lawyers  who i ve only ever heard about and never seen  is incomparably greater than between the minor lawyers and the despised petty lawyers    the great lawyers   asked k
 who are they about them  then   said the businessman
 there s hardly anyone who s been accused who doesn t spend a lot of time dreaming about the great lawyers once he s heard about them
it s best if you don t let yourself be misled in that way
i don t know who the great lawyers are  and there s probably talk about with certainty where they ve taken any part
they do defend a lot of people  but you can t get hold of them by your own efforts  they only defend those who they want to defend
and i don t suppose they ever take on cases that haven t already got past the lower courts
anyway  it s best 214 the trial not to think about them  as if you do it makes the discussions with the other lawyers  all their advice and all that they do manage to achieve  seem so unpleasant and useless  i had that experience myself  just wanted to throw everything away and lay at home in bed and hear nothing more about it
but that  of course  would be the stupidest thing you could do  and you wouldn t be left in peace in bed for very long either    so you weren t thinking about the great lawyers at that time   asked k
 not for very long   said the businessman  and smiled again   you can t forget about them entirely  i m afraid  especially in the night when these thoughts come so easily
but i wanted immediate results in those days  so i went to the petty lawyers    well look at you two sat huddled together   called leni as she came back with the dish and stood in the doorway
they were indeed sat close together  if either of them turned his head even slightly it would have knocked against the other s  the businessman was not only very small but also sat hunched down  so that k
was also forced to bend down low if he wanted to hear everything
 not quite yet   called out k   to turn leni away  his hand  still resting on the businessman s hand  twitching with impatience
 he wanted me to tell him about my trial   said the businessman to leni
 carry on  then  carry on   she said
she spoke to the businessman with affection but  at the same time  with condescension
k
did not like that  he had begun to learn that the man was of some value after all  he had experience at least  and he was willing to share it
leni was probably wrong about him
he watched her in irritation as leni now free ebooks at planet ebook com 215 took the candle from the businessman s hand which he had been holding on to all this time wiped his hand with her apron and then knelt beside him to scratch off some wax that had dripped from the candle onto his trousers
 you were about to tell me about the petty lawyers   said k   shoving leni s hand away with no further comment
 what s wrong with you today   asked leni  tapped him gently and carried on with what she had been doing
 yes  the petty lawyers   said the businessman  putting his hand to his brow as if thinking hard
k
wanted to help him and said   you wanted immediate results and so went to the petty lawyers    yes  that s right   said the businessman  but did not continue with what he d been saying
 maybe he doesn t want to speak about it in front of leni   thought k   suppressing his impatience to hear the rest straight away  and stopped trying to press him
 have you told him i m here   he asked leni
 course i have   she said   he s waiting for you
leave block alone now  you can talk to block later  he ll still be here   k
still hesitated
 you ll still be here   he asked the businessman  wanting to hear the answer from him and not wanting leni to speak about the businessman as if he weren t there  he was full of secret resentment towards leni today
and once more it was only leni who answered
 he often sleeps here    he sleeps here   exclaimed k   he had thought the businessman would just wait there for him while he quickly settled his business with the lawyer  and then they would leave together to discuss everything thoroughly and undisturbed
 yes   said leni   not everyone s like you  josef  allowed to 216 the trial see the lawyer at any time you like
do don t even seem surprised that the lawyer  despite being ill  still receives you at eleven o clock at night
you take it far too much for granted  what your friends do for you
well  your friends  or at least i do  we like to do things for you
i don t want or need any more thanks than that you re fond of me    fond of you   thought k
at first  and only then it occurred to him   well  yes  i am fond of her   nonetheless  what he said  forgetting all the rest  was   he receives me because i am his client
if i needed anyone else s help i d have to beg and show gratitude whenever i do anything    he s really nasty today  isn t he   leni asked the businessman
 now it s me who s not here   thought k   and nearly lost his temper with the businessman when  with the same rudeness as leni  he said   the lawyer also has other reasons to receive him
his case is much more interesting than mine
and it s only in its early stages too  it probably hasn t progressed very far so the lawyer still likes to deal with him
that ll all change later on    yeah  yeah   said leni  looking at the businessman and laughing
 he doesn t half talk   she said  turning to face k
 you can t believe a word he says
he s as talkative as he is sweet
maybe that s why the lawyer can t stand him
at least  he only sees him when he s in the right mood
i ve already tried hard to change that but it s impossible
just think  there are times when i tell him block s here and he doesn t receive him until three days later
and if block isn t on the spot when he s called then everything s lost and it all has to start all over again
that s why i let block sleep here  it wouldn t be the first time dr
huld has wanted to see him in free ebooks at planet ebook com 217 the night
so now block is ready for that
sometimes  when he knows block is still here  he ll even change his mind about letting him in to see him   k
looked questioningly at the businessman
the latter nodded and  although he had spoken quite openly with k
earlier  seemed to be confused with shame as he said   yes  later on you become very dependent on your lawyer    he s only pretending to mind   said leni
 he likes to sleep here really  he s often said so   she went over to a little door and shoved it open
 do you want to see his bedroom   she asked
k
went over to the low  windowless room and looked in from the doorway
the room contained a narrow bed which filled it completely  so that to get into the bed you would need to climb over the bedpost
at the head of the bed there was a niche in the wall where  fastidiously tidy  stood a candle  a bottle of ink  and a pen with a bundle of papers which were probably to do with the trial
 you sleep in the maid s room   asked k   as he went back to the businessman
 leni s let me have it   answered the businessman   it has many advantages   k
looked long at him  his first impression of the businessman had perhaps not been right  he had experience as his trial had already lasted a long time  but he had paid a heavy price for this experience
k
was suddenly unable to bear the sight of the businessman any longer
 bring him to bed  then   he called out to leni  who seemed to understand him
for himself  he wanted to go to the lawyer and  by dismissing him  free himself from not only the lawyer but also from leni and the businessman but before he had reached the door the businessman spoke to him gently
 excuse me  sir   218 the trial he said  and k
looked round crossly
 you ve forgotten your promise   said the businessman  stretching his hand out to k imploringly from where he sat
 you were going to tell me a secret    that is true   said k   as he glanced at leni  who was watching him carefully  to check on her
 so listen  it s hardly a secret now anyway
i m going to see the lawyer now to sack him    he s sacking him   yelled the businessman  and he jumped up from his chair and ran around the kitchen with his arms in the air he kept on shouting   he s sacking his lawyer   leni tried to rush at k
but the businessman got in her way so that she shoved him away with her fists
then  still with her hands balled into fists  she ran after k
who  however  had been given a long start
he was already inside the lawyer s room by the time leni caught up with him
he had almost closed the door behind himself  but leni held the door open with her foot  grabbed his arm and tried to pull him back but he put such pressure on her wrist that  with a sigh  she was forced to release him
she did not dare go into the room straight away  and k
locked the door with the key
 i ve been waiting for you a very long time   said the lawyer from his bed
he had been reading something by the light of a candle but now he laid it onto the bedside table and put his glasses on  looking at k
sharply through them
instead of apologising k
said   i ll be leaving again soon   as he had not apologised the lawyer ignored what k
said  and replied   i won t let you in this late again next time    i find that quite acceptable   said k
the lawyer looked at him quizzically
 sit down   he said
 as you wish   said k   free ebooks at planet ebook com 219 drawing a chair up to the bedside table and sitting down
 it seemed to me that you locked the door   said the lawyer
 yes   said k    it was because of leni   he had no intention of letting anyone off lightly
but the lawyer asked him   was she being importunate again    importunate   asked k
 yes   said the lawyer  laughing as he did so  had a fit of coughing and then  once it had passed  began to laugh again
 i m sure you must have noticed how importunate she can be sometimes   he said  and patted k  s hand which k
had rested on the bedside table and which he now snatched back
 you don t attach much importance to it  then   said the lawyer when k
was silent   so much the better
otherwise i might have needed to apologise to you
it is a peculiarity of leni s
i ve long since forgiven her for it  and i wouldn t be talking of it now  if you hadn t locked the door just now
anyway  perhaps i should at least explain this peculiarity of hers to you  but you seem rather disturbed  the way you re looking at me  and so that s why i ll do it  this each of them  even seems to be loved by each of them  then when i allow her to i am not so astonished by all of this as remarkable and to some extent scientific phenomenon
being indicted does not cause any clear  precisely definable change in a person s appearance  of course
but it s not like with other legal matters  most of them remain in their usu  220 the trial al way of life and  if they have a good lawyer looking after them  the trial doesn t get in their way
but there are nonetheless those who have experience in these matters who can look at a crowd  however big  and tell you which among them is facing a charge
how can they do that  you will ask
my answer will not please you
it is simply that those who at least that s what i  as a lawyer  have to say and nor can it not all of them are punished  so it can only be that the proceedings levelled against them take some kind of hold on even block  pitiful worm that he is   as the lawyer finished what he was saying  k
was fully in control of himself  he had even nodded conspicuously at his last few words in order to confirm to himself the view he had already formed  that the lawyer was trying to confuse him  as he always did  by making general and irrelevant observations  and thus k was offering him more resistance than before  as he became silent  giving k
the chance to speak himself  and then  as k also remained silent  he asked   did you have a particular reason for coming to see me today    yes   said k   putting his hand up to slightly shade his eyes from the light of the candle so that he could see the lawyer better   i wanted to tell you that i m withdrawing my representation from free ebooks at planet ebook com 221 you  with immediate effect    do i understand you rightly   asked the lawyer as he half raised himself in his bed and supported himself with one hand on the pillow  i think you do   said k   sitting stiffly upright as if waiting in ambush
 well we can certainly discuss this plan of yours   said the lawyer after a pause
 it s not a plan any more   said k
 that may be   said the lawyer   but we still mustn t rush anything   he used the word  we   as if he had no intention of letting k
go free  and as if  even if he could no longer represent him  he could still at least continue as his adviser
 nothing is being rushed   said k   standing slowly up and going behind his chair   everything has been well thought out and probably even for too long
the decision is final    then allow me to say a few words   said the lawyer  throwing the bed cover to one side and sitting on the edge of the bed
his naked  whitehaired legs shivered in the cold
he asked k
to pass him a blanket from the couch
k
passed him the blanket and said   you are running the risk of catching cold for no reason    the circumstances are important enough   said the lawyer as he wrapped the bed cover around the top half of his body and then the blanket around his legs  your uncle is my friend and in the course of time i ve become fond of you as well
i admit that quite openly
there s nothing in that for me to be ashamed of   it was very unwelcome for k
to hear the old man speak in this touching way  as it forced him to explain himself more fully  which he would rather have avoided  and he was aware that it also confused him even though it could never make him reverse his decision  thank you for feeling so friendly to  222 the trial ward me   he said   and i also realise how deeply involved you ve been in my case  as deeply as possible for yourself and to bring as much advantage as possible to me
nonetheless  i have recently come to the conviction that it is not enough
i would naturally never attempt  considering that you are so much older and more experienced than i am  to convince you of my opinion  if i have ever unintentionally done so then i beg your forgiveness  but  as you have just said yourself  the circumstances are important enough and it is my belief that my trial needs to be approached with much more vigour than has so far been the case    i see   said the lawyer   you ve become impatient    i am not impatient   said k   with some irritation and he stopped paying so much attention to his choice of words  when i first came here with my uncle you probably noticed i wasn t greatly concerned about my case  and if i wasn t reminded of it by force  as it were  i would forget about it completely
but my uncle insisted i should allow you to represent me and i did so as a favour to him
i could have expected the case to be less of a burden than it had been  as the point of taking on a lawyer is that he should take on some of its weight
but what never such a worry for me as it has been since you ve been representing me
when i was by myself i never did anything about my case  i was hardly aware of it  but then  once there was someone representing me  everything was set for something to happen  i was always  without cease  waiting for you to do something  getting more and more tense  but you did nothing
i did get some information about the court free ebooks at planet ebook com 223 from you that i probably could not have got anywhere else  but that can t be enough when the trial  supposedly in secret  is getting closer and closer to me   k
had pushed the chair away and stood erect  his hands in the pockets of his frock coat
 after a certain point in the proceedings   said the lawyer quietly and calmly   nothing new of any importance ever happens
so many litigants  at the same stage in their trials  have stood before me just like you are now and spoken in the same way    then these other litigants   said k    have all been right  just as i am
that does not show that i m not    i wasn t trying to show that you were mistaken   said the lawyer   but i wanted to add that i expected better judgement from you than from the others  especially as i ve given you more insight into the workings of the court and to accept that  despite everything  you have too little trust in me
you don t make it easy for me   how the lawyer was humiliating himself to k   he was showing no regard for the dignity of his position  which on this point  must have been at its most sensitive and why did he do that  he did seem to be very busy as a lawyer as well a rich man  neither the loss of income nor the loss of a client could have been of much importance to him in themselves he was moreover unwell and should have been thinking of passing work on to others
and despite all that he held on tightly to k
why  was it something personal for his uncle s sake  or did he really see k  s case as one that was exceptional and hoped to be able to distinguish himself with it  either for k  s sake or and this possibility could never be excluded for his friends at the 224 the trial court  it was not possible to learn anything by looking at him  even though k was scrutinizing him quite brazenly
it could almost be supposed he was deliberately hiding his thoughts as he waited to see what effect his words would have
but he clearly deemed k  s silence to be favourable for himself and he continued   you will have noticed the size of my office  but that i don t employ any staff to help me that used to be quite different  there was a time when several young lawyers were working for me but now i work alone
this is partly to do with changes in the way i do business  in that i concentrate nowadays more and more on matters such as your own case  and partly to do with the ever deeper understanding that i acquire from these legal matters
i found that i could never let anyone else deal with this sort of work unless i wanted to harm both the client and the job i had taken on
but the decision to do all the work myself had its obvious result  i was forced to turn almost everyone away who asked me to represent them and could only accept those i was especially interested in well there are enough creatures who leap at every crumb i throw down  and they re not so very far away
most importantly  i became ill from over work
but despite that i don t regret my decision  quite possibly i should have turned more cases away than i did  but it did turn out to be entirely necessary for me to devote myself fully to the cases i did take on  and the successful results showed that it was worth it
i once read a description of the difference between representing someone in ordinary legal matters and in legal matters of this sort  and the writer expressed it very well
this is what free ebooks at planet ebook com 225 he said  some lawyers lead their clients on a thread until judgement is passed  but there are others who immediately lift their clients onto their shoulders and carry them all the way to the judgement and beyond
that s just how it is
but it was quite true when i said i never regret all this work
but if  as in your case  they are so fully misunderstood  well  then i come very close to regretting it   all this talking did more to make k
impatient than to persuade him
from the way the lawyer was speaking  k
thought he could hear what he could expect if he gave in  the delays and excuses would begin again  reports of how the documents were progressing  how the mood of the court officials had improved  as well as all the enormous difficulties in short all that he had heard so many times before would be brought out again even more fully  he would try to mislead k
with hopes that were never specified and to make him suffer with threats that were never clear
he had to put a stop to that  so he said   what will you undertake on my behalf if you continue to represent me   the lawyer quietly accepted even this insulting question  and answered   i should continue with what i ve already been doing for you    that s just what i thought   said k    and now you don t need to say another word    i will make one more attempt   said the lawyer as if whatever had been making k
so annoyed was affecting him too
 you see  i have the impression that you have not only misjudged the legal assistance i have given you but also that that misjudgement has led you to behave in this way  you seem  although you are the accused  to have been treated too well or  to put it a better way  handled with neglect  with appar  226 the trial ent neglect
even that has its reason  it is often better to be in chains than to be free
but i would like to show you how other defendants are treated  perhaps you will succeed in learning something from it
what i will do is i will call block in  unlock the door and sit down here beside the bedside table    be glad to   said k   and did as the lawyer suggested  he was always ready to learn something new
but to make sure of himself for any event he added   but you do realise that you are no longer to be my lawyer  don t you    yes   said the lawyer  but you can still change your mind today if you want to   he lay back down in the bed  pulled the quilt up to his chin and turned to face the wall
then he rang
leni appeared almost the moment he had done so
she looked hurriedly at k
and the lawyer to try and find out what had happened  she seemed to be reassured by the sight of k
sitting calmly at the lawyer s bed
she smiled and nodded to k   k
looked blankly back at her
 fetch block   said the lawyer but instead of going to fetch him  leni just went to the door and called out   block  to the lawyer   then  probably because the lawyer had turned his face to the wall and was paying no attention  she slipped in behind k  s chair from then on  she bothered him by leaning forward over the back of the chair or  albeit very tenderly and carefully  she would run her hands through his hair and over his cheeks
k
eventually tried to stop her by taking hold of one hand  and after some resistance leni let him keep hold of it
block came as soon as he was called  but he remained standing in the doorway and seemed to be wondering whether he free ebooks at planet ebook com 227 head as if listening to find out whether the order to attend the lawyer would be repeated
k
could have encouraged to with the lawyer but with everything in his home  so he kept himself motionless leni was also silent
block noticed that behind his back
he left the door open in case he needed to go back again
k
did not even glance at him  he looked instead only at the thick quilt under which the lawyer could not be seen as he had squeezed up very close to the wall
then his voice was heard   block here   he asked
block had already crept some way into the room but this question seemed to give him first a shove in the breast and then another in the back  he seemed about to fall but remained standing  deeply bowed  and said   at your service  sir    what do you want   asked the lawyer   you ve come at a bad time    wasn t i summoned   asked block  more to himself than the lawyer he held his hands in front of himself as protection and would have been ready to run away any moment  you were summoned   said the lawyer   but you have still come at a bad time   then  after a pause he added   you always come at a bad time   when the lawyer started speaking block had stopped looking at the bed but stared rather into one of the corners  just listening  as if the light from the speaker were brighter than block could bear to look at
but it was also difficult for him to listen  as the lawyer was speaking into the wall and speaking quickly and 228 the trial quietly
 would you like me to go away again  sir   asked block
 well you re here now   said the lawyer
 stay   it was as if the lawyer had not done as block had wanted but instead threatened him with a stick  as now block really began to shake
 i went to see   said the lawyer   the third judge yesterday  a friend of mine  and slowly brought the conversation round to the subject of you
do you want to know what he said    oh  yes please   said block
the lawyer did not answer immediately  so block repeated his request and lowered his head as if about to kneel down
but then k
spoke to him   what do you think you re doing   he shouted
leni had wanted to stop him from calling out and so he took hold of her other hand
it was not love that made him squeeze it and hold on to it so tightly  she sighed frequently and tried to disengage her hands from him
but block was punished for k  s outburst  as the lawyer asked him   who is your lawyer    you are  sir   said block
 and who besides me   the lawyer asked
 no one besides you  sir   said block
 and let there be no one besides me   said the lawyer
block into words they would have been coarse insults
k
had been friendly and willing to discuss his own case with someone like this   i won t disturb you any more   said k   leaning back in his chair
 you can kneel down or creep on all fours  whatever you like
i won t bother with you any more   but block still had some sense of pride  at least where k
was concerned  and he went towards him waving his fists  shouting as loudly as he dared while the lawyer was there
 you free ebooks at planet ebook com 229 shouldn t speak to me like that  that s not allowed
why are you insulting me  especially here in front of the lawyer  where both of us  you and me  we re only tolerated because of his charity
you not a better person than me  you ve been accused of something too  you re facing a charge too
if  in spite of that  you re still a gentleman then i m just as much a gentleman as you are  if not even more so
and i want to be spoken to as a gentleman  especially by you
if you think being allowed to sit there and quietly listen while i creep on all fours as you put it makes you something better than me  then there s an old legal saying you ought to bear in mind  if you re under suspicion it better to be moving than still  as if you re still you can be in the pan of the scales without knowing it and be weighed along with your sins   k
said nothing
eyes completely still
he had gone through such changes in just the last few hours  was it the trial that was throwing him from side to side in this way and stopped him knowing who was friend and who was foe  could he not see the lawyer was deliberately humiliating him and had no other purpose today than to show off his power to k   and perhaps even thereby subjugate k   but if block was incapable of seeing that  or if he so feared the lawyer that no such insight would even be of any use to him  how was it that he was either so sly or so bold as to lie to the lawyer and conceal from his secret any time he liked  but he dared even more than this  he went to the lawyer s bed and began there to make 230 the trial complaints about k
 dr
huld  sir   he said   did you hear the way this man spoke to me  you can count the length of his trial in hours  and he wants to tell me what to do when i ve been involved in a legal case for five years
he even insults me
he doesn t know anything  but he insults me  when i  as far as my weak ability allows  when i ve made a close study of how to behave with the court  what we ought bother you   said the lawyer   and do what seems to you to be right    i will   said block  as if speaking to himself to give himself courage  and with a quick glance to the side he kneeled down close beside the bed  i m kneeling now dr
huld  sir   he said
but the lawyer remained silent
with one hand  block carefully stroked the bed cover
in the silence while he did so  leni  as she freed herself from k  s hands  said   you re hurting me
let go of me
i m going over to block   she went over to him and sat on the edge of the bed
block was very pleased at this and with lively  but silent  gestures he immediately urged her to intercede for him with the lawyer
it was clear that he desperately needed to be told something by the lawyer  although perhaps only so that he could make use of the information with his other lawyers
leni probably knew very well how the lawyer could be brought round  pointed to his hand and pursed her lips as if making a kiss
block immediately performed the hand kiss and  at further urging from leni  repeated it twice more
but the lawyer continued to be silent
then leni leant over body could be seen  and  bent over close to his face  she free ebooks at planet ebook com 231 stroked his long white hair
that now forced him to give an answer
 i m rather wary of telling him   said the lawyer  and his head could be seen shaking slightly  perhaps so that he would feel the pressure of leni s hand better
block listened closely with his head lowered  as if by listening he were breaking an order
 what makes you so wary about it   asked leni
k
had the feeling he was listening to a contrived dialogue that had been repeated many times  that would be repeated many times more  and that for block alone it would never lose its freshness
 what has his behaviour been like today   asked the lawyer instead of an answer
before leni said anything she looked down at block and watched him a short while as he raised his hands towards her and rubbed them together imploringly
finally she gave a serious nod  turned back to the lawyer and said   he s been quiet and industrious   this was an elderly businessman  a man whose beard was long  and he was begging a young girl to speak on his behalf
even if there was some plan behind what he did  there was nothing that could reinstate him in the eyes of his fellow man
k
could not understand how the lawyer could have thought this performance would win him over
even if he had done nothing have done so
it was almost humiliating even for the onlooker
so these were the lawyer s methods  which k
fortunately had not been exposed to for long  to let the client forget about the whole world and leave him with nothing but the hope of reaching the end of his trial by this deluded means
he was no longer a client  he was the lawyer s dog
if 232 the trial the lawyer had ordered him to crawl under the bed as if it were a kennel and to bark out from under it  then he would have done so with enthusiasm
k
listened to all of this  testing it and thinking it over as if he had been given the task of closely observing everything spoken here  inform a higher office about it and write a report
 and what has he been doing all day   asked the lawyer
 i kept him locked in the maid s room all day   said leni   so that he wouldn t stop me doing my work
that s where he usually stays
from time to time i looked in through the spyhole to see was he was doing  and each time he was kneeling on the bed and reading the papers you gave him  propped up on the window sill
that made a good impression on me  as the window only opens onto an air shaft and gives hardly any light
it showed how obedient he is that he was even reading in those conditions    i m pleased to hear it   said the lawyer
 but did he understand what he was reading   while this conversation was going on  block continually moved his lips and was clearly formulating the answers he hoped leni would give
 well i can t give you any certain answer to that of course   said leni   but i could see that he was reading thoroughly
he spent all day reading the same page  running his finger along the lines
whenever i looked in on him he sighed as if this reading was a lot of work for him
i expect the papers you gave him were very hard to understand    yes   said the lawyer   they certainly are that
and i really don t think he understood anything of them
but they should at least give him some inkling of just how hard a struggle it is and how much work it is for me to defend him
and who am i doing free ebooks at planet ebook com 233 all this hard work for  i m doing it it s laughable even to say it i m doing it for block
he ought to realise what that means  too
did he study without a pause    almost without a pause   answered leni
 just the once he asked me for a drink of water  so i gave him a glassful through the window
then at eight o clock i let him out and gave him something to eat   block glanced sideways at k   as if he were being praised and had to impress k
as well
he now seemed more optimistic  he moved more freely and rocked back and forth on his knees
this made his astonishment all the more obvious when he heard the following words from the lawyer   you speak well of him   said the lawyer   but that s just what makes it difficult for me
you see  the judge did not speak well of him at all  neither about block nor about his case    didn t speak well of him   asked leni
 how is that possible   block looked at her with such tension he seemed to think that although the judge s words had been spoken so long before she would be able to change them in his favour
when i started to talk about block to him
 don t talk to me about block   he said
 he is my client   said i
 you re letting him abuse you   he said
 i don t think his case is lost yet   said i
 you re letting him abuse you   he repeated
 i don t think so   said i
 block works hard in his case and always he always knows what s happening
you don t always find such enthusiasm as that
he s not very pleasant personally  i grant you  his manners are terrible and he s dirty  but as far as the trial s concerned he s quite immaculate   i said im  234 the trial maculate  but i was deliberately exaggerating
then he said   block is sly  that s all
he s accumulated plenty of experience and knows how to delay proceedings
but there s more that he doesn t know than he does
what do you think he d say if he learned his trial still hasn t begun  if you told him they haven t even rung the bell to announce the start of proceedings   alright block  alright   said the lawyer  as at these words block had begun to raise himself on his trembling knees and clearly wanted to plead for some explanation it was the first time the lawyer had spoken any clear words directly to block
he looked down with his tired eyes  half blankly and half at block  who slowly sank back down on his knees under this gaze
 what the judge said has no meaning for you   said the lawyer
 you needn t be frightened at every word
if you do it again i won t tell you anything else at all
it s impossible to start a sentence without you looking at me as if you were receiving your final judgement
you should be ashamed of yourself here in front of my client  and you re destroying the trust he has for me
just what is it you want  you re still alive  you re still under my protection
there s no point in worrying  somewhere you ve read that the final judgement can often come without warning  from anyone at any time
and  in the right circumstances  that s basically true  but it s also true that i dislike your anxiety and fear and see that you don t have the trust in me you should have now what have i just said  i repeated something said by one of the judges
you know that there are so many various opinions about the procedure that they form into a great big pile and nobody can free ebooks at planet ebook com 235 make any sense of them
this judge  for instance  sees proceedings as starting at a different point from where i do
a difference of opinion  nothing more
at a certain stage in the proceedings tradition has it that a sign is given by ringing a bell
this judge sees that as the point at which proceedings begin
i can t set out all the opinions opposed to that view here  and you wouldn t understand it anyway  suffice it to say that there are many reasons to disagree with him   embarrassed  block ran his fingers through the pile of the carpet  his anxiety about what the judge had said had let him forget his inferior status towards the lawyer for a while  he thought only about himself and turned the judges words round to examine them from all sides  block   said leni  as if reprimanding him  and  taking hold of the collar of his coat  pulled him up slightly higher
 leave the carpet alone and listen to what the lawyer is saying   236 the trial in the cathedral had come to visit the city for the first time and k
was given the task of showing him some of its cultural sights
at any other time he would have seen this job as an honour but now  when he was finding it hard even to maintain his current position in the bank  he accepted it only with reluctance
every hour that he could not be in the office was a cause of concern for him  he was no longer able to make use of his time in the office anything like as well as he had previously  he spent many hours merely pretending to do important work  but that only increased his anxiety about not being in the office
then he sometimes thought he saw the deputy director  who was always watching  come into k  s office  sit at his desk  look through his papers  receive clients who had almost become old friends of k   and lure them away from him  perhaps he even discovered mistakes  mistakes that seemed to threaten k
from a thousand directions when he was at work now  and which he could no longer avoid
so now  if he was ever asked to leave the office on business or even needed to make a short business trip  however much an honour it seemed and tasks of this sort happened to have increased substantially recently there was always the suspi  free ebooks at planet ebook com 237 cion that they wanted to get him out of his office for a while and check his work  or at least the idea that they thought he was dispensable
it would not have been difficult for him to turn down most of these jobs  but he did not dare to do so because  if his fears had the slightest foundation  turning the jobs down would have been an acknowledgement of them
for this reason  he never demurred from accepting them  and even when he was asked to go on a tiring business trip lasting two days he said nothing about having to go out in the rainy autumn weather when he had a severe chill  just in order to avoid the risk of not being asked to go
when  with a raging headache  he arrived back from this trip he learned that he had been chosen to accompany the for once to turn the job down was very great  especially as it had no direct connection with business  but there was no who knew quite well that he needed some successes at work if he was to maintain his position there and that  if he failed in that  it would not help him even if this italian somehow found him quite charming  he did not want to be removed from his workplace for even one day  as the fear of not being allowed back in was too great  he knew full well that the fear was exaggerated but it still made him anxious
however  in this case it was almost impossible to think of an acceptable excuse  his knowledge of italian was not great but still good a little about art history and this had become widely known 238 the trial around the bank in extremely exaggerated form  and that k
had been a member of the society for the preservation of city monuments  albeit only for business reasons
it was said that this italian was an art lover  so the choice of k
to accompany him was a matter of course
it was a very rainy and stormy morning when k   in a foul temper at the thought of the day ahead of him  arrived early at seven o clock in the office so that he could at least do some work before his visitor would prevent him
he had spent half the night studying a book of italian grammar so that he would be somewhat prepared and was very tired  his had spent far too much time sitting of late  but he resisted the temptation and sat down to his work
unfortunately  just then the servitor came in and reported that the director had sent him to see whether the chief clerk was already in his office  if he was  then would he please be so kind as to come to his reception room as the gentleman from italy was already there
 i ll come straight away   said k
he put a small dictionary in his pocket  took a guide to the city s tourist sites under his arm that he had compiled for strangers  and went through the deputy director s office into that of the director
he was glad he had come into the office so early and was able to be of service immediately  nobody could seriously have expected that of him
the deputy director s office was  of course  still as empty as the middle of the night  the servitor had probably been asked to summon him too but stood up from the deep armchairs where they had been sit  free ebooks at planet ebook com 239 ting
the director gave him a friendly smile  he was clearly very glad that k
was there  he immediately introduced him to the italian who shook k  s hand vigorously and joked that somebody was an early riser
k
did not quite understand whom he had in mind  it was moreover an odd expression to use and it took k
a little while to guess its meaning
he replied with a few bland phrases which the italian received once more with a laugh  passing his hand nervously and repeatedly over his blue grey  bushy moustache
this moustache was obviously perfumed  it was almost tempting to come close to it and sniff
when they had all sat down and begun a light preliminary conversation  k
was disconcerted to notice that he understood no more than fragments of what the italian said
when he spoke very calmly he understood almost everything  but that was very infrequent  mostly the words gushed from his mouth and he seemed to be enjoying himself so much his head shook when he was talking in this way his speech was usually wrapped up in some kind of dialect which seemed to k
to have nothing to do with italian but which the director not only understood but also spoke  although k
ought to have foreseen this as the italian came from the south of his country where the director had also spent several years
whatever the cause  k
realised that the possibility of communicating with the italian had been largely taken from him  even his french was difficult to understand  and his moustache concealed the movements of his lips which might have offered some help in understanding what he said
k
began to anticipate many difficulties  he gave up trying to understand what the 240 the trial italian said with the director there  who could understand him so easily  it would have been pointless effort and for the time being did no more than scowl at the italian as he relaxed sitting deep but comfortable in the armchair  as he frequently pulled at his short  sharply tailored jacket and at one time lifted his arms in the air and moved his hands freely to try and depict something that k could not grasp  even though he was leaning forward and did not let the hands out of his sight
k
had nothing to occupy himself but mechanically watch the exchange between the two men and his tiredness finally made itself felt  to his alarm  although fortunately in good time  he once caught himself nearly getting up  turning round and leaving eventually the italian looked at the clock and jumped up
after taking his leave from the director he turned to k   pressing himself so close to him that k had to push his chair back just so that he could move
the director had  no doubt  seen the anxiety in k  s eyes as he tried to cope with this dialect of italian  he joined in with this conversation in a way that was so adroit and unobtrusive that he seemed to be adding no and patiently breaking into what the italian said so that k
could understand
k
learned in this way that the italian first had a few business matters to settle  that he unfortunately had only a little time at his disposal  that he certainly did not intend to rush round to see every monument in the city  that he would much rather at least as long as k
would agree  it was entirely his decision just see the cathedral and to do so thoroughly
he was extremely pleased to be ac  free ebooks at planet ebook com 241 companied by someone who was so learned and so pleasant by this he meant k   who was occupied not with listening to the italian but the director and asked if he would be so kind  if the time was suitable  to meet him in the cathedral in two hours  time at about ten o clock
he hoped he would certainly be able to be there at that time
k
made an appropriate reply  the italian shook first the director s hand and then k  s  then the director s again and went to the door  half turned to the two men who followed him and continuing to talk without a break
k
remained together with the director for a short while  although the director looked especially unhappy today
he thought he needed to apologise to k
for something and told him they were standing intimately close together he had thought at first he would accompany the italian himself  but then he gave no more precise reason than this then he decided it would be better to send k with him
he should not be surprised if he could not understand the italian at first  he would be able to very soon  and even if he really could not understand very much he said it was not so bad  as it was really not so important for the italian to be understood
and anyway  k  s knowledge of italian was surprisingly good  the director was sure he would get by very well
and with that  it was time for k
to go
he spent the time still remaining to him with a dictionary  copying out obscure words he would need to guide the italian round the cathedral
it was an extremely irksome task  servitors brought him the mail  bank staff came with various queries and  when they saw that k
was busy  stood by the door and did not go away until he had listened to them  the deputy di  242 the trial rector did not miss the opportunity to disturb k
and came in frequently  took the dictionary from his hand and flicked through its pages  clearly for no purpose  when the door to the ante room opened even clients would appear from the centre while he compiled the list of words he would need  then looked them up in the dictionary  then wrote them learn them by heart
the good intentions he had had earlier  though  seemed to have left him completely  it was the italian who had caused him all this effort and sometimes he became so angry with him that he buried the dictionary under some papers firmly intending to do no more preparation  but then he realised he could not walk up and down in the cathedral with the italian without saying a word  so  with in an even greater rage  he pulled the dictionary back out again
there was a telephone call for him  leni wished him good morning and asked how he was  k
thanked her hurriedly and told her it was impossible for him to talk now as he had to go to the cathedral
 to the cathedral   asked leni
 yes  to the cathedral    what do you have to go to the cathedral for   said leni
k
tried to explain it to her briefly  but he had hardly begun when leni suddenly said   they re harassing you   one thing that k
could not bear was pity that he had not wanted or expected  he took his leave of her free ebooks at planet ebook com 243 with two words  but as he put the receiver back in its place he said  half to himself and half to the girl on the other end of the line who could no longer hear him   yes  they re harassing me   by now the time was late and there was almost a danger he would not be on time he took a taxi to the cathedral  at the last moment he had remembered the album that he had had no opportunity to give to the italian earlier and so took it with him now
he held it on his knees and drummed impatiently on it during the whole journey
the rain had eased off slightly but it was still damp chilly and dark  it would be difficult to see anything in the cathedral but standing about on cold flagstones might well make k  s chill much worse
the square in front of the cathedral was quite empty  k
remembered how even as a small child he had noticed that nearly all the houses in this narrow square had the curtains at their windows closed most of the time  although today  with the weather like this  it was more understandable
the cathedral also seemed quite empty  of course no one would think of going there on a day like this
k
hurried along both the side naves but saw no one but an old woman who  wrapped up in a warm shawl  was kneeling at a picture of the virgin mary and staring up at it
then  in the distance  he saw a church official who limped away through a doorway in the wall
k
had arrived on time  it had struck ten not there
k
went back to the main entrance  stood there indecisively for a while  and then walked round the cathedral in the rain in case the italian was waiting at another 244 the trial entrance
he was nowhere to be found
could the director have misunderstood what time they had agreed on  how could anyone understand someone like that properly anyway  whatever had happened  k
would have to wait for him for at least half an hour
as he was tired he wanted to sit down  he went back inside the cathedral  he found something like a small carpet on one of the steps  he moved it with his foot to a nearby pew  wrapped himself up tighter in his coat  put the collar up and sat down to pass the time he opened the album and flicked through the pages a little but soon had to give up as it became so dark that when he looked up he could hardly make out anything in the side nave next to him
in the distance there was a large triangle of candles flickering on the main altar  k
was not certain whether he had seen them earlier
perhaps they had only just been lit
church staff creep silently as part of their job  you don t notice them
when k
happened to turn round he also saw a tall  stout candle attached to a column not far behind him
it was all very pretty  but totally inadequate to illuminate the pictures which were usually left in the darkness of the side altars  and seemed to make the darkness all the deeper
it was discourteous of the italian not to come but it was also sensible of him  there would have been nothing to see  they would have had to content themselves with seeking out a few pictures with k  s electric pocket torch and looking at them one small part at a time k
went over to a nearby side chapel to see what they could have hoped for  he went up a few steps to a low marble railing and leant over it to look at free ebooks at planet ebook com 245 the altar picture by the light of his torch
the eternal light hung disturbingly in front of it
the first thing that k
partly saw and partly guessed at was a large knight in armour who was shown at the far edge of the painting
he was leaning on his sword that he had stuck into the naked ground in front of him where only a few blades of grass grew here and there
he seemed to be paying close attention to something that was being played out in front of him
it was astonishing to see how he stood there without going any closer
perhaps it was his job to stand guard
it was a long time since k
had looked at any pictures and he studied the knight for a long time even though he had continually to blink as he found it difficult to bear the green light of his torch
then when he moved the light to the other parts of the picture he found an interment of christ shown in the usual way  it was also a comparatively new painting
he put his torch away and went back to his place
there seemed to be no point in waiting for the italian any longer  but outside it was certainly raining heavily  and as it was not so cold in the cathedral as k
had expected he decided to stay there for the time being
close by him was the great pulpit  there were two plain golden crosses attached to its little round roof which were lying almost flat and whose tips crossed over each other
the outside of the pulpit s balustrade was covered in green foliage which continued down to the column supporting it  little angels could be seen among the leaves  some of them lively and some of them still
k
walked up to the pulpit and examined it from all sides  its stonework had been sculpted with great care  246 the trial it seemed as if the foliage had trapped a deep darkness between and behind its leaves and held it there prisoner  k
lay his hand in one of these gaps and cautiously felt the stone  until then he had been totally unaware of this pulpit s existence
then k
happened to notice one of the church staff standing behind the next row of pews  he wore a loose  creased  black cassock  he held a snuff box in his left hand and he was watching k
now what does he want  thought k
do i seem suspicious to him  does he want a tip  but when the man in the cassock saw that k
had noticed him he raised his right hand  a pinch of snuff still held between two fingers  and pointed in some vague direction
it was almost impossible to understand what this behaviour meant  k
waited a while longer but the man in the cassock did not stop gesturing with his hand and even augmented it by nodding his head
 now what does he want   asked k
quietly  he did not dare call out loud here  but then he drew out his purse and pushed his way through the nearest pews to reach the man
he  however  immediately gestured to turn down this offer  shrugged his shoulders and limped away
as a child k
had imitated riding on a horse with the same sort of movement as this limp
 this old man is like a child   thought k    he doesn t have the sense for anything more than serving in a church
look at the way he stops when i stop  and how he waits to see whether i ll continue   with a smile  k
followed the old man all the way up the side nave and almost as far as the main altar  all this time the old man continued to point at something but k
deliberately avoided looking round  he was only pointing in order to make it free ebooks at planet ebook com 247 harder for k
to follow him
eventually  k
did stop following  he did not want to worry the old man too much  and he also did not want to frighten him away completely in case the italian turned up after all
he had left the album  he noticed a small secondary pulpit on a column almost next to the stalls by the altar where the choir sat
it was very simple  made of plain white stone  and so small that from a distance it looked like an empty niche where the statue of a saint ought to have been
it certainly would have been impossible for the priest to take a full step back from the balustrade  and  although there was no decoration on it  the top of the pulpit curved in exceptionally low so that a man of average height would not be able stand upright and would have to remain bent forward over the balustrade
in all  it looked as if it had been intended to make the priest suffer  it was impossible to understand why this pulpit would be needed as there were also the other ones available which were large and so artistically decorated
and k
would certainly not have noticed this little pulpit if there had not been a lamp fastened above it  which usually meant there was a sermon about to be given
so was a sermon to be given now  in this empty church  k
looked down at the steps which  pressed close against the column  led up to the pulpit
they were so narrow they seemed to be there as decoration on the column rather than for anyone to use
but under the pulpit k
grinned in astonishment there really was a priest standing with his hand on the handrail ready to climb the steps and looking at k
then he nodded 248 the trial very slightly  so that k
crossed himself and genuflected as he should have done earlier with a little swing  the priest went up into the pulpit with short fast steps
was there really a sermon about to begin  maybe the man in the cassock had not been really so demented  and had meant to lead k  s way to the preacher  which in this empty church would have been very necessary
and there was also  somewhere in front of a picture of the virgin mary  an old woman who should have come to hear the sermon
and if there was to be a sermon why had it not been introduced on the organ  but the organ remained quiet and merely looked out weakly from the darkness of its great height
k
now considered whether he should leave as quickly as possible  if he did not do it now there would be no chance of doing so during the sermon and he would have to stay there for as long as it lasted  he had lost so much time when he should have been in his office  there had long been no need for him to wait for the italian any longer  he looked at his watch  it was eleven
but could there really be a sermon given  could k
constitute the entire congregation  how could he when he was just a stranger who wanted to look at the church  that  basically  was all he was
the idea of a sermon  now  at eleven o clock  on a workday  in hideous weather  was nonsense
the priest there was no doubt that he was a priest  a young man with a smooth  dark face was clearly going up there just to put the lamp out after somebody had lit it by mistake
but there had been no mistake  the priest seemed rather to check that the lamp was lit and turned it a little higher  free ebooks at planet ebook com 249 then he slowly turned to face the front and leant down on the balustrade gripping its angular rail with both hands
he stood there like that for a while and  without turning his head  looked around
k
had moved back a long way and leant his elbows on the front pew
somewhere in the church man in the cassock hunched under his bent back and at peace  as if his work were completed
in the cathedral it was now very quiet  but k
would have to disturb that silence  he had no intention of staying there  if it was the priest s duty to preach at a certain time regardless of the circumstances then he could  and he could do it without k  s taking part  and k  s presence would do nothing to augment the effect of it so k
began slowly to move  felt his way on tiptoe along the pew  arrived at the broad aisle and went along it without being disturbed  except for the sound of his steps  however light  which rang out on the stone floor and resounded from the vaulting  quiet but continuous at a repeating  regular pace
k
felt slightly abandoned as  probably observed by the priest  he walked by himself between the empty pews  and the size of the cathedral seemed to be just at the limit of what a man could bear when he arrived back at where he had been sitting he did not hesitate but simply reached out for the album he had left there and took it with him
he had nearly left the area covered by pews and was close to first time  he heard the voice of the priest
a powerful and experienced voice
it pierced through the reaches of the cathedral ready waiting for it  but the priest was not calling 250 the trial out to the congregation  his cry was quite unambiguous and there was no escape from it  he called  josef k    k
stood still and looked down at the floor
in theory he was still free  he could have carried on walking  through one of three dark little wooden doors not far in front of him and away from there
it would simply mean he had not understood  or that he had understood but chose not to pay attention to it
but if he once turned round he would be trapped  then he would have acknowledged that he had understood perfectly well  that he really was the josef k
the priest had called to and that he was willing to follow
if the priest had called out again k
would certainly have carried on out the door  but everything was silent as k
also waited  he turned his head slightly as he wanted to see what the priest was doing now
he was merely standing in the pulpit as before  but it was obvious that he had seen k
turn his head
if k
did not now turn round completely it would have been like a child playing hide and seek
he did so  and the priest beckoned him with his finger
as everything could now be done openly he ran because of curiosity and the wish to get it over with with long flying leaps towards the pulpit
at the front pews he stopped  but to the priest he still seemed too far away  he reached out his hand and pointed sharply down with his finger to a place immediately in front of the pulpit
and k
did as he was told  standing in that place he had to bend his head a long way back just to see the priest
 you are josef k    said the priest  and raised his hand from the balustrade to make a gesture whose meaning was unclear
 yes   said k   he considered how freely he had free ebooks at planet ebook com 251 always given his name in the past  for some time now it had been a burden to him  now there were people who knew his name whom he had never seen before  it had been so nice first to introduce yourself and only then for people to know who you were
 you have been accused   said the priest  especially gently
 yes   said k    so i have been informed    then you are the one i am looking for   said the priest
 i am the prison chaplain    i see   said k
 i had you summoned here   said the priest   because i wanted to speak to you    i knew nothing of that   said k
 i came here to show the cathedral to a gentleman from italy    that is beside the point   said the priest
 what are you holding in your hand  is it a prayer book    no   answered k    it s an album of the city s tourist sights    put it down   said the priest
k
threw it away with such force that it flapped open and rolled across the floor  tearing its pages
 do you know your case is going badly   asked the priest
 that s how it seems to me too   said k  i ve expended a lot of effort on it  but so far with no result
although i do still have some documents to submit    how do you imagine it will end   asked the priest
 at first i thought it was bound to end well   said k    but now i have my doubts about it
i don t know how it will end
do you know    i don t   said the priest   but i fear it will end badly
you are considered guilty
your case will probably not even go beyond a minor court
provisionally at least  your guilt is seen as proven    but i m not guilty   said k    there s been a mistake
how is it even possible for someone to be guilty
we re all human beings here  one like the other    that is true   said the priest   but that is how 252 the trial the guilty speak    do you presume i m guilty too   asked k
 i make no presumptions about you   said the priest
 i thank you for that   said k
 but everyone else involved in these proceedings has something against me and presumes i m guilty
they even influence those who aren t involved
suddenly  proceedings continue until a verdict is reached gradually    i see   said k   lowering his head
 what do you intend to do about your case next   asked the priest
 i still need to find help   said k   raising his head to see what the priest thought of this
 there are still certain possibilities i haven t yet made use of    you look for too much help from people you don t know   said the priest disapprovingly   and especially from women
can you really not see that s not the lot of power
if i could persuade some of the women i know to work together with me then i would be certain to succeed
especially in a court like this that seems to consist of nothing but woman chasers show the examining judge a woman in the distance and he ll run right over the desk  and the accused  just to get to her as soon as he can   the priest lowered his head down to the balustrade  only now did the roof over the pulpit seem to press him down
what sort of dreadful weather could it be outside  it was no longer just a dull day  it was deepest night
none of the stained glass in the main window shed even a flicker of light on the darkness of the walls
and this was the moment when the free ebooks at planet ebook com 253 man in the cassock chose to put out the candles on the main altar  one by one
 are you cross with me   asked k
 maybe you don t know what sort of court it is you serve   he received no answer
 well  it s just my own experience   said k
above him there was still silence
 i didn t mean to insult you   said k
at that  the priest screamed down at k    can you not see two steps in front of you   he shouted in anger  but it was also the scream of one who sees another fall and  shocked and without thinking  screams against his own will the two men  then  remained silent for a long time
in the darkness beneath him  the priest could not possibly have seen k
distinctly  although k
was able to see him clearly by the light of the little lamp
why did the priest not come down  he had not given a sermon  he had only told k
a few things which  if he followed them closely  would probably cause him more harm than good
but the priest certainly seemed to mean well  it might even be possible  if he would come down and cooperate with him  it might even be possible for him to obtain some acceptable piece of advice that could make all the difference  it might  for instance  be able to show him not so much to influence the proceedings but how to break free of them  how to evade them  how to live away from them
k
had to admit that this was something he had had on his mind quite a lot of late
if the priest knew of such a possibility he might  if k
asked him  let him know about it  even though he was part of the court himself and even though  when k had criticised the court  he had held 254 the trial  would you not like to come down here   asked k
 if you re not going to give a sermon come down here with me    now i can come down   said the priest  perhaps he regretted having shouted at k
as he took down the lamp from its hook he said   to start off with i had to speak to you from a distance
otherwise i m too easily influenced and forget my duty   k
waited for him at the foot of the steps
while he was still on one of the higher steps as he came down them the priest reached out his hand for k
to shake
 can you spare me a little of your time   asked k
 as much time as you need   said the priest  and passed him the little lamp for him to carry
even at close distance the priest did not lose  you are very friendly towards me   said k   as they walked up and down beside each other in the darkness of one of the side naves
 that makes you an exception among all those who belong to the court
i can trust you more than any of the others i ve seen
i can speak openly with you    don t fool yourself   said the priest
 how would i be fooling myself   asked k
 you fool yourself in the court   said the priest   it talks about this self deceit in the opening paragraphs to the law
in front of the law there is a doorkeeper
a man from the countryside comes up to the door and asks for entry
but the doorkeeper says he can t let him in to the law right now
the man thinks about this  and then he asks if he ll be able to go in later on
 that s possible   says the doorkeeper   but not now 
the gateway to the law is open as it always is  and the doorkeeper has stepped to one side  so the man free ebooks at planet ebook com 255 bends over to try and see in
when the doorkeeper notices this he laughs and says   if you re tempted give it a try  try and go in even though i say you can t
careful though  i m powerful
and i m only the lowliest of all the doormen
but there s a doorkeeper for each of the rooms and each of them is more powerful than the last it s more than i can stand just to look at the third one   the man from the country had not expected difficulties like this  the law was supposed to be accessible for anyone at any time  he thinks  but now he looks more closely at the doorkeeper in his fur coat  sees his big hooked nose  his long thin tartar beard  and he decides of the gate
he sits there for days and years
he tries to be allowed in time and again and tires the doorkeeper with his requests
the doorkeeper often questions him  asking about where he s from and many other things  but these are disinterested questions such as great men ask  and he always ends up by telling him he still can t let him in
the man had come well equipped for his journey  and uses everything  however valuable  to bribe the doorkeeper
he accepts everything  but as he does so he says   i ll only accept this so that you don t think there s anything you ve failed to do 
over many years  the man watches the doorkeeper almost without a break
he forgets about the other doormen  and begins to think this one is the only thing stopping him from gaining access to the law
over the first few years he curses his unhappy condition out loud  but later  as he becomes old  he just grumbles to himself he becomes senile  and as 256 the trial he has come to know even the fleas in the doorkeeper s fur collar over the years that he has been studying him he even asks them to help him and change the doorkeeper s mind
finally his eyes grow dim  and he no longer knows whether it s really getting darker or just his eyes that are deceiving him
but he seems now to see an inextinguishable light begin to shine from the darkness behind the door he doesn t have long to live now
just before he dies  he brings together all his experience from all this time into one question which he has still never put to the doorkeeper
he beckons to him  as he s no longer able to raise his stiff body
the doorkeeper has to bend over deeply as the difference in their sizes has changed very much to the disadvantage of the man
 what is it you want to know now   asks the doorkeeper   you re insatiable    everyone wants access to the law   says the man   how come  over all these years  noone but me has asked to be let in   the doorkeeper can see the man s come to his end  his hearing has faded  and so  so that he can be heard  he shouts to him   nobody else could have got in this way  as this entrance was meant only for you
now i ll go and close it     so the doorkeeper cheated the man   said k
immediately  who had been captivated by the story
 don t be too quick   said the priest   don t take somebody else s opinion written
there s nothing in there about cheating    but it s quite clear   said k    and your first interpretation of it was quite correct
the doorkeeper gave him the information that would release him only when it could be of no more free ebooks at planet ebook com 257 use    he didn t ask him before that   said the priest   and don t forget he was only a doorkeeper  and as doorkeeper he did his duty    what makes you think he did his duty   asked k    he didn t
it might have been his duty to keep everyone else away  but this man is who the door was intended for and he ought to have let him in    you re not paying enough attention to what was written and you re changing the story   said the priest
 according to the story  there are two important things that the doorkeeper explains about access to the law  one at the beginning  one at the end
at one place he says he can t allow him in now  and at the other he says this entrance was intended for him alone
if one of the statements contradicted the other you would be right and the doorkeeper would have cheated the man from the country
but there is no contradiction
on the contrary  the first statement even hints at the second
you could almost say the doorkeeper went beyond his duty in that he offered the man some prospect of being admitted in the future
throughout the story  his duty seems to have been merely to turn the man away  and there are many commentators who are surprised that the doorkeeper offered this hint at all  as position he stays at his post for many years and doesn t close the gate until the very end  he s very conscious of the importance of his service  as he says   i m powerful   he has respect for his superiors  as he says   i m only the lowliest of the doormen   he s not talkative  as through all these years the only questions he asks are  disinterested   he s not corruptible  as when he s offered a gift he says   i ll only accept 258 the trial this so that you don t think there s anything you ve failed to do   as far as fulfilling his duty goes he can be neither ruffled nor begged  as it says about the man that   he tires the doorkeeper with his requests   even his external appearance long  thin  black tartar beard
how could any doorkeeper useful for those who seek entry to the law  and when he hinted at some possibility in the future it always seemed to make it clear that he might even go beyond his duty
there s no denying he s a little simple minded  and that makes him a little conceited
even if all he said about his power and the power of the other doorkeepers and how not even he could bear the sight of them i say even if all these assertions are right  the way he makes them shows that he s too simple and arrogant to understand properly
the commentators say about this that   correct understanding of a matter and a misunderstanding of the same matter are not mutually exclusive 
whether they re right or not  you have to concede that his simplicity and arrogance  however little they show  do weaken his function of guarding the entrance  they are send him away but gives him  as it says in the text  a stool to sit on and lets him stay by the side of the door
the patience free ebooks at planet ebook com 259 with which he puts up with the man s requests through all these years  the little questioning sessions  accepting the gifts  his politeness when he puts up with the man cursing his fate even though it was the doorkeeper who caused that fate all these things seem to want to arouse our sympathy
not every doorkeeper would have behaved in the same way
and finally  he lets the man beckon him and he bends deep down to him so that he can put his last question
there s no more than some slight impatience the doorkeeper knows everything s come to its end shown in the words   you re insatiable 
there are many commentators who go even further in explaining it in this way and think the words   you re insatiable  are an expression of friendly admiration  albeit with some condescension
however you look at it the figure of the doorkeeper comes out differently from how you might think    you know the story better than i do and you ve known it for longer   said k
they were silent for a while
and then k
said   so you think the man was not cheated  do you    don t get me wrong   said the priest   i m just pointing out the different opinions about it
you shouldn t pay too much attention to people s opinions
the text cannot be altered  and the various opinions are often no more than an expression of despair over it
there s even one opinion which says it s the doorkeeper who s been cheated    that does seem to take things too far   said k
 how can they argue the doorkeeper has been cheated    their argument   answered the priest   is based on the simplicity of the doorkeeper
they say the doorkeeper doesn t know the inside of the law  only the way into it where he just walks up 260 the trial and down
they see his ideas of what s inside the law as rather childish  and suppose he s afraid himself of what he wants to make the man frightened of yes  he s more afraid of it than the man  as the man wants nothing but to go inside the law  even after he s heard about the terrible doormen there  in contrast to the doorkeeper who doesn t want to go in  or at least we don t hear anything about it
on the other hand  there are those who say he must have already been inside the law as he has been taken on into its service and that could only have been done inside
that can be countered by supposing he could have been given the job of doorkeeper by somebody calling out from inside  and that he can t have gone very far inside as he couldn t bear the sight of the third doorkeeper
nor  through all those years  does the story say the doorkeeper told the man anything about the inside  other than his comment about the other doorkeepers
he could have been forbidden to do so  but he hasn t said anything about that either
all this seems to show he doesn t know anything about what the inside looks like or what it means  and that that s why he s being deceived but he s also being deceived by the man from the country as he s this man s subordinate and doesn t know it
there s a lot to indicate that he treats the man as his subordinate  i expect you remember  but those who hold this view would say it s very clear that he really is his subordinate
above all  the free man is superior to the man who has to serve another
now  the man really is free  he can go wherever he wants  the only thing forbidden to him is entry into the law and  what s more  there s only one man forbidding him to do so the free ebooks at planet ebook com 261 doorkeeper
if he takes the stool and sits down beside the door and stays there all his life he does this of his own free will  there s nothing in the story to say he was forced to do it
on the other hand  the doorkeeper is kept to his post by his employment  he s not allowed to go away from it and it seems he s not allowed to go inside either  not even if he wanted to also  although he s in the service of the law he s only there for this one entrance  therefore he s there only in the service of this one man who the door s intended for
this is another way in which he s his subordinate
we can take it that he s been performing this somewhat empty service for many years  through the whole of a man s life  as it says that a man will come  that means someone old enough to be a man
that means the doorkeeper will have to wait a long time before his function is fulfilled  he will have to wait for as long as the man liked  who came to the door of his own free will
even the end of the doorkeeper s service is determined by when the man s life ends  so the doorkeeper remains his subordinate right to the end
and it s pointed out repeatedly that the doorkeeper seems to know nothing of any of this  although this is not seen as anything remarkable  as those who hold this view see the doorkeeper as deluded in a way that s far worse  a way that s to do with his service at the end  speaking about the entrance he says   now i ll go and close it   although at the beginning of the story it says the door to the law is open as it always is  but if it s always open always that means it s open independently of the lifespan of the man it s intended for  and not even the doorkeeper will be able to close it
there are various opin  262 the trial ions about this  some say the doorkeeper was only answering a question or showing his devotion to duty or  just when the man was in his last moments  the doorkeeper wanted to cause him regret and sorrow
there are many who agree that he wouldn t be able to close the door
they even believe  at the end at least  the doorkeeper is aware  deep down  that he s the man s subordinate  as the man sees the light that shines out of the entry to the law whereas the doorkeeper would probably have his back to it and says nothing at all to show there s been any change    that is well substantiated   said k   who had been repeating some parts of the priest s explanation to himself in a whisper  it is well substantiated  and now i too think the doorkeeper must have been deceived
although that does not mean i ve abandoned what i thought earlier as the two versions are  to some extent  not incompatible
it s not clear whether the doorkeeper sees clearly or is deceived
i said the man had been cheated
if the doorkeeper understands clearly  then there could be some doubt about it  but if the doorkeeper has been deceived then the man is bound to believe the same thing
that would mean the doorkeeper is not a cheat but so simple minded that he ought to be dismissed from his job immediately  if the doorkeeper is mistaken it will do him no harm but the man will be harmed immensely    there you ve found another opinion   said the priest   as there are many who say the story doesn t give anyone the right to judge the doorkeeper
however he might seem to us he is still in the service of the law  so he belongs to the law  so he s beyond what man has a right to judge
in this case we can t free ebooks at planet ebook com 263 believe the doorkeeper is the man s subordinate
even if he has to stay at the entrance into the law his service makes him incomparably more than if he lived freely in the world
the man has come to the law for the first time and the doorkeeper is already there
he s been given his position by the law  to doubt his worth would be to doubt the law    i can t say i m in complete agreement with this view   said k
shaking his head   as if you accept it you ll have to accept that everything said by the doorkeeper is true
but you ve already explained very fully that that s not possible    no   said the priest   you don t need to accept everything as true  you only have to accept it as necessary    depressing view   said k
 the lie made into the rule of the world   k
said that as if it were his final word but it was not his conclusion
he was too tired to think about all the ramifications of the story  and the sort of thoughts they led him into were not familiar to him  unrealistic things  things better suited for officials of the court to discuss than for him
the simple story had lost its shape  he wanted to shake it off  and the priest who now felt quite compassionate allowed this and accepted k  s remarks without comment  even though his view was certainly very different from k  s
in silence  they carried on walking for some time  k
stayed close beside the priest without knowing where he was
the lamp in his hand had long since gone out
once  just in front of him  he thought he could see the statue of a saint by the glitter of the silver on it  although it quickly disappeared back into the darkness
so that he would not remain entirely dependent on the priest  k
asked him   we re now near 264 the trial the main entrance  are we    no   said the priest   we re a long way from it
do you already want to go   k
had not thought of going until then  but he immediately said   yes  certainly  i have to go
i m the chief clerk in a bank and there the priest offering him his hand   go then    but i can t find my way round in this darkness by myself   said k
 go to your left as far as the wall   said the priest   then continue alongside the wall without leaving it and you ll find a way out   the priest had only gone a few paces from him  but k
was already shouting loudly   please  wait    i m waiting   said the priest
 is there anything else you want from me   asked k
 no   said the priest
 you were so friendly to me earlier on   said k    and you explained everything  but now you abandon me as if i were nothing to you    you have to go   said the priest
 well  yes   said k    you need to understand that    first  you need to understand who i am   said the priest
 you re the prison chaplain   said k   and went closer to the priest  it was not so important for him to go straight back to the bank as he had made out  he could very well stay where he was
 so that means i belong to the court   said the priest
 so why would i want anything from you  the court doesn t want anything from you
it accepts you when you come and it lets you go when you leave   free ebooks at planet ebook com 265 end the evening before k  s thirty first birthday it was about nine o clock in the evening  the time when the streets were quiet two men came to where he lived
in frock coats  pale and fat  wearing top hats that looked like they could not be taken off their heads
after some brief formalities at the door of the flat when they first arrived  the same formalities were repeated at greater length at k  s door
he had not been notified they would be coming  but k
sat in a chair near the door  dressed in black as they were  and slowly put on new gloves which stretched tightly over his fingers and behaved as if he were expecting visitors he immediately stood up and looked at the gentlemen inquisitively
 you ve come for me then  have you   he asked
the gentlemen nodded  one of them indicated the other with the top hand now in his hand
k
told them he had been expecting a different visitor
he went to the window and looked once more down at the dark street
most of the windows on the other side of the street were also dark already  many of them had the curtains closed
in one of the windows on the same floor where there was a light on  two small children could be seen playing with each other inside a playpen  unable to move from where they were  reaching out for each other with their lit  266 the trial they ve sent for me   said k
to himself  and looked round once again to confirm this to himself  they want to sort me out as cheaply as they can   k
suddenly turned round to face the two men and asked   what theatre do you play in    theatre   asked one of the gentlemen  turning to the other for assistance and pulling in the corners of his mouth
the other made a gesture like someone who was dumb  as if he were struggling with some organism causing him trouble
 you re not properly prepared to answer questions   said k
and went to fetch his hat as soon as they were on the stairs the gentlemen wanted to take k  s arms  but k said  wait till we re in the street  i m not ill   but they waited only until the front door before they took his arms in a way that k had never experienced before
they kept their shoulders close behind his  did not turn their arms in but twisted them around the entire length of k  s arms and took hold of his hands with a grasp that was formal  experienced and could not be resisted k
was held stiff and upright between them  they formed now a single unit so that if any one of them had been knocked down all of them must have fallen
they formed a unit of the sort that normally can be formed only by matter that is lifeless
whenever they passed under a lamp k
tried to see his companions more clearly  as far as was possible when they were pressed so close together  as in the dim light of his room this had been hardly possible
 maybe they re tenors   he thought as he saw their big double chins
the cleanliness of their faces disgusted him
he could see the hands that free ebooks at planet ebook com 267 cleaned them  passing over the corners of their eyes  rubbing at their upper lips  scratching out the creases on those chins
when k
noticed that  he stopped  which meant the others had to stop too  they were at the edge of an open square  devoid of people but decorated with flower beds
 why did they send you  of all people   he cried out  more a shout than a question
the two gentleman clearly knew no answer to give  they waited  their free arms hanging down  like nurses when the patient needs to rest  i will go no further   said k
as if to see what would happen
the gentlemen did not need to make any answer  it was enough that they did not loosen their grip on k
and tried to move him on  but k
resisted them
 i ll soon have no need of much strength  i ll use all of it now   he thought
he thought of the flies that tear their legs off struggling to get free of the flypaper
 these gentleman will have some hard work to do 
just then  miss burstner came up into the square in front of them from the steps leading from a small street at a lower level
it was not certain that it was her  although the similarity was  of course  great
but it did not matter to k
whether it was certainly her anyway  he just became suddenly aware that there was no point in his resistance
there would be nothing heroic about it if he resisted  if he now caused trouble for these gentlemen  if in defending himself he sought to enjoy his last glimmer of life he started walking  which pleased the gentlemen and some of their pleasure conveyed itself to him
now they permitted him to decided which direction they took  and he decided to take the direction that 268 the trial followed the young woman in front of them  not so much because he wanted to catch up with her  nor even because he wanted to keep her in sight for as long as possible  but only so that he would not forget the reproach she represented for him
 the only thing i can do now   he said to himself  and his thought was confirmed by the equal length of his own steps with the steps of the two others   the only thing i can do now is keep my common sense and do what s needed right till the end i always wanted to go at the world and try and do too much  and even to do it for something that was not too cheap
that was wrong of me
should i now show them i learned nothing from facing trial for a year  should i go out like someone stupid  should i let anyone say  after i m gone  that at the start of the proceedings i wanted to end them  and that now that they ve ended i want to start them again  i don t want anyone to say that
i m grateful they sent these unspeaking  uncomprehending men to go with me on this journey  and that it s been left up to me to say what s necessary 
meanwhile  the young woman had turned off into a side street  but k
could do without her now and let his companions lead him
all three of them now  in complete agreement  went over a bridge in the light of the moon  the two gentlemen were willing to yield to each little movement made by k
as he moved slightly towards the edge and directed the group in that direction as a single unit
the moonlight glittered and quivered in the water  which divided itself around a small island covered in a densely piled mass of foliage and trees and bushes
beneath them  now invisible  there free ebooks at planet ebook com 269 were gravel paths with comfortable benches where k
had by their compliance with his wishes
behind k  s back one of them seemed to quietly criticise the other for the misunderstanding about stopping  and then they went on
the went on up through several streets where policemen were walking or standing here and there  some in the distance and then some very close
one of them with a bushy moustache  his hand on the grip of his sword  seemed to have some purpose in approaching the group  which was hardly unsuspicious
the two gentlemen stopped  the policeman seemed about to open his mouth  and then k
drove his group forcefully forward
several times he looked back cautiously to see if the policeman was following  but when they had a corner between themselves and the policeman k began to run  and the two gentlemen  despite being seriously short of breath  had to run with him
in this way they quickly left the built up area and found themselves in the fields which  in this part of town  began almost without any transition zone there was a quarry  empty and abandoned  near a building which was still like those in the city
here the men stopped  perhaps because this had always been their destination or perhaps because they were too exhausted to run any further
here they released their hold on k   who just waited in silence  and took their top hats off while they looked round the quarry and wiped the sweat off their brows with their handkerchiefs
the moonlight lay everywhere with the natural peace that 270 the trial is granted to no other light
after exchanging a few courtesies about who was to carry out the next tasks the gentlemen did not seem to have been allocated specific functions one of them went to k
and took his coat  his waistcoat  and finally his shirt off him
k
made an involuntary shiver  at which the gentleman gave him a gentle  reassuring tap on the back
then he carefully folded the things up as if they would still be needed  even if not in the near future
he did not want to expose k
to the chilly night air without moving though  so he took him under the arm and walked up and down with him a little way while the other gentleman looked round the quarry for a suitable place
when he had found it he made a sign and the other gentleman escorted him there
it was near the rockface  there was a stone lying there that had broken loose
the gentlemen sat k
down on the ground  leant him against the stone and settled his head down on the top of it
despite all the effort they went to  and despite all the co operation shown by k   his demeanour seemed very forced and hard to believe
so one of the gentlemen asked the other to grant him a short time while he put k
in position by himself  but even that did nothing to make it better in the end they left k
in a position that was far from the best of the ones they had tried so far
then one of the gentlemen opened his frock coat and from a sheath hanging on a belt stretched across his waistcoat he withdrew a long  thin  double edged butcher s knife which he held up in the light to test its sharpness the repulsive courtesies began once again  one of them passed the knife over k
to the other  who then passed it back over free ebooks at planet ebook com 271 k
to the first
k
now knew it would be his duty to take the knife as it passed from hand to hand above him and thrust it into himself but he did not do it  instead he twisted his neck  which was still free  and looked around
he was not able to show his full worth  was not able to take all the work from the official bodies  he lacked the rest of the strength he needed and this final shortcoming was the fault of whoever had denied it to him
as he looked round  he saw the top floor of the building next to the quarry
he saw how a light flickered on and the two halves of a window opened out  somebody  made weak and thin by the height and the distance  leant suddenly far out from it and stretched his arms out even further who was that  a friend  a good person  somebody who was taking part  somebody who wanted to help  was he alone  was it everyone  would anyone help  were there objections that had been forgotten  there must have been some the logic cannot be refuted  but someone who wants to live will not resist it
where was the judge he d never seen  where was the high court he had never reached  he raised both hands and spread out all his fingers
but the hands of one of the gentleman were laid on k  s throat  while the other pushed the knife deep into his heart and twisted it there  twice
as his eyesight failed  k
saw the two gentlemen cheek by cheek  close in front of his face  watching the result
 like a dog   he said  it was as if the shame of it should outlive him
