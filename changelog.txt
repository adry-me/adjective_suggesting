SmartGit 20.1.4 (2020-07-29)
============================
Fixed Bugs
----------
- Changes: is not cleaned up correctly if file is selected and repository is removed outside SmartGit
- Compare, Conflict Solver:
    - internal error applying last (non-empty) line to other side
- Conflict Solver:
    - "compare.applyGitFilters" was not honored
- Distributed Reviews:
    - Integrate Pull Request: squashing fails with Git error "You cannot combine --squash with --commit"
- Files, Copy commands: internal error if invoked in bare repository
- Format Patch default external tool: was only available for head commit (regression)
- GitHub Enterprise/GitLab: client certificates without password couldn't be used
- Log
    - Graph: Checkout offered to track even remote head branch, e.g. origin/HEAD
    - Refresh: after opening repository, background tasks (like continuing SVN clone) were not scheduled
- Refresh: "File system loop encountered" as part of the node cache refreshing
- Settings: bugtracker-settings.xml was not read on first start
- SVN:
    - possible problems when trying to resume a clone
- Table control: with table.scrollToSelection=false setting a selection did not unselect previously selected files
- Working Tree window: title was not showing open repository under certain conditions


SmartGit 20.1.3 (2020-06-23)
============================
New Features, Improvements
--------------------------
- File Log, Blame, Investigate: rename detection for searching the file origin was limited to commits with up to 500 additions/removals
- Search for Repositories: added low-level property repositorySearch.autoSearchInDialog to disable the automatic search (useful for slow machines with hard drives)

Fixed Bugs
----------
- could not be started with + sign in the path
- BitBucket/others: Create Pull Request dialog contained duplicate target entries
- Distributes Reviews:
    - Branches view: "Show Closed Pull Requests" had no effect
- External Tools: even if 2 refs are required, the tool could be invoked on a single ref
- Find Object, open repository: did not always select open repository
- File compare: stderr/stdout redirection for external tools did not work
- GitHub:
    - possible "404 not found" error for subsequent refresh after adding a comment
    - Log: possible out-of-memory error while refreshing comments
- Log:
    - Files:
        - for file log, the filter pattern from the repository root log was initialized
    - Graph:
        - when filtered, checking out a commit may erroneously check out mapped local/remote branch, e.g. different commit
        - Linux: right-clicking set focus too late and hence showed an outdated context menu
- Refresh:
    - possible endless loop in file system benchmarking code
    - Working Tree window: opening broken repository (without admin dir) broke subsequent refreshing and file monitoring until repository was closed and reopened
- macOS:
    - table controls: right-clicking the table header to show the column menu did not work if scrolled
- Windows:
    - cloning to path with lower-case drive letter caused core.worktree to be set resulting in a notification of SmartGit - workaround for a Git bug


SmartGit 20.1.2 (2020-05-07)
============================
New Features, Improvements
--------------------------
- Commit template: set caret at the end of the first (valid) line (instead of the beginning)
- Log, Graph view: set low-level property "log.graph.showMergeCommitsGray" to false to not avoid gray merge commits

    - Graph view: signed commit symbol was not supported by macOS system font
    - window could be closed while a command was running
    - pressing Ctrl+Shift+3 if all files are staged, did not focus the right table in the Files view
- Preferences, Colors tab: no editor colors were shown on macOS
- Refresh:
    - internal error if core.excludesfile points to invalid path
    - internal error if HEAD points to non-local branch
    - possible internal error related to core.ignoreCase=true on case-sensitive file system (e.g. Linux)

Fixed Bugs
----------
- Files view, Index table: states were incorrectly named in Working Tree and Log window

    - after commands:
        - inefficient refreshing after performing an operation on a submodule
        - broken for submodules located on symlinks
- Log, Graph: with "Follow Only First Parent" option, stash may not be aligned with its base commit but show up at the top of the graph
- Tree control (macOS): depending on configured selection color white foreground on white background color https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=558258
- Conflict Solver: for unselected "Swap ours and theirs" option, left title should be "Rebase target ("ours")"
- Changes view: unified scrollbar not always updates correctly when selecting a new file
- .gitconfig: JGit-related lines like 'filesystem "Oracle Corporation|11.0.3-Syntevo|-2078966431"' were added to ~/.gitconfig, now to ~/.jgitconfig

Other Noteworthy Changes
------------------------
- Pull (toolbar) operates on the opened repository ignoring the Branches selection:
    - added low-level property pull.honorRemoteSelection to enable honoring of remote selection in Branches view

        - added hamburger option "Show Graph While Filtering" (replacing low-level property log.graph.graphicalFiltering)
        - bare repositories: ref-manimulating operations (delete, update ref) are now possible
        - ref display: made border color themeable (less bright in dark theme)
    - Files: right-clicking a file in a non-head commit only shows now external tools that operate on that commit
    - Commit Details view: right-clicking the commit's ID offers to copy full ID
    - Commit view, Message: support for comment lines (according to core.commentChar if commit.template is configured)
- Find Object (Ctrl+P):
    - opening an already open repository simply selects it, keeping the other open repositories open, too

    - stop operations if fetching of remote branches has actually fetched new commits
    - Integrate: improved wording for features with custom base branch
- Submodule, Add: offers "relative URL" for local repositories, too

        - resetting filter might not reveal selected commit with "Follow Only First Parent" option selected
    - Files:
        - possible error "missing blob" realted to rename detection in combination with added/remvoed submodules (regression since 19.1)
        - possible foreground change on mouse-over
- logger.properties: ignored configured handlers

====================================
New Features, Improvements
--------------------------
- i18n: Edit | Customize shows menu item names now i18nized

Fixed Bugs
----------
- Commit/Stage: fails for modified submodules (regression in 20.1 preview 8)
- External tools, e.g. Open Git Shell: leaked handles (NamedPipe)
- SVN:
    - Clone (Windows): symlink support was not properly detected (SmartGit always assumed that file system did not support symlinks)
- process shutdown: temp directory was not cleaned up correctly, because it failed to remove read-only files which were created when opening a file compare (internal or external)
- interactive rebase: might have failed with "unsupported noop line" error

Other Noteworthy Changes
------------------------
- preview version: more often checks for new builds
- GUI:

- Working Tree window:
    - Branches: if pull requests are available a link to open the Log is shown
- GUI:

    - Log, Window | Show Working Tree Window selects current repository

Fixed Bugs
----------

    - Graph:
        - possible performance problem or OOME after resetting filter with selected old commit
        - performance problem for old commits with many "On Branches"
- Changes, Compare and others:
    - fixed expensive whitespace drawing (especially for very long lines)
- File Compare:
    - could not save non-US-ASCII characters if file did not contain some originally
    - if saving failed, a partly written file remained
- GUI:
    - macOS: internal error closing a tree node with children
    - automatic window placement algorithm failed for windows with larger sizes than the visible area (on Windows 10 the sizes are reported a little bit larger than one would expect it)
    - Low-level property editor for int: the value was reset silently if value was out of allowed bounds
- File monitoring (Windows):
    - fix for repositories located on symlink

Other Noteworthy Changes
------------------------
- Windows bundles: updated to Git 2.25
- helper processes (SSH, credentials) should consume less memory now

- Blame:
    - reworked code, built upon DeepGit
    - performance improved
- Log:
    - changed default for "log.wt.refreshOpenButUnselectedModels" to "true"
    - Graph: moved View | Include Tracked Remote Branches into hamburger menu
- Journal: for merge commits, keep showing stubs instead of + signs because they can't be expanded
- Gravatar: caches images locally in <settings-dir>/gravatar-cache

Fixed Bugs
----------
- Ignore Directory:
    - internal error invoking on root directory
    => is now only possible to invoke on untracked directories
- Log:
    - Branches: quickly clicking the same checkbox should just toggle the checkbox, but not invoke the double-click command
    - Files: possible internal error trying to compare 2 files against each other from Index vs. Commit diff
    - possible interface inconsistencies between Repositories and Graph view when opening multiple repositories at once (regression since 19.1)
- Refresh:

SmartGit 20.1 Preview 5 (2019-12-12)
====================================
New Features, Improvements
--------------------------
- Log:
    - Graph:
        - collapsed merge commits and collapsed squash commits now show a tiny + sign to indicate the expandability
        - for 2 selected commits on different branches, the selection order is remembered, so the Files and Changes view show the diff in the requested order
    - Files:

SmartGit 19.2 Preview 4 (2019-11-19)
====================================
New Features, Improvements
--------------------------
- Commit view: warn if trying to commit while no branch is checked out
- Copy ID:
    - by default, copy short ID (to get long, set copyID.copyFull to true)

- Discard: don't offer abort-rebase confirmation if a non-root directory has been selected
- Edit Commit Message: support for file completion of the commit's files
- Log:
    - Commit (Details): ability to change the line separator used for separating different values (log.details.headerValueSeparator)
    - Graph:
        - Follow Only First Parent works now on Git data instead of already layouted graph, resolving various problems
    - Files:
        if no or more than 2 graph lines are selected, an informational text is shown
    - Select Parent/Child: works also if focus is outside the Graph view

Fixed Bugs
----------
- Changes:
    - color may sometimes switch between modified and added
    - Compact display: unexpected "skipped" lines in added blocks
- Compare:
    - forgot some options when using "Remember as Default"
- Log:
    - Changes: still showed changes while no file was selected
    - Commit:
        - comments used wrong background color with dark theme
        - quickly clicking Commit button created 2 commits, the second without changes
    - Files: selection unexpectedly growed after certain operations
    - Graph:
        - Filter:
            - flicking while typing
            - possible inefficient processing for certain graph-filter-combinations
        - possible redundant WT refresh

====================================
New Features, Improvements
--------------------------
- Branches:
    - Copy Message: for tag messages and stash comments
- Gerrit:
    - detection will consider review.remote configuration
    - denote target remote in dialog
- Files:
    - Filter input field:
        - Regular Expression also searches inside a string unless ^ or $ are used
        - Regular Expression matches against full path (instead of name) only if a slash was found in the search pattern (like for non-regex search, too)
- Log:
    - Creating and checking out a new branch from a remote branch (in the Branches view) also scrolls to the new branch in the Graph
- Rebase:
    - for conflicts the (conflicting) message is now not loaded into the Commit view any more (caused only confusion, because the rebase command should proceeded with Continue, not Commit)
- Split Working Tree and Index tables:
    - can be tuned with low-level properties files.split.vertical and files.split.workingTreeBeforeIndex
- macOS 10.14: switching the SmartGit theme set the required org.eclipse.swt.useSystemTheme property automatically

Fixed Bugs
----------
- Log:
    - Changes: a single staged file did not show changes
    - Graph:
        - on macOS and Linux the context menu commands operated on previous selection
    - Refresh:
        - possible internal error if the repository contained multiple shallow commits
        - problems were not reported, just logged
- Compare, Index Editor and others: some commands might been enabled (and consequently triggered) even if not applicable causing internal errors
- Compare with Each Other: used wrong, configured Diff tool (for different file types)
- Investigate: toggling Line History caused broken layout
- Cherry-pick/Revert, Abort: uses "git cherry-pick --abort"/"git revert --abort" now instead of "git reset --hard"
  (it might be necessary to first discard all local changes, because the --abort commands can't cope with them - but it should be more safe now)
- Split Working Tree and Index tables:
    - fixed several bugs, improved selection/focus handling
- Upgrade: some files in the "updater" directory might remain after an upgrade

Other Noteworthy Changes
------------------------
- In-place Application Update: more reliable way to detect whether application is closed
- Save Stash uses always "git stash push" instead of the deprecated "git stash save"
- Windows: uses native launcher to open files in registered application (instead of rundll32.exe or cmd.exe which cause different problems)
- upgraded SWT library to v4930r5
    - fixing tree-related massive flickering on Linux


SmartGit 19.2 Preview 2 (2019-10-11)
====================================
New Features, Improvements
--------------------------
- Log window:
    - Graph view:
        - display Working Tree/Index node directly at HEAD commit (use low-level property log.graph.showWtNodesTopmost to get old behavior)
        - display single instead of separate nodes for Working Tree and Index changes
    - Files view:
        - optionally show Index and Working Tree files in 2 tables
        - removed option Show Staged Changes - these purely staged changes can now easily be found in the Index table
    - Commit (Details) view:
        - shows real parent SHAs for File/Subtree logs, not 'visual parents'
- Working Tree window:
    - Files view: replaced "View | Only Index" and "View | Only Working Tree" with option to show Index and Working Tree files in 2 tables
    - removed option Show Staged Changes - these purely staged changes can now easily be found in the Index table
- Journal/Log Graph views: show full author by default

Fixed Bugs
----------
- Compare: possible internal error (regression)
- Refresh:
    - may fail (silently) in case of non-UTF-8 encoding used in .git/config (regression)
- Ubuntu 19.04: Delete to Trash was considered as non-supported if no files were trashed before (if no ~/.local/share/Trash/files/ directory existed)

Other Noteworthy Changes
------------------------
- macOS 10.15: updating the installation directory seems not to work any more (sandboxed read-only file system), so only light-weight updates are possible automatically (like for DEB bundle on Linux)
  (maybe we'll find a better solution in the future)


SmartGit 19.2 Preview 1 (2019-09-30)
====================================
New Features, Improvements

    - Move group to another group
- Performance/memory:
    - Compare/Changes view: several performance improvements
    - reduced memory consumption for loaded repositories (several changes)
    - Refresh:
        - added low-level property core.tags.loadDetails to disable possible expensive access to object database
        - Log, Graph:
            - faster initial loading
            - faster refreshing
- Squash Commits: added low-level property squash.selectOldestDate to preselect oldest date
- Stage/Unstage: optionally stage/unstage all files recursively
- UI:
    - larger buttons:
        - Commit view: Commit
        - Graph view: Continue, Abort, ...
- Worktree: added 'git worktree remove'

Fixed Bugs
----------
- Bisect: did not show command output
